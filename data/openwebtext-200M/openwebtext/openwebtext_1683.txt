Paul Coffey was unstoppable that spring of ' 85 .
Coffey and his Edmonton Oilers were on a mission , to defend the Stanley Cup that they had won for the first time a year previous .
In fact no fewer than eight Oilers - plus all three coaches - were pursuing an unprecedented triple , having participated in the Canada Cup , then the world 's only best - on - best hockey tournament .
To puck fans of the day it was the closest thing going to the modern , professional - era Olympics .
For Paul Coffey , Wayne Gretzky , Glenn Anderson , Charlie Huddy , Kevin Lowe , Mark Messier , Randy Gregg , and Grant Fuhr , the long season had begun at Canada Cup training camp on July 15 - less than two months after clinching that first Cup - and lasted right through until May 30 , at the time a record for the latest NHL game .
The first four of those played all 98 regular season and playoff games for those ' 84 - 85 Oilers , and some 116 games in all .
Already emerging as the game 's preeminent offensive defenceman , Coffey had played a starring role in Canada Cup ' 84 .
He was the hero in the stirring overtime victory against the USSR in the semi-finals , turning the tide on one famous shift in which he broke up a 2 - on - 1 , then led the charge up the ice and ultimately fired the shot that Mike Bossy tipped home for the game winner .
Canada went on to win the final series against Sweden , wrapping things up right in Northlands Coliseum .
The sweaters were different , the Cup looked different , but many of the players celebrating looked mighty familiar to us Oiler fans sitting in our regular seats .
Back in their familar white , blue and orange , the Oilers started defence of their title in style .
They set an NHL record with a 15 - game unbeaten streak to start the season , and rolled to a record of 43 - 12 - 6 by late February .
Suddenly the team hit the doldrums , winning just 6 of their last 19 , and blowing first place overall to the red - hot Philadelphia Flyers .
As the postseason got underway , many people openly questioned whether the Oilers had shot their wad .
The playoffs got off to an uncertain start as the Oilers struggled to get their trademark offensive game going .
Their three - game sweep of the Los Angeles Kings was a tense struggle indeed with two of the games going into overtime .
The difference in the series was between the pipes , where Fuhr was named first star of all three games , and he followed with a fourth such outing in winning Game One against Winnipeg Jets .
Then Paul Coffey started to roll , scoring 2 goals and 3 assists in a transcendent performance to lead Oilers to a 5 - 2 win in Game Two .
The offensive machine roared back to life , pumping 13 goals past Jets ' goalies in Winnipeg Arena to complete the four game sweep , then a mind - boggling 44 in a six - game beatdown of Chicago Blackhawks that still stands as the NHL record for goals in a playoff series .
Jari Kurri led the way , setting still - standing records for goals ( 12 ) and hat tricks ( 3 ) in a playoff series .
Still , doubt remained as the Oilers prepared to take on Mike Keenan 's white - hot Philadelphia Flyers in the Finals .
The Flyers had won 16 of their last 17 to blow past the Oil for first overall , then rolled through three playoff series losing just 3 games .
When they thumped the Oilers 4 - 1 in Game One at the Spectrum , there was plenty of cause for concern .
Crucially , the Oil gained the split with a 3 - 1 win in Game 2 with a solid defensive effort that limited the Flyers to 18 shots after 41 in the opener .
By the rules of the day the next three games would be held out west , a formula the Oilers had followed with success in 1984 with a split in Long Island and a sweep at home .
So it would play out again in ' 85 .
The 2 - 3 - 2 format had effectively become the 2 - 3 format , so the NHL promptly changed that rule after a two - year experiment .
A very successful experiment from the perspective of Oiler fans .
The Oil took charge on their home ice .
Gretzky produced a first - period hat trick in Game Three , all assisted by Coffey , then the two of them set up Mike Krushelnyski's game winner in a 4 - 3 win .
Game Four saw the Oil erupt for four powerplay goals , the last two by Gretzky proving the difference in a 5 - 3 victory .
In the process Pelle Lindbergh , the league 's first superstar Euro goalie , had been driven from the net .
So it was that on May 30 , 25 years ago today , backup Bob Froese led the demoralized Flyers on to Coliseum ice against an Oiler squad that was determined to end the job that night .
The Oilers did n't disappoint , putting on a spectacular show in blowing out the Flyers 8 - 3 .
It was the third straight series that the Oil had put a snowman on the board in the final game , as their awesome speed and skill gradually wore down each opponent .
The final game was a display of Oiler hockey at its most potent , with a series of gorgeous goals .
6 of the 8 were scored on the rush , the other 2 off of sustained pressure .
The Oilers scored on spectacular solo rushes , on nifty three - way passing plays , on one - timers and on roof jobs .
Froese had a tough night , but nonetheless made a number of fine stops to prevent the score from rolling up into double digits under a 41 - shot barrage of mostly high - quality shots .
In the first period Gretzky made a great blind pass to set up Kurri for his 90th goal of the long season ( regular plus playoffs ) , then in the second the Finn returned the favour with a great blind pass of his own which the Great One converted for his own 90th .
In between times Coffey had scored a pair of goals , one the Stanley Cup winning goal , the other on this brilliant behind - the - back pass from Gretzky which provided the season 's defining moment .
As an Oiler fan I 'm biased -- especially given as I saw 10 of the games live ( all wins ) -- but I think it 's a very defensible case that Paul Coffey put on the greatest playoff performance of any non-Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the award 's 44 - season history .
For certain he played better than a lot of Smythe winners of other seasons .
In the merely 18 playoff games it took his Oilers to defend their Stanley Cup in 1985 , Coffey set playoff records of goals ( 12 ) , assists ( 25 ) , and of course points ( 37 ) by a D- man , breaking records of Bobby Orr and Denis Potvin IIRC .
All 3 records still stand today as the likes of Al MacInnis and Brian Leetch fired and fell back in the numbers dept even as they garnered Smythe honours themselves .
In the dead puck era , even the likes of Nicklas Lidstrom have n't come close .
Coffey was flying that whole spring .
It was n't that teams did n't try to stop him ...
I still shudder to think of Jim Kyte 's attempt to amputate Coffey 's foot at the ankle with a diving slash as the Oiler speedster was flying past Winnipeg 's resident goon .
As the playoffs wore on he accumluated various aches and pains , with some six different injuries being documented .
It seemed every game somebody would take a run at him , Coffey would go down and stay down and the arena would fall deathly silent .
But a minute or two later he would clamber to his feet , and by the next shift there he would be winding up behind his own net with his wide powerful stride , preparing to blow down his preferred right side .
Leading the rush or joining it late , he added a dimension to the Oilers ' relentless attack that proved impossible to stop .
In the process Coffey came the closest of any Oiler during Gretzky 's time here to achieve something close to equal billing as a mega - star in his own right .
Besides his Canada Cup and Stanley Cup heroics he won the Norris Trophy that season , his first of three , and was widely considered the second best player in the game .
Coffey lost the Smythe to Wayne Gretzky at the height of his powers .
Gretzky played superbly , setting his own still - extant record for points in a playoff season ( 47 ) , yet his Smythe award was by no means unanimous as there was a tremendous amount of support and sympathy for Coffey .
At the time the pundits were calling it the closest vote in history , although they 've always been secretive about Smythe voting for some reason so I do n't know if that statement is verifiable or just scuttlebutt .
It was a real tough call whether you were basing it on numbers or actual play .
Both were freakin ' brilliant , night after night .
That same spring Jari Kurri tied Reggie Leach 's record for goals in a playoff season ( 19 ) , another record that still stands , and Kurri was almost an afterthought in the Smythe discussion .
Of course they all fed off each other .
If any coattails were being ridden , they were Gretzky 's , but those other guys were superstars by any mortal measure .
Like the trio of Potvin , Trottier , and Bossy , the sum was even greater than the formidable parts .
Those formidable parts - plus Anderson , Messier , Huddy and the rest - summed out to 98 goals in just 18 games that playoff season , another ( unrecognized ! ) NHL record that stands to this day .
The Oilers were in the ascendant , with eight players who had pulled off the Stanley - Canada - Stanley Cup triple .
Five of them would repeat that feat in 1987 - 88 , while one other player , Pittsburgh 's Larry Murphy , would do the same in 1991 - 92 .
Murphy 's teammate Coffey meanwhile , would win both Cups in the same calendar year for yet a third time , the only man ever to accomplish this unlikely feat .
An odd moment that I remember clearly from that last game against the Flyers in ' 85 was a two - man advantage the Oilers got in the third period .
Keenan 's
Flyers were gooning things up a bit , so Sather decided to throw the kitchen sink at them , icing a rarely - seen powerplay unit consisting of all of the Big Five as they tried to set up Kurri for a record 20th playoff goal .
They did n't click at all ; the first thing they did on that 5 - on - 3 was give up a breakaway to Dave Poulin that resulted in a penalty shot !
After Fuhr stopped that , the Big Five fumbled around but did n't generate much ; the game was in the bag , the champagne chillin ' in the room , the longest season finally winding to a successful close .
It would be my rare privilege to see a third major Cup presentation in the same building in under thirteen months !
Ever the historian , I distinctly recall what I said to my seatmates as Gretzky , Kurri , Messier , Anderson , Coffey and Fuhr took to the ice for that rare shift together , their second Stanley Cup in the bag and clearly more to come :
" Look !
The odd numbers are all out there at once !
Not often you get to see SIX HALL OF FAMERS on the ice for one team ! "
Given the boys on the bus were all of 23 and 24 years old at the time , it was a bit of a bold statement .
But what can I say ?
The proof is in the rafters .

Charlie
Sheen will begin doing work release Tuesday as part of his 30 - day sentence ... and one of his tasks will be to coach actors for a play with the ominous title , " Same Time Next Year . "
TMZ broke the story ...
Charlie 's plea deal will include work release at Theatre Aspen , where he 'll be able to leave the jail everyday at 8 AM for work at the theater and return to jail by 8 PM .
We 're told Charlie will be coaching actors for 3 plays -- " The Wonderettes , " " Three Little Pigs , " and " Same Time Next Year . "
Charlie will also be doing meet - and - greets for Theatre Aspen fundraising .
He 'll also be working with kids who are in a theater group at the ABC Center in Aspen .
As for how today will go down -- after the 4 PM court hearing where the judge accepts Charlie 's plea , he 'll meet with people from the Pitkin County Sheriff 's Department as well as a probation officer .
He 'll probably end up at the jail at around 7 PM tonight .
As we first reported ... with good time , Charlie will serve 17 days , but two of those days ( the first and last ) will be short .
We 've also learned Charlie has completed the required 36 - hours of anger management classes .
Nevertheless , after serving his sentence he 'll still be placed on probation for a short period of time -- probably 30 days -- so the fines and other requirements are fully processed .

The context :
What ’s described below happened a few minutes ago ( about 3:25 –I ’m writing this at about 3:50 ) , as I was walking down Yonge on my way from the Queen streetcar to the Go Bus terminal at Union Station , intending to catch the 3:40 back to Markham .
I ’m wearing a forest - camo tee , new jean shorts , Blundstones and my headphones , and carrying a Penguin satchel in which I ’ve got my laptop and some books .
At King , I pass a group of eight police officers .
I ’m listening to a podcast .
Halfway down the block I realize that two of them are calling after me and jogging lightly to catch up , a man and a woman .
I stop and take off my headphones .
The female officer asks , not in an unfriendly way , where I ’m going .
I tell her Union Station to catch a bus up to Markham .
She says she thinks the station is closed ( it is n’t , but I do n’t know this for sure at the time ) . ” Really ? ” I ask .
“ You sure ?
I figured the subway would be , but I did n’t think the Go Bus terminal was . ”
She says that she is n’t sure .
She asks me if she can search my bag .
I ask her if she ’s asking .
She says she ’s asking .
I say alright , but that I ’m not thrilled about it .
I open my bag .
She asks me to take out my laptop .
I do .
Satisfied , she says I can put it back .
In addition to my laptop , I have 4 books in my bag .
She takes out the fourth book , which is called Antwerp .
It ’s a small , black hardcover , plain except for two gold strips cut like stencils to outline the letters of the words “ Antwerp ” and “ Roberto Bolaño . ”
On the back , in gold print , is the translator ’s name and a quote from Bolaño about the book .
“ Ansterd ? ” She ’s trying to read it upside down .
“ Antwerp .
It ’s a city in Belgium . ”
She reads the quote from the back out loud : “ The only novel that does n’t embarrass me is Antwerp . ”
She hands it back to me .
“ You ’ve got a lot of books in your bag . ”
Her voice is still cheerful but that statement carried an air of judgment , or it reminded me of the possibility of judgment .
“ Yep . ”
She pulls out another book — this one has a pull - quote from “ New Republic ” at the base of the cover declaring the author to be “ The most dangerous philosopher in the West . ”
Beneath a title like Living in the End Times , there ’s no doubt that that seemed ominous .
I feel culpable as I see her eyes tracking the line and her expression tick a notch towards concerned .
And then I ’m upset that I feel culpable for carrying a book on Yonge Street for reasons completely independent of the G20 .
I resolve that I ’ll refuse to justify myself if she says anything , but she does n’t comment .
Instead , she hands the book back to me and asks , “ What have you got in your pockets ? ”
“ My wallet , iPod and cell phone . ”
“ Can I see ? ”
I ’m really finding this invasive .
I say as much .
The second police officer : “ You know there are 20 presidents in the city right now , right ? ”
I ’ve started to shake a bit .
I want to tell him something like “ Ca n’t do anything about that , now , can we ? ” but I do n’t .
Instead , I say something like that I do know there are a lot of world leaders in the city , but that I ’m over a block from the security cordon and am not going to get any closer to it , that the terminal is right at the bottom of the street and that they ’ll be able to see if I go anywhere else , and finally that , considering our distance from the security area , my understanding is that they need reasonable grounds to demand to search a private citizen .
He says something vague about how there have been “ incidents . ”
I ask him if there have been more today .
I ’m actually curious about this and concerned , and I think my tone conveys it , at least judging from the reaction of the first , more friendly police officer .
She replies conversationally , saying something like “ unfortunately , yes . ”
The other guy is n’t down for small talk .
“ So , can you show us what ’s in your pockets ? ”
I ask him if he ’s asking .
Throughout the whole exchange I ’m very conscious of staying polite and keeping my voice calm .
The friendly police officer clarifies that they ’re asking , and so I say that I would prefer not to .
She asks me if , in that case , I would mind if she accompanied me to the bus .
I say that I would n’t , so we start walking .
As we ’re walking , I ask her what happened at the incidents she mentioned .
Before she has a chance to answer , her superior officer , K Hancock , badge # 5793 , catches up to us and takes her aside to berate her for leaving her post “ just like that . ”
I ask the hostile officer , who ’s run up with K Hancock , 5793 , if I can keep walking since my bus leaves at 40 minutes after the hour and that ’s only ten or so minutes from now ( I take my cellphone out of my pocket to show him ) .
The hostile police officer says no and tells me to wait .
Missing the bus means I ’ll have to wait around the station for an extra hour , and I think my frustration at the prospect comes across in my expression .
The officer says something like that he does n’t like my attitude .
I do n’t really know how to respond so I just shrug .
I was n’t a fan of his attitude either , in case that has n’t been clear .
K Hancock , badge # 5793 , comes up to me and starts to explain in a friendly but authoritative voice that there have been “ incidents ” and that he would like to search me because “ people wear clothing . ”
This was how he put it : people wear clothing .
It ’s not that his meaning was n’t obvious to everyone present , but jeesh .
Had I been 18 , I would have been all over the opportunity a statement like that presented .
I might have launched into an argument that his having to put it in such a lame way betrayed a recognition that what he was doing was problematic , or I might have just said something smarmy like “ You ’ve noticed that , have you ? ”
Alternatively , I might have just been a total puss , and submitted meekly to the search from the start .
He was probably thought he was being diplomatic .
I point out that while it ’s true that I ’m wearing a forest - camo tee , I ’m also wearing Bose headphones , which are attached to an iPod , carrying a Penguin shoulder bag , which contains a Mac laptop which I ’d shown them all earlier , and that that ’s not exactly anarchist wear .
K Hancock , badge # 5793 , agrees blandly but asks to see what ’s in my pockets anyway .
I say something like , if you ’re asking , then no .
K Hancock , badge # 5793 , says “ I ’m not asking . ”
I say something like that I do n’t think he has reasonable suspicion and remind him that we ’re a ways away from the cordon .
K Hancock , badge # 5793 , tells me that people carry knives in their pockets .
I tell him that I ’m not carrying a knife , only my wallet , iPod and cell phone .
K Hancock , badge # 5793 , asks me if I have drugs .
No. K Hancock , badge # 5793 , makes a jerking head motion towards a nearby alcove and says , “ if you want privacy , we can go in there . ”
It probably was n’t meant to be threatening , but in the moment , it was hard to keep myself from reading it that way .
An image flashed through my mind of myself in the alcove , hands on the wall being shaken down by K Hancock , badge # 5793 , and his hostile associate as passers - by avoid looking .
Yes it ’s melodramatic , but again , it ’s not everyday in Toronto that one is picked from the anonymity of the sidewalk and confronted with the kind of suspicion I was being confronted with in a climate as tense as that of this weekend .
But I ’m still not really sure why I would need privacy to empty my pockets .
I tell him again that I do n’t think he has reasonable suspicion to demand a search , and that if he does have the right to demand that I submit to a search , that he explain to me the basis for that right .
K Hancock , badge # 5793 , says that he just explained to me that he did .
It had n’t been at all clear to me that that was what he was doing .
“ Yes , ” he continued , “ I ’m demanding a search . ”
I say I ’ll submit to it if he gives me his badge number .
K Hancock , badge # 5793 , says that ’s fine ( obviously ) .
So I reach into my pockets and pull out my wallet , cell phone , and iPod .
I also discover a pen .
I take the cap off , hold it up to them , and say something a bit petulant ( in hindsight ) about how it ’s just a pen .
I think I sighed as if I was sorry to disappoint them .
If I could take anything back from the exchange it would be that , but , to their credit , they did n’t react .
The hostile police officer patted my pockets lightly , which seemed to me to be pushing the rules of engagement we ’d implicitly agreed to , though at this point I was n’t going to make a fuss .
I put my wallet cell and iPod back in my pockets , but keep the pen in hand .
I pull a piece of paper out of my bag and remind K Hancock , badge # 5793 , that he owes me his badge number .
“ 5793 . ” As I write it down , my hand is really shaking .
I ’m surprised .
I do n’t feel like I ’m as upset as the shaking suggests .
On reflection , I ’m kind of happy about it though .
I hope it dramatized to them that being submitted to quasi-arbitrary searches on the implied threat of arrest is n’t an emotionally neutral experience for anyone .
All three were watching me try to get my hand under control as I formed the numbers , the shaking making my writing even worse than it usually is , and they at this point knew I was n’t hiding anything .
“ Your name is K Hancock ? ” I ask , reading his nametag .
He says yes .
I write “ K Hancock ” above the badge number on my piece of paper .
“ Am I okay to go ? ” He says yes .
So I go .
At this point it ’s about 3:39 .
Lucky for me , the bus ended up being delayed .
I got there just a few seconds before it pulled out .
I ’m writing this from the DVP .
The question :
In light of these circumstances , did K Hancock , badge # 5793 , have the authority to demand that I submit to a search ?
Civil libertarians were fuming after hearing Friday that the Ontario cabinet gave police the power to stop and search anyone coming within five metres of the G20 fences in Toronto for a one week period .
However , the Ministry of Community Safety says all the cabinet did was update the law that governs entry to such things as court houses to include specific areas inside the G20 fences — not outside .
A ministry spokeswoman says the change was about property , not police powers , and did not include any mention of a zone five metres outside the G20 security perimeter .
When asked today if there actually was a five - metre rule given the ministry ’s clarification , Blair smiled and said , “ No , but I was trying to keep the criminals out . ”
I submitted a report to the Canadian Civil Liberties Association .
The following was reported originally in EL FINANCIERO , a financial - type news publication out of Mexico City .

Mysterious armed attacks against illegal in southern Arizona
Phoenix – Undocumented immigrants and presumed drug traffickers are being attacked by gunfire from unknown assailants in the desert areas of southern Arizona .
A series of incidents have the authorities bewildered .
The Sheriff ’s Department of Santa Cruz County , along the border with Mexico , has reported more than 50 attacks since April , 2008 , to date .
In these events , some 12 immigrants have received bullet wounds and at least three have died .
To the north , in Pinal County , another series of armed incidents have been reported , presumably between undocumenteds or narcotraffickers .
Last June 11 , two Mexicans , presumed to have been carrying drugs on their backs , were killed by gunfire in an area of Pinal County , some 80 miles from the border .
Farther south the same day , a group of five undocumenteds were ambushed by two men dressed in camouflage clothing near the community of Rio Rico , between Nogales and Tucson .
The attacks remain a mystery .
Self - led , self - structured inquiry may be the best method to train scientists at the college level and beyond , but it 's not the ideal way for all high school students to prepare for college science .
That 's according to findings of a study conducted by University of Virginia professor Robert Tai and Harvard University researcher Philip Sadler .
Their study appears in this month 's International Journal of Science Education .
Data show that " autonomy does n't seem to hurt students who are strong in math and may , in fact , have a positive influence on their attitude toward science "
Tai said .
However , " Students with a weak math background who engaged in self - structured learning practices in high school may do as much as a full letter grade poorer in college science , " he said .
Tai , associate professor of education in U.Va .'s Curry School , and Sadler , director of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ' Science Education Department , conducted the study , which used data from a national survey of more than 8,000 high school science students .
" The findings suggest that students with lower levels of high school mathematics attainment had greater success in college science when they reported more teacher - structured laboratory experiences in high school , " Tai and Sadler report in their study , " Same Science for All ?
Interactive Association of Structure in Learning Activities and Academic Attainment Background on College Science Performance in the U.S.A . "
According to Tai , many secondary science classes are turning to a self - structured method of learning with the notion that students will discover science on their own .
" Advocates should be sobered by this study 's findings , " Tai said .
" Self - structured instructional practices – sometimes referred to as self - led inquiry – have many advocates , but this study suggests that this approach does not fit all students , " Tai said .
" Giving more guidance to some science students and more freedom to others seems likely to pay off in college . "
" Student - led projects and investigations do not appear to be as productive as other approaches to teaching science in high school , " Sadler said .
" Increasing student autonomy may be motivated by the goal of providing experiences more akin to scientific research , but only the strongest students appear to get much out of such opportunities in most classrooms . "
Tai and Sadler point out in their report that it is important for a teacher to carefully decide how much guidance to provide in an inquiry - based teaching approach based on each student 's achievement .
They write : " Of primary concern is the quality of student work produced in these activities .
For many teachers who assign independent inquiry activities and rely on students to design and conduct them , the reality is that while some students may do good work , others languish . "
The judge who delivered the verdict in the Bhopal gas tragedy case took Union Carbide Corporation ( UCC ) and its Indian subsidiary UCIL to task , terming the 1984 holocaust a “ white - collar crime ” by an American corporation that “ cynically used a third world country to escape the increasingly strict safety standards imposed at home ” .
Safety procedures were minimal .
Neither the American owners nor the Indian management of UCIL seemed to regard safety measures “ as necessary ” , chief judicial magistrate Mohan P Tiwari said in the judgment pronounced last Monday convicting business tycoon Keshub Mahindra , among others , for negligent running of the pesticide plant .
Tiwari did not spare then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Arjun Singh , either , saying the administration had no plan to deal with the disaster .
“ Prompt action by local authorities could have saved many , if not most , victims .
The immediate response was marred by callous indifference , ” the 95 - page judgment , a copy of which is with ‘ DNA ’ , said .
Tiwari said Union Carbide was not a “ human being ” that could be sentenced to jail and recommended a special law on the lines of the UK health and safety at place of work legislation to ensure not only workers but those residing in the vicinity of a factory handling hazardous material get protection and rehabilitation .
Stressing the need for sustained and serious prosecution of delinquent companies , the judge said corporate bodies , such as a firm or a company , undertook a series of activities that “ affect the life , liberty and property of the citizens ” .
“ Large - scale financial irregularities are done by corporations .
The corporate vehicle now occupies such a large portion of the industrial , commercial and sociological sectors that amenability of the corporation to a criminal law is essential to have a peaceful society with stable economy ” .
UCC should have self - realised the need to exercise the “ greatest care ” when dealing with such lethal chemicals .
It was also the burden of the local government to play a supervisory and regulatory role with utmost sincerity .
However , both UCIL and government utterly failed to do so , the judge observed .
The tragedy was caused by the “ synergy of the very worst of American and Indian cultures ” , he said .
Highlighting the gravity of the tragedy caused due to the leakage of lethal MIC and other poisonous gases from the UCC plant in Bhopal , the court said those who ran inhaled the killer gas more than those who had a vehicle to ride .
Children and other people of shorter stature inhaled higher concentrations .
Many people were trampled trying to escape .
In addition to MIC , Phosgene , a gas used by German ruler Adolf Hitler to kill Nazis during World War - II , leaked from the killer plant .
“ How could this gas be handled by untrained or less trained workers , ” the court asked .
Once again proving his startling lack of concern over the main point , Pope Benedict XVI has spoken out against what he is calling ‘ deplorable ’ police actions , after authorities raided a Belgian church believed to be part of the ongoing child abuse allegations .
The church was part of a fresh wave of allegations , in which several priests are believed to have abused children , or have known about the abuse of children .
Computers and accounts were taken , phone records requested , and the church swept for evidence .
“ I want to express , dear brother in the Episcopate , as well as to all the Bishops of Belgium , my closeness and solidarity in this moment of sadness , in which , with certain surprising and regrettable methods , searches were carried out including in the Malines cathedral and in the premises where the Belgian episcopate was meeting in plenary session , ” he was quoted by the Telegraph as saying in a message that appeared in a Vatican publication .
His anger is sure to raise a few eyebrows .
So far , the investigation into decades of child abuse , and the possible cover-ups by prominent members of the Church , has been met with a significant amount of waffling , pointing fingers , and outrage by a papacy that is appearing more and more corrupt .
While the serious allegations of child rape are showing recent accounts , and the church and priests were treated in the same way that anyone would be in a raid , the Pope has called the actions “ deplorable ” and “ unexpected . "
Lucky for the Belgians the Nazi Pope has no divisions .
The monstrous old bitch is fit to be tied -- and wants revenge .
In case you 've never heard Howie 's Theory Of Religion , let me run that by you real fast before we get to the latest attempts by the Vatican to protect what their employees insist is a hard - earned perk of their jobs -- access to the innocent young bodies of their parishioners ' children .
Back even before John McCain was born , life was very hard and brutal -- even more so than in Afghanistan today in some ways ( not counting the predator drones ) .
Imagine if you had to leave the relative safety of the communal cave every day with a bunch of smelly , grunting Neanderthals and a knobby club you made from a tree and go hunt some animal you could eat -- one that could well be as eager to eat you .
Anyone with any amount of natural guile would look for a way to play hooky as fast as possible .
Problem of course was obvious .
If you did n't join the hunt for the clan 's daily bread , you could starve .
No one likes a parasite .
What to do , what to do ... And then religion was born .
Some guile guy got the idea that he could persuade a bunch of dumb Neanderthals he could hear voices from a stone or channel a message from a dead ancestor or a sacred flame .
It worked .
He did n't have to work anymore !
They went out and hunted the saber - toothed tigers and he stayed home and invented tricks to explain what happened to the hunter Smilodon ate for lunch .
Much warmer and safer in the cave -- and those nice little children he was left to take care of ...
Anyway , there has beenprogress since then .
In fact , social parasites have almost completely taken over society .
And the chief of one of the biggest , best organized and most richly adorned of the parasitic guilds makes sure that that " special perk " keeps the mostly mentally - deranged applicants coming .
So you can only imagine Ratzinger 's furor when the damned Belgians -- a country with barely more divisions than his own -- had the temerity to do what other nations , including our own of course , only give lip service to -- putting an end to the age - old relationship between religionistic parasites and defenseless young children .
The incident that so offended Ratzinger happened last week , June 24th at 10:30 AM , to be precise -- at the residence of the Archbishop of Malines - Brussels , where 9 Roman Catholic bishops were gathered for their monthly meeting .
Police and court officials barged in just as the meeting was getting started and announced they would be searching the joint because there were credible allegations made that cases of sexual abuse had taken place there .
All the princes and princesses of the Church had their mobile phones confiscated ; documents were seized , and the bishops , who have always been treated as though they were above the laws of mere mortals -- that 's convenient when you 're running a criminal operation ; it 's like Congress -- were all interrogated .
No one was tortured .
This is , after all , Belgium , not the Inquisition or the U.S.
The bishops have been shrieking about the indignity of it all -- the media having been informed in advance -- and claiming that that the tombs of Cardinals Jozef - Ernest Van Roey and Léon - Joseph Suenens , were violated .
The Church is astonished , outraged and even contemplating suing Belgium .
This weekend Ratzinger was on the attack " Unexpected " indeed -- and we 're not just talking aboutwaffles here .
Imagine if the Belgians get away with treating the high status parasites like ordinary criminals and governments no longer ignore their crimes and their coverups , and stop allowing them to have safe havens right in the middle of our cities and towns !
No telling where it could lead next .
There could even be a day far in the future when these guys have to go get real jobs like everyone else -- and deal with their psychiatric dysfunctions without victimizing ... the guileless .

The city of Annapolis , Maryland recently received a Homeland Security grant for 20 new surveillance cameras in the downtown area .
The city of Baltimore already has nearly 500 .
According to the watchdog site PhotoEnforced , the state of Maryland has at least 375 red light cameras and 80 speed cameras .
Your government is watching you , Marylanders .
But do n't think for a second that it 's going to tolerate you watching back .
On Saturday , Yvonne Nicole Shaw , 27 , was arrested by sheriff 's deputies in Lexington Park , Maryland .
According to the Southern Maryland News ,
Shaw was cuffed and booked for recording deputies who had come to an apartment complex in response to a noise complaint .
Sheriff's Cpl. Patrick
Handy 's report explained that Shaw was standing about 12 feet from him , and that Shaw " did admit to recording our encounter on her cell phone for the purpose of trying to show the police are harassing people . "
Shaw 's arrest comes amid continuing national debate over the arrest and prosecution of Anthony Graber , who was arrested in April for posting a video of a traffic stop to YouTube .
Graber was pulled over on his motorcycle by Maryland State Trooper Joseph David Ulher , who drew his gun during the stop .
Graber was wearing a camera on his helmet .
Days later , police raided the home of Graber 's parents .
Graber was arrested , booked , and jailed .
He has been charged with violating Maryland 's wiretapping statute , a felony that carries up to five years in prison .
He has also been charged with " Possession of an Interception Device , " that device being his otherwise perfectly legal video camera .
In yet another video taken at the Preakness Stakes and posted to YouTube last May , a Maryland state trooper tells a video operator recording an arrest , " Do me a favor and turn that off .
It 's illegal to record anybody 's voice or anything else in the state of Maryland . "
This seems to be the position of most of the law enforcement community in Maryland .
It also happens to be wrong .
There are constitutional arguments to be made in favor of an inherent right to record on - duty police .
Shaw was trying to document harassment , which falls under the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances .
In Graber 's case , there 's a strong due process argument .
If your rights have been violated by a police officer , it 's often your word against the cop's .
Video or audio documentation of the encounter is probably your only hope of proving your case .
There are also basic policy arguments in favor of securing such a right .
We tend to behave better when we know we 're being watched , an argument policy makers often employ when justifying the use of government surveillance cameras in public spaces .
These are all good arguments to challenge the laws in states like Illinois and Massachusetts , where courts and policymakers have made it illegal to record anyone in public without their permission .
Both states have explicitly renounced the expectation of privacy provisions present in other wiretapping laws .
The laws in both states are ridiculously sweeping , and there may soon be federal challenges to both .
But Maryland 's law is n't nearly as broad .
Like several other states , Maryland requires that you obtain consent from all parties to a conversation before you 're permitted to record it .
But like every other state except Illinois and Massachusetts , Maryland also requires that the offended party have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the recorded conversation .
So when Linda Tripp recorded her personal phone calls with Monica Lewinski , she violated state law .
Lewinski had good reason to expect her personal calls to remain private .
But state and federal courts across the country have determined that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in public spaces .
Anyone can snap your picture while you 're out in public .
And unless you 're making obvious attempts to protect your privacy , anyone can also record what you say .
Here 's how Maryland 's statute makes the distinction between public and private in the definitions portion of the text :
" Oral communication " means any conversation or words spoken to or by any person in private conversation .
David Rocah , who is handling Anthony Graber 's case for the Maryland ACLU elaborates : " To charge Graber with violating the law , you would have to conclude that a police officer on a public road , wearing a badge and a uniform , performing his official duty , pulling someone over , somehow has a right to privacy when it comes to the conversation he has with the motorist . "
According to state law enforcement officials , including Harford County State 's Attorney Joseph Casilly , who is prosecuting Graber , not only is a cop permitted to pull a gun on you for a misdemeanor traffic offense , but the officer 's privacy rights prevent you from documenting the encounter .
State Police spokesman Greg Shipley defended Graber 's arrest to TV station WJZ , explaining , " We are enforcing the law , and we do n't make any apologies for that . "
But they are n't enforcing the law .
They 're enforcing a tortured , absurd interpretation of the law that no court to date has endorsed .
No Maryland court — and from what I can tell no court in the country — has ruled that a police officer has a right to privacy in his on - duty interactions with the public .
It actually gets more absurd .
In 2000 , Maryland Attorney General Joseph Curran , Jr. was asked to issue an opinion ( PDF ) on whether a plan by the Montgomery County Police Department to install recording devices on patrol officers would violate the wiretapping statute .
To date , Curran 's opinion has not been modified or changed .
Curran determined that because protocol for the plan required officers to inform motorists they were being recorded , it did not violate the statute .
But Curran was also asked to determine what would happen if an officer inadvertently recorded someone without informing him first .
Curran again said the officer would not have violated the statute .
But a footnote added the following :
It is also notable that many encounters between uniformed police officers and citizens could hardly be characterized as " private conversations . "
For example , any driver pulled over by a uniformed officer in a traffic stop is acutely aware that his or her statements are being made to a police officer and , indeed , that they may be repeated as evidence in a courtroom .
It is difficult to characterize such a conversation as " private . "
This is common sense .
No one expects what they say to a cop during a traffic stop to be private .
But consider how this affects the way Maryland cops and prosecutors are interpreting the law :
When a cop pulls you over or detains you for questioning , he — the public servant with the badge and the gun—retains a right to privacy for the entire encounter .
You do n't .
A cynic might note the curious timing of these arrests .
They 've come shortly after Maryland law enforcement officials were nationally embarrassed by the videotaped beating of Jack McKenna .
McKenna , a student at the University of Maryland , was given an unprovoked beating by police during student celebrations after a basketball game last February .
McKenna would probably still be facing criminal charges and the cops who beat him would likely still be on the beat were it not for several cell phone videos that captured his beating .
According to the way prosecutors like Casilly view the law , if any of those videos also captured audio of the beating , the person who hit record is guilty of a felony .
The McKenna case provides a pretty obvious argument in favor of more citizen monitoring of on - duty police .
The police not only beat the kid , they then lied about it in official police reports .
The security camera footage of McKenna 's beating , which is controlled by University of Maryland Campus Police , mysteriously disappeared .
The officer in charge of the camera system is married to one of the officers involved in the beating .
It took the cell phone videos to preserve some semblance of justice .
St. Mary's County State 's Attorney Richard D. Fritz will decide whether or not to bring felony charges against Yvonne Nicole Shaw .
To his credit , he seems reluctant .
" If I 'm convinced this was a public encounter that just happened to be recorded , I probably will not proceed with the prosecution , " Fritz told the South Maryland News .
" The facts will probably bear out that it was not a private one - on - one conversation . "
That 's good to hear , but really it is n't enough .
Shaw was illegally arrested ; her property was illegally confiscated .
Merely dropping the charges against her does n't change that , and still leaves Maryland police with the license to arrest and intimidate Marylanders attempting to hold them accountable in the future .
Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler could put an end to this nonsense by stating explicitly that Marylanders who record on - duty cops are exercising their rights , not committing felonies .
He could also make it clear that so long as a videographer does n't physically interfere with an arrest or a police action , police are not permitted to confiscate or destory recording equipment .
If Gansler can't bring himself to vouch for his constituents ' basic and self - apparent right to keep government officials accountable , the Maryland legislature should do it for him .

It 's Okay To Remove Content From The Public Domain And Put It Back Under Copyright

This deferential standard is warranted for two important reasons .
First , Congress is " far better equipped " as an institution " to amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data bearing upon the legislative questions . " ... Second , we owe Congress " an additional measure of deference out of respect for its authority to exercise the legislative power . "
In particular , American works were unprotected in several foreign countries , to the detriment of the United States ' interests .... statement of Jason S. Berman , Chairman and CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America ... : " [ T ] here are vastly more US works currently unprotected in foreign markets than foreign ones here , and the economic consequences of [ granting retroactive copyright protection ] are dramatically in favor of US industries . " )....
By some estimates , billions of dollars were being lost each year because foreign countries were not providing copyright protections to American works that were in the public domain abroad .... ( statement of Eric Smith , Executive Director and General Counsel of the International Intellectual Property Alliance ) ( " Literally billions of dollars have been and will be lost every year by U.S. authors , producers and publishers because of the failure of many of our trading partners to protect U.S. works which were created prior to the date the U.S. established copyright relations with that country , or , for other reasons , these works have fallen prematurely out of copyright in that country . " ) .
We note that copyright includes several " built - in " First Amendment protections ....
The idea / expression dichotomy ensures that only particular expressions , and not ideas themselves , are subject to copyright protection ....
Additionally , the fair use defense allows individuals to use expressions contained in a copyrighted work under certain circumstances , including " criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching . . . scholarship , or research . . . and even for parody . " ... Section 514 does not disturb these traditional , built - in protections , and thus , such protected speech remains unburdened .

Warning : this one is depressing if you believe in the public domain .
You may recall that last year , a district court made a very important ruling on what appeared to be a minor part of copyright law .
The " Golan " case asked a simple question : once something is officially in the public domain , can Congress pull it out and put it back under copyright ?
The situation came about because of ( yet another ) trade agreement that pulled certain foreign works out of the public domain .
A district court had initially said that this move did not violate the law , but the appeals court sent it back , saying that the lower court had not analyzed the First Amendment issue , and whether this was a case where the inherent conflict between the First Amendment and copyright law went too far to the side of copyright by violating the " traditional contours of copyright law . "
Getting a second crack at this , the district court got it right -- and was the first court to point out that massively expanded copyright law can , in fact , violate the First Amendment .
But , of course , it could n't last .
On Monday , the appeals court reversed the lower court 's ruling and said there 's no problem with the First Amendment because copyright law " addresses a substantial or important governmental interest . "
This is , plainly speaking , ridiculous .
The argument effectively says that the government can violate the basic principles of the First Amendment any time it wants , so long as it shows a " substantial or important government interest . "
But that makes no sense .
The whole point of the First Amendment was to protectsituations where the government 's interests went against citizens ' interests .
It should never make sense to judge a First Amendment claim on whether the government has " substantial or important " interests .
On top of that , the court basically said " Congress knows best " on this issue .
Again , this seems to go against the entire point of the First Amendment and the important judicial protections of the First Amendment .
The whole point of court oversight of Congress is .
But here , the court has no problem deferring entirely to Congress : Except , as has been shown time and time again on copyright issues , Congress has done aamassingto support its continued and unstoppable expansion of copyright law .
Just within the past few months we 've seen the GAO -- which is supposed to make sure that Congress is properly applying data -- admit that Congress is flat out ignoring the actual evidence and agreeing with bogus studies from a few industries that is not backed up with any actual evidence .
Most worrying of all ?
The court says that it should keep out of this discussion because it involves international relations and international treaties .
See why you should be scared to death of ACTA ?
The courts are effectively admitting that once you get these " international obligations " in place , the courts should mostly stay out of the discussion , even if it violates the basic tenets of US law .
That 's downright scary .
The court gives a lip service defense to this , saying that it can still review international agreements to make sure they abide by the First Amendment ... but ... for the most part , it 'll just defer to Congress .
Next up ?
The court actually relies on testimony about " losses " from an RIAA official as well as someone from the IIPA ( a lobbying group made up of the RIAA , MPAA and other similar organizations ) :
These are the same studies that the GAO -- whose actual job it is to analyze these reports -- dismissed as junk science .
This is exactly where the courtsstep in and note that Congress is not doing its job and is doing serious harm at the behest of a few small industry interests .
What a travesty that this court could n't see that .
And , of course , the court continues to rely on clearly biased individuals who had a clear agenda , rather than a factual basis for their positions .
It even quotes Jack Valenti 's ridiculous claim that if the US removed foreign works from the public domain , that suddenly China and Russia would start respecting US copyright .
Also incredibly frustrating , misleading and inaccurate is a small footnote , which asserts the commonly claimed excuses by the courts for why copyright law does not violate the First Amendment : that the " idea / expression dichotomy " and " fair use " make it so there is no conflict .
But what 's frustrating in this footnote is that this particular court seems to suggest that so long as copyright does n't mess withthen there 's no First Amendment issue with copyright .
But that 's wrong .
Dangerously , ridiculously and constitutionally questionably wrong .
Just because there are those two " valves " to hopefully keep copyright law from violating the First Amendment ( and there are some very , very serious questions about how well either of them actually work ) , it does not mean that those are the only places where copyright law must be judged under the First Amendment .
In this particular case , a very serious issue was raised : works that clearly were in the public domain , and which some publishers were relying onsuddenly are no longer in the public domain .
If you have any respect at all for the core notion of copyright -- which was originally supposed to be about -- the idea that you can then take works back out of the public domain is downright ludicrous .
It goes beyond being a violation of the basic contours of copyright law .
It goes against the very Constitutional principles behind copyright law -- and does so in a way that is a clear violation of the First Amendment .
Which part of " ... abridging the freedom of speech " does this court not understand ?
All in all this is an incredibly frustrating ruling .
It feels like the court did n't actually want to address the admittedly difficult question of how the First Amendment and copyright law come into conflict , so it just punted and said " well Congress knows best , so it 's okay . "
The case will almost certainly be appealed , potentially for an en banc ( full appeals court review ) or directly to the Supreme Court .
So this most certainly is not over yet .
But after a reasonable ruling last year to this year 's reversal , it 's definitely a step backwards for anyone who believes in the importance and sanctity of the public domain .

" My grandmother was three when she had to escape Nazi Germany with her family , " says Shiri Rosen , one of thousands of Israelis to have moved " back " to Germany in recent years .
" My great - grandfather was a lawyer , his office was right near here , " the 24 - year - old told AFP in a café in central Berlin , pointing over her shoulder to a parallel street .
" When I was a kid , in Israel , she ( her grandmother ) bounced me on her knee , singing a song in German ...
They were the only words in German I ever heard from her . "
Israelis Take Berlin Israel 2nd in number of tourists to Berlin Danny Sadeh Americans are only ones outside Europe to visit German capital more than Israelis .
Some 25,000 entries of Israeli tourists recorded Berlin in first seven months of 2009 Israel 2nd in number of tourists to Berlin
Before Adolf Hitler took power in 1933 , Berlin had a thriving Jewish population numbering around 170,000 , many of them professionals such as doctors and lawyers , or intellectuals and artists .
But this vibrant community was decimated in the 12 years of terror that followed as the Nazis murdered six million men , women and children across Europe in their attempt to destroy the Jewish race .
Unsurprisingly , once World War II was over and the new state of Israel came into being in 1948 , the few Jews who had miraculously survived were loath to stay in Germany , in the " Land der Taeter " ( " country of the perpetrators " ) .
But today , decades later , with an ever - dwindling number of Holocaust survivors still around , the scars are slowly healing and Germany is becoming an attractive place to live for many Israelis .
A steady trickle has been returning to make use of a law allowing descendants to claim German citizenship .
" Germany today is a haven of peace for the descendants of those who , one day , fled the country because they were in danger , " says Ilan Weiss , who moved from Israel 20 years ago .
" The fact that Jews are coming here again constitutes for Germany a certificate that it is acceptable again . "
' In Tel Aviv all people talk about is Berlin '
In 2008 , the last year for which figures are available , almost 2,000 Israelis became naturalised German citizens .
Two years earlier , more than 4,300 did so .
According to the Israeli embassy , around 13,000 Israelis now live in Berlin alone .
Mostly , they are the descendants of German Jews stripped of their citizenship as the Nazis sought to " Aryanise " the Third Reich , and who now have the right to obtain German nationality .
Sitting in his well - worn Berlin apartment , Weiss , who is in his 60s , says he has noticed in recent years more and more Israelis coming in order , he believes , to escape the constant threat of violence in the Middle East .
And it is particularly the young who are doing so , attracted not only by a feeling of going back to their roots , but also by the vibrant , modern metropolis that the German capital is today .
Many come to make the most of Berlin 's nightlife and its bohemian lifestyle , attending techno nights in disused industrial warehouses or sampling the gay scene , where " Meshuga nights " with only Israeli music are big crowd - pullers .
" In Tel Aviv all people talk about is Berlin .
It is very much the city en vogue , " says Shiri Rosen enthusiastically .
Avi Efroni - Levi , who has launched a website for the Israeli community in Germany offering tips on everything from apartments to exhibitions , very much agrees .
" The planes from Tel Aviv to Berlin are packed .
For Israelis , the city offers so many possibilities because it's so international and life is quite cheap , " the 53 - year - old told AFP .
Weiss says that for many young Israelis , coming to Germany is much easier than for their parents ' generation .
" Very few of them are influenced by the Holocaust , " he says .
" Obviously most of them studied it at school but it 's something very remote for them . "
" You ca n't concentrate on the violence all the time , it 's negative , " says Avi Efroni - Levi .
" I 've got other things to think about than the past .
I want to achieve something here . "
" The wounds of the past are still there .
They never go away , " he said .
" But we have to heal them . "
Scandinavian tractor manufacturer Valtra and sister company Sisu have been trialling and testing a prototype biogas - fuelled tractor in Sweden .
The experimental machine is a 110 hp N101 model powered by a standard four - cylinder power - plant .
Without any significant changes to the original Sisu diesel engine , 70 - 80 % of its power is generated by biogas .
The dual - fuel engine functions like a conventional diesel engine .
Compressed natural gas is injected with the intake air and combustion occurs when a small amount of diesel fuel is injected into the cylinder .
If biogas is not available , the engine can run solely on diesel .
The biogas tanks are situated on the right - hand side of the chassis , in place of the cab steps .
The capacity of the gas cylinders on the first test tractor is 170 - litres , which is sufficient for three to four hours of work , equivalent to approximately 30 - litres of diesel .
Both the diesel and gas injection systems have their own electronically controlled common rail , which allows the ratio between the diesel and biogas to be adjusted automatically according to operating temperature , engine - loading , and so on .
Valtra envisages that farms with their own biogas plants and refinement facilities will be able to produce their own fuel on - farm using slurry and other waste - streams as well as crops grown specifically for energy production .
Valtra ’s sister company Sisu Genpowex was involved in the project and has also developed a dual - fuel generator .
The tractor will undergo further testing in Skåne , Sweden while the dual - fuel engine will continue to be developed in Sisu ’s engine lab .
Although a completely new development for the Finnish firms , it is not the first tractor of its type .
Last year Case IH / Steyr revealed a prototype dual - fuel CVX 1195 machine under analysis at its St. Valentin factory Austria .

TEL AVIV ( MarketWatch ) - A severe oil spill has followed last week 's explosion and fire at an offshore Louisiana oil rig , weekend media reports said .
The April 20 explosion occurred at a Transocean Ltd. drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico .
On Friday , the Coast Guard said it had suspended its active search for 11 missing members of the crew on the rig .
Of the 126 people working on the rig , 115 were safely evacuated .
Nine of those missing are employees of Transocean , RIG , - 4.26 % the Zug , Switzerland , offshore - drilling contractor , and two are employed by a third - party company .
The rig was doing work for BP Plc , BP , - 1.18 % ( BP ) the U.K. oil major , at the time of the explosion .
BP is spearheading efforts to contain the situation , reports say .
The leaking well was discovered Saturday and the leak could have occurred when the rig sank on Thursday , media reports say .
They quote a Coast Guard admiral , Mary Landry , as saying that the spill is " very serious . "
Media reports cite BP and the Coast Guard as saying that as much as 1000 barrels , or 42,000 gallons , of oil is leaking each day .
The spill covers 400 square miles of the Gulf of Mexico about 40 miles offshore , reports say .
Inclement weather -- winds and rain -- is hampering cleanup efforts .
The Associated Press also reported that the wellhead 's depth , 5,000 feet , makes stopping the leak that much more difficult .
Media reports suggest that the disaster on the rig was caused by a blowout , in which a burst of oil or gas is suddenly pushed to the surface .
But a firm cause of the rig accident has not yet been announced .
SAN FRANCISCO —
The Justice Department is examining Apple ’s tactics in the market for digital music , and its staff members have talked to major music labels and Internet music companies , according to several people briefed on the conversations .
The antitrust inquiry is in the early stages , these people say , and the conversations have revolved broadly around the dynamics of selling music online .
But people briefed on the inquiries also said investigators had asked in particular about recent allegations that Apple used its dominant market position to persuade music labels to refuse to give the online retailer Amazon.com exclusive access to music about to be released .
All these people spoke on condition of anonymity , citing the delicacy of the matter .
Representatives from Apple and Amazon declined to comment .
Gina Talamona , a deputy director at the Justice Department , also declined to comment .
The witch hunts against communists in the United States were used to silence socialists , anarchists , pacifists and all those who defied the abuses of capitalism .
Those “ anti- Red ” actions were devastating blows to the political health of the country .
The communists spoke the language of class war .
They understood that Wall Street , along with corporations such as British Petroleum , is the enemy .
They offered a broad social vision which allowed even the non-communist left to employ a vocabulary that made sense of the destructive impulses of capitalism .
But once the Communist Party , along with other radical movements , was eradicated as a social and political force , once the liberal class took government - imposed loyalty oaths and collaborated in the witch hunts for phantom communist agents , we were robbed of the ability to make sense of our struggle .
We became fearful , timid and ineffectual .
We lost our voice and became part of the corporate structure we should have been dismantling .
Hope in this age of bankrupt capitalism will come with the return of the language of class conflict .
It does not mean we have to agree with Karl Marx , who advocated violence and whose worship of the state as a utopian mechanism led to another form of enslavement of the working class , but we have to speak in the vocabulary Marx employed .
We have to grasp , as Marx did , that corporations are not concerned with the common good .
They exploit , pollute , impoverish , repress , kill and lie to make money .
They throw poor families out of homes , let the uninsured die , wage useless wars to make profits , poison and pollute the ecosystem , slash social assistance programs , gut public education , trash the global economy , loot the U.S. Treasury and crush all popular movements that seek justice for working men and women .
They worship only money and power .
And , as Marx knew , unfettered capitalism is a revolutionary force that consumes greater and greater numbers of human lives until it finally consumes itself .
The nightmare in the Gulf of Mexico is the perfect metaphor for the corporate state .
It is the same nightmare seen in postindustrial pockets from the old mill towns in New England to the abandoned steel mills in Ohio .
It is a nightmare that Iraqis , Pakistanis and Afghans , mourning their dead , live each day .
Capitalism was once viewed in America as a system that had to be fought .
But capitalism is no longer challenged .
And so , even as Wall Street steals billions of taxpayer dollars and the Gulf of Mexico is turned into a toxic swamp , we do not know what to do or say .
We decry the excesses of capitalism without demanding a dismantling of the corporate state .
The liberal class has a misguided loyalty , illustrated by environmental groups that have refused to excoriate the Obama White House over the ecological catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico .
Liberals bow before a Democratic Party that ignores them and does the bidding of corporations .
The reflexive deference to the Democrats by the liberal class is the result of cowardice and fear .
It is also the result of an infantile understanding of the mechanisms of power .
The divide is not between Republican and Democrat .
It is a divide between the corporate state and the citizen .
It is a divide between capitalists and workers .
And , for all the failings of the communists , they got it .
Unions , organizations formerly steeped in the doctrine of class warfare and filled with those who sought broad social and political rights for the working class , have been transformed into domesticated partners of the capitalist class .
They have been reduced to simple bartering tools .
The social demands of unions early in the 20th century that gave the working class weekends off , the right to strike , the eight - hour day and Social Security have been abandoned .
Universities , especially in political science and economics departments , parrot the discredited ideology of unregulated capitalism and have no new ideas .
Artistic expression , along with most religious worship , is largely self - absorbed narcissism .
The Democratic Party and the press have become corporate servants .
The loss of radicals within the labor movement , the Democratic Party , the arts , the church and the universities has obliterated one of the most important counterweights to the corporate state .
And the purging of those radicals has left us unable to make sense of what is happening to us .
The fear of communism , like the fear of Islamic terrorism , has resulted in the steady suspension of civil liberties , including freedom of speech , habeas corpus and the right to organize , values the liberal class claims to support .
It was the orchestration of fear that permitted the capitalist class to ram through the Taft - Hartley Act in 1948 in the name of anti-communism , the most destructive legislative blow to the working class until the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .
It was fear that created the Patriot Act , extraordinary rendition , offshore penal colonies where we torture and the endless wars in the Middle East .
And it was fear that was used to see us fleeced by Wall Street .
If we do not stop being afraid and name our enemy we will continue toward a state of neofeudalism .
The robber barons of the late 19th century used goons and thugs to beat up workers and retain control .
The corporations , employing the science of public relations , have used actors , artists , writers , scholars and filmmakers to manipulate and shape public opinion .
Corporations employ the college - educated , liberal elite to saturate the culture with lies .
The liberal class should have defied the emasculation of radical organizations , including the Communist Party .
Instead , it was lured into the corporate embrace .
It became a class of collaborators .
National cohesion , because our intellectual life has become so impoverished , revolves around the empty pursuits of mass culture , brands , consumption , status and the bland uniformity of opinions disseminated by corporate - friendly courtiers .
We speak and think in the empty slogans and clichés we are given .
And they are given to us by the liberal class .
The “ idea of the intellectual vocation , ” as Irving Howe pointed out in his essay “ The Age of Conformity , ” “ the idea of a life dedicated to values that cannot possibly be realized by a commercial civilization — has gradually lost its allure .
And , it is this , rather than the abandonment of a particular program , which constitutes our rout . ”
The belief that capitalism is the unassailable engine of human progress , Howe added , “ is trumpeted through every medium of communication : official propaganda , institutional advertising and scholarly writings of people who , until a few years ago , were its major opponents . ”
“ The truly powerless people are those intellectuals — the new realists — who attach themselves to the seats of power , where they surrender their freedom of expression without gaining any significance as political figures , ” Howe wrote .
“ For it is crucial to the history of the American intellectuals in the past few decades — as well as to the relationship between ‘ wealth ’ and ‘ intellect ’ — that whenever they become absorbed into the accredited institutions of society they not only lose their traditional rebelliousness but to one extent or another they cease to function as intellectuals .
The institutional world needs intellectuals because they are intellectuals but it does not want them as intellectuals .
It beckons to them because of what they are but it will not allow them , at least within its sphere of articulation , either to remain or entirely cease being what they are .
It needs them for their knowledge , their talent , their inclinations and passions ; it insists that they retain a measure of these endowments , which it means to employ for its own ends , and without which the intellectuals would be of no use to it whatever .
A simplified but useful equation suggests itself : the relation of the institutional world to the intellectuals is as the relation of middlebrow culture to serious culture , the one battens on the other , absorbs and raids it with increasing frequency and skill , subsidizes and encourages it enough to make further raids possible — at times the parasite will support its victim .
Surely this relationship must be one reason for the high incidence of neurosis that is supposed to prevail among intellectuals .
A total estrangement from the sources of power and prestige , even a blind unreasoning rejection of every aspect of our culture , would be far healthier if only because it would permit a free discharge of aggression . ”
The liberal class prefers comfort to confrontation .
It will not challenge the decaying structures of the corporate state .
It is intolerant within its ranks of those who do .
It clings pathetically to the carcass of the Obama presidency .
It has been exposed as a dead force in American politics .
We must find our way back to the old radicals , to the discredited Marxists , socialists and anarchists , including Dwight Macdonald and Dorothy Day .
Language is our first step toward salvation .
We can not fight what we cannot describe .
Minnesota Republican candidate for governor Tom Emmer apparently violated campaign finance laws when his campaign donated twice the legal limit to a Christian punk - rock group which teaches public - school students that it ’s “ moral ” to kill homosexuals .
The Minnesota Independent made the disclosure in two stories today .
Like Exodus International , this band — named You Can Run But You Cannot Hide Intl. , and led by self - styled minister Bradlee Dean — claims to be bringing the “ message of Christ ” to youth :
In this case , a message of righteous murder .
According to the Independent :
“ Muslims are calling for the executions of homosexuals in America , ” Dean said on YCR ’ May 15 radio show on AM 1280 the Patriot .
“ This just shows you they themselves are upholding the laws that are even in the Bible of the Judeo - Christian God , but they seem to be more moral than even the American Christians do , because these people are livid about enforcing their laws .
They know homosexuality is an abomination . ”
Dean endorses efforts by foreign antigay terrorists to attack the United States if the nation does not voluntarily adopt antigay genocide laws :
“ If America wo n’t enforce the laws , God will raise up a foreign enemy to do just that , ” Dean continued .
“ That is what you are seeing in America . ”
Rep .
Tom Emmer has appeared on the kill - the - gays rock band ’s talk show , posed for pictures , visited Dean ’s home , and attended a non -profit band fund - raiser .
Fellow Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann has twice endorsed the murderous band .

Despite protests by the Minnesota Log Cabin Republicans , the state party has become more cozy with the band , not less .
Emmer has refused to comment on the band ’s appeals for antigay bloodshed .
Instead , Emmer ’s campaign released a statement to the Independent saying “ Tom ’ position on social issues has been very clear and consistent .
He is a supporter of traditional marriage , and he strongly opposes any kind of violence or unfair discrimination against any group . ”
Unless , apparently , the violence is politically and musically expedient or the discrimination is “ fair . ”
As for the tax - free , non-profit group ’s partisan political activity , watchdogs said they ’ve seen worse .
Dean Blanchard 's firm used to account for 11 % of the US shrimp supply .
Now , he is reduced to supplying fuel and water to BP clean - up crews
Of all the folks in Louisiana spoiling for a fight with Tony Hayward , none perhaps brings more gusto to the challenge than Dean Blanchard , the local shrimp king .
The outer walls of the trailer office of his seafood empire are plastered with homemade signs reading " BP= Bayou Polluter " and " President Obama : BP took my business and my money . "
The frontroom is painted shrimp pink , and Blanchard is working himself up imagining what he would like to do to the BP chief executive if he ever got the chance : fist fight , public wrestling match , jail time ?
" He took away everything I love most in the world .
I am going to hunt that son of a bitch down like a ' coon , " he said .
" He wants his life back after all he has done to us ?
The hell with him . "
Then he speculates about peeing in the Queen 's water fountain .
" What do you think would happen to me ?
I 'd go to jail for that , and it would be relatively minor environmental damage . "
He may not immediately look the part in his faded shorts and blue vest and the jumble of buildings around the docks , but in the shrimp world , Blanchard is Hayward .
BP ranks in the top three oil companies ; Blanchard says his are the third biggest shrimp docks in the world , with some 6,000 fishermen bringing him their catch .
His company accounts for about 11 % of the US shrimp supply .
In the pre-spill era , that would have put Hayward and Blanchard on near equal footing , he reckons .
Oil and shrimp were the two poles of existence in this part of Louisiana .
Offshore rigs and refinery tanks are as ubiquitous as fishing trawlers .
Blanchard had a foot in both worlds .
One grandfather got rich on shrimp , establishing the business he now operates near BP 's local command centre .
The other grandfather got rich from oil .
Now , with the gusher on the ocean floor and fishing banned in much of the Gulf , there is just oil clean - up .
At the Sand Dollar marina , redeployed fishermen and shrimpers , hauling containment boom through the water instead of nets , share space with the coastguard and national guard .
The money is only a fraction of what it would be for a successful shrimp season and 2010 was shaping up to be a banner year .
" Every 10 years , when you get a cold winter , you get a really good shrimp crop , " Blanchard said .
" We were licking our chops . "
On a good run , a big shrimp boat could earn $ 1 m ( £ 686,000 ) a day .
The going rate for fishing for oil is $ 3,000 , less for smaller boats – not a lot once divided among captain and crew .
Several of the men say they have yet to be paid .
Blanchard says his losses are on a far grander scale .
" I 've lost $ 15 m worth of sales in the last 50 days .
That would have been $ 1 m in my pocket , " he said .
A few of the big freezer boats are still going out , but Blanchard says he is reduced to selling BP fuel and water for its contract clean - up crews , and renting out dock space .
By his terms , it 's a pittance and he has no idea when he will get back to work .
" What I make off of BP I could make in eight hours , " he said .
He is equally scathing of BP 's oil clean - up strategy .
" I could take two 32 oz Big Gulp cups from the 7 - Eleven and do more than what they are doing , " he said .
Blanchard is far from the only angry man in town .
The mayor , David Camardelle , was in Washington this week to testify before Congress .
He nearly broke down .
" The shrimp died .
It 's a ghost town .
The boom does n't work , " he said .
Around the corner from his operations , a family has erected 101 simple white crosses memorialising what has been lost to the spill .
There is sea food industry , with crosses for tuna , shrimp and oyster catches , but also " beach sunrises " , " seafood gumbo " , " redfish rodeo " , " family time " , " porch sitting " and " dog on beach " .
And for all his bluster , Blanchard is overwhelmed by the loss .
" I think I did everything right , and here this idiot came and did n't know how to run his business and put me out of my business .
People used to respect me in this town .
Now I wake up in the morning and I do n't know what to do . "
With images of oily ruin from the Gulf of Mexico breaking our hearts and turning our stomachs and the car - driving world at the edge of an electric moment and a plug - in paradigm shift , more and more attention is on the batteries that will make or break this transportation revolution .
The lithium ion ( Li-ion ) battery is the state of the art .
It is the safest , most energy - dense product the auto industry can find that is not so expensive as to make battery electric vehicles ( BEVs ) unaffordable .
Yet it comes at quite a cost , perhaps $ 1,000 per kilowatt - hour .
A potent battery pack can cost more than some economy vehicles .
Carmakers would dearly love to find a way to beat that price burden .
Shai Agassi ’s breathtakingly ambitious Better Place concept is surely the cleverest way around the cost of the battery so far devised .
Better Place will sell cars but lease the batteries on cell phone - like usage plans .
That , and the Better Place ambition to build an international chain of battery fast - switch stations , may facilitate a lot of electric vehicle sales but does not solve the battery ’s price problem , it just shifts it to Agassi .
There is one great hope on the horizon .
It would make a Li-ion BEV battery an investment of sorts .
Agassi has mentioned the idea as a possibility on which his company ’s financial viability could hinge .
Today ’s Li-ion batteries are expected to last 8 - to - 10 years .
At that point , they will no longer hold a full charge but will only be capable of about 80 % of their nameplate storage capacity .
As vehicle batteries , they will require replacement .
But 80 % storage capacity might be very , very useful to somebody – somebody who might pay for that storage capacity and , by giving the battery resale value , defray the high purchase price .

In PHEV / EV Li-Ion Battery Second - Use Project , Jeremy Neubauer and Ahmad Pesaran of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) describe the experiment they are undertaking to see just how capable and valuable today ’s lithium ion BEV batteries will be when they are done with their life in transportation and begin their second life in stationary storage .
If Neubauer and Pesaran prove the hypothesized potential to be real , it could represent not only a way to affordability for BEVs but the answer to New Energy ’s hardest question :
How can there be large - scale affordable storage ?
In the foreseeable future , warehouses of second - hand Li-ion batteries could potentially be storage facilities into which solar arrays and power plants and wind installations drop excess and off - peak generation until grid managers need and call on it , giving second life to the batteries and much more life to the variable New Energies .

Communication is not just part of customer service ; it is the most important part of customer service .
That is because good customer service requires listening to a customer 's needs and then telling her how you plan to meet those needs — in other words , communicating with your customer .
Customer Service Communication Examples
Every aspect of customer service is filled with communication between the customer and the company .
While the most obvious customer service communication examples would be those between a customer who has a problem and the customer service agent assigned to help him , a customer does not need to reach out to the customer support department in order to communicate with the company .
Some of the many , many situations that involve customer service communication include :
When a shopper enters a store and sees price tags , these communicate what the customer must pay for an item .
When a client visits a company 's website and reads about what services the business offers .
When a bank teller makes small talk with an account holder who is depositing a check .
When a company sends an email about a data breach to those who have been affected .
The Results of Positive Communication
When you begin to recognize how frequently a company communicates with its customers , it is easy to see the importance of communication skills in customer service .
The benefits of good communication with customers are numerous , but they may include :
Leaving them with a positive feeling when interacting with your company , which will make them want to continue doing business with you even after they encounter problems and reduce the likelihood that they will leave you for your competitors .
Letting them know that you understand the importance of meeting customer needs and are willing to do what it takes to keep them happy , improving customer loyalty .
Giving them peace of mind that if something goes wrong , you will do whatever it takes to fix it , which may translate to customers being willing to spend more on your product or service .
Making them comfortable with bringing their problems to your attention , which can help you rectify the issues before they negatively impact other clients or can even result in new innovations .
Creating a feeling of trust by not only listening to their needs but also by being transparent with your customers about everything that may affect their experience , from pricing information and shipping delays to product recalls and data breaches .
Associating your brand with positive values such as transparency , honesty and good corporate governance .
Showing you value your customers and do not take them for granted , which could result in free word - of - mouth marketing when shoppers tell their friends about their experiences .
How to Improve Communications
Many companies wait until a customer contacts them before worrying about customer service .
This is a mistake , as it only focuses on one of the many types of communication in the full customer service experience .
Businesses that truly recognize the importance of communication skills in customer service instead look at all interactions with their customers and try to make each step as effective and positive as possible .
When you want to improve customer service communication , do not just look at the end stage where an irate shopper gets in touch when things go wrong .
Instead , try these suggestions :
Only surprising that anyone would be surprised that a study finds India has the most fucked up web of bureaucracy .
Apparently , the massive centralization of institutionalized power over almost 1.2bn people , covering 1.2 m sq. mi. ( 3.2 m sq. km. ) is dysfunctional .
And unlike the former Soviet Union , this State apparatus has an extremely well - standing allegiance with the West .
The Hong Kong - based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy surveyed 100 business executives across 12 Asian countries who said “ India had the worst levels of excessive red tape ” , the BBC reports today , adding :
The report ranks bureaucracies across Asia on a scale from one to 10 , with 10 being the worst possible score .
India scored 9.41 .
Frequent promises to reform the bureaucracy , the report says , have come to nothing , mainly because the civil service is a power centre in its own right .
There is a strong link , the report says , between bureaucracy and corruption — and a widely held belief that bureaucrats are selfish and highly insensitive to the needs of the people they are supposed to help … .
A recent survey of the Indian bureaucracy found large numbers of civil servants complaining of undue political interference , and a widespread fear that anyone questioning the system would be transferred to obscure postings in bureaucratic backwaters .
There ’s so much funny here , it ’s sad .
Call it “ representative democracy ” , “ liberal democracy ” or whatever , the central purpose is to manufacture consent to perpetuate the power needed to enhance the privileges of those in control of the State apparatus .
This is why employment statistics are politicized to insane degrees .
Governments do n’t expand amidst rises in unemployment because ‘ only the government can save the economy from apocalyptic collapse ’ .
Governments expand to put people out of work behind desks or performing manual labor for the State .
This pacifies the people to refrain them from rising up against the corporate cronies of that government and the corrupted government agents ; it requires rising up against the agency which both their boss and that on which people believe law , order , security is based .
One ca n’t look at this report and ignore : “ Starting a business in India is incredibly hard , and enforcing contracts can be nigh on impossible . ”
The government blocks entry into the marketplace to :
Perpetuate and cartelize the captains of ‘ private industry , who ; Finance the propaganda that puts the government agents into power because ;
The government needs votes and votes require consent and participation , but ; Winning elections in a ‘ liberal representative democracy ’ requires cynically controlling the information flow toward consent and ; Limiting the participation to the degree that the quantity of ‘ major players ’ in the propaganda and policy formation process are stabilized requiring the cycle to revert back to # 1 , rinse and repeat .
The problem with limiting the marketplace is that the demand for labor and — more importantly — opportunity to organize alternatives to the cartelized portion , overwhelmingly dominating the for - profit sector , is actively suppressed .
To limit the marketplace , red tape is necessary , requiring more bureaucrats and hands - on - deck .
But , this is still not enough , so the red tape increases to the point where employment is at a level insignificant to threatening the power of the State apparatus .
The cartels expand and contract with the red tape cycles in a sort of balancing act .
The ruling class fully understands that tipping the scale too far will lead to mass unemployment or government levels of cruelty to which the amount of dissent is — not only significant to threaten existing institutions of authority and distribution , but — widespread to the point where the class overwhelmingly ruled overtaking the institutions becomes an existential inevitability .
Alex writes quite a bit on Iran , so I figured I ’d write about his ‘ Motherland ’ .
We ’ve had this discussion many times that if American culture experienced the centralization of the Indian government , the U.S. would immediately decentralize .
We frequently agree that the balancing act is performed to prevent just this , with the same problems manifesting in different manners .
Maybe , we could formulate this better in a future post with a more of a joint op - ed format .
Here , I ’m just rambling .

The National Identity Card scheme will be abolished within 100 days with all cards becoming invalid , Home Secretary Theresa May has said .
Legislation to axe the scheme will be the first put before parliament by the new government - with a target of it becoming law by August .
The 15,000 people who voluntarily paid £ 30 for a card since the 2009 roll out in Manchester will not get a refund .
Ms May said ID card holders would at least have a " souvenir " of the scheme .
TIMELINE July 2002 : Plans unveiled November 2004 : ID cards bill March 2006 : Act becomes law November 2009 : Cards available May 2010 : Scheme scrapped
Full timeline : ID cards Q&A : Identity cards
The Labour scheme was aimed at tackling fraud , illegal immigration and identity theft - but it was criticised for being too expensive and an infringement of civil liberties .
The cards were designed to hold personal biometric data on an encrypted chip , including name , a photograph and fingerprints .
The supporting National Identity Register was designed to hold up to 50 pieces of information .
The cards already in circulation will remain legal until Parliament has passed the legislation to abolish them and the register .
The short abolition bill will be pushed through Parliament as quickly as possible with the aim of cards being invalid by 3 September .
Anyone who has a card or has to deal with them , such as airport security officials , will be told the termination date in writing .
Once the cards are illegal , the National Identity Register will be " physically destroyed " , say ministers .
Some 60 people who were working on the scheme for the Identity and Passport Service in Durham have lost their jobs .
Ms May said : " This bill is a first step of many that this government is taking to reduce the control of the state over decent , law - abiding people and hand power back to them .
With swift Parliamentary approval , we aim to consign identity cards and the intrusive ID card scheme to history within 100 days . "
£ 800 m saving Officials are renegotiating two contracts worth £ 650 m with companies who had agreed to deliver parts of the scheme .
It 's not clear how much the government will need to pay compensation , but officials say there is no " poisoned pill " in the deals and they expect to save £ 86 m once all exit costs are met .
' DON'T TAKE AWAY MY ID ' I paid £ 30 for this identity card and I certainly would have paid £ 75 for it because of the advantages it has given me
John Kirby , one of the 15,000 ID cardholders
' Why I love my ID card ' Some £ 250 m was spent on developing the national ID programme over eight years and its abolition will mean the government will avoid spending a further £ 800 m over a decade .
Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett unveiled plans for an identity card scheme in July 2002 .
By February 2010 , the scheme 's costs over its lifetime had ballooned to an estimated £ 4.5 bn .
Despite the demise of the national identity card , a separate but technically similar scheme for some foreign nationals will continue .
That scheme , run by the UK Border Agency , is still being rolled out .
Immigration minister Damian Green said the scheme was an EU obligation and that the previous Labour government had rolled it into the main ID card programme .
Some 200,000 of these cards , now known as biometric resident permits , have already been given to migrant workers , foreign students and family members from outside the European Economic Area .
British passports are about to be upgraded to a new international security standard but additional proposals to put more biometric information on in the future have also been axed .

The Oireachtas Foreign Affairs committee has described as " disappointing " the decision by the Israeli Ambassador to pull out of an emergency meeting on the Gaza flotilla attack later today .
Dr Zion Evrony was due to appear before the Committee , but pulled out yesterday afternoon due to " unforeseen circumstances " .
Requests for an alternative date were also refused .
The Ambassador was also expected to be questioned on Israel 's intentions towards the Irish aid ship , the Rachel Corrie , which is currently on its way to the region .
Sen .
John McCain said Thursday he was angry that Arizona electricity customers have paid well over millions for a permanent disposal site for nuclear waste but have nothing to show for it .
President Barack Obama 's administration this year scrapped long - standing plans to develop a permanent nuclear - waste repository under Yucca Mountain in Nevada , so power plants like Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station are left to store their waste on site .
The Department of Energy is obligated to eventually take the spent fuel from nuclear plants , but without Yucca Mountain it could be years before an alternative is even proposed , let alone developed .
" I think it 's a big problem , " McCain said when asked about the cut funding for Yucca Mountain during a campaign stop at Palo Verde .
The Republican senator blamed the decision entirely upon the influence of Sen. Harry Reid , who represents Nevada and leads the Democrats in the Senate .
" I was absolutely opposed to its closure , " McCain said .
" It 's absolutely ridiculous to not have Yucca Mountain after ( developing it over ) a 20 - year process . "
McCain is running for re-election and faces a primary challenge from J.D. Hayworth , a former Arizona congressman and radio host and another Republican .
Four Democrats and two minor - party candidates also are running for his seat .
Customers from Arizona Public Service Co. and Salt River Project have paid $ 258 million to the Nuclear Waste Fund , and billions has been spent researching and developing Yucca Mountain .
Meanwhile , utility customers still are paying to store waste on site at the nation 's 104 nuclear reactors , including Palo Verde .
Utility industry groups have sued to stop the payments that companies like APS and SRP make to the fund because there is no plan to deal with the waste .
At Palo Verde , after the fuel has been used in the reactors , it spends at least seven years cooling in one of the plant 's large pools .
Then it is moved to steel and concrete cylinders that stand about 18 feet tall and are placed on a concrete pad outside of the reactors .
The dry - storage area at Palo Verde is large enough to hold all the fuel that will be used for the initial 40 - year license of each reactor and could be expanded to hold fuel from the next 20 - year relicensing .
If the U.S. recycled the uranium fuel rods , the plant would have about one - fourth the waste to store on site , Chief Nuclear Officer Randy Edington said .
The concrete containers are good for at least 120 years , if not longer , Edington said , although they were not initially planned to be kept on site that long .
McCain said that lawmakers can help the nuclear industry by streamlining the licensing process , lifting the current ban on recycling the spent fuel , which is done in France , Japan and Great Britain , and by settling on a location for a permanent waste repository .
" I hope this puts pressure on the ( Obama ) administration for recycling and storage , " he said .
McCain likely chose to speak at Palo Verde because APS , which co-owns the plant with six other utilities , including SRP , is likely to try and build a new nuclear plant sometime soon .
The company forecasts it will need a new baseload power plant by about 2020 .
Baseload power plants , like nuclear facilities , are important because they run all day and night , and are difficult to replace with variable power sources such as solar plants .
" We 're basically looking at nuclear for that option , " said Don Brandt , president / CEO of Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , which owns APS .
The company ruled out a new coal - fired power plant because of the greenhouse - gas emissions from burning coal that contribute to climate change and the likelihood that those emissions will soon be taxed .
Brandt said APS has a number of sites it would consider for a new nuclear plant in Arizona , but is not moving ahead with plans to build one because the company wants to see what happens with other utilities now going through that process .
" We do n't want to be in the first wave , " Brandt said .
" We have the benefit of having some time . "
One of the companies moving ahead with new nuclear reactors is Georgia Power , which is developing two new reactors in that state .
Brandt said APS will watch that process closely .
He said the investment community would not react well if Pinnacle West were to move ahead too soon on a new nuclear facility .
" Today the reaction would be negative , " Brandt said .
" All the pieces are not together .
A lot has to happen . "

Bush : Afghanistan is a victory over terrorism
Hamid Karzai thanks U.S. for aiding his country
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Tuesday claimed victory in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and announced what he called five new initiatives to strengthen the links between that country and the United States .
Bush praised the visiting head of Afghanistan 's interim government , Hamid Karzai , as a man of " honor , courage and skill helping to build a new and democratic Afghanistan . "
" That journey to democracy and peace deserves the support and respect of every nation , " he said at a Rose Garden news conference after a meeting with Karzai , " because free nations do not breed the ideology of terror . "
" Coalition forces , including many brave Afghans , have brought America , Afghanistan and the world its first victory in the war on terror , " the president said .
" Afghanistan is no longer a terrorist factory sending thousands of killers into the world . "
A short while later in the Afghan capital city of Kabul , NATO forces came under fire Tuesday when at least one rocket exploded outside their headquarters .
One soldier suffered non-lifethreatening injuries , officials said .
About 20,000 U.S. troops and more than 6,000 ISAF peacekeepers have been involved in almost daily gunfights with members of al Qaeda and the ousted Taliban leadership , who appear intent on disrupting elections for the Afghan Constitutional Assembly planned for September .
" The fight , this war , this fight against the remnants of terrorism will go on for some time , " Karzai warned during an appearance Monday on PBS ' " The News Hour with Jim Lehrer . "
" It will not end this year .
It will not end next year .
We may have it for many years to come .
So Afghanistan will continue to have security incidents as it builds its security institutions . "
Karzai has come under criticism for reportedly cooperating with corrupt warlords , but in the Rose Garden on Tuesday he said that the Afghan government would make no deals with " bad people . "
" As president , it 's my job to take country to better future ... to a higher degree of democracy , " he said .
" To do that peacefully ... I will talk to anybody that comes to talk to me about stability and peace and about movement towards democracy .
...
" There are bad people in Afghanistan with whom we are not making a deal , with whom we are not talking and with whom we will not make a deal . "
Both in the Rose Garden and in his address to a joint meeting of Congress , Karzai acknowledged a growing problem with drug trafficking -- used by some warlords to raise money for more weapons .
Afghanistan is " adamant , " Karzai said , about ending the drug problem .
" Drug profits undermine our efforts to build a health national economy , " he told Congress . " ...
We are determined to cleanse Afghanistan of this menace . "
Bush noted " a long road ahead " but pledged that the United States would stand with Afghanistan " as partners . "
To seal those ties , Bush ticked off five new initiatives that include training newly elected officials , expanding assistance in the educational realm , working toward a bilateral trade agreement , expanding opportunities for women and increasing opportunities for cultural exchange with the United States .
" My government affirms its ironclad commitment to help Afghanistan succeed and prosper , " he said .
Karzai thanked Bush for making democracy possible in his nation .
" We have a constitution that we have today which is the most enlightened in that part of the world , " Karzai said .
" And that constitution has been made possible because of the liberation that you helped us gain and because of the stability that the United States helped us have in Afghanistan . "
" Thank you very much , Mr. President , for that . "
Speaking to Congress , Karzai said that Afghans embraced the American war on terrorism even though the rise of the Taliban and al Qaeda had come about after the United States and other Western countries left Afghanistan to the warlords after Soviet Union pulled out .
Karzai reminded U.S. lawmakers that Afghanistan faced alone the " unspeakable terror " of the Taliban and al Qaeda " long before the horrific tragedy of September 11 . "
" The terrorists subjected the people of Afghanistan to unspeakable terror even though we were among the most pious Muslims in the world , " he said .
" These atrocities continued for many years , and the world remained unengaged . "
However , Karzai said , Afghanistan is grateful " for your generosity and commitment to our people " and will continue to support U.S. efforts to battle terrorists .
" You have supported us with your resources , with your leadership in the world community and most importantly with the precious lives of your soldiers , " he said .
" Without the partnership between our two nations , " Karzai said , Afghanistan would not have made the progress it has , including the opening of schools to boys and girls , new health centers and road reconstruction to stimulate trade .
Both Bush and Karzai acknowledged that Afghanistan is a work in progress .
Karzai noted that his country remains " one of the poorest . "
Only 6 percent of its people have access to electricity , few have access to safe drinking water and farmers have a shortage of water to irrigate their crops , he said .
Armed militias still pose a serious problem , he said , especially when they are using the illegal drug trade to buy arms .
" We have come a long way , but our common journey is far from over , " he said .
Still , he said , Afghanistan is confident it will succeed , particularly with international help .
" To succeed , we ask for your continued investment , " he said .
" Afghanistan is open for business and American companies are welcome . "
Karzai also addressed new freedoms among women in Afghanistan in the wake of the oppressive Taliban regime .
" The new constitution replaces the Taliban - imposed gender discrimination by assigning 25 percent of the seats in our future parliament for women , " Karzai said .
On Monday , Karzai visited the Pentagon , pressing for more NATO peacekeeping troops to help the 20,000 U.S. forces already in his nation .
" The Afghan people demand and insist on disarming and demobilizing private militias , " Karzai told Congress .
" Only with your support , and that of the international community , can we achieve this necessary goal . "
At the Pentagon , Karzai was asked about the chances of capturing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
The president expressed optimism .
" Has a fugitive run forever ?
No , at least not in my country , " Karzai said .
" We will catch him one day , sooner or later . "
The present Sri Lankan government has proved that though Sri Lanka is a small country , it has been able to achieve many things that other countries , specially in the West have not been able to .
Nowhere in the world has terrorism been crushed and destroyed using only force .
â€ œDestroying terrorism is not a crime ” the Defense Secretary told Stephen Sackur of the BBC .
What was implied is that the means we used cannot be questioned .
In other countries a military solution goes hand in hand with a political solution .
In Sri Lanka the government believes that there is no political problem and therefore a political solution is not necessary .
If that is so what made the LTTE take up arms ?
â€ œThere was no reason .
They were born terrorists and the only solution was to exterminate them .
We have done it .
Now , do n’t talk about the past , and put forward the demands of the terrorists like power sharing and devolution of power ” , seems to be the government ’s answer .
Most Sri Lankans including some Tamils have accepted this answer .
People of most other countries would not have .
That too is an achievement of the Rajapaksa regime .
Finally the Rajapaksa brothers have convinced the people that democracy imposed on us by our colonial masters is not such a wonderful system .
It is much safer to hand over power to one family .
The Rajapaksas did not take over power by staging a coup ( Although Sarath Fonseka has called the presidential election the biggest coup ! )
Using different methods , they merely persuaded the people to vote the whole family into power , for after all the President can only trust his family members and friends .
As Gotabhaya Rajapaksa pointed out in his ‘ Hard Talk ’ interview all members of the Rajapaksa family received a massive number of preferential votes .
When Stephen Sackur questioned whether it was healthy in a vibrant democracy , for one family to hold such wide powers , Gotabhaya ’s answer was , â€ œIf the people gives all that power – all Rajapaksas were elected â€ “ so what ?
If the people want the Rajapaksas â€ “ let it be ” This then is the biggest achievement of the Rajapaksas , that they have been able to make the people want them , perhaps to stay in power for ever .
Anyone who watched Gotabhya Rajapaksa on BBC would have realized that Sri Lanka is now firmly on the road away from democracy towards authoritarian rule .
Gotabhya Rajapaksa was bold enough to tell Stephen Sackur that General Sarath Fonseka , who was mainly responsible for winning the war for the Rajapaksas could be executed if he were to agree to testify before any independent investigation of alleged abuses during the war .
To quote his own words , â€ œHe ( Sarath Fonseka ) cannot do that .
He was the commander .
That ’s a treason , we will hang him if he do that .
I am telling you .
How can he betray the country ?
He is a liar , liar , liar ” .
Such is the power of the Rajapaksas .
The Defense secretary was not elected by the people but he seems to be the most powerful man of the present regime .
Not satisfied with the power they already wield , the regime plans to legally acquire unlimited powers for an unlimited period of time , by changing the constitution .
The AHRC ( Asian Human Rights Commission ) referred to the taking over of the Attorney General ’s Department by the President as â€œone more nail in the coffin , one more step on the road to consolidation of despotic government in Sri Lanka ” .
But there are more nails to come in the form of constitutional reforms to firmly seal democracy in a coffin .
The new constitution would remove the 2 terms limit and give Mahinda Rajapaksa the freedom to remain President for life if he wished to or at least till he could hand over power to Namal Rajapaksa who is already referred to as the â€œheir apparent ” .
The senate would make it possible for any pro-democracy law to be effectively vetoed .
That would be another nail in the coffin .
Stephen Sackur thinks , â€ œThe suggestion that General Fonseka could be executed is likely to cause a political storm in Sri Lanka ” .
He is wrong .
We Sri Lankans know better .
There will be no political storm , not even a strong breeze .
The Rajapaksa brothers have seen to that .
They have convinced the majority that while they won the war on terror and saved the country , General Fonseka has been proved to be a traitor , willing to betray the country .
It may not take very long for the same people to be ready to cheer and applaud the hanging of this ‘ traitor ’ if and when the Rajapaksas decide to do so .
Organizations and institutions that could have staged a protest have been effectively silenced .
The media has been the worst hit .
Many journalists have been threatened , killed , abducted , tortured , disappeared or exiled for criticizing the government .
Any thing that is said in support of these journalists is called LTTE propaganda .
Even the killing of Lasantha Wickramatunga is being referred as part of anti-government ( LTTE ) propaganda !
What about the main opposition ?
They cannot prevent this erosion of democracy as long as Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe remains the leader .
He has now forgotten the ceasefire days when he spoke of a political settlement based on power sharing with the minorities .
Like the Rajapaksa cabal he too seems to believe that ultra nationalism is the way forward and it is wiser to share power with the Rajapaksas than with the minorities .
Being with them he helps the brothers to consolidate their power base .
When Chamal Rajapaksa was chosen as the speaker of the House Ranil Wickramasinghe was expected to protest .
Â
But he did not .
Instead he lent his support to the Rajapaksa brothers and made his own job secure .
Some people are beginning to wonder whether there is a secret agreement between Ranil Wickramasinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa that while one remains President for life the other remains leader of the opposition for life .
And so the UNP remains weak and ineffective unable to convince the people that willingly handing over all powers to one man and his family would ultimately destroy their freedom , and when that realization dawns it would be too late .
What about the intelligentsia in this country ?
Today many professionals and intellectuals are supportive of the Rajapaksa regime .
They are ever willing to â€œprotect the President ’s good name ” .
Well known and respected intellectuals are prepared to accept a â€œlittle more corruption ( un provable ) and a little more nepotism ( which is understandable ) ” from the Rajapaksa brothers â€ “ all this support is of course purely in the interest of the country they say .
What of the left parties and their leaders ?
As pointed out by Kusal Perera ( June 06th , Sunday Leader ) the old left parties like the LSSP and CP do not have any organized party structures as they had in the 50s and 60s .
Their leaders are more interested in holding ministerial posts than in offering any constructive criticism .
Enjoying state privileges and supporting a corrupt regime they have lost all credibility among the people .
Left leaders of the past like N.M. , Colvin and Leslie among many others were men of political integrity and honesty .
Today there is none among the left parties of that caliber who could give leadership to the dissenting voices .
Wickramabahu Karunaratna ’s is a lone voice in the wilderness .
The JVP does keep protesting but the people do not trust them due to their violent past .
Finally the people could protest against these moves towards authoritarianism but that is very unlikely .
Most Sri Lankans are not perturbed by the sweeping powers exercised by the Rajapaksa brothers .
To them what matters is that there is peace in the country .
They are free to move around without any fear of sudden bomb explosions .
There is security and they also believe that the economy is growing and the cost of living will gradually come down with development .
As to freedom of expression , independence of the judiciary , probing war crimes and bringing those found guilty to justice , implementation of the 13th and 17th amendments , preventing Human Rights violations , abuse of power and corruption among the politicians , police and the government officials , and finally treating the minorities as equals through power sharing – these mean nothing to them .
They are happy within the cocoons they have woven around themselves and refuse to see the reality outside their world .
Amidst such apathy and indifference of the people , is there any hope of democracy surviving in Sri Lanka ?
An honest answer would be â€œNo , not really ” .
But then as Kumar David says , â€ œWeep not for the People ; their mandate was the executioner ’s Certificate ” .
( May 23rd , Lakbima News ) Sri Lankans have failed Democracy .
The ball is lighter , the players are faster , the tactics are more complex .
And if you ’re a referee working the 2010 World Cup and you ca n’t keep up and be in the right position , you may blow the call , outraging the hundreds of millions of fans watching worldwide .
So officials working the games have to be quicker and fitter .
And it means they spend long days scouting the teams , just like opponents scout each other , so they can anticipate the action and make the right call .
“ Teams have a reputation for a style of play .
Players have certain tendencies , ” says Paul Tamberino , U.S. Soccer ’s director of referee development .
“ The referees need to know those going in , to know what to expect .
African teams are extremely speedy .
So you prepare your assistant referee ( who calls offsides ) to play the offside line .
Germany is good on free kicks in the offensive third and very good on head balls .
So you need to be ready for contact inside the penalty area . ”
For officials , the road to the World Cup is as competitive and demanding as it is for players .
Referee and assistant referee candidates have their fitness monitored monthly in the three years leading up to the Cup .
They meet with a psychologist who analyzes their game demeanor .
They attend seminars on the rules in an attempt to apply them equally across every continent where soccer is played .
They go online to a virtual classroom to discuss their doubts and concerns with instructors and colleagues .
Those components are part of FIFA ’s Refereeing Assistance Program , implemented in 2007 to improve officiating and respond to criticism .
Fifty - four trios of officials went into the program and had their performances at FIFA tournaments evaluated .
Thirty of them were chosen this February to work the World Cup .
“ Each referee has had to prove his ability out on the pitch , ” said José María García - Aranda , head of FIFA ’s Refereeing Department .
Referee controversy has long been a part of the World Cup .
In 1986 , a Tunisian refereeing his first Cup game — England against Argentina in the aftermath of the Falklands War — failed to notice the Argentine Diego Maradona punch a ball with his hand past a stunned English goalkeeper .
While the early games of the 2010 World Cup were without problems and analysts praised the refereeing , that ended with the match pitting the United States against Slovenia , a 2 - 2 tie .
Late in the game , a Mali referee , Kouman Coulibaly , working his first World Cup game disallowed a goal by U.S. player Maurice Edu .
The U.S. team complained that he refused to cite a reason for the decision , although later he said it was for a foul by Edu .
Replays showed no foul .
At the last World Cup , a Russian referee issued 16 yellow cards and 4 red cards , matching a record .
FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter said the referee should have given himself a yellow card for his poor performance , then backed off his remarks and apologized .
In another game , a British referee cautioned the same player three times before sending him off the pitch ( rules require a player to be ejected after two yellow cards ) .
He later retired from international - tournament refereeing , citing the error .
For the World Cup , trios of match officials are chosen as a team .
They are the referee on the field , who controls the game and calls fouls , and two assistant referees on the sidelines , who mainly call offsides and determine who gets possession after the ball goes out of bounds .
They have to prove their fitness on the pitch and in the lab .
Among the fitness tests are two showing whether referees can run with players , some half their age .
For the first test , a referee runs 40 meters six times .
Each of the six sprints needs to be completed in 6.2 seconds .
A second test requires a referee to run 150 meters in 30 seconds and then walk 50 meters in 35 seconds , then repeat the exercise 19 more times .
Assistant referees have less strict standards .
To track their fitness , referees constantly wear a watch that monitors their heart rates .
In the lab , a medical team in Zurich assessed each match official earlier this year .
Among the tests were a blood test , an orthopedic examination , a resting EKG , an echocardiogram and a stress test .
In late May , FIFA announced that 2 of the chosen 30 teams would not be officiating at the World Cup because an assistant referee in each team had failed the final fitness test .
FIFA says that because of the huge pressure on match officials , sports psychologists help each of them develop a personalized strategy to cope with it and prevent it from affecting their work and personal lives .
Instructors maintain close contact with match officials throughout the World Cup games to discuss any concerns .
Before games , match officials meet to discuss the problem players , the matchups , the coaching philosophies and the consequences of the game .
If a player is sent off early for a red card , will their team play for the tie or continue to attack because they need the point to move on to the next round ?
“ Referees have to be prepared , ” Tamberino says .
“ There ’s so many styles , so many tactics . ”
Tamberino , named the Major League Soccer referee of the year each year from 1998 to his retirement in 2001 , worked nine World Cup qualifying matches .
He says the two biggest changes in the game in the past decade are the increases in speed and technical ability .
“ Everything is geared to make the game faster and more exciting , not that it was n’t exciting ten years ago , ” he adds .
“ It puts more demands on referees . ”
Teams are more likely to move the ball quickly from the defensive third into the offensive end on the foot of a speedy attacker , making fitness imperative for referees , who may run seven to nine miles during a game , as much as a midfielder .
Players are also more likely to take a dive , fake being tackled .
“ The referee needs to be so close to see if it ’s a dive or it ’s really contact , ” Tamberino notes .
“ Everything rides on that one call . ”
Ultimately , for referees , it ’s a game of angles , just like so many other sports .
If the referee is in the right position with the right angle , he has a much better chance to make the right call .
As a referee , Tamberino believed in the players .
“ You want to contribute to the entertainment , ” he says .
“ You want to let the players exhibit their skills without over - calling the game for trifling offenses , as they say in the rule book .
You want to make it as enjoyable as possible for the spectators , minimize the whistles and encourage fair play . ”
For a long time , Tamberino ’s motto has been “ nothing dirty , nothing cheap . ”
“ We let you play hard and physical , but nothing dirty , nothing cheap , ” he adds .
“ That ’s a successful game to me . ”

Incumbent Republican Rick Perry holds an eight - point lead on Democratic challenger Bill White in the Texas governor ’s race with less than two weeks to go until Election Day
A new Rasmussen Reports telephone survey of Likely Voters in the Lone Star State finds Perry with 51 % support , while White , a former mayor of Houston , attracts 43 % of the vote .
Two percent ( 2 % ) like some other candidate in the contest , and five percent ( 5 % ) remain undecided .

Two weeks ago , Perry posted an 11 - point lead , 53 % to 42 % .
The new findings , while similar , are enough to move the race from Solid Republican to Leans Republican in the Rasmussen Reports Election 2010 Gubernatorial Scorecard .
Perry , who is seeking an unprecedented third full - term as governor , has led the race in each of 10 previous surveys dating back to early February .
In all the polling , Perry ’s support has stayed near the 50 % mark , ranging from a low of 47 % to a high of 53 % .

You have to imagine that in the headquarters of ESPN , the writing is on the wall as they see their World Cup and US Soccer grip sliding away .
Listen , I think that ESPN has done a good job with the 2010 World Cup , but with the following news coming out of US Soccer :
U.S. BID TO HOST FIFA WORLD CUPTM IN 2018 OR 2022 ANNOUNCES
FOX SOCCER CHANNEL AS OFFICIAL PARTNER
NEW YORK ( June 28 , 2010 ) - The USA Bid Committee today announced Fox Soccer Channel as an official partner in support of the organization 's efforts to bring the FIFA World CupTM to the United States in 2018 or 2022 .
" The challenge and privilege of hosting a FIFA World Cup is enormous , as we are seeing here in South Africa , " said Sunil Gulati , Chairman of the USA Bid Committee and President of U.S. Soccer .
" The same can be said for the bidding process .
Corporate support is an important component to a successful bid , and now we 're very fortunate to count Fox Soccer Channel as a friend and official partner of our endeavor to bring the FIFA World Cup to the United States in 2018 or 2022 . "
Fox Soccer Channel and its associated platforms , Fox Soccer Plus and Foxsoccer.com , will begin a series of corporate sponsorship announcements for the U.S. bid in the coming weeks .
Fox Soccer Channel is an American multi-platform sports network showcasing the most comprehensive world - class soccer programming in the United States throughout the year .
Fox Soccer Channel programming is dedicated to global soccer , and holds exclusive rights to key properties such as UEFA Champions League , England 's Barclays Premier League , Italy 's Serie A , the CONCACAF Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup .
It also carries a full slate of Major League Soccer , Women 's Professional Soccer , NCAA Division I men's and women 's soccer matches in the United States and is the Official Broadcast Partner of United States Youth Soccer Association .
" As the leading source for soccer programming and information in the United States , Fox Soccer Channel , Fox Soccer Plus and Foxsoccer.com is proud to join forces with the USA Bid Committee as a corporate sponsor to bring the most important event in soccer to the United States , " said David Nathanson , General Manager of Fox Soccer Channel .
" We are committed to using all of our resources to be a driving force behind support for the USA Bid . "
You have to believe this is an early commitment by FSC and Fox in general to gain a much closer relationship with US Soccer , I also have to believe this might just be the wakeup call for ESPN that a commitment to soccer is more than jumping on the bandwagon every 4 years .
I said before that I thought that ESPN pushing MLS to have midweek matches ( which hurt the local teams ) was wrong , their only wanting to show a limited number of teams ( LA , Seattle , DC , and now Philly ) in a majority of their broadcasts is wrong .
Now ESPN sit on the edge of losing the biggest soccer show on the planet to Fox .
I say this is a great move by US Soccer and by Fox , I still hold out hope that the US could host in 2018 but it is more and more likely that it would be 2022 and as you will here in the upcoming day , that 2022 should be a real focal point for soccer in the United States .

Awesome stuff , dude !
Hellion and Tank should be implemented by Blizzard asap without second thoughts , imho .
Especially hellion , cause current in - game version is just frustrating crap .
I also found out couple days ago that 's not " attacking after decelerating " that ruins micro as some of us thought .
It 's just for some only for Blizzard known reason they put arbitrary pre-attack delay into every fucking single unit except , like , zealot and mutalisk ?
" Point Damage " it 's called or something like that .
I bet you removed that from the units you modified , sluggaslamoo , right ?
Is there any sane reason for thing to be in the game , wtf .

If they even half implemented some of these features , after dealing with the balance problems , the skill ceiling would increase dramatically .
They wo n't though , but just saying .

You think they are that stupid that they cant make units stack ..
They do things for a reason .
Or people saying " thats not what we meant by moving shot .. lol blizzard is stupid " ..
What makes you think they have to exactly replicate what some guy says on some forum ..

I changed every variable to 0 with the word delay in it or related to delay , and i think mucked around with other random things like fidget to see if it made any difference .
The biggest problem is lack of documentation right now .
Its actually some flag changes and borrowing physics from units that naturally have micro capability ( typically air ) but for some reason have delays or flags set which prevent this .
For example for muta micro you allow " attacking while moving " but then also having " only fire while attacking " does most of the work .
Then you just have to get rid of delays and tweak other things .
Other units are harder , for example the hellion I do n't think natively supports attacking while moving .
Even if you set the flag , it only works mothership / patch11 phoenix style , which is not what we want .
So I duplicated the mutalisk and replaced all the variables and it worked perfectly .
This is the same for the tank , but I figured hold - position is good enough for the tank .

after reading some of their change explanations in patch 11 i came to the conclusion they might not know what we are talking about .

air should now be allowed to stack and patrol micro
you can select more than 12 units you know .. how imba would that be http://www.twitch.tv/czelpredy

Great work man .
This is how it should be done .
Microing hellion is very smooth and the other units also look nice .
Hellion is such a lame unit right now , like a lame ground version of valkyrie .
It would be nice if you tweaked Carriers so they can stack together and be a viable option in the game , because right now they are crap also .
Blizzard what were you thinking ( drinking ) when coding the game ?
Come on !
You can do better !
gogogadgetflow Profile Joined March 2010 United States 2583 Posts # 20 I think the air units should spread out very quickly when not being given commands as a balancing factor and so that their power is truly proportional to player skill and attention .
I 'm sure you can do this / I 'm sure blizz can do this .

" We were put together in a line early this year .
Even in exhibitions , they put us together and we kind of just clicked and had some chemistry right from the start . " -- Ryan Johansen
There 's a good possibility four of their players -- center Ryan Johansen , right wing Nino Niederreiter , left wing Brad Ross and defenseman Troy Rutkowski -- may be taken in the top 50 , and five , including defenseman Taylor Aronson , in the top 100 .
In the two years since Calgary businessman Bill Gallacher purchased the Winterhawks , they have gone through an amazing transformation .
Under coach Mike Johnston , who served as an assistant coach in the NHL for eight years , the Winterhawks won 25 more games and had 48 more points than last season .
They had their best regular season since 1997 - 98 and won their first playoff series since 2006 .
A big reason for that success was the great play of the line of Johansen , Niederreiter and Ross .
They also comprised the team 's top power - play unit , which was quarterbacked by Rutkowski .
Johansen is a tall , rangy 6 - foot - 2 and 180 pounds .
He had 69 points in 71 games , tying for second among WHL rookies .
Johansen is the No. 10 North American skater in Central Scouting 's final rankings , up six places from January 's midseason report .
" He has good on - ice vision and also angles well on the forecheck , " said B.J. MacDonald , who covers the WHL for Central Scouting .
" He has the intelligence to play power play as well as penalty kill .
He can be shifty and has the ability to beat a defenseman one - on - one .
Once he fills out and gains more strength , he could turn raw talent into a valuable center at both ends of rink .
He has displayed nice playmaking capabilities and this should continue at the next level .
" Niederreiter , 6 - 1 and 201 pounds , had a team - leading 36 goals , second among WHL rookies , and 60 points .
He was the first Winterhawk since 2005 to score more than 30 goals and he was named to the league 's Second All - Star team .
Niederreiter led the Winterhawks with 8 goals in the playoffs .
He 's No. 12 among North American skaters on Central Scouting 's list , up two places from midseason .
He also led Switzerland to the semifinal of the 2010 World Junior Championship and was named to the tournament All - Star Team .
His glove - tossing , one - handed goal in the breakaway contest during the skills competition at the CHL / NHL Top Prospect Game in January remains must - see viewing .
" He 's been tremendous in Portland , " a scout for an Eastern Conference team told NHL.com at the World Juniors .
" He 's one of the first Swiss kids that you 've been able to see here come in and combine his skill with the physical part of the game which usually you do n't get from the Swiss . …
Lot of these games they ( Switzerland ) do n't have the puck that much , the other team does , so he's had to do other things and he 's shown that he 's willing to pay the price .
" Ross , 6 - foot and 175 pounds , is ranked 59th , up 10 places from midseason , after totaling 27 goals , 68 points and a league - leading 203 penalty minutes .
" He 's responsible at both ends of the rink , very good hustle , and he blends feistiness with good hockey skills , " said MacDonald .
" He has the discipline and smarts of not putting his team in penalty problems .
He plays bigger than his size and shows good discipline at this early age , so he should be able to continue and have success at the next level .
I like his tenacity and positional play I think he is a better all - round hockey player than people give him credit for .
" Ross and Johansen will join Winterhawks captain Brett Ponich , a defenseman taken in the second round of the 2009 draft by the St. Louis Blues , at Hockey Canada 's summer junior evaluation camp , to be held in August in Saint John , Nfld .
Rutkowski , 6 - 2 and 208 pounds , is No. 44 on Central Scouting 's list after totaling 12 goals and 43 points .
" He has worked hard through the course of the season on fitness and his all - round defensive game , " said MacDonald .
" He has good offensive instincts , which is hard to teach .
He knows when to jump up in the play to make an odd - man situation , which is a huge plus .
He can be taught better defense as he matures .
He has good size so he will learn to be stronger in his own zone , and his containment is improving .
I think he is a smart enough player to realize he can balance both facets of game to be successful at the next level .
" Aronson , 6 - foot and 196 pounds , moved up two places to No. 88 after a season that saw him finish with 5 goals and 25 assists .
It 's not surprising those players moved up during the second half of the season .
Johnston said he began to realize his players ' potential about 20 games into the season and then made a series of trades to get stronger in goal and to give his 18 - year - olds more ice time .
"
We were put together in a line early this year .
Even in exhibitions , they put us together and we kind of just clicked and had some chemistry right from the start , " Johansen said .
" We kept having success throughout the year and we all had a great year and had a lot of fun doing it .
They 're two fun players to play with all the time .
Nino puts the puck in the net if he has a good scoring chance , so my job was to get him the puck .
Ross has great skills but he 's more of a speedster , an agitator , and a crash - and - banger .
So it was a very fun year .
" Niederreiter could become the highest - drafted Swiss player ever , ahead of Michel Riesen , who the Edmonton Oilers took at No. 14 in 1997 .
Riesen played only 12 games for Edmonton in 2000 - 01 .
" We worked perfect together , " Niederreiter said .
" Ryan Johansen was our playmaker .
He did a great job this season .
Brad Ross was our grinder and hard worker in the offensive zone .
I just tried to be the scorer on this line and I think we worked perfect together .
" Ross is all business .
When he told that it 's rare to see a player get more penalty minutes ( 203 ) than his weight ( 175 ) , he just nodded .
"
The physical play is one of the key elements of my game , " he said .
" I like to agitate out there .
I 'm not really scared of anybody .
I try to protect Nino and Johansen out there , but they can hold their own , too .
" I usually try to get in there first and bang bodies with my physical play to give Ryan a little more space .
It 's pretty easy because if you give him the puck , it 's going to be in the back of the net nine out of 10 times .
" Rutkowski tries to model his game after Mike Green and Drew Doughty .
He enjoys being a quarterback on the power play , and enjoyed playing with Ross , Johansen and Niederreiter .
" That line 's good .
We had a great success with Ryan and we had a full power - play line , " Rutkowski said .
" We had a solid power - play line there with all draft - eligibles .
We 've had a whole line that works as one unit .
Ross creates space , Ryan gets the puck to Nino .
Nino can finish .
Actually , all three of them can finish .
So , yeah , it 's been really good to play with them .
" Aronson , a native of Placentia , Calif. , who grew up seven miles from the Honda Center in Anaheim and played for the Los Angeles Junior Kings , was a first - round draft pick in the USHL last year but instead chose Portland , citing the opportunity to play for Johnston .

Australia 's biotechnology industry is warning a court challenge against the patenting of human genetic material could kill off investment in the industry .
Lawyers have begun legal action against four biotechnology companies , which co-own the patent to a gene known as BRCA1 , linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer .
They say companies should not have the right to commercialise the human body .
But representatives of the biotechnology industry say the landmark legal case could stifle innovation and investment in important medical research .
The action is brought by the law firm Maurice Blackburn , Cancer Voice Australia and a Brisbane woman with breast cancer , Yvonne D'Arcy .
They will argue that it is wrong for private company to have patents over human genetic material .
" The narrow legal issue is that human genetic material is not patentable because patent law is intended to cover inventions not discoveries , " the principal lawyer on the case , Rebecca Gilsenan , said .
The action against four biotechnology companies focuses on BRCA1 , but Ms Gilsenan says the case will have implications for thousands of patents granted on genetic material .
" In patent law , what has been happening in Australia for many years now is that IP Australia has been granting these patents over isolated genetic material and an Australian court has never been asked to rule on or to clarify the lawfulness of this practice , and so that 's why this case is groundbreaking , " she said .
One of the four companies is Melbourne - based Genetic Technologies Limited ( GTL ) , which holds the exclusive licence of the patent in Australia .
GTL 's chief executive officer Paul MacLeman says they are acting well within their legal rights .
" We 're just a small Australian biotech , we employ about 80 people , we 're just seeking to get on with our business and part of that ... is just playing by the rules as they stand right now , " he said .
" If the powers that be wish to change those rules we 'll play by the new rules . "
Dr MacLeman is concerned that removing patents will have a detrimental impact on investment in the industry .
" Without the protection of a patent , there 's no incentive for anybody to develop a commercial product and while these institutes in the various places around Australia are offering the BRCA test , they would n't be in a position to do so had it not already been commercially developed in the US , " he said .
Similar concerns are held by the chief executive of BioMelbourne Network , Michelle Gallaher .
" If the case goes through and we 're no longer able to patent genes , it throws into question a lot of research and development that may be halted along the pipeline , " she said .
" Biotech companies are not going to invest heavily in developing some of these tests if they do n't have some degree of the potential for a return on their investment by getting a product to the market and having a degree of monopoly for some period of time . "
But patent expert law expert Professor Luigi Palombi , from the Australian National University , rejects the claims that removing patents will have a detrimental impact .
" I think it will have the reverse effect , because what it 's going to do if we get the decision we want - which is to get rid of patents on genes - what it will do is free up those sorts of materials for use in new and inventive ways , " he said .
" We want the biotechnology sector to focus on inventions which will use genes to deliver better diagnostics , better treatments and better cures - well , cure , period .
" That 's not going to happen if we 're locking up raw fundamental data of the human genome in patents .
It just wo n't happen . "
A Senate Committee inquiry into gene patents is still underway .
It was supposed to report back later this month , but the Committee chair , Greens Senator Rachel Siewert , says that time frame will now be extended .
" We have already discussed extending our reporting date because of the need for further information and the issues that the court case in America rises and obviously there 's now the Australian court case , " she said .
" So we will be asking the Senate , because it 's not up to us - we have to ask the Senate to extend our reporting date . "
Senator Siewert says she is hoping to report within several months .
This would have been more apropos during the health care debate , but it actually applies to almost every modern issue , including the environment ( global warming , pollution , energy ) , gay rights , and immigration .

Here we present an example where Go's interfaces made it easy to refactor some existing code to make it more flexible and extensible .
Originally , the standard library 's RPC package used a custom wire format called gob .
For a particular application , we wanted to use JSON as an alternate wire format .
We first defined a pair of interfaces to describe the functionality of the existing wire format , one for the client , and one for the server ( depicted below ) .
type ServerCodec interface { ReadRequestHeader(* Request ) error ReadRequestBody ( interface{} ) error WriteResponse(* Response , interface{} ) error Close ( ) error }
On the server side , we then changed two internal function signatures to accept the ServerCodec interface instead of our existing gob .
Encoder .
Here 's one of them :
func sendResponse ( sending * sync .
Mutex , req * Request , reply interface{} , enc * gob.
Encoder , errmsg string )
became
func sendResponse ( sending * sync.
Mutex , req * Request , reply interface{} , enc ServerCodec , errmsg string )
We then wrote a trivial gobServerCodec wrapper to reproduce the original functionality .
From there it is simple to build a jsonServerCodec .
After some similar changes to the client side , this was the full extent of the work we needed to do on the RPC package .
This whole exercise took about 20 minutes !
After tidying up and testing the new code , the final changeset was submitted .
In an inheritance - oriented language like Java or C++ , the obvious path would be to generalize the RPC class , and create JsonRPC and GobRPC subclasses .
However , this approach becomes tricky if you want to make a further generalization orthogonal to that hierarchy .
( For example , if you were to implement an alternate RPC standard ) .
In our Go package , we took a route that is both conceptually simpler and requires less code be written or changed .
A vital quality for any codebase is maintainability .
As needs change , it is essential to adapt your code easily and cleanly , lest it become unwieldy to work with .
We believe Go's lightweight , composition - oriented type system provides a means of structuring code that scales .
Someone at Apple really does n’t like caricatures .
Pulitzer Prize - winning cartoonist Mark Fiore is just one of the artists over the past year to create or contribute work to an iPhone app — only to see it rejected as “ obscene , pornographic , or defamatory . ”
And yet , with enough bad press on the matter , Cupertino seems willing to change its stance .
According to The Wall Street Journal , Fiore received a call on Thursday from an Apple representative suggesting that he resubmit NewsToons , a series of political spoof animations he had collected into an iPhone app .
Apple rejected the app back in December 2009 , but news of the rejection only came to light this week in an interview Fiore gave when he won a Pulitzer Prize .
That interview includes the rejection notice Fiore received from Apple , in which the company tells him that apps “ may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , sounds , etc. ) that in Apple ’s reasonable judgement [ sic ] may be found objectionable , for example , materials that may be considered obscene , pornographic , or defamatory . ”
A media storm followed Fiore ’s revelation , building upon previous app store rejections , with some accusing Apple of extending its reach too far into the realm of editorial rejections .
Tom Richmond , an editorial cartoonist , caricature artist , and illustrator for MAD Magazine , on Friday posted the following to his blog :
Mark ’s story is striking a bit more serious chord than Apple just being overly Draconian in their app approvals .
With the introduction of the iPad , the focus of content for these devices moves out of the convenience of having a few apps in your pocket and into the promised land of a media delivery / consumption device …
Apps for publications and newspaper content wo n’t be very useful if it only lets us see stuff that Apple and Steve Jobs thinks we should see , and rejects things they do n’t like . ”
Richmond had similar issues last year when artwork he contributed to an iPhone app called Bobble Rep got rejected for much the same reason that Fiore ’s app was blocked .
The program was approved a few days later after his rant on the matter was picked up by several major news outlets .
As for Fiore ?
“ I feel kind of guilty , ” he said in an interview , in regards to Apple ’s phone call .
“ I ’m getting preferential treatment because I got the Pulitzer . ”
However , according to the Journal , that wo n’t stop him from most likely resubmitting the app in the future .
Sure , Apple may not want to venture into the realm of pornography on the App Store , but at the same time , there are inherent dangers when moving beyond the technical aspects of an application and into editorial content .
Hopefully these initial stumbling blocks will serve as warnings to the company , not encouragement .
I 've often made the statement that if the phone rings after midnight , it is rarely good news .
A phone call at 1:26 this morning proved out that point .
Martha Grimes of New Haven Connecticut called to inform me of the passing of her mother , Ms. Alice Kensington .
Alice was and always will be a dear friend .
She taught me more about life in a few dear months than I had learned in a lifetime and I will miss her .
I will miss her to tears .
What follows is a story about Alice I wrote in 2006 , published in the now - offline Lobby4 Linux.com website .
I am reprinting this for those who may not have read it and to spend some personal time in remembering Alice .
Many of the provided links are in archive so they take a bit to load .
I 've attempted to remove the ones that show " not available " and apologize for not supplying them here .
Aarrr me Maties , and what treasures has their spilled blood bestowed upon our scurvy husks ?…. aarrr .
Editor 's note - Kelly Clarkson was the winner of American
Idol and was " voted " the winner by public opinion . "
No , I am not going to tell you her real name .
She is a criminal now and I made her so .
86 years of lawful living , survived without so much as a speeding ticket .
Her now - blemished essence is the foulest of stain on my duplicitous hands .
She hastily uses her internet connection to research South American countries and their extradition laws as they apply to the United States .
She has calculated the penalties and withdrawn substantial amounts of her retirement fund and hastily written goodbye letters to her children .
At least the ones that are n’t yet dead .
Two ex-husbands will grope for answers and friends will wonder for years ..... She must flee under the cover of night .
Visions of swirling fog and Stoic good - byes … plane engines roaring in the background of the Casablanca airfield clutter her thoughts .
No , she cannot afford melodramatic fantasies … she must plan , she must escape those worse than the Gestapo .
Ruthless men , those who consider the KGB as pariah … it is these men that stalk her .
She does a final check of her belongings as she drags them to the door and then to the awaiting cab .
Her frail frame is soaked as the rain falls through the blackest of nights .
They must not capture her , no…it is not an option .
She would rather die , have her heart stop in mid-beat before she would give herself over to them ….
she shudders as she dares even to think their name .
The RIAA .
One of the truly extraordinary experiences in my “ career ” as a Linux Advocate , has been donating my time to our senior citizens .
In a nutshell , myself and two other volunteers visit Senior Citizen Assisted Living Centers and help them with their computer problems .
It was during one of these visits that I met “ Alice .
” Alice is not your typical 86 year old Great Grandmother .
Her demeanor is as salty as her language , and regardless of your age , those of thin skin do not fare well around her .
It seems to me that she can sniff a “ sensitive soul ” out like a barn cat finds mice …
I am beginning to think the mice fare much better .
She has no patience with indecisive or soft - spoken people .
I knew it was Alice immediately upon answering the phone .
I answered it without checking the caller ID .
“ Hello . ” “ Yeah , you got the first part of it right , cause if you do n’t help me fix this G** computer , there ’s going to be hell to pay .
” I laughed and was sincerely glad to hear her voice .
“ Well , hello Alice , Just what have you broken now ?
” Her laughter did n’t sound like an old woman’s .
“ It ’s not mine that 's screwed up …
It ’s Betty ’s and the G** CD wo n’t play .
” I thought quickly about the citizens at this particular center .
Ah , THAT Betty … I remembered now .
She was one of the only ones that would not let us put PCLinuxOS on her computer .
She liked her Windows XP , and even had a legitimate copy of it .
You do n’t argue with someone that was welding rivets into a World War II bomber before you were born .
You do as they ask .
I reformatted her hard drive and did indeed reinstall Windows XP on her machine , as much as it chapped my backside .
I heard her voice through the cupped bottom half of her cell phone .
“ I said I would take care of it , just shut up and give me a chance to talk to the man .
” I could hear a further - muffled voice on the other end and it was Betty asking Alice something .
“ No , he ’s not the fat one , he ’s the bald one with the round glasses .
You ’re thinking of the air conditioning guy . ”
She uncupped the phone and spoke to me .
“ God , if I get that simple when I ’m old Kenny , just put one between my eyes , would you …and do n’t miss , my luck , I would end up being a one - eyed obnoxious old lady .
Now , are you coming over here to fix this computer ?
” My schedule is fairly full , trying to raise funds for a trip to Washington DC and work two regular jobs .
Still , telling Alice no is akin to kicking a grizzly bear in the butt .
I cleared my throat and tried to inject an alternative choice .
“ Tell me Alice , what is it doing … I mean , instead of playing the CD , what is it doing ?
” “ Betty , move your butt and let me in there . ”
I could visualize the transaction in space management taking place in the cramped workspace the residents had to call their “ computing center . ”
“ OK , I ’m putting the disk in …right now , and ….. ”
She waited for the dialog box to appear on her screen .
“ Alright , up to now , it acts right , but watch this . ”
She spoke to me as if I were sitting next to her .
“ Bam … there it is !
” “ There is what Alice ?
” “ The friggin ’ problem Kenny … here is the problem . ”
She was impatient with my inability to keep up with her .
“ It is telling me I am attempting to play the CD in an unauthorized media .
” I understood immediately .
I sat down at my computer and pulled up Firefox .
“ Alice , do you have the CD case right there in front of you ?
” “ Well , yeah … where else would it be ?
You think she carries it around in a napkin ?
” I laughed at her spontaneity .
“ No Alice , a ziplock bag maybe , but not a napkin . ” “ So what ’s the problem here ?
What ’s so unauthorized about this media .
And what is a media anyway .
do they mean the computer ?
I put her question aside for a moment to ask another .
“ Who is the artist on the CD Alice , who is singing .
” Alice answered without hesitation .
“ Kelly Clarkson , my daughter made this cd for Betty and when she came to visit last weekend she brought it with her so I could give it to Betty the next time I … ” “ You mean it ’s a home - made CD , it was n’t bought out of a store ? ” I typed “ Kelly Clarkson ” and “ label ” in the searchbar and had my answer in the first hit .
“ No you putz , I told you my daughter made it for Betty .
You think my daughter works at the recording studio or something ?
” I smiled again at Alice 's ' demeanor .
I really wish you could meet her .
“ OK , the “ media ” the message is talking about is your cd player in the computer … not the computer itself .
See , Kelly Clarkson is contracted with RCA Records , which is a subsidiary of Sony - BMG … now I need you to pay attention here …
” I spent the next 10 minutes explaining to Alice about DRM and what it is doing to people who legitimately purchase music .
It seems that the DRM ’ed CD allowed itself to be “ ripped ” but when the copy of the CD was attempted to play in MP3 format , the DRM kicked in , and the “ screw you ” message , as Alice refers to it , appeared on the screen .
Alice listened without interupting .
I could hear her scribbling furiously as I spoke but she never stopped me to repeat something or clarify a point .
When I finished and was sure I had covered the entire issue , only then did she speak .
“ And to think I voted for that ungrateful little b****.
If I knew where to find her , I ’d rip those tight jeans off her and ram this disk up her … ”
“ No Alice … no … maybe I was n’t clear .
Many of the artists do n’t like DRM on their recordings .
They know it ’s going to kill their sales eventually .
It ’s the RIAA and Microsoft who makes all the money off of DRM , not the artists . ”
I could again hear Alice ’s pen scratching against the paper on the desk .
“ So what do we do about this friggin ’ disk ?
Are we just s***- out - of - luck Kenny ?
” I thought for a long moment then told her that she had an alternative .
Then
It struck me as funny .
“ I say something funny computer - boy ? ”
The amusement in Alice ’s voice was obvious .
“ No Alice , you did n’t .
It just occurred to me that I am going to tell you to use the means that DRM is supposed to stop . ”
And it is funny if you spend a moment thinking about it .
In the first place , I told her that the disk would play fine on a Linux System … that the DRM coding on the disk was made for Windows systems and that a Linux Machine would simply ignore the code that told it not to play .
I went on to tell Alice about Frostwire and Shareaza .
In short , I turned a 86 year old Marlboro - smoking , Chrysler Sebring Convertable - driving , Pinochole - playing , Maroon - Five listening Great Grandmother into a music pirate .
An enthusiastic one at that .
I should be ashamed of myself .
I ’m not , but at least I have morals enough to know I should .
She had her unencumbered Kelly Clarkson music in less than 10 minutes .
This is where the story should end , but it does n’t .
As I promised to do , I stopped by Alice ’s apartment on my way home from work that weekend .
She was so excited to see me , she could n’t tell me things fast enough .
I will spare you the dialog , it went something like this .
Alice knew from my warnings that downloading music via P2P was not only illegal , it was dangerous .
I told her about the RIAA monitoring and the thousands of lawsuits the RIAA had initiated and won over the past two years .
Alice had something for their asses .
She sat me down at her computer and pulled up GTK - Gnutella…her seemingly favorite weapon of choice .
She also showed me her installation of PeerGuardian .
It was with great pride she demonstrated her knowledge of how to update the IP blockList and incorporate it into the program .
As amazed as I was , I had n’t seen anything yet .
She opened konqueror and dropped down her Menu of Networked Folders .
I came close to falling out of my chair .
Listed among the Local Network and Samba Shares were icons like “ Jakesbeliever and NadKnocker .
( do n’t ask me what a “ NadKnocker ” is … I do n’t wanna know . )
Since every 8 apartments shared the same router , Alice had not only showed her new “ partners in crime ” how to use Frostwire , Shareaza and GTK - Gnutella … she had also formed “ hubs ” with the different router clusters for individual networks .
I moused and clicked my way thru some of the offerings .
I found one titled “ If you do n’t want to be disappointed in me , do n’t look . ”
In all , 24 of the residents at this Center were now officially “ Music Pirates .
” I was speechless .
I remember the first day I came there and helped these poor souls with their busted - up Windows machines … and then I look and see what has evolved since then .
I really should be ashamed of myself … I really should .
But I ’m not …in fact , I think its a riot that the very thing DRM was supposed to curtail , it made flourish and flourish without consequence .
Go figure .
All - Righty
Then ...
Sacred Antidotes An Interview with Terence Mckenna
Born in 1946 , author and explorer Terence McKenna has spent the past twenty - five years in the study of the ontological foundations of shamanism and the ethnopharmacology of spiritual transformation .
he graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a distributed major in ecology , resource conservation , and shamanism , and then traveled extensively in the Asian and New World tropics , specializing in the shamanism and ethnomedicine of the Amazon Basin .
His latest book , True Hallucinations ( HarperSanFrancisco ) , is a narrative of spiritual adventure in the jungles of the Colombian Amazon .
McKenna currently lives in Hawaii , where he divides his time between writing and lecturing .
This interview was conducted for Tricycle by Allan Hunt Badiner in April 1996 in Big Sur , California
Here are some observations of different underlying philosophies of Wikipedia which may underlie conflicts .
People with different views on these spectra may be stuck in a conflict which is actually a meta - conflict .
Please feel free to add comments or content to this page .
How strict should the notability requirements be ?
The words deletionism and inclusionism are sometimes also used about whether content should be deleted because of poor quality ; see section about eventualism vs. immediatism .
Should the focus be on having usefulness and reliability now , or more freedom of editing in order to have better articles later ?
The key is to make Wikipedia a useful and reliable Internet resource as of now .
Any edit which is problematic should be reverted on sight ; there is no time to fix it while live .
New ideas for changes should be developed in a sandbox .
Moderate immediatism [ edit ]
Articles should be in as good condition as possible when they are live .
Dispute notices should be avoided unless there 's no clear " right " version to post in interim .
Removing poor writing and unbalanced coverage is appropriate .
Cleaning it up would be too tricky and take too long .
Sandboxes are most geared towards proposed major edits .
Moderate eventualism [ edit ]
It is worth maintaining articles in good condition , but not to the extent it would stymie their organic growth through the Wiki process .
Content should only be removed if it is unsalvageable or at least hard to salvage .
Poor and biased writing should be addressed , but unless there is no content should not simply be erased .
The process of free , continuous editing will in the long run make articles better and better .
Only vandalism should be reverted .
Anyone who makes an edit has something to say which should be respected .
Poor and biased writing and misinformation will be corrected in due time .
Relax .
Article raters [ edit ]
Articles with higher ratings ( e.g. , Featured Article status ) should be treated with more immediatism than those with lower ratings .
Statusquoism [ edit ]
Extreme statusquoism [ edit ]
An article should not be altered in any potentially controversial way without prior justification .
The removal of controversial content , say pending fact - checking or discussion , should be reverted until justified in Talk and agreed upon .
of controversial content , say pending fact - checking or discussion , should be reverted until justified in Talk and agreed upon .
The burden of proof is on anyone who wants to make a change .
Unless they 're reverting .
Moderate statusquoism [ edit ]
The state an article has been in for some length of time is the benchmark .
Edits which add controversial material should be reverted until justified in Talk .
Moderate anti-statusquoism [ edit ]
Edits should not be reverted unless they are truly just troublesome .
Poor writing is not a problem ; later editors will fix it .
If an edit is so controversial that it should be reverted , an explanation should be given on Talk so the author can respond .
Extreme anti-statusquoism [ edit ]
Edits should not be reverted unless they are basically vandalism .
Poor writing , biased coverage , and questionable information is no problem ; in time , later editors will fix this up .
Similar to eventualism .
Communityism and Encyclopedyism [ edit ]
Communityism [ edit ]
Wikipedia should be made a welcoming place for newcomers who wish to participate .
Actions which might be seen as rude and disrespectful to others should be avoided , even if avoiding them temporarily negatively affects the content .
Personal attacks should not be tolerated .
A community is about finding ways to live together , not about homogeneity .
Encyclopedyism [ edit ]
The sole purpose of Wikipedia is to build an encyclopedia ; social interaction is a byproduct which should not compromise this goal .
Treating people respectfully and being nice to newbies is desirable inasmuch as it encourages contributions and diversity of opinions , and avoids groupthink .
Personal attacks are not always a big deal .
Just ignore petty ones and do your job .
Remember ; if someone reverts one of your edits , assume good faith and be respectful .
Authorism vs. Communalism [ edit ]
Authorism [ edit ]
Articles , or sections of article , often have a distinguished " main author " who is primarily the writer of the article .
The original author should be regarded as having more clout than others in how it should be organized and flow .
While major changes by non-authors should require justification , the original author should feel entitled to reorganize his / her own prose .
An article may require inquiry as to " original intent " from the author before changes are made .
Communalism [ edit ]
There is no author for articles .
Although one person may seed an article , each one is a community effort .
Once an article text has been submitted , the submitter has no special privileges vis -a - vis future edits to that text .
future edits to that text .
There is no " original intent " other than what is in the text and perhaps notes on the discussion page .
Sysopism vs. Rehabilism vs. Politicism [ edit ]
Sysopism [ edit ]
Trolls and other problem users should be banned and done with .
A former troll has a lot to prove if he / she wants to ever be allowed to contribute again .
Do n't feed the trolls .
Rehabilism [ edit ]
Every editor , even a vandal , is a potential contributor .
Every opportunity should be extended for a former troll to rehabilitate themselves .

The cost of fighting a troll is higher than fixing whatever trouble they cause .
Politicism [ edit ]
" Troll " and " problem user " are factionally defined terms at best .
One person 's valuable editor is another one 's POV - pusher .
As Wikipedia becomes more and more influential , we can expect constantly renewing political disputes : this simply can't be avoided without undermining Wikipedia 's claim to neutrality .
Engage users in conflict by using the political virtues , and assess behavior by these standards .
Try to find " troll bridges " where opposing factions can work together .
Be troll - friendly .
WikiPacifism [ edit ]
Edit wars are considered harmful .
They are also childish and pointless .
Edit wars poison the page history , flood recent changes , and disrupt other editors .
A user who finds his / her edits reverted by the same user persistently should walk away and let others handle the situation — they will decide what edits were more suitable for the page .
WikiWarrior [ edit ]
Wikipedia is a battlefield of ideas ; edit wars are part of the editorial process .
The damage from a war now and then is minimal and greatly overstated .
Repeatedly reverting a damaging edit is wholly appropriate .
Adminship [ edit ]
Adminship is " no important thing "
All users in good standing who demonstrate a minimal familiarity with the Wikipedia culture should become Administrators .
Adminship is an important duty Admins are the visible face of Wikipedia .
Only the most qualified Wikipedians should be Administrators , and they must obey the highest of standards .
Admins are janitors : adminship is just another job
The majority of work an Admin needs to do has no reflection on experience or ethical standards .
Expecting them to follow any special standards — except for misuse of their privileges — demonstrates a misunderstanding of their role .
Neutrality [ edit ]
Basic skill [ edit ]
Cultivating the habit of always writing from a NPOV in all wikipedia editing is a skill that is not difficult to acquire .
NPOV editing does not ever substantially conflict with other editing goals , and should never be compromised .
Provided all the relevant facts are available , it is not difficult to tell if writing is POV .
Elusive virtue [ edit ]
Composing NPOV text on contentious texts can be deeply difficult , requiring introspection and testing one 's honesty with oneself .
Writing from a NPOV stance can conflict fundamentally with comprehensiveness , conciseness and freshness of writing , and , though of great value , sometimes it is best sacrificed to promote other editing good .
Facts can only be grasped from a POV ; everyone has blindspots with respect to their own prejudices .
Unattainable absolute [ edit ]
A neutral point of view requires omniscience and omnipresence .
No one has that .
The comprehensive whole of all Wikipedia can be said to approach a neutral point of view as it becomes more comprehensive and includes more factual information .
A single entry can only be said to have a neutral point of view assuming the limitations of the subject ( which is not a neutral act ) .
" NPOV " as used on Wikipedia does not mean " neutral point of view " .
It 's shorthand for a particular style of writing which avoids authoritative statements and is highly contextual , particularly temporally .
" NPOV " writing often ages poorly .
Factions , advocacy and suppression [ edit ]
The conflict - driven view of wiki , e.g. battlefield of ideas , emphasizes that most of explicit knowledge arises from a need to deal with multiple points of view and compromise .
The epistemology of this view is quite similar to the Buddhist view of language : words are just indicators of conflicts , since if no conflict existed , there would be no need to speak .
People living in developed nations with representative democracy also expect power structures to be transparent , regularly audited , and ( most relevant ) composed of people visibly associated in political parties who take collective responsibility for actions , even when no individual responsibility would be possible or meaningful .
All that aside , many people would like to believe that politics has no place in encyclopedia work , and that an editorial process can be so perfect a bureaucracy as not to need factions .
This view may be more prevalent in countries that have a Supreme Court and written constitutions , which are also increasingly common in democracies .
Like - minded people naturally form groups ; attempting to prevent this from happening is silly ; multiple points of view are inevitable even if everyone considers themselves part of a single " community " .
Conflicts between groups can produce productive change and new ideas ; having rules for this prevents suppressionism .
The expertise to evaluate specific claims about the views of specific groups , e.g. Marxist economists or Islamist politicians who run in elections , will reside usually in those groups and so some form of collective credential system is needed to let factions review views that are associated with that faction .
The ruling clique or power structure is just one of many explicit factions , and if its actions or positions can be compared to those taken or advocated by other factions , this aids transparency and trust in the system as a whole .
Representative democracy is the best example : the ruling clique is a party like any other with explicit opposition and critics .
Wikipedia is a collection of all human knowlege , therefore , everyone 's opinion matters .
Factions are merely social groups , they do not have any standing in how much authority any one person has .
Joining a faction is something to do just ... for fun .
If you like Macintosh , join this faction .
If you like Windows , join this one .
If you like Linux , join this one .
Something productive may even come of every Wikipedian joining a faction .
For example , as long as an edit war does n't occur , a Macintosh faction could make some new Mac pages with a non-NPOV , And a Windows faction could come along and fix it to have a NPOV .
The Mac faction respects the fact that everyone has an opinion , and leaves the changes that the other faction made to the Macintosh articles .
If indeed a disagreement does occur , a healthy debate may help , as long as it's not a conflict .
Conflict is not good for the overall health of Wikipedia , and therefore should be avoided .
Every Wikipedian has their own opinion and this should be respected .
This eventually leads to Wikipedia being a true collection of all human knowledge without any information being biased towards a side and everyone is included in editing and revising of articles .
It is better to view ideas as a spectrum or conceptual space than a rigidly defined set ; ideas are ' near ' or ' far ' rather than ' in ' or ' out ' .
Factions are prone to groupthink and lead to suppressionism of the ' losing ' factions .
Conflicts between factions are often unnecessary and counterproductive .
A ruling clique 's activities can be confined to neutral administration of a process and can deal internally with any systemic bias they might have , by recruiting new rulers .
Vigilantism vs. Proceduralism [ edit ]
Vigilantism [ edit ]
Vandalism calls attention to a lack of editorial quality and will therefore eventually improve the overall quality of Wikipedia .
Proceduralism [ edit ]
Vandalism disrupts process , which is key to maintaining order .
Complaints should be sent through proper channels , even if they get buried .
Transclusions [ edit ]
A transclusion is the direct insertion of content from one page to another via a template , so that the page with the transclusion updates if the original page changes .
Largely duplicate content should be transcluded to help with consolidation .
Transclusions allow content to be updated more readily with less editor effort needed .
Transclusions with bad coding or incomplete documentation can marginally increase wikitext complexity .
Transclusions of templates without needed parameters can prevent minor tweaks from being made where the ideal state of pages differs only slightly .
Yesterday saw the announcement that The Pirate Bay has launched a new dating site .
PirateDate.com carries the unmistakable Pirate Bay galleon and replicates the well - worn pirate - style font , but how connected with The Pirate Bay is it ?
Well , perhaps not as closely as some might presume , but being mentioned in the same breath could be good enough .
On Tuesday , TechCrunch broke the news that The Pirate Bay is partnering with the dating company Meezoog to launch a new online dating site to take on the likes of Match.com and Zoosk .
“ PirateDate will allow singles to share and assist their social connections in finding potential dates , while getting recommendations and referrals from their friends , ” explains the article .
“ Pirate Date is utilizing Meezoog ’s technology to provide users with ‘ social proximity ’ measurements , that allow people to efficiently filter their cyber connections . ”
TechCrunch went on to question why people would want to join this new dating service , once the type of Pirate Bay user is taken into consideration .
The torrent site , they argue ( probably correctly ) is more oriented towards men than women , a sentiment shared by some Digg commenters .
“ Registered users : 12,000,000 dudes .
6 women , ” notes one .
But not all feel this situation is a problem .
“ lol that ’s a better male to female ratio than most dating websites , ” adds another .
Another user could n’t resist taking the apparent file - sharing connection to the next level .
“ Wow , 50 guys hammering the same girl .
I mean , it works for BitTorrent , right ? ”
But joking aside , are The Pirate Bay crew really diversifying into new markets ?
Well , not exactly , but they are prepared to benefit from them so they can support their site .
It ’s taken a little while , but in 2010 The Pirate Bay brand is one of the most recognizable on the Internet .
Many millions of people use the site on a daily basis and hardly a week goes by without it appearing in the news , and not just geeky news either .
The Pirate Bay ’s brand went global and mainstream a long time ago .
What advertisers and marketeers need are a good way to generate interest and for those who do n’t mind being associated with the self - styled baddest site on the planet , The Pirate Bay can generate that in truckloads .
For their part , what The Pirate Bay needs is a steady stream of income to keep the site running .
In the main they are achieving that with advertising but it appears they are prepared to consider creative partnerships if those deals make sense .
So , although it may seem that The Pirate Bay crew are launching an online dating site , in reality they ’re not .
What is actually happening is another company is launching a dating site which uses the branding and marketing power of The Pirate Bay in order to penetrate the market .
Just as PirateShops and PirateChat are linked from the site ’s massively - visited homepage , in due time PirateDate will be too ( outside of Scandinavia ) , alongside another familiar product – iPredator .
Even though it does n’t use the site ’s branding , this VPN service draws a huge amount of publicity purely because of its connection to , and promotion by , The Pirate Bay .
So while the site clearly has a great use as a file - sharing location , it also has considerable strength with certain advertisers and marketeers .
Other companies have also picked up on The Pirate Bay ’s popularity and successfully boosted their own profiles – who can possibly forget Hans Pandeya and Global Gaming Factory ?
As The Pirate Bay generates value in its brand and the awareness it creates , it also becomes a problem when the inevitable chancers come along .
In late 2009 , Swedish company Sandryds Handel took the opportunity to hijack The Pirate Bay ’s logo with the aim of using it to sell USB drives .
Will the future see The Pirate Bay enforcing protection on its trademarks and other rights , or will anyone be allowed to come in and do as they please with its image ?
Do the site ’s owners even care as long as they ’re making enough to keep the site going ?
Time will tell .
GAY OLD TIME - NOT : A school in Victoria has created controversy by banning the word gay from the classic Aussie song Kookaburra Sits In The Old Gum Tree .
A fat kookaburra is making slow progress on a weight loss programme at Sydney 's Taronga Zoo .
A local Mosman resident found the over - fed Australian native bird being chased by dogs at Rawson Park on May 4 .
It weighed 545g , 40 percent more than the typical kookaburra , and was unable to take flight .
" I 've seen many kookaburras , but never before have I seen one so fat , " Taronga Zoo wildlife hospital nurse Gemma Watkinson said .
Since then , the bird has been on a " strict " diet and exercise regime .
The female bird tipped the scales at 481g at a recent weigh - in - 20g short of its target .
It can't be released back into the wild unless it can shed those last grams , the zoo said .
Zoo staff are hopeful the bird will pass its next weigh - in , and can be returned to its Mosman stamping ground next week .

This remarkable email chain is from April 14 , 2003 .
The original message , from a military interrogator in Iraq to all concerned ( ALCON ) , announces “ The gloves are coming off gentlemen regarding these detainees , [ redacted ] has made clear it wants these individuals broken , ” and asks for “ wish lists ” of interrogation techniques .
Someone forwards this message , commenting simply , “ Sounds crazy , but we ’re passing this on . ”
The thread is picked up by a military interrogator who insists those now in U.S. custody “ understand force , not psychological mind games or incentives , ” and advocates the use of several techniques used in the U.S. military ’s SERE training programs .
In the last message in the chain — another of the countless examples in the documents where Americans raised objections to what they were seeing — the writer begins , “ As for ‘ the gloves need to come off … ’ we need to take a deep breath and remember who we are . ”
This final email in particular is a must - read .

EXCLUSIVE : An 11 - year - old girl in Mexico allegedly raped by her stepfather and now more than four months pregnant says she wants to have his baby – despite pressure from women ’s groups who want her to have an abortion , pro-life activists in the country say .
They say attorneys for abortion - rights activists have shown up at the girl 's home with plane tickets in hand in an attempt to whisk her away to get an abortion , but the child has said adamantly , “ This is my baby .
I ’m having my baby .
I will call my girl Alejandra . ”
The mother - to - be , from the Mexican state of Quintana Roo , has become the poster child for abortion rights in a country where laws pertaining to the procedure vary dramatically from state to state .
In 2007 , Mexico City passed a law allowing abortions to be performed without restrictions in the first three months of pregnancy .
The law was challenged , but it was upheld on appeal .
Since then , 17 of Mexico ’s 32 states have added an amendment to their constitutions that protects " life beginning at conception , " makes abortion illegal and , in some cases , a crime equivalent to homicide .
Quintana Roo , the Yucatan state that is home to the popular resort destination Cancun , has a similar amendment .
Abortion is allowed there only in cases of rape and when the mother ’s life is at risk , and only within the first 90 days of pregnancy .
Last month , when the then - 10 - year - old girl ’s mother told police that her daughter had been raped by the girl 's stepfather , she told authorities that she thought her daughter was 14 weeks pregnant , or 98 days , which was beyond the state ’s 90 - day limit .
But women ’s rights groups said that because it was unclear exactly how far along the girl was in her pregnancy , an argument could be made that she was still within the 90 - day limit .
Conservative groups say that 's when abortion - rights activists latched onto the girl , who is now nearing her 19th week of pregnancy , and turned her into the face of their international campaign to legalize abortion .
Women ’s rights groups maintain that the girl is small even for an 11 - year - old and that forcing her to give birth puts her life in danger .
They say she is being pressured to have the child and was never informed of all her options .
But others say that ’s not true .
Patricia Lopez Mancera , director of the conservative Center for Women ’s Studies and Comprehensive Formation in Cancun , says she has been in constant communication with the girl ’s mother and the child welfare services institution where the girl currently lives .
Recounting the mother ’s story of her daughter ’s pregnancy and the girl 's decision to have the baby , she said , “ Abortion was never an option .
The girl and her mother never thought about it . ”
Mancera said the girl 's family was n't concerned when she missed her period in November , because she commonly had irregular periods .
But in December , when the girl started vomiting in the mornings and frequently felt dizzy , her mother took her to the doctor and found out she was pregnant .
The mother had a nervous breakdown and demanded her daughter tell her what happened , Mancera said .
Finally , the girl said her stepfather had raped her .
The mother flew into a fit of rage and went directly to the police to the report the rape , and the stepfather was arrested .
He remains in jail .
( Mancera says the mother still doubts whether her husband is the unborn child ’s father — something that will be sorted out when DNA testing is done after the baby ’s birth . )
The girl has been temporarily placed in a child services housing facility where counselors met with the girl and her mother to discuss their options , Mancera said .
She said they were asked of their plans and the girl immediately said , “ We ’re going to have a baby . ”
The mother said she was planning on registering the child as her own , then turned to the girl and said , “ It ’s going to be like a little brother . ”
The girl responded , “ But it ’s going to be my baby anyway . ”
Mancera said the director of the state facility told both mother and daughter that they had a list of 67 couples who wanted a child and that giving up the baby for adoption would be a wonderful thing to do .
Again , the girl said , “ No , no , no , we ’re having it . ”
Mancera said abortion was never even considered , but they soon fell under the pressure of women ’s rights groups that showed up at the girl 's home to talk to her mother about abortion .
But Maria Luisa Sanchez Fuentes , director of the Information Group on Reproductive Choice , says her organization and others just wanted to inform the girl and her mother of their choices , and that they would never want to force anyone to have an abortion against her will .
She said the family was very poor , was being taken advantage of by the state government and was too scared to make a decision other than the one proposed by the government : to have the baby .
But Mancera said the decision was made by the girl and her mother , not anyone else .
“ She is very much into motherhood , ” Mancera said of the girl .
She said the girl and her baby are doing well in the government ’s care .
The girl was taken for an ultrasound last week and was able to see the fetus and learn its sex for the first time .
She said the 11 - year - old was very excited to see the image of her baby girl moving during the ultrasound .
“ When the girl looks at the baby on the screen she is even more sure she wants to have it , ” Mancera said .
“ The mother said , “ That ’s my grandchild , we are going to have this baby . ”
The girl said she ’d picked out a name for a baby , a name she wishes were her own .
“ Her name is Alejandra , ” she told doctors , Mancera said .
One of the main health concerns has been malnutrition , and the focus has been on providing the girl with lots of vegetables , vitamins and folic acid , she said .
The girl 's doctors say she and her baby are in good health , Mancera said , but that because of the girl ’s small size she ’s going to need constant medical attention when she reaches her seventh month .
Because of her size , the doctors will perform a cesarean section .
We conclude that the nucleus accumbens contains two functional affective keyboards for amino - acid signals : a motivation - generating keyboard and a hedonic - generating keyboard .
Corticolimbic glutamate signals and subcortical GABA signals equivalently engage the motivation keyboard to generate desire and - or dread .
Only subcortical GABA signals additionally engage the hedonic keyboard to amplify affective “ liking ” and “ disliking ” reactions .
We thus suggest that top - down cortical glutamate signals powerfully regulate motivation components , but are relatively unable to penetrate core hedonic components of emotion .
That may carry implications of limits to therapeutic regulation of pathological emotions .
Microinjections of a GABA A agonist ( muscimol ) , or of a glutamate AMPA antagonist ( DNQX ) in medial shell of rats were assessed for generation of hedonic “ liking ” or “ disliking ” by measuring orofacial affective reactions to sucrose - quinine taste .
Motivation generation was independently assessed measuring effects on eating versus natural defensive behaviors .
For GABAergic microinjections , we found that the desire - dread motivation gradient was mirrored by an equivalent hedonic gradient that amplified affective taste “ liking ” ( at rostral sites ) versus “ disliking ” ( at caudal sites ) .
However , manipulation of glutamatergic signals completely failed to alter pleasure - displeasure reactions to sensory hedonic impact , despite producing a strong rostrocaudal gradient of motivation .
GABAergic signals to the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) shell arise from predominantly subcortical sources whereas glutamatergic signals arise mainly from cortical - related sources .
Here we contrasted GABAergic and glutamatergic generation of hedonics versus motivation processes , as a proxy for comparing subcortical and cortical controls of emotion .
Local disruptions of either signals in medial shell of NAc generate intense motivated behaviors corresponding to desire and / or dread , along a rostrocaudal gradient .
GABA or glutamate disruptions in rostral shell generate appetitive motivation whereas disruptions in caudal shell elicit fearful motivation .
However , GABA and glutamate signals in NAc differ in important ways , despite the similarity of their rostrocaudal motivation gradients .

To probe this issue , here we contrasted GABAergic versus glutamatergic manipulations of medial shell for generation of 1 ) hedonic ‘ liking ’ shifts , measured in affective reactions to sucrose - quinine tastes , and 2 ) motivation gradients of appetitive and fearful behaviors as described above .
We report that despite generating comparable levels of fear and feeding behaviors , only GABA manipulation in medial shell simultaneously shifts the hedonic impact of a sensory pleasure or displeasure .
By contrast , glutamate disruption leaves hedonic impact unchanged .
These results suggest that corticolimbic glutamate inputs to medial shell can produce strong motivations but cannot penetrate as effectively into the hedonic pleasure or displeasure components of emotions generated by subcortical circuitry .
Green ; glutamatergic inputs from medial prefrontal cortex , orbitofrontal cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , and basolateral amygdala are shown entering the NAc , where they synapse on distal dendrites of medium spiny neurons in NAc .
Red ; GABAergic inputs from ventral pallidum and ventral tegmental area , as well as GABAergic interneurons and axon collaterals from other medium spiny neurons are shown synapsing onto proximal dendrites and soma of medium spiny neurons within NAc .
Therefore , similar appetitive - fearful behaviors are generated by glutamatergic and GABAergic microinjections at appropriate points along this rostrocaudal gradient in medial shell .
But glutamate and GABA signals in NAc differ in important respects .
Glutamate blockade in medial shell primarily blocks the impact of excitatory glutamate release by cortical - related projections from regions of neocortex ( e.g. , prefrontal cortex ) , and from cortical - type forebrain structures ( e.g. , basolateral amygdala and hippocampus ) , and corticolimbic relay nuclei ( e.g. , thalamus paraventricular nucleus ) [ 1 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] ( Fig. 1 ) .
GABA signals arise primarily from subcortical circuits , and muscimol more directly modulates intrinsic spiny neurons of medial shell , mimicking inputs from collateral axons from other spiny NAc neurons and from ventral pallidum projections and projections from the ventral tegmental area , and related subcortical sources [ 1 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] ( Fig. 1 ) .
These differences suggest that GABA signals to NAc function essentially as bottom - up signals whereas glutamate signals function more heavily as top - down glutamate signals .
These differences may carry functional implications for the generation of desire and dread emotions , despite their outward similarities in motivated behavior of eating versus defensive treading , distress calls , etc .
For example , in the rostral 25 % of medial shell , microinjections of the GABA A agonist muscimol or the glutamate AMPA - kainate antagonist DNQX each generate high levels of pure appetitive behaviors such as eating or drinking [ 1 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
By contrast , near the rostrocaudal midpoint of shell muscimol or DNQX microinjections generate bivalent mixtures of both appetitive and fearful reactions .
The fearful reactions include species - specific defensive behaviors such as distress vocalizations , escape attempts , conditioned place avoidance and defensive treading [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
Defensive treading in particular occurs in the wild as an instinctive anti-predator behavior used to kick sand at snakes or other natural threats , and in the laboratory to bury or build protective mounds against small localized shock prods or other noxious objects [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
In the caudal 25 % of medial shell , high levels of these fearful behaviors are elicited relatively purely by microinjections of the same drugs , whereas appetitive behaviors become suppressed [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
Local activation of GABA
A receptors or localized blockade of glutamate AMPA receptors in the medial shell of NAc each generate intense levels of motivated appetitive or fearful behaviors in an anatomically organized pattern of valence .
Desire versus dread is generated by both GABAergic and glutamatergic microinjections along a rostrocaudal gradient in medial shell , in a manner analogous to a limbic ‘ affective keyboard ’ [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
Just as a keyboard generates many notes , neurochemical manipulations at different rostrocaudal points in medial shell generate many graded combinations of appetitive and / or defensive behaviors [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
We note that a limitation of the present results was that only one dose of DNQX was used to compare motivation and hedonic effects , and it would be valuable to confirm our conclusions with additional doses .
However , the dose used was chosen to be maximally effective at generating appetitive and fearful motivations based on previous results [ 4 ] , making it perhaps unlikely that other DNQX doses would modulate hedonic reactions any more potently than the dose used here .
While both muscimol and DNQX microinjections produce similar patterns of feeding and fear behaviors , at rostral and caudal sites respectively , the intensity with which they did so differed slightly .
There was a direct correlation between site placement along the rostrocaudal gradient with the intensity of motivated feeding versus fearful behaviors generated by microinjections , both for muscimol and DNQX ( feeding time , r( 14 ) = .603 , p = .011 ; treading time , r( 14 ) = .680 , p = .004 ) .
Yet , DNQX produced slightly more appetitive eating behaviors at rostral sites ( feeding time , site X drug interaction , F ( 1,12 ) = 7.084 , p = .021 ) , while muscimol produced more intense defensive treading behavior at caudal sites ( treading time , site X drug interaction ( F1,12 ) = 36.472 , p<.001 ) .
In summary , both neurochemical manipulations produced similar rostrocaudal gradients for generating positive and negative motivated behaviors , and at similar overall intensities , but with slightly different valence biases ( glutamate = positive motivation bias ; GABA = negative bias ) .
Conversely , caudal microinjections of either drug stimulated spontaneous generation of fearful behaviors such as robust defensive treading ( site X drug interaction , DNQX , F ( 1,14 ) = 13.213 , p = .003 ; muscimol , F ( 1,12 ) = 21.087 , p = .001 ) .
As sites became progressively more caudal , the DNQX or muscimol microinjections produced increasingly higher levels of defensive treading behavior ( correlation for DNQX : r ( 16 ) = −.462 , p = .036 ; muscimol : r( 14 ) = −.682 , p = .004 ) .

Scatter plots above
Fos plume maps indicate behavioral changes exhibited by individual subjects ; lines indicate the slope of the correlation between behavioral change ( from vehicle ) and distance rostral to bregma in mm ( * p<.05 ; **p<.01 ) .
Histograms bars below and to the sides of the maps show mean change from vehicle ( error bars = SEM ) for each behavior at rostrocaudal and dorsoventral levels as marked along the medial shell .
To confirm the presence of DNQX and muscimol - generated gradients of feeding and defensive behavior , one group of rats was tested only for the elicitation of spontaneous motivated behavior , along with a small subset of the rat that also went through taste reactivity testing .
DNQX and muscimol generated similar patterns of feeding versus fear behaviors along the rostrocaudal gradient of motivation valence in medial shell .
Rostral microinjections of either DNQX or muscimol at least quadrupled levels of appetitive eating behavior and food intake over vehicle control levels ( feeding time , site X drug interaction , DNQX , F ( 1,14 ) = 8.589 , p = .001 , muscimol , F ( 1,12 ) = 8.159 , p = .014 ; food intake , site X drug interaction , DNQX , F ( 1,14 ) = 6.996 , p = .016 , muscimol , F ( 1,12 ) = 7.129 , p = .020 , Fig. 2 , 7 ) .
Progressively more rostral microinjections produced greater levels of feeding and intake ( correlation with rostral distance from bregma for DNQX : r ( 16 ) = .528 , p = .018 ; muscimol : r ( 14 ) = .747 , p = .001 ) .
Microinjection of DNQX or muscimol into more caudal sites of medial shell did not increase feeding behaviors , and instead oppositely suppressed feeding behavior at the most caudal site for both drugs ( DNQX , F ( 1,14 ) = 8.589 , p = .001 , muscimol , F ( 1,12 ) = 8.159 , p = .014 ) .
As each rat was tested with both muscimol and DNQX at its particular anatomical site , it was possible to directly compare the effects on taste reactivity of the two neurochemical manipulations at the same rostrocaudal location in the same rat .
Direct contrast of DNQX and muscimol effects confirmed that muscimol robustly altered hedonic reactions while DNQX did not ( muscimol versus DNQX , site X drug interaction , 15 minutes , F ( 1,21 ) = 6.296 , p = .020 ; 1 hr , F ( 1,21 ) = 6.957 , p = .015 ) .
Similarly , muscimol amplified negative aversive reactions , but DNQX did not , at the same caudal sites ( muscimol versus DNQX , caudal rats , F ( 1,9 ) = 8.741 , p = .016 ) .
Fos plume maps of sites where DNQX AMPA blockade produced changes in hedonic ‘ liking ’ reactions ( A ) or aversive ‘ disliking ’ reactions ( B ) to sucrose - quinine taste at 15 ( left ) and 60 minutes ( right ) post - microinjection .
DNQX had little to no effect on both hedonic ‘ liking ’ reactions and aversive ‘ disliking ’ reactions .
While some subjects did show changes in ‘ liking ’ or ‘ disliking ’ ( as indicated by the sporadically colored symbols ) , no general pattern emerged .
Histograms bars show mean change from vehicle ( error bars = SEM ) for both each reaction pattern at rostrocaudal and dorsoventral levels as marked along the medial shell .
By contrast , microinjections of DNQX in the shell completely failed to shift affective ‘ disliking ’ or ‘ liking ’ ( Fig. 3 , 6 , Fig S1 ) .
Hedonic or aversive patterns of taste reactivity were never altered by DNQX microinjection at any rostrocaudal site ( positive hedonic reactions , site X drug interaction , F ( 1,22 ) = .074 , p = ns ; aversive reactions , site X drug interaction , F ( 1,22 ) = .004 , p = ns ) or time after microinjection ( positive hedonic reactions = 15 min : F( 1,23 ) = .105 , p = ns ; 1 hr : F ( 1,22 ) = .839 , p = ns ; negative aversive reactions = 15 min : F( 1,23 ) = .934 , p = ns ; 1 hr = F ( 1,22 ) = 1.560 , p = ns ) .
At most a few individual rats showed only noise - like fluctuations at random sites or tests after DNQX , without any discernable anatomical keyboard pattern or statistical significance .
Simultaneously , in caudal shell , muscimol microinjections dramatically increased the number of negative - valence aversive reactions ( gapes , headshakes , forelimb flails ) , which are normally emitted to quinine taste ( 15 min : F ( 1,9 ) = 12.880 , p = .006 ; 1 hr : F ( 1,10 ) = 11.165 , p = .007 , Fig. 3 , 5 , Fig S1 ) .
The number of aversive reactions progressively increased as sites became more caudal , and nearly doubled above vehicle levels at the most caudal sites ( muscimol = 25.3+/−2.39 SEM ; vehicle = 12.9+/−2.75 SEM ) .
In summary , muscimol microinjection in medial shell generated a rostrocaudal gradient of rostral ‘ liking ’ and disliking ‘ disliking ’ , corresponding to the concept of an affective keyboard .
Fos plume maps of sites where muscimol GABA - A stimulation produced changes in hedonic ‘ liking ’ reactions ( A ) or aversive ‘ disliking ’ reactions ( B ) to sucrose - quinine taste at 15 ( left ) and 60 minutes ( right ) post - microinjection .
Muscimol primarily enhanced ‘ liking ’ reactions in a small moderately rostral area , beneath the genu of the corpus callosum .
Muscimol microinjection at sites outside of this area tended to reduce hedonic ‘ liking ’ reactions and enhanced aversive ‘ disliking ’ reactions , especially in caudal regions of NAc medial shell .
Histograms bars show mean change from vehicle ( error bars = SEM ) for both each reaction pattern at rostrocaudal and dorsoventral levels throughout medial shell .
When sites were moved posteriorly into the caudal half of shell , muscimol microinjection suppressed or nearly abolished positive - valence hedonic reactions that are normally emitted to sucrose taste ( e.g. , tongue protrusions and paw licking ) at both 15 min and 1 hr after microinjection ( 15 min : F ( 1,9 ) = 10.970 , p = .009 ; 1 hr : F ( 1,10 ) = 11.962 , p = .006 ; Fig. 3 , 5 , Fig S1 ) .
Supporting a keyboard - like pattern of affective modulation , muscimol produced progressively greater suppression of positive hedonic reactions elicited by oral infusions of sucrose - quinine solution as sites became progressively more caudal ( correlation of hedonic suppression with caudal placement : r( 25 ) = .461 , p = .023 ) .
Muscimol microinjection into a relatively far rostral level , about 0.5 mm thick and located at the level of the genu of the corpus callosum ( +2.0 to +2.4 mm ahead of bregma ) enhanced positive - valence hedonic reactions that are normally elicited by sucrose taste .
Microinjection of muscimol at this rostral level in medial shell nearly doubled hedonic reactions to the sucrose - quinine mixture ( muscimol = 34.3+/−5.88 SEM versus vehicle = 19.5+/−6.45 SEM tested at 15 min after microinjection ; F( 1.5 ) = 7.888 , p = .038 ) .
The affective keyboard appeared to have an anterior end , so that hedonic reactions were no longer significantly enhanced if muscimol sites were moved further anterior , beyond this + 2 to +2.4 rostral level ( site X drug interaction , F ( 1,13 ) = 9.516 , p = .009 ) .
That is , if microinjections were instead below the minor forceps of the corpus callosum , between + 2.4 to 2.8 mm ahead of bregma , muscimol actually non-significantly decreased hedonic reactions to the taste mixture ( average of 12.0+/−4.66 SEM versus 21.1+/−5.34 SEM under vehicle , F ( 1,7 ) = 2.835 , p = .136 ) .
This far rostral zone anterior to +2.4 bregma extends into the rostral pole of NAc , and thus may be outside what is traditionally considered the medial shell .
The rostral pole is further anterior than our previous fear and feeding gradient studies have typically mapped .
These results suggest that the rostral pole is not part of the affective keyboard or functional rostrocaudal gradient for amplifying affective reactions .
Muscimol microinjections shifted the positive hedonic impact of tastes in a keyboard - like gradient pattern , at rostral levels enhancing positive hedonic reactions but at more caudal levels suppressing the same positive hedonic reaction and instead amplifying aversive reactions to tastes ( correlation of hedonic reaction change with rostrocaudal position = r ( 24 ) = 0.461 , p<0.01 ) .
In comparison , DNQX produced slightly larger Fos plumes than muscimol ( though reversed in polarity ) .
The larger volume of the DNQX plume may perhaps be due to the fact that DNQX was dissolved in a more lipophilic vehicle ( DMSO - saline mixture rather than pure saline ) , which may have produced greater diffusion .
Muscimol ( 75 ng ) microinjections produced small , inhibitory “ antiplumes ” [ 23 ] of 0.3 mm radius , where local Fos expression was suppressed below vehicle levels , surrounding an even smaller excitatory center , consistent with previous reports of muscimol - induced changes in Fos expression [ 26 ] .
The very small excitatory center of doubled Fos expression ( volume = ∼ 0.004 mm 3 ; radius = 0.097+/−.016 mm SEM ) was surrounded by the larger inhibitory antiplume of <½
Fos normal expression ( compared to vehicle levels ; volume ∼ 0.04 mm 3 ; radius = .209+/−0.032 mm SEM ) , and further surrounded by an outer weaker anti-plume of < 75 % vehicle Fos expression ( volume = ∼ 0.11 mm 3 ; radius = .304+/−.0468 mm SEM ) .
Each DNQX plume contained a ∼ < 0.08 mm 3 volume center of quadrupled Fos expression levels ( compared to vehicle levels ; DNQX center radius = 0.267+/−0.042 mm SEM ) .
The plume center was surrounded by a middle band of tripled Fos expression ( radius = 0.528+/−0.068 mm SEM ) , which was surrounded by an outer rim of doubled Fos levels ( radius = 0.978 mm ) .
We used a split - and - recombine design to compare behavioral and neurobiological Fos plume effects of GABA versus glutamate drug microinjections [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
This procedure avoids under-estimation of drug spread that could result if plumes were assessed after a series of behavioral tests , due to progressive gliosis induced by microinjection repetition .
Rats were assigned to either behavioral or Fos analysis groups at the time of surgery .
Colored plume maps for both muscimol ( left ) and DNQX ( right ) show local elevations or suppressions of Fos caused relative to vehicle ( top ) .
Muscimol produces an inhibitory “ anti- plume ” or an area of suppressed Fos expression ( to 75 % and 50 % of vehicle levels ) , surrounding a small excitatory center of 200 % vehicle levels .
DNQX produces a larger , excitatory plume with areas of 200 –400 % vehicle level Fos expression .
Examples of Fos expression produced by both vehicles ( saline and the 50 % saline / 50 % DMSO mixture ) as well as muscimol and DNQX are shown on the bottom .
In order to map where microinjections were likely to have directly impacted local tissue , and to assign anatomical responsibility for behavioral effects , we used a Fos plume tool applied to separate rats to measure local plume - shaped regions of neuronal modulation caused by microinjections of DNQX , muscimol or each of the vehicles ( total n = 33 ) [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] ( Fig. 4 ) .
Local plumes of Fos expression provide a relatively direct measure of the spread of drug impact on local brain tissue , in the form of immediate early gene transcription and translation within nearby neurons .
Fos plume maps of sites where muscimol GABA stimulation ( left ) or DNQX AMPA blockade ( right ) produced hedonic ( red symbols ) or aversive ( purple symbols ) in orofacial reactions to a sweet / bitter sucrose - quinine mixture at 15 minutes post - microinjection .
Criteria for including a site as hedonic was an increase > 10 in ‘ liking ’ reactions and a decrease or no change in ‘ disliking ’ reactions .
Criteria for including a site as aversive was an increase > 10 in ‘ disliking ’ reactions and / or a decrease > 10 in ‘ liking ’ reactions .
Hedonic enhancement was produced by muscimol only a moderately rostral area just below the genu of the corpus callosum .
Aversive enhancement was produced by muscimol throughout rostral shell , and in an area rostral to the hedonic enhancement zone , possibly extending into rostral pole of NAc.
DNQX produced mostly ambivalent effects ( white ; no change , or simultaneously enhanced or suppressed ‘ liking ’ and ‘ disliking ’ reactions ) .
Histograms bars show mean change from vehicle ( error bars = SEM ) for both hedonic ‘ liking ’ reactions ( top ) and aversive ‘ disliking ’ reactions ( bottom ) at all rostrocaudal levels .
However , only stimulation of GABA receptors with muscimol microinjection generated corresponding shifts in affective reactions to the hedonic impact of sweet or bitter tastes , whereas glutamate disruptions had no effect on hedonic impact ( Fig. 3 ) .
For example , bittersweet tastes became more positively ‘ liked ’ ( e.g. , elicited more lip licking and similar hedonic orofacial reactions ) after rostral shell microinjections ( 34.3+/−5.88 SEM hedonic reactions on muscimol versus 19.5+/−6.45 SEM on vehicle , F ( 1,5 ) = 7.888 , p = .038 ) , but became negatively ‘ disliked ’ ( e.g. , elicits gapes ) after caudal microinjections ( 2.00+/−.632 SEM hedonic reactions on muscimol versus 20.8+/0 5.68 SEM on vehicle , F ( 1,9 ) = 10.970 , p = .009 ; 25.3+/−2.39 SEM aversive reactions on muscimol versus 12.9+/−2.75 SEM on vehicle , F ( 1,9 ) = 12.880 , p = .006 ) .
Glutamate AMPA blockade with DNQX microinjections completely failed to alter hedonic ‘ liking ’ or aversive ‘ disliking ’ reactions to sensory pleasure or displeasure , despite generating spontaneous motivated fearful or feeding behaviors at levels similar to GABAergic microinjections .

Sites were designated as producing primarily appetitive ( green symbols ) , defensive ( red symbols ) or mixed ( yellow symbols ) motivated behavior following muscimol and DNQX microinjections .
Purely appetitive behavior ( criteria for including a site was a > 400 sec increase in feeding behavior ) was primarily stimulated in rostral shell by both DNQX and muscimol , whereas defensive behavior ( criteria for including a site was a > 15 sec increase in treading behavior over vehicle levels ) was primarily stimulated in caudal shell by both DNQX and muscimol .
Histograms bars show mean change from vehicle ( error bars = SEM ) for both feeding ( top ) and defensive treading ( bottom ) at all rostrocaudal levels .
The effect of medial shell modulation of either GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission was assessed , for distinct group of animals , either on hedonic ‘ liking ’ affective response to sucrose - quinine taste using the taste reactivity test or on generation of appetitive or aversive motivated behavior expressed as spontaneous emission of naturalistic eating versus defensive treading behaviors .
In this design both GABAergic and glutamatergic modulation was conducted in the same animals , allowing us to compare specific effects of each drug on behavioral tests in the same rat .
Both muscimol , the GABA agonist , and DNQX , the glutamate AMPA antagonist , produced similar rostrocaudal gradients of appetitive and defensive behaviors that conformed to an ‘ affective keyboard ’ pattern ( Fig. 2 ) .
Discussion
Glutamate signals to NAc convey primarily top - down controls from cortical and cortex - related structures , such as prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , basolateral amygdala and thalamic nuclei embedded in cortico - limbic - thalamo - cortical loops .
In contrast , GABA signals to the same medium spiny neurons in NAc convey primarily subcortical inputs from intrinsic local NAc neurons , and from other subcortical structures such as ventral pallidum .
Here we showed that hyperpolarizing local disruptions of either corticolimbic glutamate or subcortical GABA inputs to NAc medial shell generate equivalent motivations expressed in behavior as appetitive desire and / or defensive dread mixtures , along the same rostrocaudal gradient in medial shell .
But only GABA - related disruptions by muscimol additionally produced corresponding changes in the hedonic impact of an affect - laden gustatory stimulus .
By contrast , glutamate - related disruptions by DNQX did not influence hedonic impact .
The valence of motivation ( appetitive versus fearful ) and of hedonic impact ( pleasant versus unpleasant ) generated by amino acid neurotransmitter disrupting microinjections was always determined by the rostrocaudal position of the microinjection site within the affective keyboard of NAc medial shell .
In this keyboard pattern , each microinjection corresponded to a key , the size of which was the radius of the local Fos plume that surrounded the drug site .
Each microinjection key was valence - tuned to a graded mixture of desire and / or dread corresponding to its rostrocaudal keyboard site in medial shell .
Glutamate - related hyperpolarizations by DNQX actually produced a local plume of roughly three times larger radius ( 0.9 mm for outer radius of detectable Fos change ) than GABA - related muscimol microinjections ( 0.304 mm radius ) , yet muscimol produced a broader array of functional effects .
DNQX microinjections and muscimol microinjections generated similar patterns of motivated fear or feeding behaviors .
At rostral sites in medial shell , DNQX or muscimol each stimulated eating behavior and food intake to four times above vehicle control levels .
Disruptions in medial shell completely failed to distort hedonic ‘ liking ’ or aversive ‘ disliking ’ reactions to sucrose - quinine taste , despite generating levels of motivated fearful or feeding behaviors intense as intense as muscimol .
At caudal sites , DNQX or muscimol each generated fearful behaviors : chiefly defensive treading directed mostly at the front of the chamber and objects in the room beyond , at levels that often exceeded 10 times control vehicle levels .
Eating behavior and food intake gradually declined and fearful behaviors gradually rose as sites moved progressively from rostral to caudal in medial shell .
However , only GABA disruptions generated a corresponding rostrocaudal gradient of shifted hedonic impact from sensory pleasure to displeasure .
Muscimol microinjection at a rostral level enhanced positive ‘ liking ’ reactions to a bittersweet taste ( e.g. , lip or paw licking ) , whereas as sites moved caudally muscimol microinjections oppositely increased negative ‘ disliking ’ reactions ( e.g. , gapes ) and suppressed positive ‘ liking ’ reactions .
DNQX microinjections completely failed to alter ‘ liking ’ reactions to sweetness , and DNQX at sites in caudal shell completely failed to enhance negative ‘ disliking ’ .
Thus local glutamatergic AMPA blockade in medial shell powerfully induced motivated ‘ wanting ’ to eat , fearful anti-predator behaviors , or both , but never altered the hedonic impact of a sensory pleasure or displeasure .
The difference between effects on motivated desire - dread versus on hedonic ‘ liking ’ -‘ disliking ’ reactions suggests that glutamate and GABA signals similarly can activate a motivation - generating keyboard in NAc to produce fear or feeding - related behaviors .
But only GABA signals have additional access to a hedonic - generating keyboard corresponding to core affective reactions to sensory pleasure or displeasure .
Neurobiological differences between GABAergic and glutamatergic microinjections Muscimol microinjections stimulate GABA
A receptors and might be expected to produce hyperpolarization and reductions in the firing rate of local neurons containing GABA A receptors .
GABA A stimulation by muscimol produces inhibitory hyperpolarizations by allowing Cl- to enter the cell [ 27 ] , producing especially powerful inhibition of medium spiny neurons [ 28 ] .
By comparison , DNQX microinjections block glutamatergic AMPA receptors , and might have been expected to similarly produce relative hyperpolarization of neurons containing glutamate receptors , by diminishing “ up states , ” suppressing EPSPs , and reducing the number of action potentials produced [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
However , important differences also exist between GABAergic and glutamatergic hyperpolarizations .
Muscimol may more potently hyperpolarize NAc neurons by acting on GABA A receptors located on somata and proximal dendrites [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
DNQX generation of desire and dread requires interaction with endogenous dopamine at the same site [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] and may act more distally on medium spiny dendrites , blocking ionotropic glutamate signals at distant spines , where AMPA receptors are more likely to be found [ 37 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
More distal placement of glutamate receptors on the head of neuronal spines , compared to GABA receptors , also might dilute the intensity of IPSP states at the soma and axon hillock induced by glutamatergic blockade , altering the degree of disinhibition passed on to output targets such as ventral pallidum , lateral hypothalamus or ventral tegmentum .
The most potent hyperpolarizations may come via activation of fast - spiking interneurons which , in striatum , produce IPSCs in the postsynaptic neurons of 4 to 6 times the amplitude of those produced by medium spiny neurons [ 28 ] .
One factor which may account for these intense differences in amplitude is synaptic location : parvalbumin - positive terminals , which likely arise from fast - spiking interneurons , are more likely to synapse on the soma , whereas medium spiny neurons are more likely to end on dendrites or spines [ 28 ] , [ 42 ] .
Generally , it seems the more proximal or intrinsic the input , the greater the inhibitory impact .
All this implies that subcortical GABA inputs to NAc may achieve a greater potency of disinhibition of downstream targets to alter hedonic impact than glutamate inputs from predominantly cortical - related sources .
Finally , we note that muscimol microinjection produced “ antiplumes ” or areas of Fos suppression , whereas DNQX produced robust pure plumes of elevated Fos expression , consistent with our previous observations [ 2 ] , [ 26 ] .
These considerations suggest an additional qualitative difference between glutamatergic versus GABAergic hyperpolarizations , beyond a simple intensity difference , which may also contribute to differing modulation of hedonic reactions to sensory pleasure or displeasure .
As a caveat , it may be important to note that our conclusion that glutamate disruption fails to penetrate core ‘ liking ’ reactions to sensory pleasure is specific to ionotropic glutamate signals , and in particular to those requiring AMPA receptor activation .
Blockade of AMPA receptors may be expected to disrupt ionotropic fast excitatory signals to medium spiny neurons in medial shell .
This conclusion about fast - acting ionotropic receptors may need to be distinguished from metabotropic glutamate receptors that play a slower and broader modulatory role for neuronal function , and which could conceivably alter hedonic ‘ liking ’ more effectively than AMPA blockade , either directly by altering medium spiny neurons with metabotropic receptors or via presynaptic modulation of GABA release , which could in turn alter hedonic impact [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] .
Thus , we conclude that ionotropic AMPA glutamate disruptions in NAc shell do not modulate hedonic pleasure , but consider the hedonic role of metabotropic glutamate receptors to remain an open empirical question .
Limits to top - down control ?
An overall interpretation of our results may be that top - down corticolimbic inputs using glutamate signals from prefrontal cortex regions , such as infralimbic cortex ( homologous in rats to ventral anterior cingulate cortex in humans ) , orbitofrontal or prelimbic cortex , or from hippocampus subiculum , basolateral amygdala , or paraventricular thalamus , all are limited in their ability to control hedonic emotional processes generated by NAc neurons , compared to bottom - up or subcortical inputs to the same NAc sites that primarily use GABA signals .
Specifically , corticolimbic glutamate circuits appear to control the generation in medial shell of motivation components ( incentive salience versus fearful salience ) , but not the generation of hedonic affective states ( pleasure ‘ liking ’ versus displeasure ‘ disliking ’ ) .
This may restrict the capacity of top - down corticolimbic circuits to regulate subcortically generated emotion .
Of course , another caveat is that our studies were conducted in rats , whereas primates and especially humans have larger prefrontal cortex and thus more dense glutamate projections to NAc .
However , our results are still likely to apply to humans unless the quantitative species difference in top - down influence actually creates a qualitative expansion of control to include NAc - generated hedonics .
We conclude that the influence exerted by top - down controls over NAc may be limited to motivational states , and may leave core hedonic reactions to affective events relatively untouched .
This feature might also conceivably set limits on the range of emotional processes that can be effectively adjusted by cognitive therapies that recruit top - down circuits [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
As caveat to our general distinction between cortical glutamate versus subcortical GABA sources , it is important to note one significant subcortical source of glutamate signals in NAc : co-release of glutamate by mesolimbic dopamine neurons [ 53 ] .
Glutamate released by mesolimbic dopamine neurons can produce fast postsynaptic potentials in NAc that is blocked by DNQX , implicating ionotropic AMPA receptors [ 53 ] .
It may be noteworthy that dopamine in NAc , like glutamate AMPA disruption , fails to enhance ‘ liking ’ reactions to sensory pleasure even when it elevates ‘ wanting ’ , suggesting a functional similarity between ionotropic glutamate and dopamine actions in NAc [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] .
Also , endogenous dopamine is required for local AMPA glutamate blockade by DNQX to generate either motivated fear or feeding behaviors , again suggesting a synergistic interaction for dopamine - glutamate motivation effects in medial shell .
In contrast to glutamate disruption from any source , both motivation and hedonic impact are robustly generated together by GABAergic inhibition of neurons in medial shell , produced by inputs from neighboring medial spiny neurons and other intrinsic NAc neurons , or from GABAergic inputs from other subcortical structures [ 1 ] , [ 56 ] .
The ability of GABAergic inhibition to modulate hedonics is consistent with previous work on NAc generation of ‘ liking ’ and ‘ disliking ’ , and also with related hedonic generation by the ventral pallidum , a major source of GABAergic input and output from NAc [ 23 ] , [ 57 ] , [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] .
I find the timing of this news convenient .
Two weeks before The Last Airbender hits theaters on July 1st , writer / director M. Night Shyamalan is rumored to be sending out his latest super - secret script to top execs .
According to Heat Vision , big names like Bruce Willis , Gwyneth Paltrow and Bradley Cooper have been approached to star .
M. Night ’s paranoid and extremely silly tradition of allowing only studio grand poobahs to read his cloak and dagger writing under the watchful eye of one of his flunkies is apparently in full effect .
No one knows what the damn plot is or what the not - so stunning twist will be .
Which begs the question , “ Gee , I wonder what ridiculous surprise Shyamalan will spring on us this time ? ”
So far , he ’s hit us with the following sharp turns ( SPOILERS dead ahead ) :
The Sixth Sense – Bruce Willis is dead .
Unbreakable – Mr. Glass caused all the disasters .
Signs – Water kills the aliens .
The Village – It ’s really modern day .
Lady in the Water – Who cares ?
This movie sucked ass .
The Happening – The trees are killing us .
After a promising start to his career , M. Might has become a borderline hack .
His stories are convoluted and his so - called twists are amateurish and illogical .
Why would a studio exec with an iota of common sense put up with this guy ’s shenanigans ?
It ’s fairly obvious he ’s trying to secure funding for his latest project before The Last Airbender opens just in case it tanks , which considering the way the summer box office is going , is very likely .
The only thing that might keep Airbender from bombing is it ’s not based on one of Night ’s overblown ideas .
However , if it does flop , Shyamalan may find himself penning and helming Syfy original movies like “ Giant Anteater vs. Mega - Toad ” instead of having lunch with old pal Bruce Willis .
I really wonder if Night is capable of regaining his form and delivering the goods .
He ’s a technically competent director but these crazy plots have got to stop .
The trees are attacking us ?
C’mon , Night .
Even environmentalists thought that was preachy .
If I told you his new script was about of bunch of people traveling on a train that inexplicably switches tracks in the middle of the night and ends up in a dark , desolate land which turns out to be hell , would you believe me ?
Does n’t that sound like something he ’d write ?
Is that really what his new flick is about ?
I ’ll never tell and neither will Shyamalan .

Council Chambers is all about the ins and outs of guild leadership in Star Wars : The Old Republic .
Each week , we ’ll look at running and managing a guild through good times , bad times and everything in between .
For all those who did not get a chance to watch the live streaming of BioWare ’s Guild Summit , Reedyn and I here at Ask A Jedi will do our best to get you as much information as we can about the event itself , game updates , and some of the news to come out of the game .
While the Summit itself was designed for guild leaders , a lot of the content being discussed Tuesday concerned the big patch 1.2 update , and the content included in that .
There will be some significant updates and improvements to guilds , in particular the inclusion of guild banks , with other much - requested features coming in future patches .
It sounded like after guild banks , the number one feature guilds sought was the implementation of an in - game guild calendar , and the design teams said they ’ll definitely be working on this for a future patch .
No dates yet , other than “ Not 1.2 ” .
Other items such as being able to invite people to groups from the guild window , better guild navigation and features , and some sort of guild logo that players can wear or display were also mentioned .
A lot of the discussion also focused on the Legacy system – which probably merits its own entry , as it is very complex and includes an extensive list of new features .
The Legacy system will introduce multiple self - casting buffs , unlocking new species / class combinations , and then convenience features such as powerful gear for lower level alternate characters .
Finally , a significant amount of information was presented about some upcoming changes to PvP and PvE .
In PvP , two of the more noteworthy items were the removal of Ilum for an indeterminate amount of time as the world PvP is re-examined and repaired to work more closely in line with what the developers had initially intended , and to also address many of the issues and concerns brought about by the community in the last major patch .
In Operations and Flashpoints , there will be a new Operation with roughly the same number of bosses as current Operations , and with adjustments to difficulty levels coming across all Operations .
What is currently considered Normal Mode will become Story Mode , and is designed for the very casual players who may not be regular raiders but still want to see that aspect of the game ’s story .
Gearing and progression will be largely moved to Hard Modes and Nightmare Modes , and the challenge of Nightmare Modes significantly increased to truly make these encounters ….. well , nightmarish .
An additional Flashpoint that completes the Rakghoul story from Kaon Under Siege will also be implemented , allowing players to learn the ending of that event and also to gear up in a more challenging flashpoint for the end game crowd .
Guildy , But Not Guildy Enough
For my part , I found the Summit very information and helpful , but felt like it could have focused a bit more on the guild aspect more .
In some ways , while I had fun and learned a lot , it felt a bit more like a “ 1.2 Update ” event rather than something specifically designed for guilds .
The small size and one - on - one time with the development team was fantastic – so definitely far beyond what one could expect at a PAX - type event or a future BioCon ( for which there were many enthusiastic demands ) .
However , the content felt much more like a reward to active and loyal guild leaders more than the opportunity to really meet and get feedback from guild leaders about what they need , what they like , what they do not like , and some of the guild - based reactions to potential features such as a guild leveling system .
In the future , I ’d recommend additional aspects like breakout sessions with guild leaders , and perhaps more options to discuss actual guild issues – for instance , not only what are the game features people most want to see for guilds , but also some more community - building sort of things .
For instance , when the Guild Headquarters was closed in early January after launch , guild leaders were told this would be reintroduced – but no word followed on when , if that is still true , or what will happen to the former Guild Headquarters .
I also would have liked a better dialogue with some of the guild leaders on how many of the “ down the road ” features that guild leaders actually want .
For example , there was mention Tuesday of some sort of “ guild progression ” , which sounds an awful lot like guild leveling .
As we saw in the entry from two weeks ago , guild leveling is something that has a lot of strong emotions from the guild communities , both positive and negative .
While I was there as a fan site representative rather than a guild leader , my inner guild leader would have welcomed some sort of round - table with other guilds to discuss with the developers whether this is something the community wants and needs , or where we would like to see efforts placed in terms of supporting the guild .
So all in all , while the event was a fantastic opportunity to interact directly with the representatives from BioWare , meet a lot of other fantastic players and guild leaders , and learn a lot about some of the upcoming changes in patch 1.2 , it also still did n’t feel quite as guild - centric as I had expected .
That said , people gave some fantastic feedback about all sorts of aspects of the game , and I fully expect the writers and developers to take that feedback into account as they continue building a bigger , better Old Republic for us all .
Kudos
I do have to applaud the initiative that the TOR team displayed with this event , reaching out to the community and setting up an event on this scale .
It ’s something that very few MMOs have done – in fact , the only one I am aware of offhand is EVE ’s efforts to work with a player - driven council to get feedback and address community concerns .
So on that , well done !
Given this was the first of its kind , I doubt anyone expected it to be perfect – and I think there is room to improve if a second guild summit is held next year , with some more breakout sessions on features with guild leaders , so that it really can feel like a dynamic exchange – but even getting this much was head and shoulders above what many other games provide .
Got a question for Council Chambers ?
Drop a line to Lady Republic at ladyoftherepublic@gmail.com or post a comment here , and you may see your guild questions answered in a future column !

BATAVIA , IL — Hoping to use his office 's high - energy synchrotron particle accelerator for a " real quick " personal project , physicist Neil Lippmann reportedly brought in a proton from home Wednesday that he had been meaning to collide against a fixed nickel target at near light speed .
" I know we 're not supposed to accelerate personal particles on company equipment , but [ Nobel laureate ] Leon [ Lederman ] brings in his own subatomic matter all the time and nobody says anything , " Lippmann said .
" Plus , I 'll do it after five , so it 's not even on company time . "
To assuage any further guilt over the workplace rule infraction , Lippmann promised to clean all the leptons out of the accelerator 's ion trap and leave the Van de Graaf generator looking just like new .

The third and final issue of Aladdin : Legacy of the Lost was just released this Wednesday by Radical Comics .
It 's a retelling of the familiar tale of Aladdin in comic - book form , and it 's definitely not the Disney version .
( Want proof ?
How about the cover of issue # 2 above . )
Aladdin , while still the protagonist of the tale , is not necessarily as likable as the one your kids may be familiar with .
From the time you meet him , he 's gambling ( and cheating ) , fighting , and hanging out in the brothel where he was raised .
Qassim , the sorcerer who 's after the lamp , is still just as evil as ever , though , taking what he wants and killing off anyone in his way .
The first issue mostly sets the stage , and other than some visual embellishments is largely the same story : Qassim needs Aladdin to fetch the lamp , tries to betray him , and Aladdin gets away with the lamp and discovers the djinn imprisoned within .
His first act is to make himself a prince , creating an enormous palace just outside the city of Shamballah and trying to win the princess over with his fabulous riches .
And here the story makes its own path to the end : Captain Sinbad enters the story and becomes a significant character in the tale , as does a Mantis Queen and the djinn of the ring .
The conclusion ( with the expected showdown with Qassim ) throws in some backstory about what Qassim wanted with the lamp and an ancient race of sorcerers , something a bit different from most versions of Aladdin that I 've read before , but the point is still the same .
Aladdin needs to fight Qassim and rescue the princess ( who , as you can tell from the third cover , is no damsel in distress either ) .
I did enjoy this version of the tale , scripted by Ian Edginton and illustrated by Patrick Reilly and Stjepan Sejic .
As with the other titles by Radical Comics , the illustrations are not your typical comic - book style and the covers give you a pretty good idea of what the rest of the book looks like .
However , I did feel that the consistency of the artwork left a little to be desired .
Sometimes a lot of the female characters looked very similar ; at other times , a character 's face might change too much from one panel to another .
I did like the djinns and the various beasts and mystical creatures throughout — that 's where the artists really shine .
The dialogue is serviceable but not fantastic ; I can appreciate the difficulty of writing conversations in English that are supposed to sound like they take place in ancient Arabia but there are some passages that just come out clunky .
If you 're a fan of the tale of Aladdin and you 'd like to see a PG - 13 version of it , you might want to check out this three - issue arc .
It 's a bit reminiscent of the current incarnations of the Prince of Persia .
You should be able to pick up the set at your local comics shop , or directly from Radical Comics .
( I 'm sure they 'll show up on Amazon as well but as of this writing only Book One was available . )
Each of the three issues has three different covers as well , so take a look at the options before you buy .

Two words : land sharks .
Arresting imagery and some variations on the story make this a fresh take on Aladdin .

BA has accused union leaders of failing to take up an offer of further talks in an effort to stop the five - day strike by cabin crew starting at midnight .
The airline said it was disappointed Unite had resorted to " negotiation through the media " .
Earlier , Unite 's joint general secretary Tony Woodley offered to call off the latest walkout if travel perks for cabin staff were reinstated .
But BA said it had already agreed to do so once its deal was accepted in full .
Talks were brought to an abrupt end on Saturday evening when left - wing protesters gatecrashed the venue where negotiations were being held .
Mr Woodley appealed to BA boss Willie Walsh via the media on Sunday afternoon , saying : " Willie , turn round and reinstate our people 's travel , without unnecessary vindictive removal of their service , and this union will call off tonight 's strike . "
Unite says the removal of travel concessions for members who went on strike in March is one of the core reasons behind the latest series of four planned walkouts .
' Shocked '
In response to Mr Woodley 's comments , BA issued a statement calling on him to call off the strike and return to the negotiating table .
" We had agreed to a request from [ conciliation service ]
Acas to meet this afternoon and are surprised that Unite did not take advantage of this , " it said .
" We have already offered to reinstate travel concessions to cabin crew once all elements of our offer have been implemented .
" Of more concern to us is Tony Woodley 's comment to the media that he wants to revisit certain proposals in our offer , when previously he had indicated that these were agreed . "
The statement went on to again blame Bassa , the Unite branch representing crew , for the failure to reach an agreement .
Mr Walsh , BA 's chief executive , had earlier told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that he hoped the latest strikes could be averted .
However , he said he was angered by Unite 's other joint leader , Derek Simpson , using Twitter to send out details of Saturday 's talks before and during the interruption by the protesters .
" I was shocked and angry when I found out that Derek was doing that , " he said .
" Sending out his version of events to the wider audience , that really did undermine my confidence in his desire to resolve this situation .
" It is a really serious issue . "
Just how much power does the Unite union actually have in its dispute with British Airways ?
Richard Scott , Transport correspondent
How can BA overpower union ?
Entries on Mr Simpson 's Twitter page , dereksimpsonjgs , on Saturday included " Arguments over the 8 sacked workers , " and " Fear of more sackings to come " .
These were later followed by " If I have to apologise to Willy over twittering then I shall ....
But I am not afraid of saying what is really going on ... " .
Mr Woodley said Mr Walsh was wrong to focus on the Twitter issue .
" If Willie Walsh can travel to the Andrew Marr programme , and be on television [ and ] radio worrying about Twitter , when we can sort out the real issue of travel , along with the agreement and other things , I 'll have to ask him to get his priorities right , " he said .
Contingency plans
Even if the strike is called off later on Sunday , BA 's services next week are still likely to be affected , especially on Monday , as crews and planes may be in the wrong place .
BA has said that if the walkout does go ahead , it plans to fly more than 60,000 customers a day next week , operating 60 % of long - haul flights and 50 % of short - haul services from Heathrow .
It says all flights at London Gatwick and London City will operate as normal .
The airline is intending to lease as many as eight aircraft with pilots and crew from other UK or European carriers .
Earlier this week , BA was granted a court injunction preventing the strikes after the High Court ruled that the Unite union had not reported results of its strike ballot correctly to members .
However , this was overturned on Thursday following an appeal by the union .
In addition to the strike due to start at midnight , two further five - day walkouts by Unite members are scheduled to begin on 30 May and 5 June .
The long - running dispute between BA and Unite cabin crew members centres on jobs , pay and working conditions .
However , after striking workers had their travel concessions removed following the walkouts in March , with others facing disciplinary action , Unite said these issues also had to be addressed in any successful agreement .
Numerous BA cabin crew members rely on travel perks - where they pay 10 % of normal fares - to commute to work from UK cities outside London , or even from mainland Europe .
Most of the Earth 's surface is underwater , where our lungs and fragile bodies can't take us .
Here are the manned and robotic vehicles designed to withstand the extremes of cold and pressure so we can explore it .

The exploration of the underwater wreckage of the RMS Titanic by Dr. Robert Ballard and the subsequent James Cameron film Titanic introduced the world to the technology and the challenges of underwater exploration , but the Titanic lies just 3,800 meters below the ocean 's surface .
Almost 47 % of the ocean lies beyond 4,500 meters .

Sunlight and the heat it creates is almost nonexistent at 200 meters below the surface .
A Seawolf class nuclear sub can't extend past 600 meters .
Once you hit 4,000 meters the temperature is nearly freezing .
At the lowest depths below 6,000 meters , in the hadalpelagic zone , the pressure is eight tons per square inch .
To operate at these depths you need vessels capable of working with almost no heat , no light , and crushing pressures .
There are numerous classifications , but these manned and unmanned vehicles can be generally divided into three categories .
Bathyscaphes
The bathyscaphe is like a submarine but it lacks any propulsion system and utilizes buoyancy and gravity for movement .
The most famous bathyscaphe is the Trieste , which took its inventor Jacques Piccard and Lieutenant Don Walsh near the bottom of the Mariana Trench ( 10,911 meters ) on January 23 , 1960 .
It 's the only time humans have ever visited that depth and it was accomplished using two giant tanks of iron pellets fbecause a normal tank could n't release the water ballast .

Deep - Sea Vehicles
The Deep - Sea Vehicle combines the maneuverability of a submarine with the strength of a bathyscaphe and many can reach between 4,500 and 6,500 meters below the ocean .
The most famous of these vehicles is Alvin , which Dr. Ballard used to explore the Titanic .
It has a crew of three ( a pilot and two scientists ) , two robotic arms for working with tools , video cameras , and bright lamps .
Most importantly , though a DSV still uses gravity / buoyancy to move vertically , it has six reversible thrusters to move around .
Newer vehicles like the Mir and Nautile are capable of going as deep as 6,000 meters .
Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles
The most common underwater vehicle is the unmanned ROV .
These vehicles vary widely in depth rating , size , and purpose .
The majority of the work being done below the surface on the BP oil spill live feed is being done by ROVs .
Some are as small as a lawnmower while others are as large as a Honda .

The largest and most advances ROVs are the " heavy workclass " models like the Hercules used by the National Oceanic And Oceanographic administration and the Institute For Exploration , which are tethered to mother ships and can explore the ocean floor at around 4,000 meters .
They 're made of a special syntatic foam and can carry robotic arms as well as specialized equipment .
A specialized ROV called the Kaiko was launched by Japan and combined the properties of a Bathyscaphe and an ROV to make the deepest unmanned dive at 10,911.4 meters .

Diffing Clojure Forms
Start with Stuart Sierra 's excellent clojure .
walk , ( to sort the maps / sets , ) add Tom Faulhaber 's wonderful Clojure pretty print , and finish it off with Neil Fraser 's magnificent Java diff library : http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/wiki/API, and you 'll find it 's pretty easy to create a function to diff Clojure forms .
Mine 's here :
http://github.com/GeorgeJahad/difform
http://clojars.org/difform
Works like this :
( use ' com.georgejahad.difform ) ( difform { 1 2 3 4 5 6 } { 5 6 1 2 3 7} ) { 1 2 , 3 - 4 + 7 , 5 6}
As you can see , the two forms differ only in the value of key 3 , where it is 4 in the first form and 7 in the second .
For a more interesting example ,
( difform {: cart {:items [ { : new - delivery {:ids [ " - 1 " ]} , :old-unit- price " 700.00 " , : product - id " prod - 1 " , : quantity " 1 " , :unit- price " 700.00 " } ] , :old-total - dollars " 700.00 " , : purchase ?
false , : total - dollars " 700.00 " } , :day " 2010-05 - 18 " , :event-ids [ " 1274166000010:some-session - id -1 " ] , : old - id " 14 " , : delivery {:ids [ nil ]} , : session " some- session - id - 1 " } {:day " 2010 - 05 - 18 " , : old - id " 14 " , : session " some- session - id - 1 " , : delivery nil , : cart {:purchase ?
false , :old-total - dollars " 1400.00 " , :total - dollars " 1400.00 " , :items [ {: product - id " prod - 1 " , :old-unit- price " 700.00 " , : unit- price " 700.00 " , : quantity " 2 " , : new - delivery {:ids [ " - 1 " ] }}]} , :event-ids [ " 1274166000000:some-session -id- 1 " ] } )
produces the following .
Here the values of the quantity , total - dollars , and a few other fields have changed :
{ : cart {:items [ {:new - delivery {:ids [ " - 1 " ]} , :old-unit- price " 700.00 " , : product - id " prod - 1 " , : quantity " - 1 + 2 " , :unit- price " 700.00 " } ] , :old-total - dollars " - 7 + 14 00.00 " , : purchase ?
false , : total - dollars " - 7 + 14 00.00 " } , :day " 2010-05 - 18 " , : delivery - {:ids [ nil - ]} , : event-ids [ " 1274166 + 0 0000 - 1 0:some-session-id-1 " ] , :old-id " 14 " , :session " some-session-id-1 " }
A very common use is with clojure .
test .
For example , if clojure test reports you have failed a test like this :
FAIL in ( xyz - test ) ( xyz_spec.clj : 7 ) expected : ( = form1 form2 )
Run ( difform form1 form2 ) to see what the exact failure was .

“ If you were to have faxed me this balance sheet and asked me to guess who it belonged to , I would have guessed , Citadel , Magnetar or even a proprietary trading desk at a bank . ”
So begins a story by Alexandra Harris of the Medill Journalism school at Northwestern , which , however , does not focus on some exotic product - specialized hedge fund , or some discount window ( taxpayer capital ) backed prop desk ( hedge fund ) at a TBTF bank , but instead at the 61 % underfunded , $ 33.7 billion Illinois Teachers Retirement System ( TRS ) , which just happened to lose $ 4.4 billion in 2009 ( a year when , courtesy of America 's conversion from capitalism to socialism , the market rose 60 % ) , and 5 % in2008 .
Yet underperformance can be explained .
What can not , is that the TRS has now become a shadow AIG .
As Harris notes " TRS is largely on the risky side of the contracts , selling and writing OTC derivatives , including credit default swaps , insurance - like contracts that guarantee payment in the event of a default , that were blamed in part for the 2008 collapse of Lehman Bros. and bailout of insurance giant American International Group Inc. , or AIG . "
Demonstrating just how far the fund is willing to go in the " for broke " category , knowing full well that if it repeats AIG 's implosion , the government will likely bail it out , is the disclosure that a stunning 81.5 % of the fund 's investments are considered risky - this means it is the fourth - riskiest investment portfolio for a pension fund in the U.S !
All it will take is another Flash Crash - like event , or a liquidity crunch , and the 355,000 " full - time , part - time and substitute public school teachers and administrators working outside the city of Chicago " will likely end up with a big , fat donut in their retirement portfolios courtesy of some deranged lunatic , portfolio manager , situated externally at a bank like Goldman Sachs , who in taking a page straight out of Obama 's bailout nation , has decided there is no such thing as risk .
And to those naive enough to think the TRS is the only such fund which has now gone all - in on " no risk and infinite return " , wait until such stories start emerging about every single massively underfunded pension and fully insolvent fund in the US .
From Harris ' report :
Frank Partnoy , a law and finance professor at the University of San Diego who worked on Wall Street as a derivatives structurer in the mid-1990s , said TRS ’s portfolio is an indication that investing is not about what is smart but what will generate the highest returns .
“ It ’s an epic illustration of how we ’ve really gotten lost in financial complexities , ” he said , after studying the Illinois Auditor General 's 2009 audit of TRS and the fund 's March 31 derivatives positions .
TRS said it uses over - the - counter , or privately negotiated , derivatives to maximize the performance of its portfolio and only allows money managers to invest in derivatives if they “ have the appropriate expertise and knowledge and employ sophisticated risk management systems , ” said David Urbanek , public information officer , in an e-mail .
The fact that TRS trustees and investment advisors approved the use of OTC derivatives is n’t , in itself , alarming .
The financial instruments are not explicitly prohibited in the Illinois pension code , and many derivatives contracts provide protection against losses on other investments .
In the balance sheet provided to Medill News Service , TRS ’s OTC derivatives portfolio showed that in addition to writing CDSs , the pension fund was selling swaptions and shorting international - based interest rate swaps .
For each contract written or sold , TRS received a premium .
And as always happens when one collects pennies before a rollercoaster , the spectacular blow up always eventually catches up with you :
Unfortunately for TRS , its OTC positions soured in late April when Greece ’s debt woes worsened , Standard & Poor ’s downgraded Spain ’s debt to AA and the euro dropped to its lowest levels since the currency ’s inception .
The International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank orchestrated a $ 1 trillion bailout to ensure that Greece and the other PIIGS — Portugal , Ireland , Italy and Spain — would not default on their debts .
“ As the European debt crisis worsens , TRS ’ positions are going to bleed money , ” the trader said .
Where it gets even scarier , is that TRS may be fraudulently misrepresenting its massively underwater portfolio :
But the Illinois Teachers ’ Retirement System said if it unwound the OTC trades held in its pension fund today , the positions would have a market value of $ 5 million and a notional value of $ 1.1 billion .
Notional value is the total value of a leveraged financial instrument ’s assets .
It is n’t clear how TRS is valuing its OTC derivatives and market experts , among them Rosenthal , who estimated a loss of $ 515 million as of March 31 , were skeptical the OTC positions could have been showing a net positive notional value .
TRS projects it will have logged a $ 158 million gain from its derivatives portfolio by the June 30 end of fiscal 2010 — with $ 5 million derived from its swaptions , CDS and interest rate swaps positions — and just a fraction of its projected $ 627 million total return .
A significant portion of TRS ’s OTC derivatives are linked to interest rate swaps and those are tied to either the London Interbank Offering Rate or Euro Interbank Offering Rate .
Interest rate swaps stipulate for every basis point tick upward in the LIBOR or EURIBOR , the fund is forced to pay out an interest rate that is two basis points higher .
This is why the notional value of TRS ’s U.S. dollar - and international - based interest rate swaps were in the red by $ 361.4 million at the end of March .
TRS ’ portfolio also includes a large number of swaptions — or the right at a future time to enter into a swap position — which showed a loss of $ 14 million as of March 31 .
In addition , the fund sold approximately $ 154 million worth of CDSs guaranteeing the debt of dozens of companies , countries and states , among them American International Group Inc. , GMAC , Panama , Mexico and California .
( See graphic ) .
A large part of TRS ’s international - based interest rate swaps positions are linked to the Brazilian Interbank Deposit Rate and Euribor in a bet that inflation would stay low in Europe but rise in emerging markets .
Rosenthal , who said TRS appears to be betting that long - term Treasury yields will greatly increase , is incredulous that the fund even has this view .
“ Their job is not to play the [ Treasury ] yield curve , ” Rosenthal said .
“ It ’s not their job to have that view . ”
Swaptions , Euribor exposure , curve trades ?
What the hell happened to buy and hold .
Does TRS really expect to survive this , when there are sharks like Goldman who know every single trade the TRS has on , and one day , sooner rather than later , will destroy it , but not before margin calling it to death in the process .
The logical question of who the hell is supervising this slow motion train crash surprisingly has no answer :
Section 1-109.1. of the Illinois Pension Code states it is the duty of the board of trustees of a retirement system or pension fund to appoint fiduciaries to manage its assets — including the power to acquire and dispose of any assets — as well as assign others as fiduciaries to oversee activities other than asset management .
TRS said it makes day - to - day operational decisions concerning strategic asset allocation , portfolio structure and manager selection , but cedes all of its investment decisions , within TRS parameters , to professional money managers , a list some 60 names long that includes Goldman Sachs Asset Management , JPMorgan Investment Management , Northern Trust Co. and State Street Global Advisors .
When asked which managers were responsible for the pension fund ’s derivatives portfolio , Urbanek , the Illinois TRS spokesman , said OTC derivatives positions are scattered across each asset class because they are “ complementary positions ” within each portfolio .
According to its investment policy , TRS encourages diversification of assets and “ prudent ” risk taking because these strategies align with its long - term investing goals .
“ Increasing risk is rewarded with compensating returns over time . ”
“ They ’re not maintaining effective internal controls , ” Partnoy said .
“ Is it prudent risk - taking to write CDSs on Brazil ? ”
At the end of the day , it appears the fund is doing nothing illegal by essentially offloading front - office duties to Goldman , which of course is happily trading in advance of the fund , to whose books it likely has full exposure , to benefit its own prop trading desk , and reward its own shareholders first and foremost : 63 out of 63 profitable trading days anyone ?
The bottom line , experts say , is that there is no language in the Illinois pension code that prohibits pension funds and retirement systems from buying or selling OTC derivatives as an investment method .
In the event of catastrophic losses , lawsuits would be filed against the fiduciaries , but ultimately taxpayers would be left holding the bag .
And here we see where the next layer of catastrophic systemic collapse will come from : the multi-trillion pension system , which is now invested in the riskiest imaginable products , and whose existence is contingent on a market and economy , both priced to perfection .
The Fed is surely aware of this , and will do everything in its power to prevent a catastrophic collapse .
Yet the Fed always loses the battle at the end of the day .
And if Americans were angry the last time they had to bail out bankers , just wait until it becomes obvious that these very banks blew up the pensions of tens of millions of Americans only so that the very same banks could enjoy at least one more year of record bonuses .
It is not obvious where the next crash will happen .
And it is certain that nothing will be done , as facing the problem would mean recognizing the massive losses already facing the pension system .
And that would be the dominoes that forces yet another round of inevitable mark - to - market , and bank implosions .
The timebomb is now ticking and there are merely seconds left before it goes off .
We have been warned , and will do nothing to stop it .
Facing a growing chorus of dissatisfaction from users , pundits , critics , and lawmakers , Facebook is reportedly holding an all hands meeting on to address the company 's latest privacy backlash .
It 's unknown what the social network intends to discuss at its meeting , but the company may consider temporarily suspending its new Instant Personalization feature , according to All Facebook .
F8
The recent backlash and privacy concerns about Facebook began shortly after the company 's F8 developer 's conference in late April .
During the conference 's keynote speech , Facebook unveiled a variety of new user features , including the universal Like button and Instant Personalization , a feature that allows a Web site to cater to your personal tastes based on information from your Facebook profile .
The social network also unveiled other features such as the Open Graph API and social plugins , all of which are meant to add a social dimension to your user experience as you visit sites outside of Facebook .
When you visit a site like CNN.com , for example , the activity stream plugin can show you a list of actions your Facebook friends have taken on the site such as what articles they have liked or recommended .
The FTC
Less than a week after Facebook unveiled its new features at F8 , four U.S. Senators -- Senators Michael Bennet ( D - Colo . ) , Mark Begich ( D - Alaska ) , Al Franken ( D - Minn. ) , and Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y . ) -- asked the Federal Trade Comission to set privacy rules for online social networks .
The four senators also sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailing their concerns with Facebook 's expansion of publicly available data , the company 's third - party data storage policies , and privacy concerns surrounding the Instant Personalization service .
Then , in early May , the Electronic Privacy Information Center and 14 other public interest groups lodged a formal complaint against Facebook with the FTC .
The goal is to " restore privacy settings that were previously available ... give users meaningful control over personal information , and seek other appropriate injunctive and compensatory relief . "
Chief among the privacy complaints were concerns over the Instant Personalization service , and how difficult Facebook makes it to block the service completely .
The complaint also took issue with Facebook 's decision to make a user 's likes and interests publicly available by default despite the fact that a majority of users signed up for Facebook with the understanding that information would remain private .
The complaint also says Facebook 's Privacy Policy is " designed to confuse users and to frustrate attempts to limit the public disclosure of personal information that many Facebook users choose to share only with family and friends . "
As part of the complaint to the FTC , the public interest groups pointed to user dissatisfaction by listing several user groups that oppose Facebook changes such as the group " Millions Against Facebook 's Privacy Policies and Layout Redesign . "
The group has more than two million Facebook users and informs members of " privacy policy changes and attempts to inform users on how to protect their personal information , " according to the complaint to the FTC .
Scrutiny
There have also been several interesting reports on Facebook 's expanding disclosure of user information .
IBM researcher Matt McKeon posted an interactive graphic entitled " The Evolution of Privacy on Facebook , " which shows how making user information public by default has progressed over time .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Deeplinks Blog posted a timeline showing how Facebook 's privacy policies have changed .
Finally , on Thursday , The New York Times posted its own graphic called " Facebook Privacy : A Bewildering Tangle of Options " that says you need to click through " 50 settings with more than 170 options " to fully manage your privacy on Facebook .
Statements in the media
Attempting to confront concerns over Facebook and privacy issues , several Facebook executives have made public statements in recent weeks .
In an interview with Computerworld , Ethan Beard , director of Facebook 's developer network defended Facebook , saying that user response to Facebook 's expanded features had been " overwhelmingly positive . "
Several days later , responding to user questions in The New York Times , Elliot Schrage , vice president for public policy at Facebook , acknowledged user concerns over Facebook 's recent changes , and said the social network intends to improve its " efforts to provide better guidance to those confused about how to control sharing and maintain privacy . "
Perhaps Thursday's all hands meeting is the beginning of Facebook 's effort to improve user guidance on issues of sharing and privacy as Schrage mentioned , or maybe the company is considering a roll back of new features as All Facebook suggests .
Regardless , it will be interesting to see if Facebook announces any changes to its new features in the coming days , as the network attempts to deal with recent criticisms over its new features and data sharing policies .

I ’ve been watching this story for a while now , and it just keeps getting weirder and weirder .
I ’m not really sure what to make of it .
Of course it comes from South Carolina , the state that pretty much invented weirdness in politics — from the infamous smear campaign against McCain in 2000 , to introducing the phrase “ hiking the Appalachian Trail ” into politics — but those things actually made sense compared to this .
I ’m talking , of course , about the Democratic primary for senator in South Carolina , won by Alvin Greene .
You can easily be forgiven if you have no idea who Alvin Greene is .
Neither do most voters in South Carolina , even though they apparently voted for him .
Candidate Green is unemployed , has absolutely no political experience , attended no political events , gave no interviews , raised no money , had no staff , and did n’t run any ads .
It is n’t even clear how he came up with the $ 10,440 required to register as a candidate , and he is n’t talking .
He never filed any of the required reports with the Federal Election Commission .
Not only that , but Greene was discharged “ involuntarily ” from the Army , and was arrested in November on a felony obscenity charge .
But he won nonetheless , upsetting the expected winner , Vic Rawl , who is a state representative .
Fundamental to the senselessness of this is its meaninglessness .
It is n’t like Democrat Greene has much chance to win over incumbent Senator Jim DeMint , who is a reasonably popular Republican in one of the most right - wing states .
So why would it be worth any shenanigans ?
Suggested explanations include the idea that Greene was a Republican plant who was given the money to register .
This idea has merit , given that there is strong evidence that in another race in South Carolina a candidate was a Republican plant .
But given that frontrunner Rawl had virtually zero chance against DeMint , why bother ?
The only explanation I can believe is that this can be blamed on faulty voting machines .
Indeed , 25 precincts show that Greene received more votes than were officially cast .
And tallies of absentee ballots differed wildly from tallies from the voting machines .
Political statistics site 538.com has not one but two posts about how the results in this race make absolute no sense , and are likely fraudulent .
South Carolina uses voting machines from ES&S , machines that have a number of widely known flaws .
These machines produce no printed record , so there is no way to determine what actually happened .
Why is anyone still using these notoriously insecure and bug - ridden machines ?
UPDATE : Greene gives a bizarre interview on CNN :
UPDATE 2 : FiveThirtyEight.com has an article about this , that ends with the interesting line , saying about Greene “ And there ’s no way he can beat DeMint…unless there ’s something really wrong with those South Carolina voting machines .
Would n’t that be funny ? ”
Yes , that would be very funny , indeed !

Electronic signals from Sunderland 's boat indicate it is drifting at just 1 mph , which means it still is afloat but not under sail , said Jeff Casher , an engineer on her support team .
The mast might have fallen or Sunderland could have been injured ,
preventing her from sailing , he said .

[ Updated at 4:20 p.m. ET ]
Abby Sunderland 's family is scrambling to persuade any government with an aircraft in the area to help find the 16 - year - old sailor , family spokesman Christian Pinkston told CNN .
The California teen 's 40 - foot boat was in the Indian Ocean , about 2,000 miles east of Madagascar and 2,000 miles west of Australia , when distress signals started coming from the boat Thursday morning California time , Pinkston said .
No one has been able to contact Sunderland since then .
Sunderland began her journey from Marina del Rey , California , on January 23 with the goal of sailing her 40 - foot boat around the world solo and without stopping .
Mechanical troubles forced her to make two stops for repairs , including in Cape Town , South Africa , in early May .
Sunderland 's family was told at about 5 a.m. PT about the distress signals .
The family had spoken to her just one hour earlier , and although she was in rough seas , she was not in distress at that time , according to Pinkston .
The closest boat - a private fishing vessel - is 40 hours away , according to Pinkston .
The distress signals came from two manually activated distress beacons , Sunderland 's family said on her blog Thursday afternoon .
When they were talking with her Thursday morning , she told them she had just had a rough sailing day , with winds of up to 60 knots and seas of up to 25 feet , though the winds had subsided to about 35 knots , according to the blog .
" We are actively seeking out some sort of air rescue but this is difficult due to the remoteness of her location , " the family 's blog post said .
" Australian Search and Rescue have arranged to have a [ Qantas ] Airbus fly over her location at first light ( she is 11 hours later ) .
They will not be able to help her other than to talk via marine radio if they are able to get close enough .
Hopefully , they will be able to assess her situation and report back to us . "
The post also said Abby " has all of the equipment on board to survive a crisis situation like this . "
" She has a dry suit , survival suit , life raft , and ditch bag with emergency supplies , " the family 's post said .
" If she can keep warm and hang on , help will be there as soon as possible . "
The Australian coast guard and the Reunion Island government - a French island that is the closest land to her last position - are involved in efforts to help Sunderland , according to Peter Thomas , a freelance journalist who spoke to Sunderland 's father Thursday .
[ Posted at 2:09 p.m. ET ]
A teenage girl attempting to sail solo around the world has gone missing after sending out distress signals in the Indian Ocean , according to a CNN affiliate in her hometown .
Abby Sunderland , 16 , of Thousand Oaks , California , has not been heard from since losing contact with her family during a storm Thursday , her brother told CNN affiliate KTLA in Los Angeles .
Sunderland activated her emergency beacon locating devices an hour after losing contact with her family , and a rescue effort is under way .
The nearest boat is believed to be at least 40 hours away , according to KTLA .
Sunderland celebrated passing the halfway point Monday on her quest to circumnavigate the globe alone in a sailboat , according to her website .
She initially planned to be the youngest to make the trip nonstop , but that was undone in early May when she stopped for repairs in South Africa .
" I 've been in some rough weather for awhile with winds steady at 40 - 45 knots with higher gusts , " she wrote Wednesday on her blog .
It took her two hours to repair a torn sail in the wind and high waves , and her internet connection on board her 40 - foot boat , Wild Eyes , was failing , she wrote .

NEW YORK – With the clock ticking towards a June 26 contract deadline , thousands of unionized supermarket workers are negotiating in an attempt to avoid a strike , but their employers at Stop and Shop , King Kullen and Pathmark are refusing to budge .
Their union , United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500 , represents more than 16,000 workers at the three supermarket chains .
The contract negotiations and potential strike affect stores across the city , and in neighboring Westchester , Putnam and Dutchess counties and Long Island , with possible repercussions in New Jersey and Connecticut .
As of press time , the union has called for mediation .
Local 1500 has alerted consumers to the possibility of a strike .
With the July 4 holiday weekend approaching , the union is urging the public to make plans to buy their cookout ingredients and supplies at other supermarkets .
“ Customers have a right to know what is happening , ” Greg Purcell , a UFCW spokesperson , said .
“ No shopper should feel comfortable putting their deli , bakery , floral or produce orders in the hands of a supermarket whose workers are on strike . ”
The supermarkets have told consumers not to worry , saying they have contingency plans in place .
These plans , however , would have to include a huge number of scab workers , a move that would be an open attack on labor .
The area the markets serve is home to over 1 million union households , who would likely not cross picket lines .
The union says a “ contingency ” scab workforce would reduce the quality of the supermarkets ’ services .
“ You ca n’t replace 80 percent of your workforce expecting to deliver the same quality products and customer service shoppers demand from Stop and Shop and the two other supermarkets , ” Greg Pasqual , a Stop and Shop worker from Duchess County , said in a statement .
“ We need to avoid this strike so no one , especially our customers , will have their holiday weekend ruined , ” he said .
There are four main sticking points in the dispute : pensions , pay , health care and the situation of part - time workers .
The union contends that the cost of everything has gone up , while workers ’ wages have remained stagnant , and management has been pushing for givebacks in health care .
Further , the workers ’ pension fund is less than 80 percent funded , and the union and management have to come to an agreement to reach full funding , as required by law .
In a display of solidarity between full - time workers and part - timers , groups that have been played against each other by management in other struggles , the union is fighting for a guarantee of more hours for part - time workers .
Workers at Stop and Shop and King Kullen will take a strike authorization vote on June 23 .
Workers at Pathmark will do the same on June 25 .
The strike motions are expected to pass .
New York Jobs with Justice and other progressive organizations have urged the public to help avoid a strike by pushing management to accept what are seen as the just demands of the workers .
Jobs with Justice is asking people to “ contact the store manager at your local Stop and Shop , Pathmark or King Kullen and ask them to negotiate in good faith and simply provide the workers with a fair contract they deserve . ”

Through its Get Game Smart initiative , Microsoft held an Xbox 360 video game night for members of Congress and the Greater Washington Boys & Girls Club this week , in an attempt to bring awareness to family - friendly gaming and share tips for managing digital media consumption .
The program was sponsored by a bipartisan group of four Congressional representatives : Mike Rogers ( R - MI ) , Bobby Scott ( D - VA ) , John Shimkus ( R - IL ) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - FL ) .
Some 150 representatives , staff , and family members attended , along with Boys & Girls Club members and their parents .
Congresswoman Wasserman Shultz said video games and the internet encompass a wide range of experiences , and parents must learn how to effectively shape their children 's usage .
" There is no greater mission than protecting our kids , " she said in a statement released after the event .
" By working together with groups like Get Game Smart , we can ensure that our children experience these new technologies in a way that is safe , healthy and most of all fun . "
Microsoft provided all - ages Xbox 360 games like The Beatles : Rock Band , Lips : Number One Hits , and Forza Motorsport 3 , as well as the Xbox 360 and PC " visual programming " creation took Kodu .
Also featured were demonstrations on using Xbox 360 parental controls and timers , as well as explanations of Entertainment Software Rating Board ratings .
" Bringing parental involvement and industry together is vital in order to help protect children from inappropriate graphic violence and sexual situations , " said Congressman Shimkus .
" Games have moved well beyond Pong and Atari from my youth , and we must ensure that all the necessary information is being provided to help parents and their children enjoy appropriate entertainment . "

WASHINGTON , June 21 ( UPI ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court , in a 6 - 3 ruling , determined Monday that the U.S. government 's ability to criminalize material support for terrorists is constitutional .
The ruling was written by Chief Justice John Roberts .
It keeps intact a provision of the Patriot Act despite arguments that it threatened free speech of organizations wanting to assist non-violent activities of groups listed on the U.S. terror watch list -- in this case the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , identified as PKK for Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan , and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka .

The Humanitarian Law Project and similar groups argued they were involved in peaceful , legal activities of the PKK and the LTTE , but the court said providing money for non-violent purposes could free up resources for terrorist acts .
The decision affirmed in part and reversed in part a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling , sending it back for further adjudication .
The high court concluded that , as applied in this case to these individuals and groups , the Patriot Act statute in question does n't violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment .
Roberts said the court was n't deciding whether future applications of the material - support statute to speech or advocacy would survive a First Amendment challenge .
" It simply holds that ( the statute ) does not violate the freedom of speech as applied to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide , " Roberts wrote .
Roberts also rejected the argument that the material - support statute violated a plaintiff 's right to freedom of association because , citing the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling , it " does not penalize mere association , but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist groups material support . "
Roberts said the government , represented by Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagen as solicitor general , erred in arguing the only thing at issue was content , not speech , and incorrectly cited the standard of review .
The statute in question " regulates plaintiffs ' speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its content , " Roberts wrote .
" Even if the material support statute generally functions as a regulation of conduct , as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message . "
In his dissent , Justice Stephen Breyer said that , while agreeing that the statute was not vague , " I cannot agree with the court 's conclusion that the Constitution permits the government to prosecute the plaintiffs criminally for engaging in coordinated teaching and advocacy furthering the designated organizations ' lawful political objectives . "
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor joined Breyer in dissent .
Justices Antonin Scalia , John Paul Stevens , Anthony Kennedy , Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas joined Roberts .
UK's £ 20 bn bill for fighting Iraq and Afghan wars
Fighting the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq alongside the U.S. has cost British taxpayers more than £ 20 billion since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 , it emerged yesterday .
The bill includes £ 18 billion for military operations as well as paying for overseas development and aid .
However the £ 20.34 billion total , revealed for the first time in official Whitehall figures , does not include the salaries of soldiers or paying for their long - term injuries and mental health care .
It is also on top of the £ 35 billion annual defence budget .
Costly war : British soldiers on patrol in Helmand province
Afghanistan , where operations began in October 2001 , has cost more than Iraq to finance , with £ 11.1 billion spent on the conflict so far .
The total includes £ 1.2 billion on humanitarian , reconstruction and development aid .
THE PRICE OF WAR
All figures are in millions of pounds unless otherwise stated .
IRAQ ( total across all departments )
2002-03 - £ 866.3 m
2003 -04 - £ 1570.8m
2004-05 - £ 1084.6 m
2005 -06 - £ 1139.6 m
2006 -07 - £ 1148.2m
2007-08 - £ 1584.3 m
2008-09 - £ 1470.55 m Ministry of Defence alone ( from Treasury reserve ) 2009 - 10 - £ 358 m ( estimated )
Department for International Development 2009 - 10 - £ 20 m
TOTAL : £ 9.24bn
AFGHANISTAN
Ministry of Defence ( from Treasury reserve )
2001 -02 - £ 221m
2002-03 - £ 311m
2003 -04 - £ 46 m
2004-05 - £ 67 m
2005 -06 - £ 199 m
2006 -07 - £ 742m
2007-08 - £ 1,490m
2008-09 - £ 2,623m
2009 - 10 - £ 4,200 m ( estimated )
Total : £ 9,899 m Humanitarian , reconstruction and development assistance
2001 - 10 - £ 1,200 million TOTAL : £ 11.1bn COST OF BOTH WARS = £ 20.34bn
With no withdrawal date from Afghanistan for Britain 's 10,000 troops , the costs are set to rise further .
Former Chancellor Alistair Darling revealed in March that £ 4billion had been set aside for Afghanistan this year .
Fighting the war in Iraq cost more than £ 8.2 billion , while £ 557 million was given to the country - for development .
The Foreign Office also spent £ 283 million on diplomacy in Iraq and Whitehall spent a further £ 147 million on other programmes such as the ' conflict prevention pool ' .
It took the total bill for Iraq , which was invaded in March 2003 and where combat operations ended in April last year , to £ 9.24 billion .
Critics of the wars condemned the figures .
Former London mayor Ken Livingstone said the cost of the war in Afghanistan would have funded free tuition in English universities for ten years .
But defence experts argued that the costs were bound to be high .
Professor Malcolm Chalmers , a defence analyst with the Royal United Services Institute , said :
' They have been long and sustained operations in difficult geographical locations .
' Simply maintaining thousands of people in such a location takes a lot of money on logistics before you have even started . '
The true cost of the war will become clear only in the decades to come when troops suffering long - term mental and physical injuries seek treatment .
NEW CHIEF GENERAL SIR DAVID RICHARDS
General Sir David Richards
General Sir David Richards is tipped to become the new head of the Armed Forces after impressing David Cameron with his call for urgent change in Afghanistan .
The country 's top general is set to become the new Chief of the Defence Staff in the autumn when Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup stands down .
General Richards , who has 40 years of military experience , has called for an end to suggestions that Britain will pull out of Afghanistan imminently .
He wants more ' boots on the ground ' in the country .
His appointment could signal a longer haul in Afghanistan for troops , as he has called for Nato allies to help build schools and clinics and create good local governance in volatile Helmand province .
opinion
If there is one thing I have learnt conclusively over the past few months , it is that Australians feel pretty intensely about the growing electronic book phenomenon .
This lesson has been pounded into me , slowly , but gradually and repetitively , from multiple angles , like Iron Man ’s Tony Stark pounding massive pieces of steel together into a giant suit of comprehension .
Only without so much champagne and flunkies .
Firstly , it would be safe to say that virtually everyone in Australia ’s book publishing universe has now called me about the eBook feature I published back in February .
Most of the publishers and retailers have called .
Authors have called .
eBook reader manufacturers have called .
And representatives of publisher and author organisations have called .
If you have n’t called me about the article yet , and you work in Australia ’s publishing industry , please do – I would love to chat about that article .
In fact , I have a script that I can read from which has prepared answers for everything you could say or ask .
I have been called about this article so many times that I have prepared a formula to make each call more efficient .
Then there are the readers .
There seems to be a trend over the past few months that any article I write about eBooks attracts more comments and page impressions in general than other articles .
It ’s as if attaching the “ eBook ” tag to an article is like sprinkling it with a tiny golden shower of magic dust .
Kind of like the sort of stuff that happens in Enid Blyton .
I ’d say this eBook interest probably stems from the happy conflux of three trends affecting Australia .
Firstly , as Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows , Australians are big readers .
In the 2003 /04 financial year , Australians bought some 80 million new books , with a total value of $ 1.4 billion .
The overwhelming percentage of those books were sold from actual bookstores , instead of to casual browsers in supermarket checkout lines , for example .
If you speak to Australians about books , they will gladly tell you about how they fondly remember reading something like Colin Thiele ’s Storm Boy or The Magic Pudding in their childhood – and maybe John Marsden ’s Tomorrow When the War Began series .
Later on they will tell you about how influential Tim Winton ’s novels – the most notable of which is Cloudstreet – has been in their thinking about Australia .
Others ( myself included ) will proudly show you their massive science fiction and fantasy collection and rant about how depressed they were when Robert Jordan tragically passed away before he could finish The Wheel of Time , and how happy they are now that Brandon Sanderson is completing the series .
Yes , Australians love books .
But Australians also love technology .
Both in corporate IT departments and in our personal lives , Australians love to get the latest gear in to tinker with .
Perhaps the pinnacle of joy many adult Australian males could feel would be to be clustered around a BBQ on the beach with their mates , a beer in one hand , proudly displaying the new iPhone that they lined up overnight in the freezing cold to pay mega - dollars for .
It ’s a rite of passage .
( There is one pinnacle currently higher – to be the one to pull out a HTC Desire and tell the iPhone owner how they are nothing but a stooge to Steve Jobs .
There is nothing Australians love more than one - upping each other . )
But there is a dark side to these two loves that Australians have – technology and books .
More than anything else , Australians get frustrated when – due to our geographical isolation compared to major population centres in the US and Europe – we get something late , or not at all , or it is overpriced .
This especially applies to technology and books .
And when you take the two together – whoah , boy , there is a problem .
If you could sum up Australia ’s attitude to eBooks at the moment , it would be something like : “ We would , if we could , but we can ’t . ”
That is , as I was discussing with a professional colleague yesterday , it is not possible in Australia ( even with the Amazon Kindle ) to get most of your reading done electronically , despite the obvious maturity of the technology , because there are many publishing industry restrictions stopping Australians from getting the right level of access to eBooks .
This is causing a great angst out there in the Australian population .
We do n’t want to be the country that is left behind in the eBook revolution .
Ideally , we want to be leading it .
Book publishers who understand this mostly hidden tidal force of anger and who can leverage their operations in a way that they can harness it , will be able to make millions and millions and garner themselves an immense amount of goodwill from Australians .
Book publishers who ignore Australia , on the other hand , will find themselves swept out to ocean as that powerful undercurrent of annoyance takes more visible force .

It 's commonly believed in Louisiana that the president 's declaration of a six - month moratorium on new drilling off the state 's coast is " a bigger blow than Katrina or the BP spill . "
Local pols are competing to see who can condemn the moratorium the lousest , shouting to any nearby mic or camera about the jobs it 's going to cost .
Not just the predictable Republican corp stooges , either .
Unable to find a mic or camera on the weekend , Charlie Melancon wrote an LTE to the Times - Pic Sunday , declaring
Offshore drilling stands at the very foundation of Louisiana 's economy , and this fight is too important to be sidetracked by Washington politics or partisan games .
Yes .
Washington politics .
That buttinsky federal government , perfectly personified in the socialist Dr. Evil , President Obama .
He 's killing our jobs !
Stand at the border with your ear cocked and you can almost hear them :
Point of fact , the president 's just momentarily stunning our jobs .
The kill needle is next up the chute , gripped in the invisible hand every pol looooooves to kiss : the free market .
Mowbray 's article points out what should be obvious to all , particularly to market - lovers : the Deepwater Horizon disaster is going to kill jobs in the drilling sector even if the president lifts the moratorium tomorrow , because the effects of this hell are already being factored into the cost of doing business .
DRILLING INSURANCE COSTS SET TO SKYROCKET
Impact could dwarf moratorium 's Insurance costs for deepwater drilling are poised to rise by as much as 50 percent after the Deepwater Horizon disaster , and the increases are sharp enough that it could make some exploration and production projects too expensive no matter what happens with new regulations in Washington .
. . .
The impact is particularly potent in deepwater , meaning depths of greater than 1,000 feet , the areas of the Gulf of Mexico that hold the most remaining oil reserves .
Drilling in deepwater is more price - sensitive than other types of oil exploration , because it requires expensive state - of - the - art equipment , detailed analysis of hard - to - reach geology and long planning horizons for projects .
Many deepwater exploration and production projects are viable only when oil prices are expected to remain high , so increases in the costs of drilling could render some projects unfeasible .
Currently , many oil companies self - insure their wells , or use " captive " insurers , ostensively independent companies whose sole raison d'etre is to act as underwriters for particular companies .
With the economic hit of the Deepwater Horizon disaster sure to top even the $ 10 billion cap that business - friendly Republicans like David Vitter are willing to set for oil hell liability , this in - house insurance will have to be augmented with real coverage from real insurers , kicking the cost of covering wells up by half or more .
The repercussions will mean oil companies will have to make tough decisions on which fields to lease and drill .
Economic reality , the unfettered market , will inevitably mean some holes just wo n't get poked , and the pokers will get fewer jobs .
That 's how capitalism works , right ?
Oh , we have options .
We could simply lift the moratorium and allow drilling , in shallow water or deep , with no change in regulations and let stand the $ 75 million damages cap , in effect telling the oil companies that hells like the Macondo lease blowout are perfectly acceptable , but even the Vitters of the world are n't about to grab a third rail like that .
We could embrace a higher cap and tougher regulations and let the price of oil come closer to matching its cost , letting the market function as it was designed .
Then again , for a camera - mad pol , where 's the fun -- or electoral advantage -- in patiently explaining that capitalism really is a game with rules , a game that yields winners and losers ?
Really , is n't it ever so much easier to just blame the president ?
A very sad postscript :
The first link here leads to a diary entitled " Oilies . "
I wrote it back in May , when the extent of the oil hell was just becoming clear .
In that post , I speculated on the possible diaspora of Louisianians left jobless or otherwise unable to continue life here .
At the time , I was thinking mostly of people in the fishing , oil and maritime sectors .
Which goes to show Cassandra was an optimist .
Today , GF got an email from her friends at BECA Gallery , an immensely important contemporary art exhibition space that opened in New Orleans after the flood .
It reads , in part :
Dear friends and supporters ,
We are writing to let you know that we will be relocating our offices , at least temporarily .
For the past two months , until the last week of this past May , we were busy viewing new larger exhibition space opportunities here in New Orleans with hopes of locating an intermediate sized space to better accommodate our future exhibitions while working on planning / developing the larger scale BECA ICAD exhibition facility .
On the heels of the closing of our May exhibition ' FUTURE FORWARD ' , the horrible and catastrophic oil spill disaster in the gulf turned into a personal nightmare for one of our volunteer directors , Melissa Roberts .
During the last week of May , Melissa began experiencing a sudden onset of a burning throat and difficulty swallowing whenever she went outdoors .
No other symptoms that would be associated with allergies , etc. were present .
Since she had experienced allergies in the past , she knew that what she was experiencing was not anything that she had previously experienced .
Within the next week we began hearing from dozens of others experiencing the same symptoms here in New Orleans and after contacting both poison control and the LA Dept. of Public Health as well as the LA Dept. of Environmental Quality , she was told , " Your symptoms are to be expected because of the spill and the dispersants and you should stay indoors " .
Our questions were , " For how long and why is this OK and why are n't there adequate health advisories being dispatched outside of ' stay indoors ' ?
We took a short trip out west for possible relief for Melissa and to our relief and disappointed , she was able to breathe without difficulty the entire time she was away .
The difference was enough for us to make an emergency decision to begin a relocation plan until we 've learned more from independent scientists about what is actually unfolding .
As the days and weeks began to unfold , the nightmare became all of our personal nightmares with no real action nor solid leadership from the federal government and with criminals left in charge of the crime scene .
As we finalize our relocation plans to remove ourselves from what 's blowing in from the oil spill , the toxic dispersants and now the massive burn offs , we are learning that hundreds of people along the gulf coast and inland are now experiencing a variety of adverse health effects : http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/...
We are remaining hopeful that we will one day be able to return here to New Orleans .
BECA directors and volunteers have made many personal and financial sacrifices since we opened a small gallery space back in Jan. 2008 to help contribute to the renewal of the arts here in NOLA .
Being forced out of your home is unfair and unacceptable but we can thank BP 's negligence for creating the mess that we all must now deal with in the manner which makes the most sense to each of us individually .
Those with pre-existing health problems seem to be having the most problems with the chemicals , etc. in the air .
Our volunteer director , Melissa Roberts , who was diagnosed with SLE Lupus 10 years ago , has been forced to stay indoors as much as possible since she first began experiencing adverse reactions the last week of May .
It seemed to coincide with the spray area of BP 's aerial spraying of the toxic dispersant moving closer to shore , but we have no real way to know for certain .
The changes wrought by The Hell have barely begun . . .
ISLAM CONVERT : Jason Osborne says Corrections ' claim that he could n't do community work because he had to pray is incorrect , but that he could not work among filth at a rubbish dump , as he was required to do .
A muslim has claimed he could not do community work because he needs to pray five times a day , away from non-believers .
Jason Osborne , 30 , screamed and threatened Corrections staff when he was being inducted into a sentence of 300 hours ' community work on December 30 .
He was given the sentence in Hastings District Court for failing to pay fines of $ 15,334 .
Jason Osborne
He appeared in court on Thursday to plead guilty to failing to complete the community work and on another charge of driving while suspended .
He appeared in the dock with a white cloth draped over his head .
According to a summary of facts , Osborne had told a senior community work supervisor in Hastings that he needed to pray five times a day and would not do that in front of non-Muslims .
He was told no preferential treatment would be given because of religious beliefs .
Osborne punched a table and shouted that he would not pray in front of non-Muslims .
He then stepped towards the supervisor with clenched fists .
When he was told to leave , he entered the reception area and shouted : " I am a Muslim .
I need to pray five times a day . "
Judge Tony Adeane remanded him in custody overnight so a report could be completed .
When he reappeared in court yesterday , his lawyer said Osborne had found a probation officer who did not mind him praying and that he had completed 50 hours of community work in the past three weeks .
Judge Adeane said the court was a secular institution and he was unsure what sentence could be given that would meet Osborne 's religious beliefs .
He granted Osborne bail for eight weeks to allow him to complete the sentence .
Yesterday , Osborne told The Dominion Post that the summary of facts was " fabricated " by Corrections .
The Muslim prayer timetable would mean he had to pray twice during a working day , not five times , and he had not told staff he needed to pray away from non-Muslims .
His sole objection was to being sent to a rubbish dump to do his community work because his religion forbade him from praying " in filth " .
" I was stressing out .
They wanted me to separate all the rubbish in the recycling area . "
He started doing community work when he was told he would go to prison if he did not .
He had since found a supervisor who allowed him to do his community work at family attraction Splash Planet , which was clean enough for his prayers .
Osborne , who has five children , said he had not offended since converting to Islam last August .
Corrections Hawke's Bay area manager George Henderson said Osborne had been given permission to pray while doing community work .
" Each case concerning religious observances is considered on a case by case basis , taking into account the ability of the offender to comply with the sentence imposed by the court , any likelihood of reoffending and any risk of harm to others , " Mr Henderson said .
The president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand , Anwar -ul Ghani , said people should not offend in the first place , but if they did it was understandable that they would want to pray to repent .
Clean places to pray could be found at most places , including a rubbish dump , and Muslims did not need to be away from non-Muslims when praying , he said .
" You can pray in front of anybody . "
MUSLIM PRAYERS
Muslims pray five times a day , each prayer lasting five to 10 minutes .
While praying they must :
Be confident of the time of prayer .
Being unsure invalidates the prayer even if the time turns out to be correct .
Face east , with the chest facing the direction of Mecca .
The ill are allowed leniency with posture .
Cover all intimate parts of the body .
Ensure clothes and body and the place of prayer are clean .
Cleanse using water or sand and use a prayer mat if possible .
South Lyon , MI - Ryan Petry had a plan to avoid helping his family with computer problem on Mother ’s Day Sunday , and executed it flawlessly .
“ I knew , going in , it was going to be tough to avoid doing computer work , because my mom had called on Saturday and said that her computer was running slow .
I did n’t let that discourage me though .
I promised myself no computer work this weekend , ” said Petry .
Petry works in the IT Department at Globochem fixing computers five days a week .
“ With my job , the last thing I want to do on a holiday is fix computers .
I tell my family that , but they never listen , ” he said .
The 24 - year - old ITT grad wanted to avoid a situation similar to what happened during Easter where instead of looking for hidden eggs , he spent the whole time removing malware from his dad ’s laptop .
Petry is n’t comfortable with conflict , so he devised a plan that avoided any .
He studied websites that gave tips on avoiding people at parties , redirecting conversation and faking an upset stomach .
“ On Sunday my mom tried to trick me by asking me to come to the office so she could tell me a secret , but I faked some diarrhea to get out of there , ” said Petry .
" A little bit later my dad brought out his laptop to ' show me some pictures , ' but I successfully started a family argument by bringing up his affair ten years ago .
Old wounds can be useful tools . "
Karen Petry , Ryan ’s mom , felt disappointed in her son .
“ You could tell he went to tech school and not acting school with the whole diarrhea thing .
If he ’s not going to fix our computers then I ’m not sure why we should invite him to these gatherings , but please do n’t tell him that . ”
Ryan hopes to chronicle his success on his blog , so other geeks can learn from his experience .
“ I ’d much rather help random people on the Internet than my family , ” he said .

The electoral consequences of large fiscal adjustments
Alberto Alesina , Giampaolo Lecce , Dorian Carloni
The market turmoil in recent weeks pose a key question : can European governments credibly commit to cutting their deficits ?
This column presents evidence that fiscal adjustments do not increase the likelihood of electoral defeat for incumbent governments .
Europe ’s fiscal problems can be solved – it is now up to today ’s leaders to step up .
The conventional wisdom about the political economy of fiscal adjustments is that deficit reduction policies cause recessions .
Recessions , combined with the direct political costs of tax increases and spending cuts create serious problems for incumbent governments at the polls .
The governments which raise taxes or cut spending – the latter especially in Europe – are voted out of office .
Therefore Europe is doomed to failure .
Fiscally responsible governments which try to cut spending will lose elections and fiscally irresponsible ones will survive and fiscal problems will persist or worsen .
Conventional but wrong
This view is conventional but vastly incorrect .
First of all a large literature starting with Giavazzi and Pagano ( 1990 ) has shown that large fiscal adjustments can be expansionary .
Recently Alesina and Ardagna ( 2010 ) have provided the latest piece of evidence on this issue showing that , indeed , fiscal adjustments based upon spending cuts are more successful ( i.e. lead to more stable consolidations of the budget ) and cause less contraction of the economy than tax increases .
In fact more often than not spending cuts boost growth even in the very short run .
But what about the electoral consequences ?
Alesina et al. ( 1998 ) found no clear evidence suggesting that governments which reduce budget deficits decisively are routinely voted out of office .
Some are .
Many are not .
But that paper stopped with data at the early nineties .
What happened next ?
This is the topic of our work in progress ( Alesina et al. 2010 ) .
Here we look at the largest cases of fiscal adjustments in the last 25 years in Western Europe as compiled by Gros and Alcidi ( 2010 ) in a recent Vox column and we look at their political consequences1 .
The point of these authors was that large adjustments of the size needed today in Europe are economically feasible , but politically ?
We list as “ government changes ” the cases when there was a change in the political orientation of the government with or without an election during the adjustment period .
We list as “ no change ” cases in which an election was followed by the reappointment of the same party or coalition or there was a new government of the same party without an election .
In the Gros and Alcidi sample we find 13 government changes and 26 no changes , thus the changes were 33 % of the total .
Is this high or low ?
In the sample of these countries from 1975 to today there were about 39 % of government changes over the total .
So there were slightly fewer changes during fiscal adjustments than in the entire sample .
This difference is probably not statistically significant but certainly there is no evidence that fiscal adjustments lead to a higher likelihood of defeat .
Also we do not find any pattern of more electoral losses for government which cut spending more than taxes .
In fact the third column of Table 1 reports the share of change in deficit obtained with spending cuts ; when it greater than 100 it means that taxes were actually cut during the adjustments .
Of the three countries with a share of spending cuts about 100 two had no government change during the period ( Ireland and Belgium ) , the third country ( the Netherland ) had two but in a decade .
The three countries with the lowest cut in spending ( Italy , France , and Greece ) had 5 government changes and 7 no changes – a frequency of changes well higher than the average .
The bottom line is that it is possible for fiscally responsible governments to engage in large fiscal adjustments and survive politically .
Moreover , acting on the spending side is no more costly that doing on the tax side .
A sense of urgency because of impending crisis , a bit of time between the adjustment and the next election , good communication with the public , are ingredients that help .

Conclusion
Fiscal problems in Europe can be solved .
Large adjustments based on the spending side work , they are not recessionary and are not the kiss of death for the governments implementing them .
It can be done .
If the fiscal crisis in Europe worsens , threatening the world recovery , we will know whom to blame : the current leaders of Europe .

The Girdwood Forest Fair committee has made a decision to cancel the 45th annual Girdwood Forest Fair .
This decision was based out of respect for the community of Girdwood .
The GFF committee is United on prioritizing the safety of our community and the Alaskans who recreate in our valley .
While we are hopeful this situation will show great improvements by July , we are not willing to risk the safety of our community , vendors and patrons .

A version of the following correction is published in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday 13 May 2010 Referring to the Adam Boulton - Alastair Campbell encounter , the column below described one of the parties as " hysterically queenly and psychotically aggressive " .
The Guardian 's style guide states that terms such as psychotic should be used only in a medical context .
This was the day on which Westminster finally tumbled down the rabbit hole .
Were you searching for a vignette in which the hilarious arse - about - titness of it all was crystallised , you could do worse than the contretemps between Alastair Campbell and Adam Boulton on the green outside the Houses of Parliament .
Put it this way : Sky News viewers were treated to a live dust - up between two men , one of whom was hysterically queenly and psychotically aggressive and turned puce , and the other of whom was Alastair Campbell .
Reviewing the Raging Boul footage , it appears to be Campbell 's suggestion that the Sky News political editor was personally disappointed that David Cameron was not yet prime minister that caused Adam 's rag to be well and truly lost .
" Do n't keep saying what I think ! " he shouted , jabbing his finger and looking for all the world like it would be his fist next .
" Do n't keep saying what I think !
I 'm fed up with you telling me what I think !
I do n't think that ! "
" Calm down , calm down , " chided Campbell , apparently channelling Michael Winner .
" This is live on television . "
" Do n't tell me what I think ! " shrieked Boulton .
They had to cut away eventually .
Any other news ?
Well , the prime minister resigned , which held its own in a busy news schedule .
In fact , strictly scientifically , it was bigger than the sudden and untimely death of Prince Harry , and we know this because a few months back the BBC downgraded the notional death of the third in line to the throne to an event that would no longer interrupt normal programming were it to take place .
No such sang froid for Labour 's Brownectomy , which bumped the Weakest Link ( sweet of him to provide his own punchline ) .
As for the Tories and the Lib Dems … well , the first sign that Mum and Dad were having some problems was an afternoon statement by David Laws .
" Although we are very , very conscious of the need to reach decisions quickly , " the party 's negotiator told reporters , " we also want to make sure that we get these matters right and this discussion is dependent not only on the Liberal Democrat party , but also on the proposals and discussions that are ongoing with the Conservative party , and the representations that are , frankly , being made by the Labour party . "
This is Lib Dem for " Hey – do n't hate the playa , hate the game . "
Within a couple of hours , hung parliament love interest Nick Clegg was cooing at Labour over the airwaves , while busy little helpers were said to be scuttling round Portcullis House demanding named support for a David Miliband leadership campaign .
The puzzle was that so few had seen it coming .
Seemingly every pundit and reporter had spent the day either quacking that the Con - Lib negotiations were looking very positive , or warning that we must avoid upsetting the markets – prompting one esteemed colleague to remark that if we were take this mollycoddling of the markets ' obsession with stability to its logical conclusion , perhaps we should n't have elections at all .
On the BBC , meanwhile , Huw Edwards was claiming that if they did n't hear something from the Lib Dem and Tory negotiating room soon , " the public will begin to lose patience " .
What he meant , of course , was that people who have to fill rolling news channels would begin to lose patience .
I do n't know what it was like where you were , but on the streets of London the public did n't seem to be losing patience at all .
The public , in fact , were getting on with their business perfectly happily , and the worry among the political class should surely be that the longer they are left without politicians swanking about reannouncing policies every 10 minutes , the more they will wonder after the point of them .
Loosely speaking , then – in fact , speaking with a looseness likely to be matched only by David Cameron 's bowel movements – that is where we are now .
It should go without saying that in the time it takes to press the send key we shall be somewhere else entirely .
Indeed , given that the cliche of the hour is that " we are in uncharted territory " , the cartographers should surely name these coordinates the Straits of WTF and be done with it .
In a May 7 article , Haaretz reporter Ilana Hammerman described in dramatic detail a crime she had methodically planned and committed .
In defiance of laws supposedly related to Israel ’s security , Hammerman picked up three teenage Palestinian girls in their village in the West Bank , took them through the Betar checkpoint , and drove them into Tel Aviv .
There they ate ice cream , visited the mall and museum , and played in the sea .
Even though the girls lived just a few kilometers from the beach , Israel ’s military occupation had prevented them from ever visiting it before their illegal " day of fun . "
Hammerman wrote in her account of the experience , " If There Is A Heaven : "
“ The end was wonderful .
The last photos show them about two hours after the trip to the flea market , running in the darkness on Tel Aviv ’s Banana Beach .
They did n’t want to stop for even a minute at the restaurant there to have a bite to eat or something to drink , or even to just relax a bit .
Instead they immediately removed their sandals again , rolled up their pants and ran into the water .
And ran and ran , back and forth , in zig - zags , along the huge beach , ponytails flying in the wind .
From time to time , they knelt down in the sand or crowded together in the shallow water to have their picture taken .
The final photo shows two of them standing in the water , arms around each others ’ waists , their backs to the camera .
Only the bright color of their shirts contrasting with the dark water and the sky reveals that the two are Yasmin and Aya , because Lin was wearing a black shirt . ”
But the fun ended as soon as a group called The Legal Forum for the Land of Israel filed a request with Israeli Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein demanding that Hammerman be prosecuted for breaking the country ’s " Law of Entry to Israel " forbidding Israelis from assisting Palestinians in entering Israel .
If Weinstein agrees to the request , Hammerman could face as much as two years in prison .
The Legal Forum for the Land of Israel was founded by a religious nationalist settler named Nachi Eyal .
When I reached Eyal on the phone , he maintained to me that his concern related strictly to Hammerman ’s disregard for the rule of law .
" She broke the law and she made a report about her breaking of the law , " Eyal told me .
" She wanted everyone to know that you can take Palestinians in against the law and lie to police officers and the Army .
I want to send a message that no citizen in Israel can take the law into his hands and if he does they have to pay . "
However , a glance at Eyal ’s past campaigns and statements reveal his targeting of Hammerman as part of a broader agenda that has less to do with the rule of law than with opening a new phase in the settlement movement ’s political agenda .
A former aide to settlement founding father Chanan Porat , Eyal founded his Legal Forum in 2004 to combat the Israeli government ’s planned evacuation of the radical Gush Katif settlement from the Gaza Strip .
In recent years , the Legal Forum has focused its efforts increasingly inside the Green Line , ramping up the pressure against Palestinian citizens of Israel and anyone who advocates on their behalf .
Eyal has boasted of his latest campaign to push Jewish settlement activity in coastal cities of Israel like Jaffa , Akko and Haifa which maintain sizable communities of Palestinian citizens of Israel .
He claimed he has " encouraged Jews not to put up ‘ for sale ’ signs in these areas in order to dissuade Arabs from buying up these properties . "
The Legal Forum is also intent on preventing Palestinian Israelis from building on their own land .
" We are mapping Israel ’s land resources , investigating illegal Arab building sites and filing suits against such building , " Eyal has said .
The Legal Forum is a prominent player in right - wing efforts to disqualify Palestinian - Israeli legislators from the Knesset .
In May , when Balad MK Jamal Zahalka made anti-Zionist statements during a speech in Ramallah , Eyal called on the government of Israel to revoke his citizenship .
" If a member of Knesset goes to the enemy and says bad things about Israel they must pay for this , " Eyal insisted to me .
" Israeli democracy must have weapons to preserve the democracy or it will be destroyed . "
In another recent campaign , Eyal attacked a military investigation of an Army colonel who publicly justified his use of torture techniques to compel Palestinian detainees into confessions .
The investigation " ties the IDF ’s hands during the war on terrorism , " Eyal said , " and helps the terrorists . "
Eyal ’s Legal Fund spearheaded the campaign to suppress a book , " The House of Dajani , " that portrayed the early Zionists in unflattering terms .
His efforts led to the reversal of a decision to award the book the Sapir Prize , Israel ’s most prestigious literary award .
Now Eyal ’s efforts are focused on ensuring that Hammerman ’s kindness does not go unpunished — " they have to pay , " as he said .
The Attorney General has ordered the police to open an investigation of Hammerman and Eyal is confident that case will proceed to the next stage .
" I think we will succeed because [ Hammerman ] broke the law and she made a lot of noise , " Eyal remarked .
" Israel will not allow these kinds of things to continue . "
01 Jun 2010 16:02:40 GMT
JERUSALEM , June 1 ( Reuters ) - World powers including China and Russia called on Israel on Tuesday to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip following the killing of nine activists during an Israeli operation to stop ships delivering aid there .
How did the embargo start , what is its impact and how does Egypt cooperate in enforcing it ?
HOW DID THE BLOCKADE BEGIN ?
Israel imposed restrictions on the Gaza Strip after it pulled out troops and settlers in 2005 .
They were tightened after the 2006 parliamentary election victory of Hamas , the Islamist movement which rejects interim peace terms ; after Hamas captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006 and again in 2007 when Hamas seized full control in Gaza .
Israel says the embargo is a response to Hamas 's hostility -- a hostility expressed in thousands of rockets and mortar rounds fired over the border , prompting an Israeli offensive in late 2008 .
Israel aims to deny Hamas the ability to arm and to weaken the movement 's popularity among civilians .
Hamas sees the blockade , imposed with Egypt 's help , as a form of economic blackmail designed to turn the people of Gaza against it and force a softening of its policy towards Israel .
To Hamas , the blockade is itself an act of hostility .
WHAT HAS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT BEEN ?
U.N. agencies have charted a deteriorating humanitarian situation and rising poverty in the Gaza Strip as a result of the blockade .
A recent survey by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) found the number of refugees living in abject poverty had tripled since 2007 .
The private sector has collapsed and 42 percent of Gaza 's residents are out of work , UNRWA says .
Palestinians are using tunnels to bring in supplies from Egypt .
Most goods -- even new cars -- are available from smugglers , but at prices that are too high for many people .
Aid agencies ensure basic food is plentiful but complain of scarce medical supplies .
Reconstruction after Israel 's 3 - week 2008 - 09 offensive has been stalled due to restrictions on the supply of building materials .
Israel restricts supplies of cement and iron on the ground that they can be used for military purposes .
Israel says there is no humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and says it ensures adequate food supplies .
UNRWA strongly disagrees , saying there is a humanitarian crisis .
Earlier this year , Israel allowed clothes and shoes into Gaza for the first time since 2007 .
U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley , reacting to Israel 's naval action , said the United States wants to ensure there is adequate access for humanitarian goods through the Gaza border crossings " while bearing in mind the government of Israel 's legitimate security concerns " .
The United Nations wants an immediate end to the embargo .
WHAT HAS THE POLITICAL IMPACT BEEN ?
There are signs of discontent with Hamas 's rule in Gaza , but for now there is no real threat to its control there .
[ ID:nLDE6420NA ]
Equally , there is no sign the Iranian - and Syrian - backed group is bending to demands that it accept peace agreements signed by other Palestinian groups with Israel .
Hamas , which controls the tunnels , is still able to pay salaries to its employees , including thousands of security men .
Discontent with shortages and a lack of freedom to travel seem to have eroded Hamas 's popularity , but accurate opinion sampling is difficult .
The Western - backed Palestinian Authority , based in the West Bank , also continues to pay salaries to thousands of Palestinian civil servants who were on its payroll at the time Hamas took control of Gaza .
WHAT IS EGYPT'S ROLE ?
Egypt controls the Rafah crossing , the only gateway to Gaza not controlled by Israel , and cooperates in maintaining the blockade -- a role that has led to fierce criticism of Egypt across the Arab and Muslim world .
Egypt rarely opens the crossing , citing arrangements agreed in 2005 with the United States , the European Union , Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the time of Israel 's unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip .
Conscious of the criticism , Egypt said on Tuesday it would open the crossing for people and aid until further notice .
[ ID : nLDE6501E6 ]
Egypt fears that allowing free movement of goods and people through Rafah would allow Israel to wash its hands of the territory , which the Jewish state captured from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war .
Today , Egypt has a 30 - year - old peace deal with Israel and a strained relationship with Hamas , which is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood , the largest opposition group in Egypt and officially banned there .

Mr Keogh was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when he was 18 A coroner has ordered police and health services to review the way they treated a patient who hanged himself after being falsely accused of a sex assault .
An inquest into John Keogh 's death in Wiltshire heard how police failed to tell him they had dropped the assault case against a fellow female patient .
Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health
Trust said it always seeks to safeguard its clients and to learn from incidents .
Wiltshire Police will not comment until it has responded to the coroner .
' Charges withdrawn '
The 23 - year - old was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when he was 18 .
It was because he had previously tried to kill himself that he was sectioned to Green Lane psychiatric hospital in Devizes .
His brother Christopher , 34 , said John had formed a relationship with a female patient while at the hospital .
" When they both got out of the hospital they were going to move in together and he seemed very happy , " he said .
But days later the woman claimed Mr Keogh had indecently assaulted her .
They brought his stuff back from hospital ... the shoes without the laces that he killed himself with
Christopher Keogh , brother Mr Keogh was then moved to a secure ward in Salisbury and police later decided to drop the case and withdraw all charges after interviewing him .
But Wiltshire Police did not plan to tell him until four days later , by which time he had hanged himself with a pair of shoelaces .
Christopher Keogh said the trust had not offered any support .
" They brought his stuff back from hospital , the clothes he was wearing with the blood stains and the shoes without the laces that he killed himself with , " he added .
In a statement Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Trust said its staff carried out one - to - one and regular observations with Mr Keogh on the night he died .
It added that it always sought to safeguard its clients and to learn from incidents , " it said .
Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner David Ridley said he had written the letter in accordance with Rule 43 of the Coroners Rules 1984 .
Rule 43 states a coroner has a wider remit to make reports to prevent future deaths - and a person receiving the report must sent a written report to the coroner .

Good evening everybody .
Sombreros , berets , comedy moustaches , onion necklaces and other lazy national stereotypes at the ready for tonight 's Guardian minute - by - minute coverage of this Group A encounter at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane , 1,229 m above sea level .
To put that in perspective , this is the fourth highest of the 10 World Cup finals venues .
To put that in even more perspective , Paris is 130 m above sea level at its highest point , compared to Mexico City at 2,240 m .
I make that advantage Mexico before a Jabulani has been kicked ... 5 mph faster than it would be at sea level .
Diego Forlan drove Uruguay top of this group last night with their emphatic win over hosts South Africa , which means defeat for either of these two sides would leave them in all sorts of bother , leaving them three points off the pace with one match to play and relying on other results , goal difference , other teams not conspiring against them by colluding and all the usual last - round - of - the - group - stage shenanigans .
But you 're clever and already know all that , so you do n't need me to tell you .
If you 're struggling to recall how either or both these sides fared in their opening matches because you 're in the early stages of senility , your synapses are fried through years of alcohol and / or drug abuse , or some other reason , here are David Hytner 's report on France 's dull opener against Uruguay and Paul Wilson 's account of Mexico 's opener against South Africa , for your reading pleasure .
Kick - off is at 7.30 pm .
I 'll be back at 7 pm or so to bring you all the team news and pre-match build - up .
Okey dokey , for anyone who 's heard about them , but never seen them in action , here 's RTE 's answer to the Match Of The Day Lineker , Hanson , Shearer and Dixon axis of tedium in action , picking over the bones of the Republic of Ireland 's exit from the World Cup qualifying play - off at the hands of France .
From the left : Bill O'Herlihy and pundits John Giles , Graeme Souness and Eamon Dunphy .
This is Dunphy in comparatively mellow mode .
Here is in slightly less mellow mode after seeing Sven - Goran Eriksson being interviewed by Garth Crooks after England struggled to beat Ecuador four years ago .
France : Lloris , Sagna , Gallas , Abidal , Evra , Govou , Toulalan ,
Diaby , Malouda , Ribery , Anelka .
Subs : Mandanda , Reveillere , Planus , Gourcuff , Cisse , Gignac , Henry , Squillaci , Diarra , Valbuena , Clichy .
Mexico : Perez , Osorio , Moreno , Rodriguez , Salcido , Marquez ,
Giovani , Juarez , Torrado , Vela , Franco .
Subs : Ochoa , Barrera , Castro , Blanco , Aguilar , Hernandez , Guardado , Magallon , Torres , Bautista , Medina , Michel .

On yellow cards and will miss next match if they get booked France : Jeremy Toulalan , Patrice Evra , Franck Ribery .
Mexico : Efrain Juarez , Gerrardo Torrado .
Match pointers with which to bore your fellow drinkers ( if you 're in the pub and reading this on an iPhone or Blackberry , for whatever reason )
• Mexico have never won a World Cup match against any of the seven countries that have won the competition ( 11 defeats and five draws )
• France are unbeaten in their last eight finals games , although they have drawn half of those matches
• Mexico have scored at least one goal in each of their last nine World Cup games against European sides
• Nicolas Anelka has failed to have a shot on target in 384 consecutive minutes for the French side
• Mexico have made it to the knockout stage in their previous five World Cup participations
Brian O Donnchadha writes : " I 've been living in the states now for just over four years and I was finally beginning to forget what craggy - face Dunphy looked like , " he says .
" Thanks for undoing years of hard work . "
Living in the States with a name like that ?
Rather you than me .
I 'm going to go out on a limb and guess the natives struggle with it .
Not long now :
The teams emerge from the tunnel , led by the referee who picks the ball of its plinth .
I remain cautiously optimistic that one of them will forget to do that some night and then have to scurry back to get it hoping nobody will notice .
Alternatively , it would be amusing if whoever it is whose job it is to place it on the plinth decided , for a laugh , to put a rugby ball or a nice cake there instead .
Or glue the ball down to it .
What are they going to do on the night of the final , when they 'll need two plinths : one for the World Cup trophy and one for the official match - ball ?
These are the things I lie awake at night thinking and worrying about .
1 min : Mexico win the toss on a windy night in Polokwane and Elect to play from right to left .
France kick off .
Both sets of players line up in the colours you 'd expect them to .
2 min : Mexico concede a free - kick not far inside the Mexico half for a Carlos Salcido bodycheck on Franckl Ribery .
The ball is launched high into the night sky towards the Mexican penalty area .
They clear their lines .
3 min : Mexico gallop clear on the break , the ball is played down the left channel into the path of Giovani Dos Santos , who shoots across the face of goal only to see the ball hit the foot of the post and bounce back into play .
Would n't have counted anyway - he was offside .
5 min : Mexico striker Guillermo Franco picks up the first yellow card of the night , either for a foul on Abou Diaby or for standing in front of the ball so FVrance could n't take a quick free - kick .
He 's furious with the referee .
Nic Anelka blasts the ball over the bar from the edge of the final third .
7 min :
In quick succession , both goalkeepers are forced to race into action to catch through - balls being chased down by strikers .
Hugo Lloris was probably given most to think about .
8 min : From outside the centre - circle inside his own half , Rafael Marquez dinks a beautifully weighted long ball over the top of the France defence .
It bounces and sits up beautifully for Carlos Vela to either try his luck with a diagonal volley or square for two team - mates - Franco and Salcido - sprinting into the middle .
The Arsenal striker opts to shoot but blasts the ball high over the bar .
10 min :
It 's been an entertaining opening 10 minutes , despite the best attempts of the referee , who seems a bit whistle - happy and has already had words with Mexican full - back Ricardo Osorio , telling him to pull his sleeves down .
Are referees even allowed do that ?
12 min : For Mexico , Franco turns and shoots over the bar from the edge of the penalty area .
Moments previously , France had gone close when Malouda tried to pull the ball back for Ribery in the Mexico penalty , only for a defender to make a crucial interception .
There was somebody nipping at Malouda 's ankles in a crowded penalty area - if he'd gone to ground he might well have got a penalty .
14 min : France win a free - kick about 40 yards from the Mexico goal , in line with the right hand side of the penalty area .
They try a training ground move that involves Ribery peeling off the edge of the defensive wall , picking up a short pass then whipping the ball across the face of goal from the right .
It 's fractionally too high for Abou Diaby at the far post .
16 min :
It 's real end - to - end stuff here , which means I 'm struggling to find time to tell you anything about how France have lined up .
They 're playing a 4 - 3 - 3 , with Ribery in the hole behind Anelka , and Malouda in his preferred position on the left of the front bank of three , rather than the middle bank of three where Raymond Domenech has been playing him in recent matches .
19 min : For Mexico , Carlos Salcido tries his luck from just outside the penalty area .
He pulls a low daisy - cutter a couple of feet wide of the right upright .
19 min : Mexico win a free - kick in the right channel for an Evra foul on Giovani .
It 's within shooting range .
20 min :
This ref is being a real nitpicky pain in the proverbials .
He accuses the Marquez and / or Dos Santos of moving the ball a couple of feet forward from where their free - kick should be taken and insists they put it back .
I do n't think either of them had bothered trying to steal a couple of feet .
After all that palaver , Giovani Dos Santos blasts it into the wall .
23 min : Florent Malouda wins a corner for France off Ricardo Osorio , whose sleeves remain down .
Ribery plays it low and shortish to Sagna , receives it back and then crosses it in from a better angle .
Rodriguez heads clear with Anelka lurking .
25 min : Jeremy Toulalan sends a wonderful outswinger of a cross in from the right touchline .
On the edge of the six - yard box , Florent Malouda leaps highest - really high , in fact - but mistimed his jump and failed to make contact .
27 min : Sprinting down the left touchline with the ball at his feet , Mexican winger Carlos Salcido cuts inside Sagna with a nutmeg , then advances on goal .
William Gallas backs off him , allowing him a free shot on goal .
He shoots straight at Hugo Lloris who'd come off his line to narrow the angle .
The danger averted , Lloris gives Gallas a rollocking for leaving him so exposed .
29 min : Rafael Marquez tries to find Dos Santos with another ball over the French backline .
Close , but no cigar .
Mexico striker Carlos Vela goes down and is then helped off with what looks like hamstring - twang - his World Cup is almost certainly over .
Mexico play on with 10 men for the itme being .
30 min : Mexico substitution : Vela off , Pablo Barrera on .
France win a corner from which nothing come .
After half an hour , France have enjoyed the better of an entertaining nil - niller , but certainly are n't having it all their own way .
32 min : Mexico 's substitute almost has an immediate impact .
After more good work in his station out on the left touchline , Salcido drops a marvellous cross into the corridor of uncertainty between goalkeeepr and defence .
Lloris rushes off his line to punch clear , but the ball ricochets off Barrera 's head , loops back from whence it came and drops this much over the bar .
That was inches away from being an incredibly lucky opener .
35 min : For Mexico , Gerrardo Torrado tries a shot from 35 yards out .
Some lucky punter sitting in the gods behind the goal gets a nice souvenir to bring home .
37 min : Free - kick for France , 35 or so yards out , a little left of centre .
Ribery shoots into the wall , where Torrado blocks with his face .
38 min : Unlike in some other matches , you can actually hear some bogstandard stadium noise over the drone of the vuvuzelas .
Chanting , the draught generated by Mexican waves and the stadium announcer .
" He sounds tremendous , " declares Sean Welch , ( yes that Sean Welch ... y' know , the former bass player with The Beautiful South ) .
" Exactly like James Earl Jones playing God on The Simpsons . "
40 min : Marvellous work from Franco , who despite lying on the ground outside the French penalty manages to hook a bouncing ball towards Dos Santos .
Under pressure from Evra , he sends a low drive fizzing wide of the right upright .
43 min : " When the ref told the Mexican player to pull his sleeves down was that his way of telling him to stop trying so hard ? " asks Ian Copestake .
44 min : " A player got told off for having his sleeves rolled up you say ? " asks Joe Bentley .
" That 's a slippery slope .
What next ?
Yellow cards for slouching ?
Ties becoming part of the kit ?
The beautiful game is moving in dangerous direction here . "
44 min-and -a- bit : Nicolas Anelka tries a shot from distance but it deflects off Francisco Rodriguez , whose intercession takes the sting off it .
44+2 min : As Mexico gallop clear on the counter - attack , James Earl Jones ( it 's remarkable - listen out on the highlights ) announces there 'll be two minutes of injury - time .
Jeremy Toulalan cynically hauls down Guillermo Franco and gets a yellow card for his troubles .
He 'll miss France 's match against South Africa .
Half - time
Celebrity spot : I just went out for a breath of fresh air ( OK , a smoke ) and had to walk through the scrum of attendees at a photography exhibition launch in the front parlour of the Guardian office .
And bedad who was there looking brown as a berry in a nice blue summer dress but TV presenter and former Boddington 's girl Melanie Sykes .
She 's looking well .
And this minute - by - minute report is turning into a copy of Heat magazine .
Half - time emails : " Barry , surely your attempt to introduce Eamon Dunphy can't be complete without his gloriously bitter summation of Roy Keane 's career following Keane 's departure from Man Utd , " writes Fionnan Johnson .
" Please tell Mr. Copstake that it depends on what part of the world you are from , " writes Jesualdo Ferreira .
" Here in Portugal we tell our young people to roll up their sleeves and put up their socks .
Over the border in Spain they say ' pull your socks down and tear off your sleeves ' .
I was talking to chap from North Korea and he said they say ' Put your sleeve cuffs down and put your socks on your hands . '
I also heard that the Greeks do very bad thing with their socks !
Funny old world . "
Second half : France substitution : Gignac on , Nic Anelka on .
They need to make a substitution because they 've created very little .
France win a free kick within range for Franck Ribery , well right of centre .
Ribery dinks it over the wall towards the edge of the six - yard box and a Mexican hacks clear .
47 min : " On RTE , Ronnie Whelan and Eamon Dunphy just disected the French performance , showing that Gallas , Gouvou and the others want to be at home and are not breaking past a jog , " writes Paul Reynolds .
" The players have no interest according to the lads and they say Domenech has zero influence . "
48 min : Two yellow cards in quick succession , both for Mexicans .
Full back Moreno for a shove on Malouda , followed by right - winger Juarez for a foul on Abou Diaby .
49 min : Mexico win a free - kick right of centre , close enough to goal for Marquez or Dos Santos to have a pop .
50 min : Another training ground move .
Dos Santos sprints past the left - hand side of the French wall to the touchline , Marquez drills the ball towards him and the Spurs player sends in a cross .
It 's too low and flat for any of his team - mates to get near it .
52 min : " Dunphy 's finest hour was his character assassination of Terry Venables , " writes Hugh Collins .
" Gary Lineker would rather slit his own face than express opinions this strong on any subject . "
53 min : Malouda picks up the ball on the right flank , cuts inside and advances on goal before unleashing a right - footed surface - to - air effort from the edge of the penalty area .
In the Mexico goal , Oscar Perez is forced to tip the ball over .
Nothing comes from the corner .
55 min : Mexico substitution : Javier Hernandez on , Efrain Juarex off .
From the exact same position as Malouda shot moments previously , Franck Ribery stings Perez 's palms with a left - footed rasper .
The goalkeeper puts the ball out for a corner , from which nothing comes .
56 min : " Even funnier than Eamonn Dunphy and co is the RTE mickey - take on their Apres Match program , " writes M Turpie .
" Here is a send - up of Dunphy and new boy Didi Hamann . "
58 min : Mexico win a free - kick on the edge of the final third .
Dos Santos tries to swing it into the far post , but succeeds only in sending the ball flying high over the bar .
59 min : Mexico have a huge incentive to win this match .
If they do they 'll be level with Uruguay on four points , which would enable both teams to play out a draw and guarantee their berths in the knockout stages .
Of course France have a huge incentive to win this match too - making sure the scenario outlined above is n't played out .
61 min : Mexico substitution : Cuauhtemoc Blanco , aged 72 , on , Guillermo Franco off .
Mexico are turning the screw here - they 're bossing the game .
France are being over - run in midfield and Andre - Pierre Gignac has n't had a kick since coming on at half - time .
GOAL ! Mexico 1 - 0 France ( Hernandez ) SWith his back to goal , Hernandez plays the ball back to Marquez on the halfway line , turns and sprints towards the France goal .
Marquez dinks a beautifully weighted pass over the top for the substitute to run on to .
He 's directly in line with the static defence when the ball is played : onside .
His first touch is marvellous , bringing him clean through on goal with the ball at his feet .
He takes it right and wide of Lloris , slots it into the empty net and wheels away in celebration .
That is a marvellous goal from the new Manchester United recruit .
66 min : France free - kick in the Mexico left - back position - Ribery curls the ball into the arms of Mexico goalkeeper Oscar Perez .
68 min : France are staring into the abyss here - lose this and any chance they have of avoiding a humiliating exit in the group stages is minimal .
They 'll have been cheering that goal in the saloons of Guadalajara , Mexico City , Tijuana and Dublin .
70 min : France substitution : Sidney Govou , who has had a shocker , off .
Marseille 's attacking midfielder Mathieu Valbuena replaces him .
Thierry
Henry remains anchored to the bench , while on the touchline , Raymond Domenech remains poker - faced .
72 min : I ca n't see France getting back into this .
Half their players are n't trying a leg , while the few who are creating little or nothing .
Their fans deserve better .
Heck , Ireland 's fans deserve better .
Malouda 's been their stand - out player and he 's probably only playing well out of spite .
73 min : Gignac shoots high and wide from outside the penalty area .
75 min : " A roar has gone up in our quiet carriage of the 20:38 from Sheffield to London as everyone refreshed their mobile internet pages ( no wifi ) and found on entering Chesterfield that France were losing , " writes Paul Mason , who appears not to have considered the fact that such scenes of jubilation invariably ensue whenever any train arrives at Chesterfield .
It 's a very nice place and has a nice church with a crooked spire .
PENALTY FOR MEXICO !
Pablo Barrero skins Patrice Evra down the right flank and gets tripped by Eric Abidal in the penalty area .
The ref points straight to the spot .
GOAL ! Mexico 2 - 0 France ( Blanco 79 )
The elderly substitute takes a massive run-up and blasts the ball low and to Lloris 's left .
79 min : Sorry .
His left , Lloris 's right .
80 min :
That was remarkable , Evra appeared not to give a hoot as Barrero sauntered past him , leaving Abidal exposed , but with no real need to lunge in as Barrero was in danger of running the ball out of play .
When the referee pointed to the spot , Domenech was leaning against the edge of the dug - out looking totally expressionless .
When the penalty was scored , he was leaning against the dugout looking totally expressionless .
Three minutes later , he 's still leaning against the edge of the dugout looking totally expressionless .
82 min : France win a free - kick about 35 yards out .
Ribery blasts it into the wall , where it hits Marquez .
84 min : I can feel my phone buzzing away in my pocket , with text message after text message arriving .
Either I 've done something to upset the missus or assorted compatriots are sharing their delight at this France demise .
85 min : I forgot to mention at the time - Abidal got booked for his penalty - conceding foul on Barrera .
86 min : " Didi Hamann loves his horse - racing , " texts my mate Bullets Curley from a field in Dublin .
" He 's out here in Leopardstown drinking and smoking and backing horses . "
It 's well for some .
87 min : " Has anyone ever sacked a manager during the World Cup ? " asks Sam Fletcher .
" If I were head of the FFF , I would be tempted to sack Domenech after this game .
Mind you , it brings you back to the question : why have they employed him for so long ? "
88 min : Blanco tries to play Dos Santos through on goal with a through - ball from distance .
His visionary pass is a teensy bit too weighty and Lloris beats the Mexican striker to the ball .
90 min : James Earl Jones announces that Mexico will have three additional minutes in which to heap more humiliation on France .
90+1 min : Domenech is still leaning against the dug - out , while all his subs are congregated down behind one goal .
He has n't said a word since the second goal went in , probably because he knows there 's no point because his players would n't listen to him .
90+2 min : Peep !
Peep !
Peep !
It 's all over - Mexico have won a thoroughly deserved victory .
To have any chance of getting out Group A , France will need to beat South Africa well and hope Uruguay and Mexico do n't draw .
If they play on that night like they did tonight , the draw wo n't matter because they 've no chance of beating South Africa .
Their manager is an idiot and almost to a man , their players are a disgrace to their country .
" Post this , Barry , " writes Anthony O'Connell .
" You know you want to . "
It would be my absolute pleasure , Anto .
To the people of France on behalf of the people of the Republic of Ireland ...

While the financial reform negotiation process grinds to its meaningless conclusion , the real action lies elsewhere – in Jamie Dimon ’s executive suite .
Dimon , the head of JP Morgan Chase , is apparently seeking to ( a ) become more global , ( b ) move further into emerging markets , and ( c ) become more like Citigroup .
This is terrific corporate strategy – and very dangerous for the rest of us .
Jamie Dimon clearly wants to become too big to fail , too interconnected to fail , and – above all – too global to fail .
He knows that the reform package will , among other ( very small ) things , create a resolution authority that will give the government more power – in principle – vis -à - vis failing financial institutions in the future .
This is a central part of Tim Geithner ’s vision for financial stability .
But Mr. Dimon also knows – as a board member of the NY Fed and sometime White House / Treasury confidante – that a US resolution authority will do precisely nothing to make it easier to handle the failure of a large global bank , e.g. , Citigroup , doing business in over 100 countries .
The reason global megabanks will get bailouts in the future is simple – policymakers will fear the chaos that would ensue when competing bankruptcy claims swarm over a defaulted institution , much as happened for Lehman ( e.g. , in London ) in September 2008 .
Mr. Dimon and his colleagues – who include some top former global regulators – are also well aware that the G20 ( and everyone else ) will not make any serious push towards creating a cross - border resolution mechanism .
The best way to signal to creditors that they will be protected in all potential future crises is to make JP Morgan bigger and more global .
This will lower the funding costs for the organization and in turn make this global expansion more profitable when times are good – and when times are bad , there will be government support .
In effect , Mr. Dimon is constructing a “ poison pill ” against takeover by the government .
This is so simple , so brilliant , and so dangerous that it should take your breath away .
If you press serious administration officials , in private , on how they will use the new resolution authority for Citigroup or ( now ) JP Morgan Chase , they are quite candid : they would create a conservatorship , as with AIG or Fannie / Freddie .
But there is a huge difference between conservatorship and resolution .
Resolution is about winding down the company , typically involves firing , and should imply losses for unsecured creditors .
Conservatorship is about managing the company as a going concern – and would almost certainly in this context involve full creditor protection .
It is perhaps ironic that Jamie Dimon argued strongly , early in the reform process , for a heavy weight to be placed on a resolution authority as a way to prevent future bailouts .
His actions now to undermine the effectiveness of such an authority further suggest that this administration was unwise and naïve to rely on his advise in the early formative phases of reform .
The White House may now be waking up to the profound dangers that Mr. Dimon and his successors will pose , but they are still unwilling to do anything meaningful about it .
People mostly use either serif or sans - serif fonts and often miss out the handwritten fonts .
They are as important as the main font classifications .
I particularly like to use handwritten fonts to highlight significant items in screen captures .
They add the personal touch in my design and also provide great typographic contrast .
However , not all handwritten fonts are legible .
I ’ve put together a huge list of free handwritten and script fonts that work well .

The Philadelphia Orchestra is not quite ready to let this device into the Kimmel Center 's Verizon Hall , but it has been working with Drexel on the project and sent representatives to the campus this week for a demonstration .
In an era of shrinking audiences , could this be the way to resonate with the masses who do n't know a coloratura from a contralto ?
Previously a career minor league for nearly a decade , Matt Carkner earned himself a full - time home on the Senators blue line during the 2009 - 10 season ( Getty Images ) .
" For the first few weeks there ( after the Sens ' season ended ) , I was pretty grumpy watching other teams play .
But when all was said and done , my friends and family all congratulated me and helped me remember what a great season it was for me personally . "
Matt Carkner
After the sting of defeat finally wore off , Matt Carkner allowed himself more than a few moments of satisfaction .
They were surely well earned .
Then again , when you 've spent the better part of a decade toiling in the minors and your National Hockey League dream finally arrives ... as Carkner puts it , " I can't really complain about my year .
" Even if the first - round Stanley Cup playoff exit at the hands of the Pittsburgh Penguins did n't really sit too well with anyone in the Senators dressing room .
" For the first few weeks there ( after their elimination ) , I was pretty grumpy watching other teams play , " Carkner admitted in an interview with OttawaSenators.com .
" But when all was said and done , my friends and family all congratulated me and helped me remember what a great season it was for me personally .
" Indeed , it was .
The 29 - year - old native of nearby Winchester went into training camp last fall expecting to start the season where he'd finished the previous two — with the Binghamton Senators of the American Hockey League .
But Carkner could n't be denied a spot on the season - opening roster in Ottawa .
It got even better from there .
Carkner scored his first NHL goal in the Senators ' home - opener against the New York Islanders and was named the game 's first star .
By the end of October , he 'd earned himself a new two - year , one - way contract , giving Carkner and his family the security they 'd desired for so long .
Carkner also etched his name into Senators playoff lore by scoring the winner in the longest game in modern franchise history , the epic triple - overtime triumph in Game 5 of the series against the Penguins .
It was one more chapter in an amazing story authored by a guy that had seen only two previous games of NHL action before making it with the Senators .
" Making the team alone was a huge success for me , " said Carkner , who suited up for 87 of 88 games the Senators played in the regular and post - season .
" Getting to play in front of my home town and my family and friends , scoring my first NHL goal in my first NHL game in Ottawa ... it seemed like good things happened throughout the year for me .
I was pretty fortunate with injuries ( and ) I was healthy for most of the year .
" Getting the opportunity to play in the playoffs alone was a dream come true and the highlight of my year was definitely the triple - overtime winner .
" But count on a guy who thrives on hard work to do anything but rest on his laurels .
" I was very happy with the success I had but I know that to continue on , I 've got to keep working on a lot of different things , " said Carkner .
" Hopefully in the future , we 'll have a lot more team success .
" Carkner and teammate Jesse Winchester have been confirmed as participants in the Sens Foundation 's annual Walk , Roll & Run for Roger 's House , presented by the Ottawa Citizen , set for June 20 at Scotiabank Place .
It 's a natural fit for the community - oriented Carkner .
"
It 's kind of handy for me to be around this area because there are a lot of great causes that I 'm able to help out ( with ) , " he said .
" It 's going to be a great day .
You can't go wrong coming out to support this cause . "
Built with the blue - laser diode of a dismantled Casio projector , the $ 200 Spyder III Pro Arctic is the world 's most powerful portable laser .
It can permanently blind you and set your skin — or anything else , really — on fire almost instantly .

" With greater power comes the need for greater responsibility . "
That 's actually what Wicked Lasers , the mad geniuses behind the Spyder III , wrote to us in an email describing this terrifying piece of technology .
They wanted to make one thing very clear : this is not merely a laser pointer , and it 's certainly not a toy .
What it is , really , is a weapon .
The diodes in Casio's new mercury - free Green Slim projectors apparently allow for unprecedentedly powerful portable lasers , and Wicked Lasers has gleefully harvested them for the 1 Watt Spyder III .
Comparing it to the $ 2000 Sonar , the company 's reigning portable laser powerhouse , Wicked Lasers explains that the blue Spyder III laser is 2000 times brighter to the human eye , and , at $ 200 , 1/10th the price .

Wicked Lasers is throwing in a free pair of safety glasses with the purchase of a Spyder III , which might make wielding one marginally safer , but just writing this post has left me terrified enough to stay as far away from these things as possible .
For a few weeks , anyway , until our review unit gets here .

WASHINGTON ( PAI ) –Iranian unions , students and human rights activists readied nationwide protests , centered around the June 12 first anniversary of the fraudulent 2009 Iranian presidential election , according to websites and the son of a colleague of an imprisoned Iranian bus drivers union president .
The protests , which could stretch from June 10 through June 20 , are designed to again call the world ’s attention to repression by both Iran ’s military and by street militia recruited by the clerically - run government of the Islamic Republic of Iran , they said .
The Iranian government is nominally headed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Besides again protesting the vote , unionists and activists will denounce the May 9 execution of five activists , including Kurdish teachers ’ union member Farzad Kamangar , and the two - plus years of hard jail time — so far — for Mansour Osanloo , president of the Tehran Bus Drivers union .
Osanloo ’s bus drivers ’ union colleague , Ebrahim Mahdadi , has been held for at least a year in his latest jail stint , adds David Cockroft , president of the International Transport Federation , a coalition of worldwide transportation unions , including the Amalgamated Transit Union and the Transport Workers Union of America .
The ITF is vigorously protesting their imprisonment .
He also wrote Ahmadinejad , “ ITF and the rest of the international community is extremely concerned Farzad Kamangar and others appear to have been killed without due legal process , without notice and without even a chance to say goodbye to their families .
This situation represents a horrendous lack of disrespect for basic human rights and decency .
“ On behalf of the five million workers in the transport industry worldwide , I urge you to intervene robustly , personally and immediately to put a stop to the abuse of power and legal process perpetrated by elements within your administration , ” he added .
Osanloo ’s colleague — a fellow Tehran bus driver — told his son that Osanloo has been held in hazardous conditions , including months in Iran ’s notorious Evin Prison , used by the former Shah ’s secret police for torture .
Osanloo was recently transferred to solitary confinement after “ being held with dangerous criminals ” or being incarcerated with addicts , according to ITF and the son .
Some months after Osanloo was arrested , the son visited ATU in Washington and got its leaders to send a formal letter to Ahmadinejad demanding the Iranian bus drivers ’ leader ’s release .
Osanloo “ has been tortured because they want him to come on state TV and say things against unions and he refuses , ” the son reports .
“ The Intelligence Services want to crush someone ’s character and personality , so that when they ’re released , nobody will listen to or believe them .
“ They used to kill you right away , ” the son said of the torture in Evin prison .
“ Now they want to kill the person ’s soul . ”
The son of Osanloo ’s colleague explained the Tehran bus drivers union was legally recognized by the present Iranian government .
“ But they want the union leader to be an agent of the government .
Instead , the bus drivers chose their own leader , ” Osanloo .
“ Otherwise , it would be a sham union , ” he said .
No charges have ever been filed against Osanloo .
The son of Osanloo ’s colleague said the union leader was picked up “ because he ’s part of the general uprising in Iran of students , workers , teachers and others for democracy . ”
Others arrested include leaders of minority religious sects .
Worldwide leaders of the Baha ’i faith organized protests on June 12 against Iran ’s jailing of seven leaders .
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , among others , endorsed those Baha ’i protests .
Besides the election protests , the demonstrators in Iran also want the union leaders to have the right to a public trial , to hear and respond to the charges against them , and to have legal counsel .
Other protests against Iran ’s actions included three in early June in the world ’s most - populous Moslem country , Indonesia .
Other than the son ’s approach to ATU , U.S. unions have not been asked for help , because of fear that U.S. support would enable the Iranian government to label Iranian union leaders as U.S. tools , U.S. union international specialists told PAI .
Nevertheless , the Iranians believe international protests and attention will help keep pressure on their government not to mistreat — or kill — union leaders .
That ’s what happened to Kamangar , 35 , a member of the Teachers ’ Trade Association of Kurdistan , and four other Kurds , on May 9 .
Kamangar was accused of “ endangering national security ” and “ enmity against God . ”
He was sentenced to death , ITF said , in a 5 - minute closed trial in Feb. 2008 , and hung this year .
And sugar union leaders were picked up last November and have been held ever since , ITF reports .
The Obama administration denounces Iranian human rights abuses , but it concentrates on gaining support for tough international sanctions against Iran ’s nuclear program .
Despite a deal between Iran , Turkey and Brazil on nuclear fuel , the Obama administration went forward with a new round of sanctions against Iran , passed by the United Nation ’s Security Council this week .

Orang - utans communicate intelligently using gestures , researchers have found .
British scientists who spent nine months observing the great apes in three European zoos identified 40 frequently used body language signals .
These were employed repeatedly to send messages such as " I want to play " , " give it to me " , " go away " , " follow me " , or " stop doing that " .
" Play " gestures involved a range of clowning antics , including back rolls , placing objects on the head , and blowing raspberries .
" Nudge and shoo " movements meant an ape wanted to be left alone , while a hand to mouth " begging " gesture requested food .
Other gestures included hitting the ground , hair pulling , biting the air and grabbing .

On most cable newscasts , the people who are writing new financial regulations are called congressmen .
But on “ The Dylan Ratigan Show ” on MSNBC , some are called “ banksters . ”
That term , a twist on gangsters , tells viewers a lot about Mr. Ratigan , a financial news apostate who has transformed himself into an outspoken opponent of too - big - to - fail banks and the politicians whom he calls their servants .
In the recent fight over financial reform , he lent a megaphone to people who wanted an end to “ too big to fail , ” and he called on viewers to lobby the Senators in his imaginary Bankster Party .
All this from a man who , until recently , hosted a stock - picking show on CNBC , the cable personification of Wall Street .
Now Mr. Ratigan , who labels himself a taxpayer advocate , rails against the “ vampire ” banks who “ have assumed control of our government . ”
“ It ’s like being the guy who was running the casino , and then having an awakening and realizing that the casino is what ’s killing the country , ” Mr. Ratigan said in an interview last week .
Tea Party Power : Who 's Next After Bennett ?
Fresh from its
Utah victory , the Tea Party looks to other Republican incumbents .
WASHINGTON , May 9 , 2010  --
The Tea Party movement has many more incumbent Republicans in its sights this midterm election year after tossing out an incumbent conservative GOP senator in Utah .
In its first real show of political force , the Tea Party movement unseated three - term Sen.
Bob Bennett in the state 's Republican primary race Saturday .
" It 's the beginning of a trend , " journalist Robin Wright said Sunday on ABC News ' " This Week . "
Bennett 's loss to two Tea Party candidates , former assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Lee and businessman Tim Bridgewater , sends a warning signal to other GOP incumbents in a year when an anti-Washington , pro-fiscally conservative current is running strong among Republicans .
ABC News 2010 Election Map : Follow the House , Senate and Governors ' Races
" You have the next coming up , Kentucky and Arizona and New Hampshire .
We 're likely to see this elsewhere , " Wright said .
" Democracy 's about the majority , but it's about the majority of people who participate .
And , in this case , a certain kind of people participated , and their candidate won . "
The Tea Party 's next big political fight will take place May 18 in Kentucky 's Republican Senate primary .
Although Secretary of State Trey Grayson has the support of the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republican state establishment , he is running against Tea Party favorite Rand Paul , the son of former presidential candidate Ron Paul of Texas .
Paul is also supported by Sarah Palin and evangelical leader James Dobson .
Although Bennett blamed the " toxic " political environment , even he conceded that his Senate votes may have been a problem .
His votes for health care overhaul and the Trouble Asset Relief Program , painted by critics as the " Wall Street bailout , " enraged members of the Tea Party movement , who hope to purge incumbents of questionable conservative purity .
" The political atmosphere obviously has been toxic and it's very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment , " Bennett said Saturday in his concession speech .
Although their support for the GOP - backed fiscal conservative Marco Rubio may have caused Florida Republican Gov. Charlie Crist to run as an independent in the upcoming senate race there , Utah was Tea Party supporters ' first breakthrough victory .
John Avlon , co-author of " Wingnuts : How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America , " said on ABC , " This is a marker in the evolution of the Tea Party movement into becoming a real political force . "
Tea Party : Not Just ' Astroturf ' ?
" They have succeeded in taking out a Republican senator who is by most accounts a fellow conservative because he was insufficiently conservative when it came to government spending .
That is a real marker of a movement that is reaching maturity , " Avlon said .
In a competitive year when only 56 percent of Republicans say their party best represents their values , moderate Republican incumbents are targets .
According to a recent ABC News poll , 56 percent of Republicans say their party best represents their values , and 30 percent of Republicans say they pick the Tea Party movement instead of the GOP .
This contrasts with the Democratic Party , where 86 percent of Democrats say their party best represents their values .
Still , others chalk it up to anti-Washington sentiment and not necessarily pro-conservatism .
" This is an anti-Washington year , " conservative columnist and ABC News contributor George Will said .
" How do you get more Washington than a three - term senator who occupies the seat once held by his father , a four - term senator , who before that worked on the Senate staff and then as a lobbyist in Washington ?
He 's a wonderful man and a terrific senator , but the fact is , he 's going against terrific headwinds this year , and he cast three votes , TARP , stimulus , and an individual mandate for health care .
" Now , you might like one , two or all three of those , but being opposed to them is not outside the mainstream of American political argument . "
Author Avlon said , " If they stay on fiscal issues , they can have a real impact on this election .
There 's no question .
They have been able to channel voter anger into something that is genuinely grass roots not Astroturf . "
There have been predictions for months that the Democrats will take a big hit in the midterm election , but the ouster of Bennett shows that incumbents in both parties should be worried .
" Just because you have an ' R ' next to your name does n't mean you 're safe this year , " said Ramesh Ponnuru , a senior editor for National Review magazine .
But even with a Utah victory , and Palin 's support , the Tea Party movement still faces significant challenges .
A recent ABC News / Washington poll published May 5 showed that of the 27 percent who support the Tea Party movement , only 17 percent " strongly " support it , and only 2 percent say they 're " active participants . "
" They are going to need to show if they can actually beat Democratic incumbents and actually beat Republican incumbents -- and sort of put the fear of God into the party a little bit -- and that the activist base is a force to be reckoned with , not just to be used to advance the party 's chosen candidates , " Politico 's Alexander Burns told ABC .
ABC News ' David Kerley contributed to this story .
A 19 - pound Asian carp has been found near the shore of Lake Michigan , above a navigation lock that regional political leaders had been demanding the Army Corps slam shut to try to keep the invaders out of the world 's largest freshwater system .
The fish confirms what DNA evidence had been telling fishery managers for months - that Asian carp had indeed breached an electric fish barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , considered the last line of defense for Lake Michigan .
The bighead - nearly 3 feet long - is the first actual Asian carp found above the barrier , despite weeks of netting on the canal system and a $ 1.5 million fish - poisoning program last month .
It was plucked Tuesday from Lake Calumet , about six miles downstream from Lake Michigan , by a commercial fisherman hired by the state of Illinois to do routine fish sampling in the area .
" We set out earlier this year on a fact finding mission and we have found what we were looking for , " John Rogner , assistant director of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources , said in a news release Wednesday .
" This is important evidence and the more information we have about where Asian carp are , the better chance we have of keeping them out of the Great Lakes . "
The federal government said it has no intention to order shut two navigation locks in the area , something regional politicians outside Illinois have been demanding for months .
The plan is to continue " sampling actions " in Lake Calumet , which is north of the O'Brien lock , as well as other areas on the Chicago canal system .
This will involve netting and electrofishing .
Biologists say a handful of fish making their way into Lake Michigan does not mean a self - sustaining population is going to get established .
They say most initial invasions fail because the fish must find a suitable place to reproduce , then they must find each other and then their offspring must survive long enough to reproduce on their own .
Then , of course , the cycle has to repeat itself .
Over and over .
" We remain firmly committed to achieving our collective goal of preventing Asian carp from becoming established in Great Lakes waters , " said Mike Weimer , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service assistant regional director of the fisheries and aquatic resources program .
Meanwhile , federal officials say they will do their best to keep it business - as - usual for the barges , tour boats and recreational boat owners who use the navigation locks to move between the waterways and Lake Michigan .
" The Army Corps of Engineers will continue to operate the locks and dams in the Chicago Area Waterway System for congressionally authorized purposes of navigation , water diversion and flood control , " said Col. Vincent Quarles of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers .
' Worst fears ' realized
Michigan Attorney General and gubernatorial hopeful Mike Cox said the find means that the region 's " worst fears " have been realized , and he is considering further legal action .
The Republican led a coalition of Great Lakes states this year , including Wisconsin , in a push to reopen a decades - old U.S. Supreme Court lawsuit over of the operation of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal .
He wanted the court to order the locks shut , something the court declined to do .
" President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers have simply refused to take the threat seriously , " Cox 's office said in a statement .
But the news came as a relief to an industry group that depends on the navigation locks , which Army Corps officials say were never designed to be used as fish barriers .
" As the government 's own studies have shown , lock closure undermines the resources and regional support necessary to solve this problem , while doing nothing to protect the Great Lakes , " said Mark Biel , executive director of the Chemical Industry Council of Illinois .
Not necessarily a breach
Biel also said the fish find does n't necessarily prove there has been a breach at the electric fish barrier downstream on the Sanitary and Ship Canal , a sentiment echoed by Rogner of the Illinois DNR .
Rogner said in a Wednesday conference call with reporters that he is not convinced the fish made it to Lake Calumet on its own .
He noted that in the past decade there were two occasions where Asian carp were found in Chicago lagoons , bodies of water not connected to Lake Michigan .
Those fish likely were planted by individuals - live bighead were once commonly sold in Asian fish markets in the Chicago area .
Of course , Rogner said , it is also possible the fish somehow swam through the barrier ; the Army Corps did not turn up the fish - shocking device to a level strong enough to repel all sizes of Asian carp until the middle of last year , when the first DNA tests indicated the fish were mustering in an area just below it .
Conservationists Wednesday said they were n't surprised by the news .
" The ( environmental ) DNA has told us for months that the threat is real .
It 's time to stop fighting about whether there 's a problem and move on to developing real solutions , " said Thom Cmar of the Natural Resources Defense Council .
" Asian carp are like cockroaches .
If you find one , you likely have a much larger problem on your hands . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States will go after foreign websites that pirate American music and movies as part of a new strategy to stop sales of counterfeit and pirated goods at home and abroad , Vice President Joe Biden said on Tuesday .
“ This is theft , clear and simple , ” Biden said at a meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other Cabinet officials .
“ It ’s smash and grab , no different than a guy walking down Fifth Avenue and smashing the window at Tiffany ’s and reaching in and grabbing what ’s in the window , ” Biden said , referring to the jewelry store in New York City .
U.S. businesses estimate they lose billions of dollars each year to piracy and counterfeiting of items including films , music and consumer goods .
They also blame the illegal trade for hundreds of thousands of lost U.S. jobs .
“ It is especially critical that the United States has an effective framework for protecting creative content online and enforcing intellectual property rights in the digital environment , ” said Bob Pisano , interim chief executive officer at the Motion Picture Association of America .
U.S. computer and video game makers also cheered the promise of tougher enforcement .
The National Association of Manufacturers urged the administration to focus especially on China , which it has called “ ground zero ” for piracy and counterfeiting .
The U.S. Trade Representative ’s office has battled for years to close websites in Russia , China and other countries that sell pirated American music and films .
“ ROGUE ACTORS DOING ILLICIT BUSINESS ”
Biden said the United States would exert more pressure on foreign governments to shut down the sites by “ being as public as we possibly can ” about illegal activity .
“ As we shine the spotlight on foreign governments that have rogue actors doing illicit business within their borders , it ’s the government ’s responsibility to respond , ” he said .
Biden did not mention any foreign websites by name .
A recent USTR report said China ’s top Internet search firm , Baidu Inc , was associated with between 50 percent and 75 percent of illegal music downloads in China .
Several Russian websites still provide illegal downloads , even though the most notorious and formerly largest site , Allofmp3 , was shut down in 2007 , the USTR report said .
The plan , mandated by Congress in 2008 , also includes steps to ensure the federal government does not buy counterfeit goods .
Biden framed that issue as a matter of both safety and national security , noting the risk of sending soldiers into combat with counterfeit Kevlar vests .
The strategy also includes new steps aimed at stopping the importation of counterfeit goods ranging from toothpaste and clothing to auto parts to medicine .
“ The theft of virtually everything Americans make , create and innovate has been facilitated by the lack of a comprehensive strategy to put these thieves out of business , ” David Hirschmann , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s Global Intellectual Property Center , said in a statement welcoming Biden ’s announcement .
Countdown to Disaster
21 Days Before the Blast
From the pasturelands outside a little Mississippi town called Liberty , Shane Roshto steers his pickup truck toward Houma , Louisiana , a bit more than four hours to the south .
He 'll sleep in his truck tonight , Tuesday , March 30 , in the parking lot at the heliport off Highway 24 , and get up at dawn to meet the chopper that will fly him out to the Deepwater Horizon , a drilling rig floating over a mile - deep canyon in the Gulf of Mexico .
Shane has been working on the Horizon for almost four years now , ever since he got Natalie pregnant .
He fell in love with her the night they met , just before Christmas break in ' 04 , when they were juniors in high school , and Natalie fell in love with him , too .
Her daddy just about died when he found out she was pregnant , but Shane did n't flinch .
" Well , " he told Natalie , " I guess it 's about time I grew up . "
He quit his classes at the community college and signed up with Transocean , a Swiss company that drills oil and gas wells in waters all over the planet .
His first hitch on the Horizon was in August ' 06 , two weeks as a seaman , bottom of the pecking order .
He marched up to the drilling manager , stuck out his hand , and said , " I'm Shane Roshto , and I 've got my eye on one of your jobs . "
Ballsy .
He left for two weeks —
Transocean worked its crews fourteen days on and fourteen off back then — and returned as a roustabout , a common laborer but better than a seaman .
He made roughneck a year later , and he figured another two , maybe three hitches , he might make the subsea crew , maintaining the blowout preventer and the pipes that run to the ocean floor , as well as almost everything else below the waterline .
Backbreaking work , but it paid better than roughneck , and roughnecking wore a man out just as fast .
" The oil field gave me life , " he 'd tease Natalie sometimes , " but it 's gonna take my life , too . "
And Shane 's got a good life now .
He married Natalie when she was eight months pregnant , in December ' 06 , and their boy , Blaine , turned 3 back in February .
His job puts a roof over their heads and food on the table and , when he pulled an extra two weeks at sea last year , a pile of presents under the Christmas tree .
And it 's good work , proud work .
Shane calls himself oil - field trash , but he smiles when he says it .
The rig he's on is a wondrous machine , a semisubmersible drill poking holes through seabeds at unfathomable depths , tapping oil and gas deposits thought to be unreachable only a few years back .
When the Horizon hit a world record , 35,050 feet , in the Gulf last September , Natalie could practically see his head swell .
The only downside is the schedule — all those long stretches away from his wife and son , especially after Transocean switched to three - week rotations last fall .
" This paycheck better bring me home , " he 'd tell his buddies on the rig .
And it always did .
At 6 a.m. on the last day of March , the helicopter ferries Shane out to sea .
His shift on the drill floor will start at midnight and last until noon , and he 'll work twelve hours every day until his hitch is up .
14 Days
Freddy Demolle is in his boat , a twentytwo - footer tethered to one of the platforms not too far out into the Gulf , his face shaded by a ball cap that has jesus is my boss stitched across the front .
He 's 63 years old , and he 's been fishing or shrimping or crabbing for a living his whole life .
Now he 's after sheepshead , which have come into the shallower waters to spawn , and they 're schooling around the rig pilings , feeding on barnacles and the shrimp Freddy 's stabbing onto the hook of his cane pole .
He 's pulling them out as fast as he can set bait .
If they keep biting , he 'll motor back to Venice with a ton of fish , maybe more , and he 'll sell them at the dock for forty cents a pound .
If the fish quit taking his shrimp , Freddy will untie his boat and move to another rig and then another until he finds one where the sheepshead are biting .
There are upwards of 4,000 platforms in the Gulf , some abandoned and most way farther out than Freddy 's willing to take his little boat , and each is like a little reef that draws crustaceans and baitfish that draw the bigger fish .
Oil rigs make for good fishing , and it's been that way ever since Freddy can remember .
Satellite images released and analyzed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) and Amnesty International ’s Science for Human Rights Program show the dramatic impact of the recent violent events on the city of Osh in southern Kyrgyzstan .
The new findings were released shortly after a top U.N. official warned the Security Council that ethnic tensions in Kyrgyzstan continue , along with fears that there could be another wave of violence in the strategic Central Asian state .
Entire neighborhoods are burnt down ( 1,640 structures are damaged or destroyed in total ) , leaving only empty shells of houses behind .
You can see a sample of the Cheremushki neighborhood at our interactive explorer or check out the in - depth analysis from our colleagues at AAAS .
Additionally , and even more distressing , we found more than one hundred “ SOS ” signs throughout Osh , mainly in still intact areas .
The varying sizes , shapes , and orientations of these images show little regard for the viewing angle or perspective of ground - based observers .
As such , it is likely that many of them would be difficult to read , except from above , indicating that the population is aware that it is being observed from above .
To the remaining residents in Osh we would like to say that we have documented your distress and captured your dozens of large SOS signs from space .
Today ’s release of satellite images comes amidst reports that the Kyrgyzstani interim government is not in full control of its security force and that Uzbekistani authorities started expelling refugees to Kyrgyzstan .
The Uzbekistani authorities should refrain from forcibly removing , coercing or persuading refugees from Kyrgyzstan to return until they can do so in safety and dignity .
We are also very concerned that encouragement by the Kyrgyzstani interim government for refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes is premature as Kyrgyzstani security forces do not appear to be able to ensure the safety and security of these persons .
We have issued several Urgent Actions to protect displaced people .
Join us in urging the government of Uzbekistan ( pdf ) to refrain from the forcible return of refugees .
The deadly violence is said to have started with clashes between rival gangs of mostly Kyrgyz and Uzbek youths on 10 June and rapidly escalated , reportedly leaving more than 2,000 people dead and thousands injured .
Around 400,000 people are reported to have fled their homes and about 100,000 are believed to have fled to Uzbekistan .
To document the violence and help clarify the extent of the devastation , we conducted a damage assessment – based on satellite images – of the city of Osh , Kyrgyzstan and surrounding neighborhoods .
The analysis serves to corroborate the reports of widespread arson and to quantify the scale of destruction .
The images confirm that while most of the city remains largely intact , where present , the damage is severe .
Large swaths of buildings in the city appear to have been destroyed , a pattern which is repeated in the northern and eastern suburbs .
Additionally , on numerous occasions the letters “ SOS ” appear on roadways and athletic fields throughout the city .
In fact , the total count of “ SOS ” messages within this study area is 116 .
To clarify all facts on the ground , we are calling for an international investigation into the violent events that have taken place in the past week in southern Kyrgyzstan .
Only an international investigation will be considered unbiased and credible by all affected groups .
answers in genesis tackles logic , fails miserably
Answers
In Genesis tries to debate the divine origins of logic as if it was a law of physics with the most illogical drivel they could muster .
When you live in constant denial , one of the benefits of your avoidance of the real world is getting to make up your own rules of physics , chemistry , biology and history , and then pretending as if they actually apply outside of your imagination , especially when you sell them as your religious beliefs .
Just ask Ken Ham and his band of professional ignoramuses .
After publishing countless articles that are wrong about virtually every aspect of middle school science and opening a museum which serves as a testament of rabid religious denialism , they decided that if you believe that The Flintstones was an accurate account of human pre-history , you could tackle logical constructs to prove that those uppity atheists are the irrational ones rather than you .
Really , at this point it ’s actually kind of sad because the whole thing reads like it was written by a sixth grader …
The materialistic atheist can’t have laws of logic .
He believes that everything that exists is material — part of the physical world .
But laws of logic are not physical .
You ca n’t stub your toe on a law of logic .
Laws of logic cannot exist in the atheist ’s world , yet he uses them to try to reason .
…
He is borrowing from the Christian worldview to argue against the Christian worldview .
The atheist ’s view cannot be rational because he uses things that cannot exist according to his profession .
Basically , the argument here is that since materialists believe everything is a part of a natural world and laws of logic are n’t tangible , therefore Christianity according to them is right and there ’s a magical creature running the 6,000 year old universe to which you can telepathically talk at your leisure .
Wow , gee , is n’t Jason Lisle , the AiG astrophysicist who sacrificed his reason to Ham ’s inane war on science , so logical ?
Too bad he ca n’t distinguish between abstract concepts and physical entities , basing his entire argument on that inability , but hey , he says he can prove it by confusing the very measurable and well - defined physical laws of causality with the notion of a god ’s supernatural consistency .
Oh and by borrowing an example from Sunday School for first and second graders , which you ’ll probably be able to recognize pretty quickly .
Breathing requires air , not a profession of belief in air .
Likewise , logical reasoning requires God , not a profession of belief in Him .
Of course the atheist can reason ; it ’s because God has made his mind and given him access to the laws of logic — and that ’s the point .
It ’s because God exists that reasoning is possible .
The atheist can reason , but within his own worldview he cannot account for his ability to reason .
Umm … ok ?
Note to the AiG ’s zombies : asserting things does n’t mean you logically proved them .
We can see air , we can breathe it , we can trap it , measure it , analyze it , and create it in the lab .
If you ’re going to compare a deity to air , you better make sure we can do the same with the deity , otherwise you ’re comparing apples to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8 and pretending that your lapse in thought is somehow logical .
Even worse is the ridiculous insistence that just because we exist , it must mean your God exists too .
We can reason thanks to millions of years of evolution which gave us the rudiments of intelligence , a real sense of right and wrong straight from the cradle , and helped spawn societies with their legal codices .
But would n’t you know it , the brilliant logician that is Lisle saw through the ruse and can counter with the following …
The atheist might respond , “ Laws of logic are material they ’re electro - chemical connections in the brain . ”
But then the laws of logic are not universal ; they would not extend beyond the brain .
In other words , we could n’t argue that contradictions cannot occur on Mars , since no one ’s brain is on Mars .
In fact , if the laws of logic are just electro - chemical connections in the brain , then they would differ somewhat from person to person because everyone has different connections in their brain .
Ow .
The stupid .
It burns like the death ray spawned by a feeding black hole ’s surging magnetic fields , as Orac would probably say .
While trying to prove that the laws of logic are invariable throughout the universe , Lisle is so completely unaware of what he ’s saying , he does n’t even notice that he proves himself wrong .
Obviously , a mix of fundamentalism and denial gave him very different ideas of what the laws of logic are for most people since he ’s trying to argue that his ability to think the way a rabid Biblical literalist does is incontrovertible proof of a deity .
And on top of that , just to make this even worse and more embarrassing on himself , he goes on to compare the uniform laws of physics on a macro scale to his personal interpretations of Ham ’s screeds .
So he thinks that he logically proved that because gravity does n’t reverse itself on Mars , he was granted supreme logical skills from the creator of the universe .
Unless he prefixed all this with the world “ Christianity , ” most of us would probably think that he should spend a few weeks in a padded room for observation .
Is this what passes for logic in AiG ’s collective lapse of thought ?
This is like being lectured about genetics by an obnoxious six year old who thinks he knows so much about the subject that he can condescend to you as he spews out utter nonsense .
And if it was n’t grown men doing the same thing and insisting on propagating this insipidity among others under a false guise of scientific authority , it would actually be kind of funny .
But in reality , this exercise in “ logic ” is just the ramblings of a zealot desperately grasping at straws and passing off mindless repetition and assertions as an argument for a magical sky man who listens to his thoughts if he thinks hard enough .
Really , what deity would even want to have such followers ?
If you are of the type of the gamer who actually keeps abreast with daily world news besides gaming then you should not be a stranger to the BP Oil fiasco .
According to reports , the amount of oil spilling in to the Gulf of Mexico stands at 25,000 barrels a day .
Now how much is that in terms of quantity one might ask ?
We have got the answer for that .
We got a video from Youtube which uses the Unreal Engine to render 25,000 barrels .
Check it out , its pretty interesting .

THE DEPROLIFERATOR —
Many of us hoped for more from the Nuclear Posture Review ( of government policy on nuclear weapons ) — such as that it stand up like a man instead of continue to work from the crouch .
Still , as with the new START treaty , it may not be transformational , but it is transitional .
As Jeffrey Lewis , these days one of the media ’s automatic go - to guys ( and deservedly ) when it comes to nuclear weapons , writes about the details , “ none of that will matter a year from now .
I suspect we will look back at this period — the release of the Nuclear Posture Review , the signing of the Prague Treaty , the Nuclear Security Summit and the NPT Review conference — and say that this was a pivot point , the moment when we began talking about nuclear weapons on terms that are different from those of the Cold War . ”
But just because we ’re talking about nukes in terms different from those of the Cold War does n’t mean that there are n’t many of us who are n’t on good terms with the new NPR .
Let ’s begin by reviewing one of the circumstances that helped pave the way for President Obama to negotiate the new START , revise the NPR , and arouse hopes for an international security meeting this month and the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference that has just begun .
We ’re speaking about the celebrated series of Wall Street Journal op - eds written by the “ Four Horsemen . ”
( Yeah , I know — kind of silly when groups of four people are reflexively termed “ horsemen ” or “ gang of . ”
Still , the of - the - Apocalypse implication comes at the expense of the reputations of at least three of them . )
They , of course , were Henry Kissinger ; another former secretary of state , George Schultz ; a secretary of defense , William Perry ; and long - time senator and chairman of the Committee on Armed Services , Sam Nunn .
Their first op - ed , which appeared in January of 2007 , with its call for the gradual abolition of nuclear weapons , caught many by surprise .
Heck , they were even willing to eventually throw the baby — deterrence — out with the bathwater .
Disarmament , they claimed , was “ consistent with America ’s moral heritage . ”
The aging equestrians renewed their call in January of 2008 when they presented a soon to be oft - quoted analogy : “ In some respects , the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons is like the top of a very tall mountain . …
We must chart a course to higher ground where the mountaintop becomes more visible . ”
But as Darwin Bondgraham , Nicholas Robinson , and Will Parrish wrote of the four horsemen in a blockbuster article for Z Magazine in 2009 :
The novelty of such a hawkish [ aside from Nunn , noted for his co-authorship of the Nunn - Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program — ­­RW ] and bipartisan coalition .
. . promoting the goal of nuclear disarmament , has curiously been spared critical reflection by long - time anti-nuclear activists .
Indeed , many of the more established arms control , disarmament , and peace organizations .
. . have fallen over themselves with eagerness to cite the WSJ essay and the supposedly new political terrain it maps out .
Indeed , the third 4 - H op - ed , “ How to Protect Our Nuclear Deterrent , ” published after the Z piece , finally gave the disarmament community pause .
Shortly afterwards , the same trio wrote of the Four Horsemen that they :
. . . have gone so far as to call for a surge in nuclear weapons spending at the national laboratories .
The Four Horsemen endorse the view of a recent Congressional committee on nuclear weapons policy .
. . which concluded that “ investments are urgently needed .
. . in the laboratories ’ budgets for the science , technology , and engineering programs that support and underwrite the nation ’s nuclear deterrent . ”
In fact , they maintain :
With their direct links to the corporations that manage the weapons labs .
. . the Four Horsemen are the chief negotiators working through public forums to limit the extent of arms control treaties and extract the biggest pro-nuclear lab concessions .
[ The ] technocratic corps of [ the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories ] have long been known as powerful bulwarks against international treaties that limit nuclear arms development .
Or , as Jonathan Schell , less than thrilled by the new START , wrote in the Nation : “ If this trend continues , it is entirely possible that the ultimate mockery will occur : nuclear arsenals will march forward into the future under a banner that reads Ban the Bomb . ”
Kindly Keep Your Thoughts About Conspiracy Theories to Yourself
Meanwhile , what about those “ direct links to the corporations that manage the weapons labs ” ?
Rather than allowing a neat policy process carried out at the executive level to determine the future of the nuclear weapons complex , forces with financial .
. . stakes in nuclear weaponry , working through think tanks like [ the Hoover Institute ] , or corporate entities like Bechtel and the University of California , are actively attempting to lock in a de- facto set of policies by building a new research , design , and production infrastructure that will ensure nuclear weapons are a centerpiece of the US military empire far into the future .
The crux of their argument :
Their ability to accomplish this is dependent on [ in part ] the illusion , strongly held among arms controllers .
. . that the future will ultimately be shaped by what the Nuclear Posture Review says , and whether .
. . nonproliferation treaties result in reducing arsenal counts .
In other words , we ’re watching the wrong hand in the shell game — the political instead of the economic .
What ’s with the Hoover Institution , the University of California , and Bechtel then ?
In their their first article , the authors write :
For roughly four decades , this influential right - wing think tank has enjoyed a little - known , but fateful .
. . affiliation with .
. . . the University of California [ which ] has managed the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratories since their inceptions in the mid-20th century .
…
In 2003 [ after , among other things ] a series of revelations concerning security violations and managerial corruption at the labs .
. . the U.S. Department of Energy . . . put the lucrative management contracts up for bid . …
In response , the UC formed a limited liability corporation ( LLC ) with the Bechtel Corporation [ and later ] Lawrence Livermore .
Hoover ’s Board of Trustees includes current Bechtel CEO Riley Bechtel and aforementioned horse - person William Perry is a senior fellow at Hoover .
George Schultz , president of Bechtel for eight years before he became secretary of state , is now a senior fellow at Hoover .
In their second article , the authors quote a retired Livermore physicist to the effect that “ the new ‘ nuclear weapons - zero ’ evangelism at the Hoover Institution is another in a long line of carefully crafted excuses to keep open the pipeline from the U.S. Treasury to the nuclear weapons intelligentsia subsidy , and particularly its California contingent . ”
The Strategic Defense Initiative , itself hatched at Hoover , was an early attempt at what the authors call “ anti-nuclear nuclearism ” designed to , “ disempower the movement for nuclear abolition by seizing the moral high ground from under them , while simultaneously providing huge long - term flows of funding to Los Alamos and Livermore Labs . …
These practical agendas are more or less obscured behind the rhetorical agenda of disarmament . ”
For example :
A litmus test for the sincerity of the four horsemen ’s desire to pursue nuclear abolition occurred shortly after publication of their initial op - ed .
Since 2005 , the directors at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore had been promoting a program called the Reliable Replacement Warhead ( RRW ) , which they hoped would take the place of Stockpile Stewardship as the raison d’etre of the nuclear weapons complex .
Under the rubric of “ replacing ” existing nuclear warheads and enabling a quantitative reduction in the U.S. arsenal , the labs sought to develop a new model nuclear weapon , receive billions of dollars in funding for production infrastructure , and train cadres of weapons scientists for future careers in the nuclear enterprise .
Also enmeshed in the Bechtel - UC web , they write , is , “ none other than Obama ’s own undersecretary of Arms Control and International Security .
. . Ellen Tauscher . … During her tenure in Congress , Tauscher represented California ’s conservative 10th Congressional District which includes the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory [ and ] Lockheed Martin ’s Sandia Lab campus in Livermore . …
When all is said and done , her role as a US Rep. and now State Department official is to boost nuclear weapons spending at the labs . ”
Procure pork , that is .
To reiterate , thus far , they write that “ statements of politicians and elder statesmen about a world free of nuclear weapons .
… has served to fix the attention of disarmament and antiwar activists on abstract levels of policy declaration and international negotiation .
This has unfortunately blinded them to the political deal - making process at hand . ”
In other words , disarmament advocates give more weight to the political than the porcine at their own risk .

Q : Did Obama turn down foreign offers of assistance in cleaning up the Gulf oil spill ?
Did he refuse to waive Jones
Act restrictions on foreign - flag vessels ?
A : No to both questions .
So far , offers from six foreign countries or entities have been accepted and only one offer has been rejected .
Fifteen foreign - flag vessels are working on the cleanup , and none required a waiver .
FULL QUESTION
Is it true that Obama blocked foreign help with cleaning up the Gulf oil spill because he refused to waive the Jones Act , which requires all boats to be American made and crewed by Americans to work in U.S. waters , even though it has been routinely waived for similar events ?
FULL ANSWER
We ’ve received several questions about the federal government ’s response to the oil spill .
This one claims that a provision of the Merchant Marine Act , called the Jones Act , has prohibited foreign vessels from entering U.S. waters and assisting in the cleanup .
Some critics have charged — falsely — that Obama ’s refusal to waive the Jones Act has kept foreign vessels from assisting in cleanup efforts .
In a June 23 interview on " Fox & Friends , " Republican Rep. Charles Djou of Hawaii was asked by show host Gretchen Carlson about the Jones Act and why the administration was refusing foreign assistance .
Djou answered :
Djou , June 23 : It ’s important that we take help from whomever and wherever they ’re willing to offer it .
…
So why are we not waiving the Jones Act to allow international help to come in ? …
Why we ’re not waiving it here … is baffling .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , both Republicans , have also claimed that the Jones Act , which was temporarily lifted by President Bush after Hurricane Katrina , is now standing in the way of foreign vessels bringing assistance to the United States .
They are both incorrect .
Palin stated this in an interview with Fox News ’ Greta Van Susteren :
Palin , June 11 : For one , there needs to be a waiving of the Jones
Act so that we could have had many , many days ago , weeks ago , some help with skimmers from elsewhere , besides just U.S. flagships , come over and help in this tragedy .
And that order needs to be given to [ Coast Guard ] Admiral [ Thad ]
Allen right now .
It ’s amazing to me and to so many others that though President Bush had been able to waive Jones Act provisions for Katrina , President Obama has n’t thought to do that yet ?
And yet surely , that has been suggested by those experts around him .
In reality , the Jones Act has yet to be an issue in the response efforts .
The Deepwater Horizon response team reported in a June 15 press release that there are 15 foreign flagged ships currently participating in the oil spill cleanup .
None of them needed a waiver because the Jones Act does not apply .
The Jones
Act is a trade and commerce law that was enacted in 1920 as part of a larger Marine Merchant Act .
It requires all trade delivered between U.S. ports to be carried in U.S. flagged vessels constructed in the United States and owned by American citizens .
The law states its purpose is to develop a merchant marine for national defense and commerce .
Why was the Jones Act waived as part of the Hurricane Katrina response , and why has n’t it been waived now ?
Katrina inflicted massive infrastructure damage , which restricted the availability of key resources .
According to the Deepwater Horizon response team : " A Jones Act waiver was granted during Hurricane Katrina due to the significant disruption in the production and transportation of petroleum and / or refined petroleum products in the region during that emergency and the impact this had on national defense . "
The Deepwater Horizon spill has yet to affect infrastructure or oil and gas availability ; the damage is environmental , and foreign vessels are approved for delivering resources and conducting offshore skimming .
Although the Jones
Act is currently not applicable , the federal government has taken steps to expedite the waiver process should the oil spill response require a Jones Act waiver for trade and commerce .
Also , contrary to reports such as the one on " Fox & Friends , " international assistance has been accepted .
To date , 25 countries and four international organizations have offered support in the form of skimming vessels , containment and fire boom , technical assistance and response solutions , among others .
A chart provided by the State Department shows that as of June 23 offers from six foreign countries or entities had been accepted .
Fifty more offers were under consideration — including multiple offers from a single country or entity .
One offer had been declined : France offered a chemical dispersant that is not approved for use in the United States .
President Barack Obama described this process in his May 27 press conference :
Obama , May 27 :
The job of our response team is to say , okay , if 17 countries have offered equipment and help , let ’s evaluate what they ’ve offered :
How fast can it get here ?
Is it actually going to be redundant , or will it actually add to the overall effort — because in some cases , more may not actually be better .
And decisions have been made based on the best information available that says here ’s what we need right now .
It may be that a week from now or two weeks from now or a month from now the offers from some of those countries might be more effectively utilized .
Each offer must be compliant not only with the needs outlined by the Unified Command , but also with U.S. safety regulations .
The Unified Command provided us with this statement and information :
Unified Command , June 22 : Those offers of international assistance that were not accepted , while greatly appreciated , did not meet the operational requirements of the Unified Command .
These offers have not been declined because they may be needed in the future as response strategies change .
Some challenges in accepting these offers included : Equipment failed to meet US requirements / specifications ( i.e. dispersant not on approved list / containment boom made of non-approved material )
Contingencies placed on the offers proved logistically impracticable when compared to other sources .
In one instance , the offering country ’s export laws prohibited delivery of the assistance
Contingencies placed on the offers made it difficult for the Unified Command to meet the contingency
Also , all offers , except for a few , come with a serious price tag .
The Associated Press compared these offers with recent aid that the U.S. gave to some of these countries .
The AP reported :
Associated Press , June 18 : U.S. disaster aid is almost always free of charge ; other nations expect the U.S. to pay for help .
" These offers are not typically offers of aid , " said Lt. Erik Halvorson , a Coast Guard spokesman .
" Normally , they are offers to sell resources to BP or the U.S. government . "
Reports claiming that the federal government has refused help are not only incorrect — foreign assistance has been utilized — but are also misleading : purchasing resources and expertise is vastly different from accepting " foreign aid . "
– Joshua Goldman
Correction , July 1 : As of June 23 , the U.S. had accepted six offers of assistance from six foreign countries or entities .
The original post said five offers were accepted .
We have updated the post to include the correct number .

BANGKOK —
Two months of tension and violence ended with a whimper on Thursday as the last exhausted group of protesters filed out of a Buddhist temple where they had taken refuge , bewildered and frightened , some in tears .
As they shuffled past a smear of blood on the ground that told of the recent fighting , a line of female police officers in black berets comforted them , touching their shoulders and murmuring : “ Do n’t be afraid .
You ’re safe now .
Have a safe journey home . ”
But it felt , on this morning after a political convulsion unlike anything anyone here has seen , that Thailand ’s future was anything but safe .
“ It was tragic , ” said Anusart Suwanmongkol , a senator who supports the government .
“ Yesterday was the most tragic day in my memory , in Thai history .
Nobody gained anything .
Nobody won .
The country lost . ”

Currently , the PlayStation 2 is king of the best - selling console hill , but come October ...

According to NPD analysts who 've been tracking gaming sales , " The NDS is approaching the PS2 as the best - selling hardware system of all time ... and by October or November of this year , it should meet or exceed the install base of the PS2 . "
With PSP sales sliding and Nintendo DS sales tallying up to 129 million units so far , Sony had better pull its finger from its triangle button and start producing a proper successor to the PSP .

AN 82 - year - old woman 's family left her to die in a tiny attic covered in faeces and blood , an inquest was told yesterday .
Valerie O'Connor deserved to " die in comfort and with dignity " in the home she shared with her daughter Lynette O'Connor and grandchildren Sean and Shane .
Instead she suffered what a coroner described as the worst case of cruelty to a senior citizen she had ever seen .
Glebe Coroner 's Court , in Sydney , was told that Mrs O'Connor was bed - ridden and suffering from an undiagnosed stomach cancer .
On January 14 , 2008 , she was found by her sister , Shirley Barber , in a tin-roof attic on a 44C day , lying in sheets that had n't been washed for months .
She weighed just 35kg .
In papers tendered to the court , police and medical experts detailed Mrs O'Connor 's living conditions .
The tiny attic bedroom was covered in faeces and blood .
Mrs O'Connor was given a bucket to use as a toilet but was incapable of getting off her bed to use it .
She was fed a diet that included Milo , pizza and mudcake , the court was told .
Mrs Barber likened the appearance of her sister to a " concentration camp victim " .
The inquest was told that Mrs O'Connor died three days after being admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from sepsis and a perforated bowel - side effects from the undiagnosed cancer .
Coroner Mary Jerram said : " Thiis one of the worst matters of which I have heard in this court or any other as
to an elderly person being uncared for .
" It 's hard to imagine how any caring person could allow her to get into the state she was in without seeking help , medical or community services .
" All people are entitled to die in comfort and with dignity , she did not .
She was sadly neglected . "
Mrs O'Connor 's daughter Lynette rejected an invitation from Ms Jerram to take the stand and put forward her version of events .
Ms Jerram said she could not pursue legal action against Lynette O'Connor or her partner Michael Gray because it was cancer that had killed Mrs O'Connor .
" I must find that Valerie O'Connor died on January 17 at RPA cause of death being sepsis , perforated bowel , stomach cancer , " she said .
" That is the cause of her death .
But I do regard those who were supposed to be caring for her as contributing to the terrible manner of her death . "
Outside court , Mrs O'Connor 's niece Carrol Barber remembered her as a " caring person " .
" She did n't deserve to go like this .
No person should have to live their last days in that sort of agony , " she said .
More than a hundred and fifty years ago , Americans were thrown into jail for not paying their debts , until the country did away with so - called debtors ’ prisons in 1833 .
Today , similar punishments have returned for those in over their heads in debts .
While millions of Americans are still struggling to pay off credit cards and loans , many are finding themselves serving time in local jails because of failures to make payments or to appear at court hearings with debt collectors .
Consumer attorneys said they ’ve witnessed a rise in debt - related arrests in Arkansas , Arizona , Minnesota and Washington .
In Minnesota , arrest warrants for debtors have increased 60 % during the past four years .
Those arrested often serve 48 hours in local jails .
But in some states , judges have ordered individuals to serve jail time until coming up with minimum payments to creditors .
The federal government does not keep figures on these kinds of arrests , and the industry would prefer to keep it that way , says Robert Hobbs , deputy director of the National Consumer Law Center in Boston .
“ My suspicion is the debt collection industry does not want the world to know these arrests are happening , because the practice would be widely condemned , ” Hobbs told the Minneapolis - St. Paul Star Tribune .

So apparently my blog was listed as an attacker page on Google because some sneaky bastard figured out a way to hack me and install malware .
That was no good , but luckily it has all been cleared up .
The only thing my blog is intended to attack is arteries , and few places attack arteries quite like Vicious Dogs , a wonderful little hot dog joint in North Hollywood .
Some places you can tell are going to be good just by taking a look at their facade .
This facade was pretty amazing , sporting a 10 foot plastic hot dog , and although this hot dog was loaded with veggies , it was a very good sign .
I walked on in and was surprised to find that Vicious Dogs also doubled as a cupcake shop .
It was a strange mix of foods , but I had no time to deal with cupcakery , I was here to eat something vicious and dog - like .
Their menu was loaded with some great hot dog options .
The man behind the counter who seemed to run the place told us to get the Sweet and Spicy Kielbasa .
I do usually like to go with recommendations , but that hot dog full of peppers and onions would have been wasted on me .
Instead , I saw one of their specials on the counter , called the Daddy Mack .
This hot dog creation consisted of a hot dog wrapped in bacon , topped with either mustard or BBQ sauce , and then further topped with mac and cheese , all for only $ 3.99 ( and an extra 10 % off for Disney employees like this guy ) .
I had to to have such genius in my mouth and ordered it with BBQ sauce .
My compatriot ordered the Sweet and Spicy Kielbasa , so I was able to at least get a look at the chef ’s special .
When it arrived , I was slightly disappointed to see what looked like Velveeta Shells and Cheese topping my hot dog .
Do n’t get me wrong , I love me some Velveeta Shells and Cheese , but I kind of hoped Vicious Dogs would give me something more unique .
Nonetheless , this thing was loaded and I grabbed a fork , knowing that bun could n’t contain all that mac .
I started digging in and was happy to find that the bacon was thin and crispy .
On its own , I think bacon should be thick , but for a hot dog I did n’t want it to overwhelm .
The mac and cheese tasted like I had expected , which was n’t amazing , but I do have to give the place major kudos for coming up with the idea of adding mac and cheese to a hot dog .
It certainly took the cheese dog to the next level .
Now the hot dog itself was pretty tasty , and despite the toppings it was flavorful enough to maintain its position as the centerpiece of the meal .
I am definitely looking forward to visiting Vicious Dogs again .
They have some great concepts and although the Daddy Mack hot dog could have used a few more touches , it was pretty inspirational .
Plus , their specials seem to always be changing , so I know that I ’ll be able to find new hot dog creations to chow down on for a long time .
Nine Turkish activists killed in an Israeli raid on a Gaza - bound aid ship were shot a total of 30 times and five died of gunshot wounds to the head , Britain 's Guardian newspaper reported on Friday .
Open gallery view Turkish TV shows coffins aboard the Mavi Marmara , a Gaza - bound ship raided by Israel , June 4 , 2010 Credit : AP
Autopsy results showed the men were hit mostly with 9 mm bullets , many fired at close range , the Guardian said , quoting Yalcin Buyuk , vice - chairman of the Turkish council of forensic medicine which carried out the autopsies on Friday .
Israeli commandos stormed a flotilla of aid ships planning to break the Israeli sea blockade of Gaza on Monday .
The deaths , which all took place on one ship , the Mavi Marmara , drew widespread condemnation .
Israel said the marines who rappelled onto the Mavi Marmara fired in self - defense after activists attacked them with clubs and knives as well as two pistols snatched from the commandos .
The autopsy results showed that a 60 - year - old man , Ibrahim Bilgen , was shot four times in the temple , chest , hip and back , the Guardian said .
A 19 - year - old , named as Fulkan Dogan , who also has U.S. citizenship , as shot five times from less than 45 cm away , in the face , the back of the head , twice in the leg and once in the back , it said .
Two other men were shot four times .
Five of those killed were shot either in the back of the head or in the back , the Guardian quoted Buyuk as saying .
In addition to those killed , 48 others suffered gunshot wounds and six activists were still missing , he added .
Israel said the multiple gunshot wounds did not mean the shots were fired other than in self defense .
" The only situation when a soldier shot was when it was a clearly a life - threatening situation , " the Guardian quoted a spokesman for the Israeli embassy in London as saying .
" Pulling the trigger quickly can result in a few bullets being in the same body , but does not change the fact they were in a life - threatening situation , " the spokesman said .
The newspaper quoted Haluk Ince , chairman of the council of forensic medicine in Istanbul , as saying that in only one case was there a single bullet wound , to the forehead from a distant shot , while every other body showed multiple wounds .
He said all but one of the bullets retrieved from the bodies came from 9 mm rounds .
Of the other round , Ince said : " It was the first time we have seen this kind of material used in firearms .
" It was just a container including many types of pellets usually used in shotguns .
It penetrated the head region in the temple
and we found it intact in the brain . "
No -one at Turkey 's forensic laboratory could immediately be reached for comment .
After last week ’s edition of TNA Impact , will we finally get the answers to all of our questions ?
What prompted “ The Monster ” to return , and will “ The Icon ” be forced to speak ?
Find out here :

THEY are the one who told me what to do , and Hulk , THEY are coming and they ’re going to be here sooner than you think …
Nothing is going to be able to stop it ! ”

While Abyss is enjoying the moment , Hulk Hogan comes out from the tunnel with a steel chair and cracks Abyss in the back with it .
Abyss whips around and security gets between him and Hulk as broadcast goes off the air .
QUICK THOUGHTS :
The opening sequence was sort of silly , with Abyss shoving the ring in Hogan ’s mouth and trying to choke him out , but I think when it comes down to this turn for Abyss it was necessary to sever all ties with Hulk .
Now there ’s bad blood between them and it works .
I can only imagine who is the THEY that Abyss is talking about .
The main event was n’t good .
For it being billed as Falls Count Anywhere and No DQ , it was really lame .
They really did n’t get to much into the weapons and the action did n’t leave the ring side area until after the bell .
Now that Flair has assaulted Lethal ’s brother it has gone from just business to personal .
The one thing I did n’t like about what happened tonight was that they did n’t show Lethal going to rescue his brother .
I would ’ve like to see them rectify that situation either with Lethal finding him beaten down or actually getting into it with Flair and Styles .
Missed opportunity there .
Sting once again outsmarts Jeff Jarrett .
Shocker !
Remember , Sting is now all about deception !
This rivalry will be drawn out all the way until Victory Road or even longer .
The pot keeps boiling and it ’s going to boil over soon enough for Team 3D .
Devon is getting pissed at Ray , and it ’s only a matter of time before they come to blows .
I ’m looking forward to the fallout .
WWE dark matches have the cameras rolling once again as Superstars is on the air .

It ’s an odd fact that the biggest science story of the twenty - first century — probably the biggest ever — broke in that tabloid of tabloids , The National Bedrock .
I was in the middle of conducting a NASA press conference several days before the Minerva lift - off — the Return to the Moon — and I was fielding softball questions like : “ Is it true that if everything goes well , the Mars mission will be moved up ? ” and “ What is Marcia Beckett going to say when she becomes the first person to set foot on lunar soil since Eugene Cernan turned off the lights fifty - four years ago ? ”
President Gorman and his Russian counterpart , Dmitri Alexandrov , were scheduled to talk to the press from the White house an hour later , so I was strictly a set - up guy .
Or that was the plan , anyway , until Warren Cole mentioned the dome .
It was a good time for NASA .
We all knew the dangers inherent in overconfidence , but two orbital missions had gone up without a hitch .
Either of them could have landed and waved back at us , and the rumor was that Sid Myshko had almost taken the game into his own hands , and that the crew had put it to a vote whether they ’d ignore the protocol and go down to the surface regardless of the mission parameters .
Sid and his five crewmates denied the story , of course .
I ’d just made the point to the pool of reporters that it was Richard Nixon who ’d turned off the lights — not the astronaut Eugene Cernan — when Warren Cole began waving his hand .
Cole was the AP journalist , seated in his customary spot up front .
He was frowning , his left hand in the air , staring down at something on his lap that I could n’t see .
“ Warren ? ” I said .
“ What ’ve you got ? ”
“ Jerry … . ”
He looked up , making no effort to suppress a grin .
“ Have you seen the story that the Bedrock ’s running ? ” He held up his iPad .
That started a few people checking their own devices .
“ No , I have n’t , ” I said , hoping he was making it up .
“ I do n’t usually get to Bedrock this early in the week . ”
Somebody snorted .
Then a wave of laughter rippled through the room .
“ What ? ” I said .
My first thought had been that we were about to have another astronaut scandal , like the one the month before with Barnaby Salvator and half the strippers on the Beach .
“ What are they saying ? ”
“ The Russians released more lunar orbital pictures from the sixties , ” He snickered .
“ They ’ve got one here from the far side of the Moon .
If you can believe this , there ’s a dome back there . ”
“ A dome ? ”
“ Yeah . ”
He flipped open his notebook .
“ Does NASA have a comment ? ”
“ You ’re kidding , right ? ” I said .
He twisted the iPad , raised it higher , and squinted at it .
“ Yep .
It ’s a dome all right . ”
The reporters in the pool all had a good chuckle , and then they looked up at me .
“ Well , ” I said , “ I guess Buck Rogers beat us there after all . ”
“ It looks legitimate , Jerry , ” Cole said , but he was still laughing .
I did n’t have to tell him what we all knew :
That it was a doctored picture and that it must have been a slow week for scandals .
#
If the image was doctored , the deed had to have been done by the Russians .
Moscow had released the satellite images only a few hours before and forwarded them to us without comment .
Apparently nobody on either side had noticed anything unusual .
Except the Bedrock staff .
I had n’t looked at the images prior to the meeting .
I mean , once you ’ve seen a few square miles of lunar surface you ’ve pretty much seen it all .
The dome — if that ’s really what it was — appeared on every image in the series .
They were dated April , 1967 .
The Bedrock carried the image on its front page , where they usually show the latest movie celebrity who ’s being accused of cheating , or has gone on a drunken binge .
It depicted a crater wall , with a large arrow graphic in the middle of a dark splotch pointing at a dome that you could n’t have missed anyhow .
The headline read :
ALIENS ON THE MOON
Russian Pictures Reveal Base on Far Side
Images Taken Before Apollo
I sighed and pushed back from my desk .
We just did n’t need this .
But it did look like an artificial construct .
The thing was on the edge of a crater , shaped like the head of a bullet .
It was either a reflection , an illusion of some sort , or it was a fraud .
But the Russians had no reason to set themselves up as a laughing stock .
And it sure as hell looked real .
I was still staring at it when the phone rang .
It was Mary , NASA ’s administrator .
My boss .
“ Jerry , ” she said , “ I heard what happened at the press conference this morning . ”
“ What ’s going on , Mary ? ”
“ Damned if I know .
Push some buttons .
See what you can find out .
It ’s going to come up again when the President ’s out there .
We need to have an answer for him . ”
#
Vasili Koslov was my public relations counterpart at Russia ’s space agency .
He was in Washington with the presidential delegation .
And he was in full panic mode when I got him on the phone .
“ I saw it , Jerry , ” he said .
“ I have no idea what this is about .
I just heard about it a few minutes ago .
I ’m looking at it now .
It does look like a dome , does n’t it ? ”
“ Yes , ” I said .
“ Did your people tamper with the satellite imagery ? ”
“ They must have .
I have a call in .
I ’ll let you know as soon as I hear something . ”
I called Jeanie Escovar in the Archives .
“ Jeanie , have you seen the National Bedrock story yet ? ”
“ No , ” she said .
“ My God , what is it this time ? ”
“ Not what you think .
I ’m sending it to you now .
Could you have somebody check to see where this place is — ? ”
“ What place ?
Oh , wait — I got it . ”
“ Find out where it is and see if you can get me some imagery of the same area .
From our satellites . ”
I heard her gasp .
Then she started laughing .
“ Jeanie , this is serious . ”
“ Why ?
You do n’t actually believe there ’s a building up there , do you ? ”
“ Somebody ’s going to ask the President about it .
They have a press conference going on in about twenty minutes .
We want him to be able to say : ‘ It ’s ridiculous , here ’s a picture of the area , and you ’ll notice there ’s nothing there . ’
We want him to be able to say ‘ The Bedrock ’s running an optical illusion . ’
But he ’ll have to do it diplomatically .
And without embarrassing Alexandrov . ”
“ Good luck on that . ”
#
The Bedrock story was already getting attention on the talk shows .
Angela Hart , who at that time anchored The Morning Report for the World Journal , was interviewing a physicist from MIT .
The physicist stated that the picture could not be accurate .
“ Probably a practical joke , ” he said .
“ Or a trick of the light . ”
But Angela wondered why the Russians would release the picture at all .
“ They had to know it would get a lot of attention , ” she said .
And , of course , though she did n’t mention it , it would become a source of discomfort for the Russian president and the two cosmonauts who were among the Minerva crew .
Vasili was in a state of shock when he called back .
“ They did n’t know about the dome , ” he said .
“ Nobody noticed .
But it is on the original satellite imagery .
Our people were just putting out a lot of the stuff from the Luna missions .
Imagery that had n’t been released before .
I ca n’t find anybody who knows anything about it .
But I ’m still trying . ”
“ Vasili , ” I said , “ somebody must have seen it at the time .
In 1967 . ”
“ I guess . ”
“ You guess ?
You think it ’s possible something like this came in and nobody picked up on it ? ”
“ No , I ’m not suggesting that at all , Jerry .
I just — I do n’t know what I ’m suggesting .
I ’ll get back to you when I have something more . ”
Minutes later , Jeanie called : “ It ’s the east wall of the Cassegrain Crater . ”
“ And — ? ”
“ I ’ve forwarded NASA imagery of the same area . ”
I switched on the monitor and ran the images .
There was the same crater wall , the same pock - marked moonscape .
But no dome .
Nothing at all unusual .
Dated July , 1968 .
More than a year after the Soviet imagery .
I called Mary and told her : The Russians just screwed up .
“ The President ca n’t say that . ”
“ All he has to say is that NASA has no evidence of any dome or anything else on the far side of the Moon .
Probably he should just turn it into a joke .
Make some remark about setting up a Martian liaison unit . ”
She did n’t think it was funny .
#
When the subject came up at the presidential press conference , Gorman and Alexandrov both simply had a good laugh .
Alexandrov blamed it on Khrushchev , and the laughter got louder .
Then they moved on to how the Minerva mission — the long - awaited Return to the Moon — marked the beginning of a new era for the world .
The story kicked around in the tabloids for two or three more days .
The Washington Post ran an op - ed using the dome to demonstrate how gullible we all are when the media says anything .
Then Cory Abbott , who ’d just won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Einstein in Albert and Me , crashed his car into a street light and blacked out the entire town of Dekker , California .
And just like that the dome story was gone .
#
On the morning of the launch , Roscosmos , the Russian space agency , issued a statement that the image was a result of defective technology .
The Minerva lifted off on schedule and , while the world watched , it crossed to the Moon and completed a few orbits .
Its lander touched down gently on the Mare Maskelyne .
Marcia Beckett surprised everyone when she demurred leading the way out through the airlock , sending instead Cosmonaut Yuri Petrov , who descended and then signaled his crewmates to join him .
When all were assembled on the regolith , Petrov made the statement that , in the light of later events , has become immortal : “ We are here on the Moon because , during the last century , we avoided the war that would have destroyed us all .
And we have come together .
Now we stand as never before , united for all mankind . ”
I was n’t especially impressed at the time .
It sounded like the usual generalized nonsense .
Which shows you what my judgment is worth .
I watched on my office monitor .
And as the ceremony proceeded , I looked past the space travelers , across the barren wasteland of the Mare Maskelyne , wondering which was the shortest path to the Cassegrain crater .
#
I knew I should have just let it go , but I could n’t .
I could imagine no explanation for the Russians doctoring their satellite imagery .
Vasili told me that everyone with whom he ’d spoken was shocked .
That the images had been dug out of the archives and distributed without inspection .
And , as far as could be determined , without anyone distorting them .
“ I just do n’t understand it , Jerry , ” he said .
Mary told me not to worry about it .
“ We have more important things to do , ” she said .
There was no one left at NASA from the 1960s .
In fact , I knew of only one person living at Cape Kennedy who had been part of the Agency when Apollo 11 went to the Moon : Amos Kelly , who ’d been one of my grandfather ’s buddies .
He was still in the area , where he served with the Friends of NASA , a group of volunteers who lent occasional support but mostly threw parties .
I looked him up .
He ’d come to the Agency in 1965 as a technician .
Eventually , he ’d become one of the operational managers .
He was in his mid-eighties , but he sounded good .
“ Sure , Jerry , I remember you .
It ’s been a long time , ” he said , when I got him on the phone .
I ’d been a little kid when he used to stop by to pick up my grandfather for an evening of poker .
“ What can I do for you ? ”
“ This is going to sound silly , Amos . ”
“ Nothing sounds silly to me .
I used to work for the government . ”
“ Did you see the story in the tabloids about the dome ? ”
“ How could I miss it ? ”
“ You ever hear anything like that before ? ”
“ You mean did we think there were Martians on the Moon ? ”
He laughed , turned away to tell someone that the call was for him , and then laughed again .
“ Is that a serious question , Jerry ? ”
“ I guess not . ”
“ Good .
By the way , you ’ve done pretty well for yourself at the Agency .
Your granddad would have been proud . ”
“ Thanks . ”
He told me how much he missed the old days , missed my grandfather , how they ’d had a good crew .
“ Best years of my life .
I could never believe they ’d just scuttle the program the way they did . ”
Finally he asked what the Russians had said about the images .
I told him what Vasili told me .
“ Well , ” he said , “ maybe they have n’t changed that much after all . ”
Twenty minutes later he called back .
“ I was reading the story in the Bedrock .
It says that the object was in the Cassegrain Crater . ”
“ Yes .
That ’s correct . ”
“ There was talk of a Cassegrain Project at one time .
Back in the sixties .
I do n’t know what it was supposed to be .
Whether it was anything more than a rumor .
Nobody seemed to know anything definitive about it .
I recall at the time thinking it was one of those things so highly classified that even its existence was off the table . ”
“ The Cassegrain Project . ”
“ Yes . ”
“ But you have no idea what it was about ? ”
“ None .
I ’m sorry .
Wish I could help . ”
“ Would you tell me if you knew ? ”
“ It ’s a long time ago , Jerry .
I ca n’t believe security would still be an issue . ”
“ Amos , you were pretty high in the Agency — ”
“ Not that high . ”
“ Do you remember anything else ? ”
“ Nothing .
Nada .
As far as I know , nothing ever came of any of it , so the whole thing eventually went away . ”
#
Searching NASA ’s archives on “ Cassegrain ” yielded only data about the crater .
So I took to wandering around the facility , talking offhandedly with senior employees .
It must feel good to see us back on the Moon , huh , Ralph ?
Makes all the frustration worthwhile .
By the way , did you ever hear of a Cassegrain Project ?
They all laughed .
Crazy Russians .
On the day the Minerva slipped out of lunar orbit and started home , Mary called me into her office .
“ We ’ll want to get the crew onstage for the press when they get back , Jerry .
You might give the staging some thought . ”
“ Okay .
Will it be at Edwards ? ”
“ Negative .
We ’re going to do it here at the Cape . ”
We talked over some of the details , the scheduling , guest speakers , points we ’d want to make with the media .
Then as I was getting ready to leave , she stopped me .
“ One more thing .
The Cassegrain business — ” I straightened and came to attention .
Mary Gridley was a no - nonsense hard - charger .
She was in her fifties , and years of dealing with bureaucratic nonsense had left her with little patience .
She was physically diminutive , but she could probably have intimidated the Pope .
“ — I want you to leave it alone . ”
She picked up a pen , put it back down , and stared at me .
“ Jerry , I know you ’ve been asking around about that idiot dome .
Listen , you ’re good at what you do .
You ’ll probably enjoy a long , happy career with us .
But that wo n’t happen if people stop taking you seriously .
You understand what I mean ? ”
#
After the shuttle landing and subsequent celebration , I went on the road .
“ We need to take advantage of the moment , ” Mary said .
“ There ’ll never be a better time to get some good press . ”
So I did a PR tour , giving interviews , addressing prayer breakfasts and Rotary meetings , doing what I could to raise the consciousness of the public .
NASA wanted Moonbase .
It was the next logical step .
Should have had it decades ago and would have if the politicians had n’t squandered the nation ’s resources on pointless wars and interventions .
But it would be expensive , and we had n’t succeeded yet in getting the voters on board .
That somehow had become my responsibility .
In Seattle , I appeared at a Chamber of Commerce dinner with Arnold Banner , an astronaut who ’d never gotten higher than the space station .
But nevertheless he was an astronaut , and he hailed from the Apollo era .
During the course of the meal I asked whether he ’d ever heard of a Cassegrain Project .
He said something about tabloids and gave me a disapproving look .
We brought in astronauts wherever we could .
In Los Angeles , at a Marine charities fundraiser , we had both Marcia Beckett and Yuri Petrov , which would have been the highlight of the tour , except for Frank Allen .
Frank was in his nineties .
He looked exhausted .
His veins bulged and I was n’t sure he did n’t need oxygen .
He was the fourth of the Apollo - era astronauts I talked with during those two weeks .
And when I asked about the Cassegrain Project , his eyes went wide and his mouth tightened .
Then he regained control .
“ Cassandra , ” he said , looking past me into a distant place .
“ It ’s classified . ”
“ Not Cassandra , Frank .
Cassegrain . ”
“ Oh. Yeah .
Of course . ”
“ I have a clearance . ”
“ How high ? ”
“ Secret . ”
“ Not enough . ”
“ Just give me a hint .
What do you know ? ”
“ Jerry , I ’ve already said too much .
Even its existence is classified . ”
#
Cassandra .
When I got back to the Cape I did a search on Cassandra and found that a lot of people with that name had worked for the Agency over the years .
Other Cassandras had made contributions in various ways , leading programs to get kids interested in space science , collaborating with NASA physicists in analyzing the data collected by space - born telescopes , editing publications to make NASA more accessible to the lay public .
They ’d been everywhere .
You could n’t bring in a NASA guest speaker without discovering a Cassandra somewhere among the people who ’d made the request .
Buried among the names so deeply that I almost missed it was a single entry : The Cassandra Project , storage 27176B Redstone .
So secret its existence was classified ?
The reference was to the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville , Alabama where NASA stores rocket engines , partially - completed satellites , control panels from test stands , and a multitude of other artifacts dating back to Apollo .
I called them .
A baritone voice informed me I had reached the NASA Storage Facility .
“ Sgt. Saber speaking . ”
I could n’t resist smiling at the name , but I knew he ’d heard all the jokes .
I identified myself .
Then : “ Sergeant , you have a listing for the Cassandra Project . ” I gave him the number .
“ Can I get access to the contents ? ”
“ One minute , please , Mr. Carter . ”
While I waited , I glanced around the office at the photos of Neil Armstrong and Lawrence Bergman and Marcia Beckett .
In one , I was standing beside Bergmann , who ’d been the guy who ’d sold the President on returning to the Moon .
In another , I was standing by while Marcia spoke with some Alabama school kids during a tour of the Marshall Space Flight Center .
Marcia was a charmer of the first order .
I ’ve always suspected she got the Minerva assignment partially because they knew the public would love her .
“ When were you planning to come , Mr. Carter ? ”
“ I ’m not sure yet .
Within the next week or so . ”
“ Let us know in advance and there ’ll be no problem . ”
“ It ’s not classified , then ? ”
“ No , sir .
I ’m looking at its history now .
It was originally classified , but that was removed by the Restricted Access Depository
Act more than twenty years ago . ”
#
I had to get through another round of ceremonies and press conferences before I could get away .
Finally , things quieted down .
The astronauts went back to their routines , the VIPs went back to whatever it was they normally do , and life on the Cape returned to normal .
I put in for leave .
“ You deserve it , ” Mary said .
Next day , armed with a copy of the Restricted Access Depository Act , I was on my way to Los Angeles to pay another visit to a certain elderly retired astronaut .
#
“ I ca n’t believe it , ” Frank Allen said .
He lived with his granddaughter and her family of about eight , in Pasadena .
She shepherded us into her office — she was a tax expert of some sort — brought some lemonade , and left us alone .
“ What ca n’t you believe ?
That they declassified it ? ”
“ That the story never got out in the first place . ”
Frank was back at the desk .
I ’d sunk into a leather settee .
“ What ’s the story , Frank ?
Was the dome really there ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ NASA doctored its own Cassegrain imagery ?
To eliminate all traces ? ”
“ I do n’t know anything about that . ”
“ So what do you know ? ”
“ They sent us up to take a look .
In late 1968 . ” He paused .
“ We landed almost on top of the damned thing . ”
“ Before Apollo 11 . ”
“ Yes . ”
I sat there in shock .
And I ’ve been around a while , so I do n’t shock easily .
“ They advertised the flight as a test run , Jerry .
It was supposed to be purely an orbital mission .
Everything else , the dome , the descent , everything was top secret .
Did n’t happen . ”
“ You actually got to the dome ? ”
He hesitated .
A lifetime of keeping his mouth shut was getting in the way .
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ We came down about a half mile away .
Max was brilliant . ”
Max Donnelly .
The lunar module pilot .
“ What happened ? ”
“ I remember thinking the Russians had beaten us .
They ’d gotten to the Moon and we had n’t even known about it .
“ There were n’t any antennas or anything .
Just a big , silvery dome .
About the size of a two - story house .
No windows .
No hammer and sickle markings .
Nothing .
Except a door .
“ We had sunlight .
The mission had been planned so we would n’t have to approach it in the dark . ”
He shifted his position in the chair and bit down on a grunt .
“ You okay , Frank ? ” I asked .
“ My knees .
They do n’t work as well as they used to . ”
He rubbed the right one , then rearranged himself — gently this time .
“ We did n’t know what to expect .
Max said he thought the thing was pretty old because there were no tracks in the ground .
We walked up to the front door .
It had a knob .
I thought the place would be locked , but I tried it and the thing did n’t move at first but then something gave way and I was able to pull the door open . ”
“ What was inside ? ”
“ A table .
There was a cloth on the table .
And something flat under the cloth .
And that ’s all there was . ”
“ Nothing else ? ”
“ Not a thing . ”
He shook his head .
“ Max lifted the cloth .
Under it was a rectangular plate .
Made from some kind of metal . ”
He stopped and stared at me .
“ There was writing on it . ”
“ Writing ?
What did it say ? ”
“ I do n’t know .
Never found out .
It looked like Greek .
We brought the plate back home with us and turned it over to the bosses .
Next thing they called us in and debriefed us .
Reminded us it was all top secret .
Whatever the thing said , it must have scared the bejesus out of Nixon and his people .
Because they never said anything , and I guess the Russians did n’t either . ”
“ You never heard anything more at all ? ”
“ Well , other than the next Apollo mission , which went back and destroyed the dome .
Leveled it . ”
“ How do you know ? ”
“ I knew the crew .
We talked to each other , right ?
They would n’t say it directly .
Just shook their heads : Nothing to worry about anymore . ”
Outside , kids were shouting , tossing a football around .
“ Greek ? ”
“ That ’s what it looked like . ”
“ A message from Plato . ”
He just shook his head as if to say :
Who knew ?
“ Well , Frank , I guess that explains why they called it the Cassandra Project . ”
“ She was n’t a Greek , was she ? ”
“ You have another theory ? ”
“ Maybe Cassegrain was too hard for the people in the Oval Office to pronounce . ”
#
I told Mary what I knew .
She was n’t happy .
“ I really wish you ’d left it alone , Jerry . ”
“ There ’s no way I could have done that . ”
“ Not now , anyhow . ”
She let me see her frustration .
“ You know what it ’ll mean for the Agency , right ?
If NASA lied about something like this , and it becomes public knowledge , nobody will ever trust us again . ”
“ It was a long time ago , Mary .
Anyhow , the Agency was n’t lying .
It was the Administration . ”
“ Yeah , ” she said .
“ Good luck selling that one to the public . ”

The NASA storage complex at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville is home to rockets , a lunar landing vehicle , automated telescopes , satellites , a space station , and a multitude of other devices that had kept the American space program alive , if not particularly robust , over almost seventy years .
Some were housed inside sprawling warehouses ; others occupied outdoor exhibition sites .
I parked in the shadow of a Saturn V , the rocket that had carried the Apollo missions into space .
I ’ve always been impressed with the sheer audacity of anybody who’d be willing to sit on top of one of those things while someone lit the fuse .
Had it been up to me , we ’d probably never have lifted off at Kitty Hawk .
I went inside the Archive Office , got directions and a pass , and fifteen minutes later entered one of the warehouses .
An attendant escorted me past cages and storage rooms filled with all kinds of boxes and crates .
Somewhere in the center of it all , we stopped at a cubicle while the attendant compared my pass with the number on the door .
The interior was visible through a wall of wire mesh .
Cartons were piled up , all labeled .
Several were open , with electronic equipment visible inside them .
The attendant unlocked the door and we went in .
He turned on an overhead light and did a quick survey , settling on a box that was one of several on a shelf .
My heart rate started to pick up while he looked at the tag .
“ This is it , Mr. Carter , ” he said .
“ Cassandra . ”
“ Is this everything ? ”
He checked his clipboard .
“ This is the only listing we have for the Cassandra Project , sir . ”
“ Okay .
Thanks . ”
“ My pleasure . ”
There was no lock .
He raised the hasp on the box , lifted the lid , and stood back to make room .
He showed no interest in the contents .
He probably did this all the time , so I do n’t know why that surprised me .
Inside , I could see a rectangular object wrapped in plastic .
I could n’t see what it was , but of course I knew .
My heart was pounding by then .
The object was about a foot and a half wide and maybe half as high .
And it was heavy .
I carried it over to a table and set it down .
Would n’t do to drop it .
Then I unwrapped it .
The metal was black , polished , reflective , even in the half - light from the overhead bulb .
And sure enough , there were the Greek characters .
Eight lines of them .
The idea that Plato was saying hello seemed suddenly less far - fetched .
I took a picture .
Several pictures .
Finally , reluctantly , I rewrapped it and put it back in the box .
#
“ So , ” said Frank , “ what did it say ? ”
“ I have the translation here . ” I fished it out of my pocket but he shook his head .
“ My eyes are n’t that good , Jerry .
Just tell me who wrote it .
And what it says . ”
We were back in the office at Frank ’s home in Pasadena .
It was a chilly , rainswept evening .
Across the street , I could see one of his neighbors putting out the trash .
“ It was n’t written by the Greeks . ”
“ I did n’t think it was . ”
“ Somebody came through a long time ago .
Two thousand years or so .
They left the message .
Apparently they wrote it in Greek because it must have looked like their best chance to leave something we ’d be able to read .
Assuming we ever reached the Moon . ”
“ So what did it say ? ”
“ It ’s a warning . ”
The creases in Frank ’s forehead deepened .
“ Is the sun going unstable ? ”
“ No . ” I looked down at the translation .
“ It says that no civilization , anywhere , has been known to survive the advance of technology . ”
Frank stared at me .
“ Say that again . ”
“ They all collapse .
They fight wars .
Or they abolish individual death , which apparently guarantees stagnation and an exit .
I do n’t know .
They do n’t specify .
“ Sometimes the civilizations become too vulnerable to criminals .
Or the inhabitants become too dependent on the technology and lose whatever virtue they might have had .
Anyway , the message says that no technological civilization , anywhere , has been known to get old .
Nothing lasts more than a few centuries — our centuries — once technological advancement begins .
Which for us maybe starts with the invention of the printing press .
“ The oldest known civilization lasted less than a thousand years . ”
Frank frowned .
He was n’t buying it .
“ They survived .
Hell , they had an interstellar ship of some kind . ”
“ They said they were looking for a place to start again .
Where they came from is a shambles . ”
“ You ’re kidding . ”
“ It says that maybe , if we know in advance , we can sidestep the problem .
That ’s why they left the warning . ”
“ Great . ”
“ If they survive , they say they ’ll come back to see how we ’re doing . ”
We were both silent for a long while .
“ So what happens now ? ” Frank said .
“ We ’ve reclassified everything .
It ’s top secret again .
I should n’t be telling you this .
But I thought — ”
He rearranged himself in the chair .
Winced and rotated his right arm .
“ Maybe that ’s why they called it Cassandra , ” he said .
“ Was n’t she the woman who always brought bad news ? ”
“ I think so . ”
“ There was something else about her — ”
“ Yeah — the bad news , ” I said .
“ When she gave it , nobody would listen . ”

Caleb Cushing has suggested multiple times that developers of free software should consider support an obligation and make support a priority .
I can agree with that as a categorical imperative , but I can't agree that releasing free software induces a requirement to do so .
For example , any distribution you upload to the CPAN should contain a comprehensive test suite which suffers no false negatives and offers no false positives .
Yet not all CPAN distributions do so .
CPAN itself requires no test suite , and plenty of useful CPAN distributions lack comprehensive test suites , and few CPAN distributions have neve suffered from false negatives .
Certainly the utility of CPAN would increase if our test suites trended toward perfection , but requiring perfection would likely suppress the utility of the CPAN in the long term .
Ever since I gave up the dull periods between crises of system administration for what has become my career ( and a mortgage and family obligations and hobbies which do not require me to sit in front of my computer all night long ) , I have had to prioritize how I spend my time .
Sometimes I add new features .
Sometimes I apply patches .
Sometimes I revise documentation .
Yet the fact that I wrote a long - dead templating system in 1998 or my own test framework in 2000 or even Test : : Builder in 2002 in no way obligates me to neglect mowing my lawn in favor of adding a feature anyone requests in 2010 .

Community - driven software means we do n't have to suffer the whims of profitability or market changes or personnel changes or trade secrets or market segmentation or duplication or competition .
It means that we , collectively , have the power to make our lives easier with software .
Sometimes that means changing how we develop software .
Sometimes that means changing how we support software .
In this case , I believe in means changing our will : no longer should we act as if software is a resource produced by someone else and we are mere consumers .
We should act as if we are equals in producing software — because we are .

Hi !
My name is Miles .
My mom likes to run , so I am her new running partner !

Last Easter , NBC gave air time to freemason and Christ - basher Michael Baigent , whose work helped inspire The Da Vinci Code .
This year , elite media fires another Lenten missile at Christians at the start of the 40 - day period before the resurrection of our Lord .
On Sunday , the Discovery Channel aired " The Lost Tomb of Jesus , " followed by a roundtable discussion led by no less than Ted Koppel .
The " documentary " was also shown on Channel 8 in Israel .
Created by a religious Jew , Simcha Jacobivici , it argues for the Talmud 's vengeful myth that Christ was not bodily resurrected and that he had a sex partner and a child .
The film 's attack on the Christian faith has been denounced by serious scholars and archeologists including professor Amos Kloner , who oversaw the tomb 's original 1980 dig and says the supposed " new evidence " that the tomb was Christ 's is " not serious " ( see Brent Bozell , " What Bones of Jesus ? " Feb 28 ) .
The work was called a " publicity stunt " by one of America 's foremost archeologists , William Dever ( WA Post , Feb 28 ) .
Despite this , the film got a glowing review from NBC's Today Show , which also oohed and ahhed over The Da Vinci Code last year ( another anti-Christ film and book heavily promoted by Jews ( See , " < http://truthtellers.org/alerts/behinddavinci.html>The Jews Behind Da Vinci Code " ) .
Jewish New York Times writer Laurie Goodstein wrote , " In recent years , audiences have demonstrated a voracious appetite for books , movies and magazines that reassess the life and times of Jesus , and there is already a book timed to coincide with this documentary ... " ( Feb 27 ) Is it really audiences who demonstrate this voracious appetite - or Jewish media elite ?
Martin Scorcese , who directed the blasphemous Last Temptation of Christ ( produced by Jewish - owned MCA ) , just won an Academy Award .
NBC promoted the Christophobic " Book of Daniel " but had to cancel ; I guess their audience did n't share their appetite !
( See , " < http://truthtellers.org/alerts/bookofdaniel.html>Who's Behind NBC's ' Book of Daniel ' ? " )
Compare the reception of Jacobivici's attack on Christianity with the recent book of another Jew , Ariel Toaff , about the blood libel in the Middle Ages .
Toaff 's book , which suggested medieval Jews might not always have been guileless victims , was so hotly attacked it was recalled within a week .
Jewish elite refused to even consider the historical evidence in Toaff 's work .
But a production that damages Jesus ' reputation ?
In that case , facts are petty details !
The NY Times TV review of Lost Tomb hailed its laughable evidence as so earthshaking it " could someday lead the Discovery Channel to wish it had left the Talpiot tomb unfound . "
Lost Tomb 's director , Jacobivici , is an Orthodox Jew born in Israel .
He previously created the highly questionable " Exodus Decoded " in 2006 and the Discovery Channel 's 2002 documentary " Ossuary of James , " which was declared a forgery the next year .
You'd think an individual with such disregard for truth and such a hardened agenda to attack Christianity would not be mainstream in a " religion of tolerance , " as Judaism is declared to be .
But Forward says he " made a name for himself as a Jewish leader in Canada " as a student activist and later as president of the International Congress of the World Union of Jewish Students ( Rebecca Spence , March 2 ) .
Canada Censors Christians but Airs Christ - Bashers
It 's notable that Jacobivici , though born in Israel , calls Canada home .
Sec. 319 of Canada 's federal hate law , the Human Rights Act , makes it a crime to " publicly incite hatred " or " willfully promote hatred " of any identifiable group .
Sec. 13.1 bans communication ( including online ) of messages that " are likely to expose a person to hatred or contempt on the basis of race , national or ethnic origin , color , religion , age , sex , sexual orientation , etc . "
Under hate laws , Canadian Christians have been heavily fined for publicly quoting Scripture against homosexuality and refusing to cooperate with the militant gay agenda .
In May 2002 , the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council ( CBSC ) found Dr. Laura Schlessinger guilty of " abusive discrimination " for her censuring words against homosexuality and demanded that she be taken off the air in Canada .
Stations which continued to air Dr. Laura would be brought before the CBSC and potentially lose their broadcast licenses .
Dr. James Dobson has been repeatedly censured and warned by CBSC .
In a ruling several years ago , CBSC said Dobson was sufficiently rehabilitated to be allowed to continue broadcasting in Canada .
But Focus on the Family Canada must carefully screen each Dobson program to see if it contains criticism of homosexuality .
If so , it is replaced with a prior " hate - free " program .
Is Jacobivici's shameless attack on Christian orthodoxy also censored in Canada for inspiring contempt for an identifiable group : Christians ?
Vision TV aired Lost Tomb in Canada on March 6 .
The Canadian Jewish Congress and federal " thought police " were not offended .
Only some people and viewpoints enjoy the attack - dog protection of the Anti-Defamation League , their " anti-hate " laws , or Jewish - dominated Western media .
Traditionalists who present a conservative , Biblical stance on homosexuality - or who express criticism of things Jewish - are shunned , censored , and ultimately made criminals in Canada , Australia , and much of Europe .
Any pastor in these countries who forcefully reads from Scripture and teaches that the Jewish leaders had Christ crucified is in danger of indictment for inciting " hatred and contempt " against Jews .
The same is true for anyone who publicly reveals the hidden anti-Christian , anti-Gentile teachings of modern Judaism 's most sacred literature , the Talmud and Kabbalah .
Canada 's massive Jewish - owned conglomerate of radio , TV , newspapers and publishing , CanWest Global , boldly forbids any criticism of the state of Israel or matters Jewish .
Meanwhile , through western media , Christianity is exposed to a glut of scathing books and debunking films , and Christians are supposed to just take it .
Lost Tomb is hardly news .
It 's just the latest minor skirmish in a millennia - old battle between the Judaic spirit and Jesus Christ - a battle whose beginning was recorded in the book of Acts when Jewish leaders did their very best to stamp out Christianity at its dawn .
When
He returned to heaven , Christ left behind His Spirit , Who binds people of all races who submit themselves to God and worship Christ as Savior with willing trust .
Rather than establishing a physical military kingdom on earth , Jesus shattered political walls and ancient barriers by uniting Jews and Gentiles into a global spiritual church .
The Jewish leaders responsible for the crucifixion hated Christ 's challenge to their authority , an authority built on dead religious rituals , black magic , and Jewish supremacism .
Today , the Pharisees ' legacy remains .
Judaism throughout the last 2,000 years has struggled against St. Paul 's revelation - the spiritual unity of Jews and Gentiles in Christ .
Today , the state of Israel is the prime symbol and concentration of the Judaic spirit in the world .
It is filled with ruthless racism , empty religious rituals ( the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem are even now seeking to reinstate animal sacrifices ) , and love of Kabbalah and black magic .
This is the legacy of Judaism 's 1600 - year sojourn in Babylon , the occult center of antiquity .
In the United States , Jewish media elite routinely produce and publicize books and films glorifying the Talmudic mythologies of Jesus ' non-resurrection or sexual relationship with Mary Magdalene .
Jewish activists also advance the evil work of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith , which works aggressively to bind the USA with the same " anti-hate " laws that censor Christianity in Canada , while allowing the malignant screeds of men like Jacobivici .
Unless the American church recognizes what is going on , we will soon attack Iran and further deliver the Middle East into Israel 's hands , enabling the global ascendancy of those who deeply hate Jesus ( See , " < http://truthtellers.org/alerts/nowinwar.html>America in No - Win War for Israel " ) .
Christians who ignore the Judaic source of works like the Lost Tomb and " anti-hate " laws are willing sacrifices , loosening their own collar before the butcher 's knife .
We may not feel the consequences ourselves , especially if we do n't speak up .
But our children will suffer .
Many Arab Christians are already in pain , thanks to our unbiblical policy of unconditional support of Israel .
And we will suffer someday , when we stand before Christ - whose Spirit we are not defending against His present - day attackers .

Australia : Big business and mining companies issue diktats to new prime minister
By Patrick O’Connor
25 June 2010
Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard — installed yesterday through a series of unprecedented manoeuvres by a cabal of right - wing factional apparatchiks and trade union bureaucrats — has been issued with a clear set of instructions by the corporate and media interests that orchestrated her predecessor Kevin Rudd ’s ousting .
She is preparing to carry them out by substantially revising , if not shelving , the Labor government ’s proposed 40 percent Resource Super Profits Tax ( RSPT ) on the mining industry , returning the budget to surplus by slashing public spending , and quickly moving to implement a series of far reaching “ free market ” economic reforms .
Press coverage of the Gillard coup abounds with mafia - like metaphors describing Rudd ’s downfall .
They are entirely apt .
The conspiracy in Canberra over the last 24 - hours amounted to a political contract killing .
Labor ’s factional chiefs — acting without the knowledge , let alone input , of the majority of caucus members , who are nominally responsible for electing the party leader — switched prime ministers at the direct behest of specific business and media interests .
Chief among these was the mining industry .
A Sydney Morning Herald article today , headlined “ Tycoons claim credit for a burial ” , noted : “ Mining tycoons have claimed much of the credit for Kevin Rudd ’s downfall , saying the industry - led opposition to the resources tax was the main reason for the leadership coup . ”
The mining companies ’ two - month long campaign against the tax — which included expensive television , radio , newspaper , and billboard advertising — exploited fears among ordinary people over the prospect of severe economic downturn and higher unemployment .
Moreover , Rudd ’s decision to use the RSPT revenue to lower the corporate tax rate and bolster other sections of business , rather than spend a cent on social services , meant that his attempt at populist posturing fell flat .
The mining giants ’ successful campaign against Rudd comes after they helped instigate the removal of Malcolm Turnbull as opposition leader in December , because of his support for an Emissions Trading Scheme , underscoring the resource sector ’s considerable weight within the Australian ruling elite .
Mining shares gained value on the news of Rudd ’s exit , with early trade in London registering gains for Rio Tinto , BHP Billiton , and Xstrata .
Those mining companies registered in Australia similarly closed higher yesterday evening with iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group among the biggest winners , gaining 2.5 percent .
Gillard is yet to announce any details on the status of the mining tax , but has declared that the government ’s “ doors are open ” to negotiations with resource sector CEOs .
She has also cancelled the government ’s publicly - funded advertising campaign promoting the tax .
The Minerals Council of Australia , BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have likewise scrapped their ads as part of the “ truce ” .
Placating the mining companies may be Gillard ’s immediate priority , but she faces the more complex task of orchestrating a u-turn in government fiscal policy , from stimulus to austerity .
Rudd ’s $ 42 billion stimulus package helped the Australian economy avoid official recession after the 2008 financial crash , and garnered him plaudits from ruling circles and unanimous media support , which found reflection in carefully manipulated opinion polls .
This situation continued until late 2009 , when Rudd ’s position began to unravel .
From early 2010 demands began to be raised , most forcefully by the Murdoch press , for the early winding up the government ’s stimulus programs and for an alternative focus on cutting welfare and social infrastructure spending .
The campaign intensified as Rudd delayed implementing promised austerity measures , even as the global sovereign debt crisis worsened , with Greece and other European economies threatened with national bankruptcy .
Predictably , today ’s Australian ’s editorial backed Rudd ’s ousting and urged the government to veer even further to the right .
The newspaper welcomed the fact that Gillard “ signalled a return to the reforming tradition of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating , continued by John Howard and Peter Costello ” , and criticised the former prime minister ’s farewell speech , which catalogued his supposed achievements in office , including a few minor health initiatives .
“ The projects [ Rudd ] pointed to were not the achievements of the reforming prime minister he promised he would be when he won office in 2007 , ” the editorial declared .
“ He accomplished little that came anywhere near Hawke , Keating and Howard ’s capacity for complex policy planning or their ability to convince the country to accept hard decisions . ”
The Australian added that in response to the global financial crisis , Rudd merely “ threw money at the problem ” and demonstrated a “ Whitlamesque assumption that spending money can replace policy planning ” .
The Australian Financial Review put aside the fears it expressed yesterday , that a knifing of Rudd could damage the country ’s reputation for stability , and instead urged Gillard to adopt a “ a bold vision ” .
The organ of finance capital expressed considerable concern , however , in the Labor government ’s “ thin economic expertise ” , exacerbated by Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner ’s decision yesterday to resign from the parliament at the next election .
The Financial Review described Gillard ’s pledge to balance the budget in three years as “ encouraging ” , but questioned how it would be done given that concessions on the mining tax would likely blow a multi-billion dollar hole in fiscal projections .
Business Spectator columnist Alan Kohler demanded that “ Gillard must mop up Swan ’s mess ” , referring to treasurer ( and now deputy prime minister ) Wayne Swan ’s “ total stinker ” of a budget delivered last May .
Kohler insisted that the resource tax would have to be put aside until after the election , due to be held later this year , noting that this would leave a $ 12 billion revenue shortfall that would have to be covered in other areas .
There is little chance that the Gillard government will simply rescind the various pro-business measures that the mining tax was due to fund — including a 2 percent lower company tax rate , higher superannuation contributions to boost the finance sector , and more infrastructure investment benefitting exporters — leaving spending cuts the only alternative .
“ Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey announced $ 24.7 billion in savings last month to give themselves some room to move , ” Kohler concluded .
“ Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan must now do something similar — in other words , a mini budget is required to clean up her deputy ’s mess before the new PM can announce an election . ”
Kohler articulated the growing consensus in ruling circles that the Labor government not be permitted to use higher taxes and favourable terms of trade to evade an austerity program that slashes long - term social spending in areas including welfare , health , and education , and drives down the living conditions of the working class .
Gillard , however , confronts the same dilemma as her predecessors — how to implement an economic and social program that is diametrically opposed to the most fundamental interests of the majority of the population .
That is why the media has placed such heavy emphasis on the fact that she is the country ’s first female prime minister , presenting her gender as inherent evidence of her “ progressive ” bone fides .
The Fairfax press has been especially effusive .
Under a huge front - page photo of Gillard with Australian Governor - General Quentin Bryce , the Sydney Morning Herald gushed in large type : “ What a day .
Who would have thought they would live to see a female prime minister sworn into office by a female governor - general ? ”
Inside , the newspaper made clear the real reason for its enthusiasm : “ Gillard the former campus radical has made the transition to the safe mainstream consensus without a ripple , ” it noted .
“ In her address after the leadership change yesterday , the only foreign subject touched upon was Afghanistan , in the form of a tribute to the soldiers serving there .
She has been a participant in the second - track diplomacy effort known as the Australian - American Leadership Dialogue , and in the newer Australia - Israel forum set up last year .
In these two sensitive areas , where politicians are carefully watched for deviation by powerful lobbies , she has flagged her adherence to the norm . ”
Nevertheless , concerns are being raised about Gillard ’s legitimacy as prime minister , within broad layers of the population , given the manner of her elevation to the job .
The Australian Financial Review ’s political editor Laura Tingle wrote an uncharacteristically vitriolic comment , denouncing Labor ’s “ new generation of ‘ powerbrokers ’ behind this coup who seem to have no respect for the traditions of one of the oldest democratic political parties in the world , nor any apparent commitment to its values ” .
She concluded that while Rudd ’s removal could well boost Labor ’s poll ratings , “ the way in which it was achieved leaves open the question of whether it is a party that actually deserves to win [ the next election ] ” .
Gillard has pledged not to move into the official prime minister ’s residence in Canberra unless and until she is voted in as PM at the next election .
This decision reflects a definite nervousness within the government that Rudd ’s political guillotining has openly revealed , before broad layers of the working class , the real physiognomy of the Labor Party — a sordid parliamentary clique that has become nothing but a vehicle for implementing the diktats of corporate Australia , divorced from any connection to the interests and sentiments of ordinary people .
If they had hired Blackwater , the firm would have had a particularly appropriate sounding name for the job : guarding tar - stained beaches .
In their latest eyebrow - raising PR move , multinational oil giant BP has enlisted private security contractors to keep onlookers away from oil cleanup sites .
While the firm they hired apparently is n’t Blackwater ( the private security firm Blackwater changed their name to Xe Services after a spate of killings in Baghdad , and has now put itself up for sale ) , they certainly seem to have ‘ black water ’ in their sights .

Wired ‘s “ Danger Room ” blog dubbed BP ’s decision to hire private mercenaries in the Gulf “ one of the bestest public relations moves ever . ”
The blog notes that BP ’s move recalls bungled decisionmaking in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , when the US Department of Homeland Security — and some very wealthy homeowners — turned to private security contractors to protect their property in the wake of the disaster .
“ This would nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t be the first time a private security firm made an appearance in a Gulf disaster , ” Wired ’s Adam Rawnsley writes .
“ When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans , the Department of Homeland Security and a number of private firms , fearful of reported widespread violence and chaos , turned to private security contractors like Blackwater and ArmorGroup International to protect their property . ”
According to reports , the firm hired is named Talon Security .

In a video clip obtained by ThinkProgress over the weekend , a local news team from WDSU in New Orleans was told by a private security guard that they were not allowed to talk to cleanup workers on a public beach or come within 100 yards of cleanup operations .
“ WhoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s saying that ? ” reporter Scott Walker asked the guard .
“ Because no one can tell me that , unless youÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re the Jefferson Parish SheriffÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Office , youÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re the Coast Guard , or you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re the military , can you tell me where to go on this public beach . ”
“ I can tell you where to go because IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m employed to keep this beach safe , ” the guard replied , adding , “ You are not allowed to interview any workers . ”
An angry professor who listened to Monckton 's speech at a US university demolishes the wild claims made by the climate denier
It takes a lot to make a scientist mad – even today , when it seems that science and scientists are under siege , particularly over the topic of climate change .
But everyone has a breaking point , one straw too many that inspires them to act .
For me , that time came last October when I learned about a British import we have had the displeasure of experiencing here in the United States .
That import , Christopher Monckton , Viscount Monckton of Brenchley , had given a rousing speech to a crowd at Bethel University in Minnesota , near where I live .
His speech was on global warming and his style was convincing and irreverent .
Anyone listening to him was given the impression that global warming was not happening , or that if it did happen it would n't be so bad , and scientists who warned about it were part of a vast conspiracy .
I know a thing or two about global warming .
I have worked in the field of heat transfer and fluid mechanics and I have published more than 80 papers on these topics .
I am a university professor and also an active consultant in the energy and environment industry .
What I heard in his talk surprised me .
Monckton cited scientist after scientist whose work " disproved " global warming .
He contended that polar bears are not really at risk ( in fact they do better as weather warms ) ; projections of sea level rise are a mere 6 cm ; Arctic ice has not declined in a decade ; Greenland is not melting ; sea levels are not rising ; ocean temperatures are not increasing ; medieval times were warmer than today ; ocean acidification is not occurring ; and global temperatures are not increasing .
If true , these conclusions would be welcome .
But there is a problem with this kind of truth – it is not made by wishing .
So I began a journey of investigation ( the full results of which you can view here ) .
I actually tracked down the articles and authors that Monckton cited .
What I discovered was incredible , even to a scientist who follows the politics of climate change .
I found that he had misrepresented the science .
For instance , Monckton 's claims that " Arctic sea ice is fine , steady for a decade " made reference to Alaskan research group ( IARC ) .
I wrote to members of IARC and asked whether this was true .
Both their chief scientist and director confirmed that Monckton was mistaken .
They also pointed me to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre ( NSIDC ) for a second opinion .
A scientist there confirmed Monckton 's error , as did Dr Ola Johannessen , whose work has shown ice loss in Greenland ( Monckton reported that Johannessen 's work showed that Greenland " was just fine " . )
Next , I investigated Monckton 's claim that the medieval period was warmer than today .
Monckton showed a slide featuring nine researchers ' works which , he claimed , proved that today 's warming is not unusual – it was hotter in the past .
I wrote to these authors and I read their papers .
It turned out that none of the authors or papers made the claims that Monckton attributed to them .
This pattern of misinterpretation was becoming chronic .
Next , I checked on Monckton 's claim that the ocean has not been heating for 50 years .
To quote him directly , there has been " no ocean heat buildup for 50 years " .
On this slide , he referenced a well - known researcher named Dr Catia Domingues .
It turns out Domingues said no such thing .
What would she know ?
She only works for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) in Australia .
In one last , and particularly glaring example , Monckton referred to a 2004 statement by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) which stated that solar activity has caused today 's warming and that global warming will end soon .
The president of the IAU division on the sun and heliosphere told me that there is no such position of the IAU and that I should pass this information on to whomever " might have used the IAU name to claim otherwise " .
After learning all of this , and much more than can be written about in this limited space , I felt like Alice who fell down the rabbit hole and emerged in an alternate reality .
How can such misrepresentations be made without public recourse ?
I can not answer that .
I can say that scientists are listening and though our voices are small , we will use them to hold people like Monckton and others to account for their public claims .
The science community is slowly learning that if we do n't perform this service , no one will .
Tough decisions are going to have to be made and the public deserves accurate information about the science so they can help make those decisions .

Strangest way to receive tons of marriage offers
One Way to Get Popular with Ladies : Set out to Walk Around The World in an Iron Mask
( images via Simon Bensley and Linda Culm )
Roll up , roll up , roll up !
You , sir , say that you dream of fame , and all the rewards it offers , but lack any talent whatsoever ?
And you , over there , wish beyond anything in this world to be the recipient of innumerable offers of marriage ?
And you , kind sir , desire to earn a considerable fortune but without all the trauma of actual work ?
Well , ladies and gentlemen , I can make all these dreams and far more a reality .
The answer , you see , is in this box .
But before I reveal its contents , and the answer to all your desires , I must first tell you all a story – the story of one Harry Bensley .
Harry was , to put it mildly , a bit of a rogue , a rascal , a rake , a rapscallion .
Born around 1877 , Harry soon proved to as wily with his businesses and investments as he'd was with the ladies , the bottle , and the cards – creating for himself a self - indulgently lavish and totally outlandish lifestyle .
But , alas – or so some stories go – Harry 's luck deserted him one day and he lost it all on a foolish wager .
Facing absolute ruin , Harry had few options – until , that is , the intervention of John Pierpont Morgan and Hugh Cecil Lowther ( the 5th Earl of Lonsdale ) .
What Morgan and Lowther did was offer poor Harry an opportunity to regain his fortune .
All Harry had to do was accept another , very possibly , foolish wager .
( images via )
Harry , you see , had to take a stroll .
But not a few dozen , or even hundred , miles ... not just across England , or even down and through Europe , or into the Middle East and then China .
No , ladies and gentlemen , Harry had to walk all the way around the entire Earth .
Yes , you may gasp .
Assuredly , you want shake your heads in disbelief , but those were the terms of the bet .
But that 's not all .
For not only did Harry have to walk all the way around this lovely world but he also had a few other , well , ' unusual ' terms to obey if he was to regain what he'd lost .
First of all , Harry had to follow a very specific path through no less than 169 separate British cities , getting in each one a signature proving his visit .
After this would follow travels to 18 other countries , again in a strict order .
Second ,
Harry would begin his incredible journey with no more than one British pound in his pocket .
Any money made on the trip could only be made by selling novelty picture postcards explaining the bet .
Third , his only change of clothing would be a spare set of undergarments .
Fourth , he would push a baby carriage the entire way .
Fifth , Harry would have a companion who would make sure that Harry obeyed every term and requirement of the wager .
No cheating , Harry !
Sixth , Harry would have to – somehow , somewhere – find himself a wife .
As said , this was outrageous , bizarre , insane , but Harry agreed to every requirement and term of the bet .
He would push his stroller , he would have only a change of underwear , he would have no money except for what he made selling his postcards , and he would find himself a wife .
But there was one other term , ladies and gentlemen , one other requirement that Harry had to meet to win back his fortune .
And that thing , the final condition , has to do with this box , right here at my feet .
You see Harry had to complete his round - the - world walk without a single , solitary person recognizing him .
Yes , my rapt audience , Harry had to travel through Britain , across Europe , into Asia and beyond without even once being recognized – even by the woman he would somehow manage to agree to marry him .
And how was Harry supposed to accomplish this ?
And did Harry win his bet ?
Ah , but first things first – and now I shall open the box .
HOW TO WIN FAME , FORTUNE , AND MARRIAGE PROPOSALS
( images via )
Amazing , is n't it ?
A real antique , too .
It 's hard to believe that anyone ever wore anything like this – or that Harry Bensley agreed to wear it on planned trip around the world .
The helmet is from a suit of armor and weighs almost five pounds and , yes , Harry had to wear it constantly .
On January 1 , 1908 , Harry began his journey : wearing his helmet , pushing his pram , followed by his monitor , he began his walk around the world .
Did Harry succeed in his outrageous , bizarre , insane voyage ?
Did he win back his fortune or did some cruel accident void the terms of the wager ?
Well , for a while things got sticky .
As he traveled , the tale of the Man In The Iron mask grew and people began to flock to see him – as well as try and guess his identity .
Even a newspaper of the time , in a moment of cruelty , offered a reward of one thousand pounds to anyone who could guess his identity .
Eventually Harry arrived in Italy , having walked over 30,000 miles in six years without ever voiding the terms of the wager .
Alas , the fate – and the failure of diplomacy – intervened in 1914 .
The details of what occurred next are hazy , at best .
Some claim that Harry called off the wager to serve his country in World War 1 , while others say that Morgan called it off and gave Harry a small sum , and there are even a few who argue that other , unknown , causes interfered .
In any event , Harry fought for his country and , again the cruelties of fate , was seriously wounded – but Harry 's poor luck continued when he lost whatever else he had and ended up having to take a series of low - end positions until his death in 1956 .
Wild enough tale to be made into a movie ...
You say you desire fame but lack talent ?
You say you lust after fortune but do not want to soil your hands with work ?
You say you crave the attention of women ?
Well , maybe you will have better luck than poor Harry when you put on this ancient helmet and try to stroll around the world without once being identified .
But before you disparage Harry Bensley you should know that even though Harry never won back his fortune , and his story is not as famous as some people 's , Harry did manage to receive 200 or so marriage proposals from women who'd never seen his face .
But Harry , the once - rake , the once - rapscallion , never once accepted their offers .
So maybe Harry did win a bit of something with his amazing bet after all : a special form of nobility befitting the knight 's helmet he wore for over six years .

In closing , here is a weird statue , which almost seems to say : " OK , so you 've heard the man 's amazing story .
Now what about YOUR life ?
Is it even mildly interesting ? " -

The actor films a PSA asking Obama to help save the whales
As British spy James Bond , Pierce Brosnan battled many fictional bad guys – but now the actor is fighting for a good cause :
He wants to help save the whales .
In a new PSA for the International Fund for Animal Welfare , Brosnan directly addresses President Barack Obama , telling him that “ whales face more threats today than ever before ” from everything from pollution to professional whalers to climate change .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ As a candidate you promised to end illegal whaling , and we applauded your leadership , ” says Brosnan .
“ But recent reports reveal your administration supports an international proposal , which gives Japan , Iceland and Norway the license to kill whales . ”
The actor then asks the president promise to protect the whales .
Later this month , the International Whaling Commission is scheduled to vote on a proposal that could allow commercial whaling with certain restrictions .
One thing we ’ve learned about the Gulf oil spill is how opinions tend to differ depending on which side of the Atlantic you reside on .

100,000 barrels per day and possible well casing failures dictate that .
Watching this situation play out will be both fascinating and nauseating .
One of the biggest questions going forward may prove to be : Is BP too dangerous to exist ?
I ’m starting to think so .
Their safety record is horrific .
BP continued to cut corners even after recent disasters , as the NYT points out here .
In contrast , after the Valdez incident , Exxon transformed their culture into one where OCD - level safety concern is encouraged .
I ’m starting to think BP should n’t even be entrusted with the relief wells and a head - role in the cleanup efforts .

Graphic shows statistics for newspaper print ad revenue , circulation and evening new viewership
( AP ) --
Even the news industry 's free fall probably will not be enough to wipe out complicated federal rules designed to restrain the power of media companies .
For decades , the Federal Communications Commission has imposed strict limits preventing any company from controlling too many media properties in the same market .
These limits were established to ensure that communities have choices of newspapers and local TV and radio stations .
Congress requires the FCC to take a hard look at the rules every four years to determine whether they still serve the public interest .
If they do n't , the FCC has to rewrite them .
Now , as the FCC kicks off its latest review , it faces calls to pare the limits because traditional media companies are no longer the almighty players that they were when the ownership rules were first enacted .
Newspaper readers and advertisers have migrated to the Internet , where a lot of content is free and advertising costs less .
As a result , newsrooms have shrunk and newspapers have sought bankruptcy protection or shut down .
Television broadcasters are suffering too as cable , satellite TV and the Internet splinter audiences and siphon ad dollars - forcing stations to seek new revenue streams and even raising questions about the future of free , over - the - air TV .
Against this backdrop , media companies argue that the FCC 's ownership limits no longer make sense and should be relaxed , or even scrapped , so that the companies can get bigger in order to better compete and survive .
" These rules need to fall away , " says Jerry Fritz , general counsel for Allbritton Communications , an Arlington , Va. , company that owns eight TV stations in seven markets , a cable station in Washington , D.C. , and Politico , a successful online and print publication that covers politics .
Allbritton is also launching a local news website to cover the Washington region .
" The FCC rules make no sense anymore , " Fritz says .
But the FCC is unlikely to toss out media ownership restrictions entirely .
The agency is also under pressure from public interest groups that support strong limits .
Andrew Schwartzman , head of the group Media Access Project , argues that such rules remain critical because democracy relies on a vibrant press with many voices .
These groups have a key ally in Michael Copps , one of the three Democrats on the five - member FCC .
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski has said little publicly about his views on the existing rules , and his staff has promised a fresh look at the entire media ownership framework .
But Genachowski was an architect of the Obama campaign 's technology platform , which included a pledge to encourage diversity in media ownership .
Complicating the situation : Even as the FCC launches the 2010 review , the agency still is tied up in a legal battle in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals over the media ownership reviews of Genachowski's Republican predecessors .
The case goes back to the 2002 review under then - FCC chairman Michael Powell .
Powell tried to raise the caps on TV and radio station ownership and relax the so - called " cross- ownership " ban , a rule adopted in 1975 that prohibits common ownership of a broadcast station and a newspaper in the same market .
( Holdings in some markets , such as Chicago , where Tribune Co. owns WGN radio and TV and the Chicago Tribune , were grandfathered in . )
But Powell 's plan drew legal challenges from public interest groups that said he had gone too far and media companies that said he had not gone far enough .
So the Third Circuit sent the matter back to FCC , telling it to rewrite the rules .
And that led Powell 's successor , Kevin Martin , to try to ease the cross - ownership ban in the 20 largest media markets .
That drew more challenges from both sides .
After Genachowski came to the FCC last year , the agency urged the Third Circuit to hold off on considering the case because Martin 's rules would soon be superseded by the 2010 review .
For a time , the court complied and prevented those rules from going into effect .
But in March , the court got tired of waiting for the agency to act and allowed Martin 's rules to take force , which could pave the way for cross - ownership deals in the biggest markets .
So now , the FCC must decide how to respond in court to the challenges to Martin 's actions - even as it launches its own media ownership review .
On both fronts , public interest groups are pushing to roll back Martin 's cross - ownership rules and leave the rest of the restrictions in place .
Meanwhile , media companies are fighting to lift the cross - ownership ban entirely .
They also want some relief from rules that prohibit one company from owning more than one TV station in smaller markets and more than two TV stations in larger markets , including only one of the top four .
Such rules , opponents say , reflect a time when the news business was dominated by just three TV networks and local newspapers - before cable , satellite and the Internet transformed the media , providing outlets for all sorts of viewpoints and voices .
Indeed , some of the current ownership rules date in some form to as early as the 1940s .
So why , critics ask , should the FCC continue to measure competition by counting broadcast stations and newspapers in individual markets ?
" I do n't think the average consumer sees the market the way we regulate it , " Powell says .
" This is n't the way Americans consume media . "
Critics also say the rules do more harm than good by artificially inflating the number of media outlets fighting for a limited pool of readers , viewers and advertisers in individual markets .
Allowing consolidation , says Harold Furchtgott - Roth , a former Republican FCC commissioner , would let media companies build larger audiences to attract advertisers and spread hefty newsgathering costs by repurposing content across more platforms .
" If we want robust local news , we need to give media companies the opportunity to achieve scale , since producing local news is not cheap , " says Rebecca Duke , vice president of distribution for LIN Media , a company based in Providence , R.I. , that owns 29 TV stations .
Lifting the rules could help save struggling newspapers or TV stations looking for a buyer , Furchtgott - Roth adds , because often the only potential suitor might be the other major media outlet in town .
One irony not lost on media executives is that the FCC and the Justice Department are expected to approve Comcast Corp .'s proposal to buy a majority stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co .
That deal , which would give the nation 's largest cable TV operator control of NBC 's media empire , would dwarf the types of local media mergers prohibited by the FCC 's current rules .
Still , Corie Wright , policy counsel for the public interest group Free Press , insists there is not enough competition in most markets to permit consolidation .
Even as cable and the Internet offer many more choices for general news and commentary , most local reporting is still done by newspapers and TV stations , she notes .
Georgetown Law professor Angela Campbell , who represents several public interest groups defending strong ownership limits , fears more consolidation would lead to newsroom layoffs as media companies combine operations and feed the same content to different outlets .
" Every time you have one of these deals , at the end of the day it means one newsroom closes , another lost voice , less local coverage and less diversity of perspective , " says FCC Commissioner Copps .
Schwartzman , head of Media Access Project , is also skeptical of the argument that the industry 's troubles justify deregulation .
After all , he noted , the economy is still emerging from a deep recession that has hit major advertisers in the auto , real estate and retailing sectors particularly hard .
As those sectors recover , he says , media companies may recover too .
" I am concerned about enacting policy changes based on temporary economic conditions , " Schwartzman says .
" We do n't know what the new normal is . "
But whatever the new normal turns out to be , it figures to look very different from the traditional media landscape .
That 's why some observers are asking whether all the debate over media consolidation may be beside the point , given the huge problems facing the industry .
" Media companies are struggling and the government is standing in their way , " says Kenneth Ferree , a former FCC official who pushed to relax the ownership limits under Powell and is now a senior fellow with The Progress & Freedom Foundation , a free - market think tank .
" But even if the FCC got rid of the rules , would it matter anyway ?
That 's the $ 64,000 question . "

I ’ll get to the oil .
But first you have to understand where I ’ve been and where you undoubtedly wo n’t go , but Shell ’s drilling rigs surely will — unless someone stops them .
Over the last decade , I ’ve come to know Arctic Alaska about as intimately as a photographer can .
I ’ve been there many times , starting with the 14 months I spent back in 2001 - 2002 crisscrossing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — 4,000 miles in all seasons by foot , raft , kayak , and snowmobile , regularly accompanied by Inupiat hunter and conservationist Robert Thompson from Kaktovik , a community of about 300 on the Arctic coast , or with Gwich ’in hunters and conservationists Charlie Swaney and Jimmy John from Arctic Village , a community of about 150 residents on the south side of the Brooks Range Mountains .
In the winter of 2002 , Robert and I camped for 29 days at the Canning River delta along the Beaufort Sea coast to observe a polar bear den .
It ’s hard even to describe the world we encountered .
Only four calm days out of that near - month .
The rest of the time a blizzard blew steadily , its winds reaching a top speed of 65 miles per hour , while the temperature hovered in the minus - 40 - degree range , bringing the wind - chill factor down to something you ’ll never hear on your local weather report : around minus 110 degrees .
If that ’s too cold for you , believe me , it was way too cold for someone who grew up in Kolkata , India , even if we did observe the bear and her two cubs playing outside the den .
During the summer months , you probably can’t imagine the difficulty I had sleeping on the Alaskan Arctic tundra .
The sun is up 24 hours a day and a cacophony of calls from more than 180 species of birds converging there to nest and rear their young never ceases , day or “ night . ”
Those birds come from all 49 other American states and six continents .
And what they conduct in those brief months is a planetary celebration on an unimaginably epic scale , one that connects the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to just about every other place on Earth .
When you hear the clicking sound of the hooves of the tens of thousands of caribou that also congregate on this great Arctic coastal plain to give birth to their young — some not far from where my tent was set up — you know that you are in a place that is a global resource and does not deserve to be despoiled .
Millions of Americans have come to know the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , even if at a distance , thanks to the massive media attention it got when the Bush administration indicated that one of its top energy priorities was to open it up to oil and gas development .
Thanks to the efforts of environmental organizations , the Gwich ’in Steering Committee , and activists from around the country , George W. Bush fortunately failed in his attempt to turn the refuge into an industrial wasteland .
While significant numbers of Americans have indeed come to care for the Arctic Refuge , they know very little about the Alaskan Arctic Ocean regions — the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea ( which the refuge abuts ) .
I came to know these near - shore coastal areas better years later and discovered what the local Inupiats had known for millennia : these two Arctic seas are verdant ecological habitats for remarkable numbers of marine species , including endangered Bowhead whales and threatened polar bears , Beluga whales , walruses , various kinds of seals , and numerous species of fish and birds , not to mention the vast range of “ non-charismatic ” marine creatures we ca n’t see right down to the krill — tiny shrimp - like marine invertebrates — that provide the food that makes much of this life possible .
The Kasegaluk lagoon , which I spent much time documenting as a photographer , along the Chukchi Sea is one of the most important coastal treasures of the entire circumpolar north .
It is 125 miles long and only separated from the sea by a thin stretch of barrier islands .
Five icy rivers drain into the lagoon , creating a nutrient - rich habitat for a host of species .
An estimated 4,000 Beluga whales are known to calve along its southern edge , and more than 2,000 spotted seals use the barrier islands as haul - out places in late summer , while 40,000 Black Brant goose use its northern reaches as feeding grounds in fall .
In July 2006 , during a late evening walk , wildlife biologist Robert Suydam and I even spotted a couple of yellow wagtails — not imposing whales , but tiny songbirds .
Still , the sight moved me .
“ Did you know , ” I told my companion , “ that some of them migrate to the Arctic from my home , India ? ”
Can oil be cleaned up under Arctic ice ?
Unfortunately , as you ’ve already guessed , I ’m not here just to tell you about the glories — and extremity — of the Alaskan Arctic , which happens to be the most biologically diverse quadrant of the entire circumpolar north .
I ’m writing this piece because of the oil , because under all that life and beauty in the melting Arctic there ’s something our industrial civilization wants , something oil companies have had their eyes on for a long time now .

If you ’ve been following the increasing ecological devastation unfolding before our collective eyes in the Gulf of Mexico since BP ’s rented Deepwater Horizon exploratory drilling rig went up in flames ( and then under the waves ) , then you should know about — and protest — Shell Oil ’s plan to begin exploratory oil drilling in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas this summer .
On March 31 , standing in front of an F - 18 “ Green Hornet ” fighter jet and a large American flag at Andrews Air Force Base , President Obama announced a new energy proposal , which would open up vast expanses of America ’s coastlines , including the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas , to oil and gas development .
Then , on May 13 , the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals handed a victory to Shell Oil .
It rejected the claims of a group of environmental organizations and Native Inupiat communities that had sued Shell and the Interior Department ’s Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) to stop exploratory oil drilling in the Arctic seas .
Fortunately ,
Shell still needs air quality permits from the Environmental Protection Agency as well as final authorization from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar before the company can send its 514 - foot drilling ship , Frontier Discoverer , north this summer to drill three exploratory wells in the Chukchi Sea and two in the Beaufort Sea .
Given what should by now be obvious to all about the dangers of such deep - water drilling , even in far less extreme climates , let ’s hope they do n’t get either the permits or the authorization .
On May 14 , I called Robert Thompson , the current board chair of Resisting Environmental Destruction on Indigenous Lands ( REDOIL ) .
“ I ’m very stressed right now , ” he told me .
“ We ’ve been watching the development of BP ’s oil spill in the Gulf on television .
We ’re praying for the animals and people there .
We do n’t want Shell to be drilling in our Arctic waters this summer . ”
As it happened , I was there when , in August 2006 , Shell ’s first small ship arrived in the Beaufort Sea .
Robert ’s wife Jane caught it in her binoculars from her living - room window and I photographed it as it was scoping out the sea bottom in a near - shore area just outside Kaktovik .
Its job was to prepare the way for a larger seismic ship due later that month .
Since then , Robert has been asking one simple question :
If there were a Gulf - like disaster , could spilled oil in the Arctic Ocean actually be cleaned up ?
He ’s asked it in numerous venues — at Shell ’s Annual General Meeting in The Hague in 2008 , for instance , and at the Arctic Frontiers Conference in Tromsø , Norway , that same year .
At Tromsø , Larry Persily — then associate director of the Washington office of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , and since December 2009 , the federal natural gas pipeline coordinator in the Obama administration — gave a 20 - minute talk on the role oil revenue plays in Alaska ’s economy .
During the question - and - answer period afterwards , Robert typically asked : “ Can oil be cleaned up in the Arctic Ocean ?
And if you ca n’t answer yes , or if it ca n’t be cleaned up , why are you involved in leasing this land ?
And I ’d also like to know if there are any studies on oil toxicity in the Arctic Ocean , and how long will it take for oil there to break down to where it ’s not harmful to our marine environment ? ”
Persily responded : “ I think everyone agrees that there is no good way to clean up oil from a spill in broken sea ice .
I have not read anyone disagreeing with that statement , so you ’re correct on that .
As far as why the federal government and the state government want to lease offshore , I ’m not prepared to answer that .
They ’re not my leases , to be real honest with everyone . ”
A month after that conference , Shell paid an unprecedented $ 2.1 billion to the MMS for oil leases in the Chukchi Sea .
In October and December 2009 , MMS approved Shell ’s plan to drill five exploratory wells .
In the permit it issued , the MMS concluded that a large spill was “ too remote and speculative an occurrence ” to warrant analysis , even though the agency acknowledged that such a spill could have devastating consequences in the Arctic Ocean ’s icy waters and could be difficult to clean up .
It would be an irony of sorts if the only thing that stood between the Obama administration and an Arctic disaster - in - the - making was BP ’s present catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico .
A COURT has awarded control of a brothel 's sex toys to SA Police , although prosecutors have admitted they are unsure what officers will do with them .
The former manager of Snoopy 's brothel , Georgia Nicola , 45 , of Unley , today pleaded guilty to keeping a brothel , living on the earnings of prostitution , and receiving money paid in a brothel .
Henry Cleland , prosecuting , told Adelaide Magistrates Court that an undercover policeman had entered the South Rd brothel in November , 2008 , and paid Nicola $ 140 .
Police then raided the house and seized cash and " numerous articles to do with sexual acts " before arresting Nicola .
Mr Cleland asked Magistrate Terence Forrest order Nicola forfeit the items , but admitted he " did not know what police would do with them . "
Craig Caldicott , for Nicola , said his client no longer ran the brothel and has begun stable work as a receptionist .
He said Nicola would pay the " lion 's share " of the money earned from her clients to the women who worked at the brothel .
Charges of managing a brothel against Nicola 's co-accused , Andrew Kalogeras , 42 , of Unley , were dropped .
Mr Forrest fined Nicola $ 1000 , recorded a conviction against her and ordered she forfeit the sexual items .

Carders.cc , a German online forum dedicated to helping criminals trade and sell financial data stolen through hacking , has itself been hacked .
The once - guarded contents of its servers are now being traded on public file - sharing networks , leading to the exposure of potentially identifying information on the forum ’s users as well as countless passwords and credit card accounts swiped from unsuspecting victims .
The breach involves at least three separate files being traded on Rapidshare.com :
The largest is a database file containing what appear to be all of the communications among nearly 5,000 Carders.cc forum members , including the contents of private , one - to - one messages that subscribers to these forums typically use to negotiate the sale of stolen goods .
Another file includes the user names , e-mail addresses and in many cases the passwords of Carder.cc forum users .
A third file — which includes what appear to be Internet addresses assigned to the various Carders.cc users when those users first signed up as members — also features a breezy explanation of how the forum was compromised .
The top portion of this file — which is accompanied by an ASCII art picture of a cat — includes an oblique reference to the party apparently responsible for the Carders.cc site compromise , noting that the file is the inaugural issue of Owned and Exposed , no doubt the first of many such “ e- zines ” to come from this group .
Ironically , the anonymous authors of the e-zine said they were able to compromise the criminal forum because its operators had been sloppy with security .
Specifically , they claimed , the curators of Carders.cc had set insecure filesystem permissions on the Web server , which essentially turned what might have been a minor site break - in into a total database compromise .
From the e-zine ’s opening salvo :
Many of you guys may have noticed this breeding German “ underground ” shit called carders.cc .
For those who do n’t : Carders is a marketplace full of everything that is illegal and bad .
Carding , fraud , drugs , weapons and tons of kiddies .
They used to be only a small forum , but after we erased 1337 - crew they got more power .
The rats left the sinking ship .
The voices told us to own them since carders is our fault and we had to fix our flaw .
So we did .
During the ownage they also gave us lulz by showing off their ridiculous configuration skills which had a specific impact on their security .
They actually managed to chmod and chown nearly everything to 777 and www - user readable .
Including their / root directory .
On the surface , it ’s tempting to grin at the misfortune of these fraudsters .
Still , the leaked database contains no small amount of password and banking information for many innocent victims .
In addition , these types of vigilante attacks typically come with hidden costs :
For one thing , while it may be true that law enforcement officials could use some of this information to locate people engaged in computer trespass , and buying or selling stolen personal and financial data , the public release of this information could just as easily prompt those individuals to abandon those accounts and Internet addresses , and even potentially jeopardize ongoing investigations .

There is a massive amount of vacant inventory sitting across the United States .
A good portion of this is viewable to the public but a large amount of this inventory is simply hidden from data scrutiny .
Last week we talked about the commercial real estate bust coming to the most expensive region in California of San Francisco .
The fundamental problem was the complex had no way of cash flowing on the apartments with current market rates .
So it is no surprise that the giant San Francisco project now enters into another precarious situation .
Banks do not move quickly on commercial real estate problems because who is going to buy a multi-million or even billion dollar piece of real estate ?
In this market the pool is tiny and the pool of those willing to lend is smaller .
One of the hardest hit regions with collapsed real estate prices is Nevada .
The enormous CityCenter project in Las Vegas is n’t doing so hot :
“( Las Vegas Sun ) The closing of condo sales at CityCenter has gotten off to a slow start , according to analysts who track the housing market .
Through the end of April , MGM Mirage and Dubai World , the owners of the project , have closed on 78 of 1,543 units at the Vdara condo - hotel , according to SalesTraq .
Closings started in March at Vdara but CityCenter had announced earlier this year it had sold 698 units there . ”
78 of 1,543 units is not a good start rate for a supposedly ultra - hot piece of property .
The spin might be out there but just look at what is happening with price .
Some units are already seeing price drops of hundreds of dollars per square foot .
Many prospective buyers are waiting for 40 to 50 percent price cuts .
Prices on some units have been cut by 30 percent but that does n’t seem to be pushing inventory .
The amount of sales tells us that people are more cautious with their purchases .
You have to ask who financed this commercial real estate deal and what bank (s ) are into this place .
One thing is certain and that is the numbers simply wo n’t work with what is currently being sold .
“ At the ultra-luxury condominium tower Mandarin Oriental , where 205 of 227 condos were reported sold as of earlier this year , 32 units closed between January and the end of April , according to SalesTraq .
“ CityCenter just started closing units in the two Veer Towers in mid-May so those numbers wo n’t be available until the end of June .
MGM had reported that 480 of the 670 units had been sold earlier this year .
Through Thursday , MGM counted 110 closings at Vdara , 38 at Mandarin Oriental and 16 at Veer .
“ This Manhattanization thing everybody was trying to take credit for a few years ago , the condominium market has fallen on its face in this town , ” said SalesTraq President Larry Murphy .
“ This is the deManhattanization of Las Vegas .
CityCenter is right in the middle of the economic ( woes ) , and it is a horrible time to be coming online . ”
A horrible time to come online but who is holding the note ?
This is why we are simply entering the first stage of the $ 3 trillion commercial real estate bust .
Banks are optimistically hoping something will come to fruition that will suddenly make ultra slick condo units sell like pancakes .
But right now consumers are price conscious even in the heart of the Vegas strip .
The fascinating thing is these units do n’t show up in national data as inventory .
Clearly these kinds of projects will skew statistics and it is clear that these are available properties .
Whether they are priced right is another story but to exclude these from the overall data is misguided .
If we look at the data there could n’t be a worse time to come online :
We are in uncharted territory here .
To bring a massive project like this online today will yield troubling results .
Chicago is also dealing with this kind of commercial real estate debacle :
“ ( Chicago Business ) A Near South Loop site where Chicago gangster Al Capone once had his headquarters , and where Geraldo Rivera famously found nothing in Mr. Capone ’s vault , has gained new notoriety as the city ’s biggest condo tower to be taken over by its lender in the current housing crisis .
The 35 - story Lexington Park , near Michigan Avenue and Cermak Road , was surrendered last week by its Irish developer through a deed - in - lieu of foreclosure .
The private - equity venture that now owns the property acquired Corus Bank ’s the distressed condo loans after the Chicago - based lender failed last fall .
Just three buyers have closed on Lexington Park ’s 333 units , according to property records .
The tower , 2138 S. Indiana Ave. , was supposed to be ready for occupancy in 2008 .
Limerick , Ireland - based Chieftain Group Ltd. borrowed $ 84 million from Corus in fall 2006 to finance the tower ’s construction , and also obtained $ 10.6 million in financing from 47 individuals in Ireland , according to mortgages recorded in Cook County . ”
What in the world is a developer from Ireland building in Chicago ?
So far of the 333 units only 3 have closed !
You do n’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that is n’t exactly hitting it out of the park .
Just run a back of the napkin calculation :
$ 84 million + $ 10.6 million / 333 units = $ 284,084 per unit cost
That is pretty high for a condo in Chicago given the current economy ( and that is assuming they sell for break even prices ) .
A person put down $ 15,000 in earnest money back in 2006 for a one - bedroom unit .
These deals are largely a bust .
These will bring down many banks and show how insane the commercial real estate bubble grew .
These units are also part of the condo shadow inventory as if we need more vacant units on the market .
To add to this insanity I saw a piece of legislation being put forward in Congress to encourage building .
Only in our currently dysfunctional Congress would they give a tax break for building more units when clearly we already have too many units .
The irony of the bill would also put more pressure on these empty projects and thus push more commercial real estate deals over the edge .
What we give in tax breaks we will also need to give in bailouts .

How to Convert Text to Unicode Code Points
How to Convert Text to Unicode Code Points
The process for working with character encodings in Python , or converting text to Unicode code points at any point in time , can be incredibly confusing , complex , and convoluted – especially if you are n’t particularly familiar with the Unicode language to begin with .
Thankfully though , there are a lot of tools ( and a lot of tutorials ) out there that can dramatically streamline and simplify things for you moving forward .
You ’ll find the inside information below incredibly useful at helping you tackle Unicode code points but there are a host of “ automatic converters ” that you might want to take advantage of online as well ( almost all of the best ones being open - source and free of charge , too ) .
If you ’re working with a web host like BlueHost , or using a CMS like WordPress , then this conversion process is already taken care of for you .
By the time you ’re done with the details below you ’ll know exactly how to :
Understand the overall conceptual point of character encodings and the numbering system in Unicode
How Unicode has built - in support for numbering systems through different INT literals
How to take advantage of built - in functions that are specifically designed to “ play nicely ” with character encodings and different numbering systems
Let ’s dig right in .
What exactly is character encoding to begin with ?
To start things off you have to understand exactly what character encoding is to begin with , which can be a bit of a tall task considering the fact that there are hundreds of character encodings that you can deal with as a programmer throughout your career .
One of the very simplest character encodings is ASCII so that ’s going to be the fundamental standpoint that we work with throughout this quick example .
Relatively small and including contained encoding you are n’t going to have to worry about a whole lot of headache or hassle wrapping your head around this process but will be able to use the fundamentals here in any other character encoding you do later down the line .
ASCII encompasses :
All lowercase English letters as well as all uppercase English letters
Most traditional punctuation and symbols you ’ll find on a keyboard
Whitespace markers
And even some non-printable characters
All of these inputs can be translated from traditional characters that we are able to see and read in our own native language ( if you ’re working in English , anyways ) to integers and inevitably into computer bits – each and every one of that can be encoded to a very unique and specific sequence of bits that do something very specific in the world of Unicode .
If every single character has its own specific code point ( sometimes referred to as an integer ) that means that different characters are segmented into different code point ranges inside of the actual ASCII “ language ” .
In ASCII a code point range breakdown is as follows :
0 through 31 code points –
These are your control or nonprintable characters
32 through 64 code points –
These are your symbols , your numbers , and punctuation marks as well as whitespace
65 through 90 code points –
These would be all of your uppercase English alphabet letters
91 through 96 code points – Graphemes that can include brackets and backslashes
97 through 122 code points –
These are your lowercase English alphabet letters
123 through 126 code points – Ancillary graphemes
Code point 127 – This is your Control point or the Delete key
All 128 of those individual characters encompass the entirety of the character set that is “ understood ” by the ASCII language .
If a character is input into ASCII that is n’t included in the list we highlighted above is n’t going to be expressed and it is n’t going to be understood based on this encoding scheme .
How Bits Work
As we highlighted above , individual characters are going to be converted into individual code points that are later expressed as integers and bits – the essential building block of all language and information that computers understand .
A bit is the expression of binary language , a signal that your computer understands because it only has one of two binary states .
A bit is either a zero or a one , a “ yes ” or a “ no ” , a “ true ” or a “ false ” , and it ’s either going to be “ on ” or it ’s going to be “ off ” .
Because all the data that computers have to work with needs to be condensed down to its bare - bones and its most essential elements ( bits ) each and every one of those individual characters that may be input into the Unicode language has to be distilled down into decimal form .
As more decibels are added the binary form is expanded on , always looking for ways to express the information and data being conveyed in binary form so that the computer can understand exactly what ’s happening .
The problem with ASCII and the rise of Unicode
The reason that Unicode exists has a lot to do with the fact that ASCII as a computer language simply does n’t have a large enough set of characters to accommodate every other language in the world , unique dialects , and computers that are capable of working with and reading different symbols and glyphs .
Truth be told , the biggest knock against ASCII has always been that it does n’t even have a large enough character set to accommodate the entirety of the English language , even .
This is where Unicode swings in to the scene .
Essentially acting as the same fundamental building block language that your computer can understand , Unicode is made up of a much larger ( MUCH larger ) set of individual code points .
There are technically a variety of different encoding schemes that can be taken advantage of when it comes to Unicode as well , each of them with their own distinct code points , but the overwhelming majority of folks using Unicode are going to leverage UTF - 8 ( something that ’s become a bit of a universal standard ) .
Unicode significantly expands on the traditional ASCII table .
Instead of being capable of handling 128 characters , though , Unicode can handle 1,114,112 different characters – representing a significant upgrade that allows for far more complexity and precision in a programming language .
At the same time , some argue that Unicode is n’t exactly and encoding specifically but instead is something more of an implementation of a variety of other character encodings .
There ’s a lot of nuance here that you may or may not be interested in getting into ( depending on how deep you want to dive into the world of Unicode ) , but it ’s important to know that there is a distinction between the two .
How to actually convert text into Unicode
If you are seriously interested in converting text into Unicode the odds are very ( VERY ) good that you are n’t going to want to handle the heavy lifting all on your own , simply because of the complexity that all those individual characters and their encoding can represent .
Instead , you ’ll want to take advantage of online conversion tools that allow you to input pretty much any character imaginable directly into this tool and have it immediately transform that character set ( that very specific character set ) into exact Unicode – almost always in UTF - 8 but sometimes in UTF - 16 or UTF - 32 , depending on what you are interested in .
These conversion tools are ridiculously easy to use and as long as you are moving forward with conversion solutions from reputable sources you should n’t have anything to worry about as far as accuracy , security , or safety are concerned .
It sure beats having to try and figure out the binary code points of characters in Unicode manually !
A top administrator at Texas A&M University resigned on Friday after he admitted lying about his academic credentials and military background .
Alexander Kemos was hired in March 2009 and named senior vice president for administration a year later .
He had claimed to have a doctoral degree from Tufts University in Medford , Mass . , and to have been a former Navy SEAL .
A&M President R. Bowen Loftin announced the resignation in an e-mail to the campus Friday , saying Kemos resigned " to spend more time with his family . "
Kemos served briefly as Loftin 's chief - of - staff last summer .
Kemos , 50 , came to A&M from the business world , previously serving as executive vice president for corporate development and as a founding partner at Nordic American Group .
Loftin released a statement Friday saying he had asked the university 's general counsel to investigate after learning of questions into Kemos ' background .
He confronted Kemos Thursday night .
Kemos " confirmed several misrepresentations related to his academic degrees and military service , " Loftin said in the statement .
Loftin is on vacation and not available to comment further , university spokesman Jason Cook said .
Cook said A&M officials did not verify Kemos ' academic or military credentials before his hiring because both his original position , associate executive vice president for operations , and the senior vice president 's job are staff positions , requiring only a criminal background check .
Applicants for academic jobs , including faculty positions , are screened to ensure their academic credentials are valid , he said .
Kemos could not be reached for comment Friday .
As senior vice president for administration , Kemos was the No. 3 administrator on campus , responsible for facilities , auxiliary enterprises , campus police and other business operations .
References checked Cook said he did not know if the job required a doctoral degree .
Kemos was recommended for the position by a campus search committee chaired by Jeffrey Seemann , vice president for research .
That committee did check Kemos ' references , Cook said .
He said he did not know who first told Loftin about the discrepancy , but that Loftin was told " four or five days ago . "
H. Russell Cross , a long - time A&M faculty member and administrator , will serve as acting senior vice president for administration .

The Corporatocracy and government collusion
US government poisons its own citizens
( Natural News )
What 's clear about the BP oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico is that theare doing a better job of asking the really tough questions than the mainstream media .
Sure , CNN , Fox and others are bringing some attention to the matter , and they 've done some solid reporting on it , but they have n't yet found a way to ask the deeper questions like why the U.S. government seems to be colluding with BP to cover up the truth about the spill .
Just the other day , I found an article entitled , " 16 Burning Questions About The Gulf Of Mexico Oil Spill " on the TheEconomicCollapseBlog.com site ( http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/... ) .
It was a really insightful collection of important questions , so I 've repeated them below .
The author of these questions was n't mentioned on the page , so I regret I cannot properly attribute the list , but I do think they 're worth reviewing , so I 've included my own commentary and an extra question below .
Here are the 16 questions : #1 ) Barack Obama has authorized the deployment of more than 17,000 National Guard members along the Gulf coast to be used " as needed " by state governors .
So what are all of these National Guard troops going to be doing exactly ?
Are the troops going to be used to stop the oil or to control the public ?
Good question .
Much of the response activity to the spill seems to be about controlling the public 's perception and limiting media access to the spill site rather than actually cleaning up the mess .
#2 ) Barack Obama has also announced the creation of a " Gulf recovery czar " who will be in charge of overseeing the restoration of the Gulf of Mexico region following the oil spill .
So is appointing a " czar " Obama 's idea of taking charge of a situation ?
#3 ) Because it is so incredibly toxic , the UK's Marine Management Organization has completely banned Corexit 9500 , so if there was a major oil spill in the UK's North Sea , BP would not be able to use it .
So why is BP being allowed to use Corexit 9500 in the Gulf of Mexico ?
Because Corexit kills sea animals and makes them sink and disappear rather than allowing them to wash up on shore where the emotional outcry would be even worse than it is already .
#4) It is being reported that 2.61 parts per million of Corexit 9500 ( mixed with oil at a ratio of 1:1o ) is lethal to 50 % of fish exposed to it within 96 hours .
That means that 1 gallon of Corexit 9500 / oil mixture is capable of rendering 383,141 gallons of water highly toxic to fish .
So why was BP allowed to dump 1,021,000 gallons of Corexit 9500 and Corexit 9527 into the Gulf of Mexico , and why are n't they being stopped from dumping another 805,000 gallons of these dispersants that they have on order into the Gulf ?
Sadly , BP is running the show in the Gulf , not the government !
The U.S. government has sold out to private corporations who now think they own the gulf and can run operations there however they see fit .
#5 ) If these dispersants are so incredibly toxic to fish , what are they going to do to crops ?
What are they going to do to people ?
They 're obviously going to poison the entire Gulf Coast region if hurricanes whip up these chemicals and deposit them on land .
We could be looking at a complete wipeout of the Florida citrus industry , for example , if all the worst conditions converge .
#6 ) If the smell of the oil on some Gulf beaches is already so strong that it burns your nostrils , then what in the world is this oil doing to wildlife that encounter it ?
#7 ) Is it a bad sign that birds from the Gulf region are flocking north by the thousands ?
Remember the Tsunami in the Indian ocean a few years back ?
The animals fled first , while the clueless people stayed behind and got clobbered by the deadly wave .
I think a similar thing could be happening in the Gulf .
All it takes is one hurricane to turn the entire region into a toxic stew of chemical poison .
#8 ) Why is BP being allowed to use private security contractors to keep the American people away from the oil cleanup sites ?
Yes , this is the real question .
BP is running security in the Gulf the same way Halliburton runs security in the Middle East .
The corporate contractors are now the police force in the area , and they 're running the Gulf as if they owned it !
This is a clear indication that the corporations have taken over our government # 9 )
Why is BP openly attempting to manipulate the search results on sites like Google and Yahoo ?
#10 ) Why has the FAA shut down the airspace above the Gulf of Mexico oil spill ?
What do n't they want the American people to see ?
There are lots of answer to this one :
The feds probably do n't want people in small airplanes taking aerial photos and posting them online ( because the Obama administration is working overtime to cover up the truth here , much like the Bush administration did with the flag - draped coffins coming home from war in the Middle East ) .
It could also be that they are planning something really crazy like a deep ocean nuke to collapse the well , and they do n't want civilians falling out of the sky when the mushroom cloud appears .
#11 ) Senator Bill Nelson of Florida says there are reports that there are additional ruptures in the sea floor from which oil is leaking .
If there are quite a few of these additional ruptures , then how in the world does BP expect to completely stop this oil leak ?
BP actually does n't expect to stop this leak anytime soon .
They are clearly in full - on spin mode , just trying to deny the truth and spin the words to buy themselves more time to offload stock shares before the whole thing comes tumbling down . # 12 ) Why are scientists finding concentrations of methane at up to 10,000 times normal background levels in Gulf waters ?
Because BP broke the ocean floor , and now huge volumes of gas hydrates ( which contain methane ) are bubbling up from places that were previously trapped safely underground .
#13 ) At some testing stations in the Gulf of Mexico , levels of benzene have been detected at over 3000 parts per billion , and levels of hydrogen sulfide have been detected as high as 1192 parts per billion .
Considering that these levels would be highly toxic to humans , why has n't the general public been warned ? # 14 ) Why are so many Gulf oil spill disaster workers showing up at local hospitals complaining of a " mysterious illness " ?
This is going to be the Gulf War Syndrome of the Gulf Coast .
Or the 9/11 asbestos question affecting firefighters .
There will be a wave of toxic side effects from the use of chemicals in the Gulf , and both BP and the federal government will predictably deny any link between the chemicals and the health effects for years to come .
#15 ) If " 70 % or 80 % " of the protective booms are doing absolutely nothing at all to stop the oil , then what is going to stop the millions of gallons of oil in the Gulf from eventually reaching shore ?
Nothing , of course .
The oil is going to reach the shore , and there 's nothing BP or the feds can do to stop in .
In fact , it seems as if they areto interfere with the cleanup by halting the barges that were supposed to be vacuuming oil just off the beaches . # 16 ) It is being reported that the deep sea oil plumes are creating huge " dead zones " where all creatures are dying as they are deprived of oxygen .
If this oil spill continues to grow could the vast majority of the Gulf of Mexico become one gigantic " dead zone " ?
Indeed , that is precisely what looks likely to happen .
The Gulf of Mexico could become a massive dead zone , adding to the long list of humanity 's crimes against the planet .
See my related CounterThink cartoon at : https://www.naturalnews.com/029015_atrocities...
I 've also added one more question of my own : Remember the BP press conferences on cable news ?
A U.S. Coast Guard representative was standing right there beside the BP spokesperson , almost as if she were a subordinate of BP .
This is insane !
If anything , the US Coast Guard should be telling BP what to do , not the other way around .
And why is the US Coast Guard restricting reporters ' access to the spill areas , threatening them with arrest if they " trespass . "
Trespass into PUBLIC waters ?
Does n't anybody realize thatand if we want to take our boats out into the Gulf to get some video of what 's really happening there , that 's our right !
But the U.S. government is now working for BP , it seems , and they 're trying to protect BP 's image by restricting the freedoms of ordinary Americans .
Sound familiar ?
That 's why I think this Gulf of Mexico disaster is another 9/11 reactionary freedom squasher in the works .
Just wait ... you 'll see what kind of freedom - destroying ideas are put forth by our lawmakers in response to this catastrophe .
When it 's all said and done , it wo n't only be British Petroleum that loses ; it will be all of us .
What we 're really witnessing here with the BP disaster is our own government colluding with the powerful corporatocracy to cover up the truth all while making it worse by interfering with legitimate cleanup efforts .
It 's almost as if the federal government were actively working to worsen the problem and expand the impact of the disaster .
But that brings up the question : Why ?
Why would our own government worsen a catastrophe ?
The answer , of course , is right in front of you .
Just visit ground zero in New York City and remind yourself of all the various ways the U.S. government expanded its power following the collapse of the twin towers .
" Never waste a good crisis " is the mantra of Big Government today , and the easiest way to steal even more power away from the people is to turn a small disaster into a big disaster , then leap in with a " government solution " that enacts some large , oppressive new act that never would have been possible before the disaster .
So what kind of oppressive new laws does the Obama administration want to put in place in response to this disaster ?
Perhaps government control over all oceans , or government control over all seafood .
Maybe they want to outlaw oil over the next 25 years and force everybody to transition to some other form of energy ( which may not actually be a bad idea from an ecological perspective , but at what price to freedom ? ) .
There are a thousand other conspiracy theories that try to guess at what the government 's true agenda might be in this moment .
While it 's hard to say which of them ( if any ) might be true , one thing is crystal clear :
The government does not seem interested inin the Gulf of Mexico .
It is covering up the truth , threatening mainstream journalists who try to photograph the region , restricting air travel over the well site , restricting boat travel anywhere near the spill , and basically lying to the public on a daily basis about what 's really happening there .
That alone should make any thinking person suspicious .
If the situation were really under control , why would they have to lie about it ?
There is precedent for believing that the U.S. government might try to poison its own citizens in order to achieve a political goal .
During Prohibition , the U.S. government actually released poisoned alcohol in order to harm ( or kill ) those who were defying the law and drinking liquor .
That story is published today here on NaturalNews.com .
Read it to learn more about what our own government may be capable of doing when it wishes to exercise power of the People .
A reporter for local New Orleans news station WDSU tried to interview some BP employees on a beach in Louisiana and was met by a BP - hired security guard and was told he should n't disturb the workers reports The Consumerist .
According to the video ( shown below ) , the media needs to stay at least 100 feet from BP workers .
Here 's one killer quote from the BP - hired security guard when the reporter asks why he 's preventing people from accessing a public beach :
GUARD : " I can tell you where to go because I 'm employed to keep this beach safe .
I have to keep the workers safe . "
REPORTER : " Can I go interview that worker ? "
GUARD : " NO . "
Powerful stuff .
Watch the video below for the full confrontation
Inside , it ’s life - and - death confrontations , cutthroat competition , conspiracies , betrayals and white - collar crime across the span of a hostile universe .
But outside the virtual world , developers and gamers work together to shape the future of EVE Online .
PC Gamer goes to Reykjavik , Iceland for a behind - the - scenes look at the Council of Stellar Management at work - and play .
“ Well , at least I remember to pay my bills on time ... ”
Noah Ward hides his widening grin by taking a sip of wine .
A series of good - natured ooooh ’s ripple out across the table and conversations cease as everybody pauses to see how the two men sitting on either side of me are going to respond .
We ’re eating a fancy meal at a classy Italian restaurant in downtown Reykjavik , and two EVE Online players just got called out for mismanaging internet spaceships .
That kind of chatter is unusual enough to hear over a plate of prosciutto , but they were n’t merely being called out by some random joe on the forums - this particular ribbing was delivered by Noah Ward , EVE ’s lead game designer .
For most gamers , sitting down to dinner with the developers of their favorite game lies firmly in impossible - dream territory , but for the nine EVE players sitting with me at the table , it ’s very real - and over the past two years , these meetings have become an essential component of the game itself .
Every six months , elections are held in EVE Online to elect nine players to the Council of Stellar Management ( CSM ) .
And in an appropriate parallel to the kind of tactics players deploy every day in EVE Online , these seats are won through rigorous campaigning and corporate politics .
The elected player representatives then work with the rest of EVE ’s 330,000 players to develop a list of issues to be discussed when developer CCP flies them to its headquarters in Reykjavik , Iceland to sit down with them face - to - face twice per year .
Above :
The player - elected Council of schemers
After four months of talking with constituents , poring over forum posts and debating the relative merits of one issue over another , the Council members have finally arrived in Iceland to meet with the developers at CCP .
And it ’s obvious they ’re loving every second of it .
Oskarsson ’s own credentials are in the form of a 21 - page paper that established the impetus behind , the justification for and the implementation of the Council of Stellar Management .
The report went so far as to analyze the theory of the evolution of societies and how EVE went through each step , citing the works of philosophers and social theorists , including Karl Marx , Immanuel Kant , Jean - Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Hobbes .
Above : Office building mullet : professional up front , party in the back
But the economist works at the macro level and does n’t intervene in cases like that of Goonfleet , which had been one of the largest corporations within EVE Online until its leader forgot to make routine fund transfers before leaving on a real - life vacation .
As a result , just weeks before the summit , Goonfleet lost most of the facilities and planets it controlled due to an inability to pay the maintenance fees .
When the leader returned to a group on the verge of mutiny , he looted what little assets Goonfleet had left , fired everyone from the corporation and fled to another part of the galaxy .
So Ward ’s friendly wisecrack had to have stung a bit for at least a few players at the table .
In fact , after a betrayal like that , I expected Asher Dratel and John Zastrow , the two members of Goonfleet on the CSM , to be seething with bitterness and anger .
But they hardly seemed phased by the loss , and were eager to rebuild their alliance under a new banner .
They laughed with everyone else at West ’s prodding and happily told their side of the story .
This might strike most people as a little weird , especially considering that many other MMOs shenanigans like these could result in real - world litigation .
But every EVE player is comfortable with this dichotomy .
On the one hand , EVE is dark and dangerous : nobody can be trusted , everyone has their price and a swift , merciless death awaits you around every corner if you ’re not careful .
But on the other hand , players are optimistic , cooperative , entrepreneurial and often downright brilliant in the ways that they find to bend the game world to their ideas and purposes .
EVE ’s society is always on the verge of anarchy ; most alliances function in the sectors of space where there are no ruling government bodies or police force to restrict players ’ actions .
Sometimes it ’s messy .
Sometimes things go wrong .
But there ’s very little centralized authoritarian control applied in most MMOs that establish what can or ca n’t be done .
In EVE , players collaborate with developers .
Just like they ’re doing now , around the dinner table , as everybody exchanges their favorite stories from a digital world still just a few years old .
Stories that seem to emphasize that EVE
Online is breaking out of its original mold and becoming whatever players want it to be .
Stories about CCP itself - not all of them flattering - were passed around the table just as merrily .
I had flown into Iceland knowing little more than that you did n’t want to do your banking there , but by the end of the CSM , one thing was very clear :
If Reykjavik was a college party town , then CCP would be the biggest frat house on campus .
Yes , it ’s a very serious developer of fine games , but just look at the facts : the majority of employees are young males ; breakfast , lunch and sometimes dinner are served in the company ’s cafeteria by two grandmotherly Icelandic women ; free snacks , sodas and energy drinks can be found in every kitchen ; and “ I was drunk ” is the only excuse needed for showing up late in the morning .
Above :
The CSM represents this entire galaxy
And that ’s not even taking into account the sheer number of “ this one time when I was drunk ” stories that everyone at CCP seemed to have on hand .
The raucous , booze - fueled mayhem even extends to official CCP events , and this spirit - both laid - back and slightly crazed - contributes to CCP ’s innovative development structures that incorporate player feedback with unprecedented efficiency .
Where Blizzard is the buttoned - down suit assuring players , “ Do n’t worry , we ’ve got everything under control ” ( and they do ) , CCP is the hung - over rock star smashing guitars , trashing hotel rooms , using excessive amounts of pyrotechnics and crowd surfing at every opportunity .
Tonight I get to do something I ’ve wanted to do for a really long time : I ’m open - sourcing the roguelike I ’ve been working on for several years .
Amaranth is an old - school terminal - based roguelike written in C# .
It looks like this :
Because I ’m crazy about decoupling , it ’s actually split into three separate projects :
Bramble is a very small low - level library containing utility classes .
It does n’t rely on anything beyond core .NET collections and provides more useful 2D vector and rectangle classes , along with some other handy stuff .
Even if you are n’t working on a game , there may be something in here you can use , which is why it ’s its own project .
Malison is the terminal library Amaranth uses for its user interface .
Like many roguelikes , Amaranth does n’t have graphics .
Instead , it draws the game world in ASCII like an old computer terminal .
Malison is a generic library for drawing to a virtual terminal .
Even if you do n’t care about Amaranth , Malison should be exactly what you need if you ’re going to write your own roguelike or other terminal - style app in C# .
One nice feature it has is that it decouples a logical terminal from a specific renderer .
It provides a renderer using WinForms , but it should be simple to implement other renderers on top of XNA , WPF , or Silverlight .
Code that writes to a terminal only knows about the abstract terminal API , which means you could have a single game engine that supports rendering to a bunch of different terminal implementations .
Amaranth is the actual game , or the beginnings of one .
I have lots of work left to do here , but a lot is also done .
I ’ll be writing more about interesting bits of the engine I hope .
In the meantime you ’ll just have to dig around in the code if you ’re curious .
Some fun stuff it supports :
Game engine is completely decoupled from UI .
It was designed so that if I later write a graphical front - end for it , zero engine code would need to change .
Game loop handles different entity speeds , decoupling from UI , makes no distinction between player - controlled and AI entities , and makes clever use of coroutines .
Game content is data - driven and loaded from friendly human - readable text files .
Expected roguelike features are in there : random dungeons , line - of - sight , field - of - view , inventory , stores , spells , etc .
The game loop was designed to support emergent behavior and interactions between entities .
For example , hitting a monster could cause it to explode in a fireball which will in turn light a nearby torch , blinding an adjacent zombie .
( There is n’t content for this stuff yet , though , just engine support . )
No global state .
Singletons are for amateurs .
It ’s all up on bitbucket : bramble , malison , amaranth .
Feel free to try it out , branch it , or whatever .
In the meantime , I ’ll try to find time to start writing some documentation on more interesting parts of what ’s in there .
Dragon Age Anime Announced
" Anime is a great medium for us to continue the robust Dragon Age story , " said Dragon Age franchise executive producer Mark Darrah in the announcement .
Over on the FUNimation side of the partnership , CEO Gen Fukunaga promises " We are going to be bringing the classic visual and storytelling techniques found in anime to create a film that will extend the narrative of the world BioWare has created . "
Darrah and BioWare creative director Mike Laidlaw will executive - produce the film , as will Fukunaga and FUNimation director of original entertainment Chris Moujaes .
Production was slated to begin in May , while the finished product will be released for " home video " at an unspecified point in 2011 .
An unnamed Dragon
Age title is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2011 while an unknown something is due on February 1 , 2011 .
The anime 's release could well tie into -- or be -- one of these .
The movie rights to BioWare 's sci-fi RPG series Mass Effect were recently picked up by the production company behind the movie adaptations of ' 300 ' and ' Watchmen . '
' I Am Legend ' screenwriter Mark Protosevich is reportedly in talks to write the screenplay .
( WOMENSENEWS ) –U.S. pro-choice advocates are still worried about the drug " ella , " which prevents pregnancy from occurring for five days after unprotected intercourse , rather than three , as the current available pills do .
The drug , which has been available as " ellaOne " in 22 European countries since October 2009 , won unanimous backing from a U.S. Food and Drug Administration , FDA , advisory panel on June 17 .
This brings it a step closer to U.S. availability , which could come as soon as the fall or winter of 2010 .
In studies involving more than 4,500 women , ella prevented pregnancy up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse .
Research published in peer - reviewed journals , including The Lancet and Obstetrics and Gynecology , confirm that it is safe , with mild side effects –headaches , dizziness and nausea–experienced by only 5 to 10 percent of users .
Ella ( also called ulipristal acetate ) , however , is sparking controversy because it is a close chemical relative of mifepristone , the medical abortion pill , known as RU - 486 , which has been available in the United States since 2000 .
RU -486 works for up to nine weeks to prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb or to dislodge a growing embryo .
Ella works by preventing ovulation .
It ’s not an abortafacient–a substance that induces abortion –because it does not affect a fertilized egg or embryo .
As a result , it does n’t terminate pregnancy as pregnancy is defined by the Washington - based American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the Chicago - based American Medical Association and other health organizations .
Before the June 17 FDA ruling , 20 pro-choice groups –including Catholics for Choice , NARAL Pro-Choice America and the National Women ’s Law Center , all based in Washington –wrote a letter to the FDA in support of ella .
A Second Letter
Now , these organizations are preparing a second letter to the FDA that will once again stress women ’s need for a safe , long - lasting emergency contraceptive that prevents unwanted pregnancy .
" We need to get the word out and let people know what ella is , and what it is n’t , " said Kirsten Moore , president of Washington ’s Reproductive Health Technologies Project .
Moore testified in support of ella at the June hearing .
On any given day , a million American women who do not want to become pregnant have unprotected sex and more than 25,000 women become pregnant every year after being sexually assaulted , report researchers from Princeton University in Princeton , N.J .
As a result , notes the Atlanta - based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , more than half of the pregnancies that occur in the United States every year are unintended .
Since 1999 , women in the United States have had access to another form of emergency contraception : Plan B .
Also called the " morning - after pill , " the drug is made by the Israel - based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries .
While Plan B works for three days after unprotected intercourse , ella is effective for five .
Those additional two days are significant because sperm can live in the female reproductive tract for up to five days , which means ella can prevent fertilization during the entire time that sperm are viable .
The extra days are also significant because women who live in rural areas or who have other barriers to contraceptive access may not be able to obtain Plan B within its three - day window .
If approved , ella will be sold in the United States by Watson Pharmaceuticals , based in Corona , Calif .
While Plan B is available in the United States to women over age 17 without a prescription , ella would require a prescription for all women who take it .
Though Plan B runs around $ 50 , ella will likely cost $ 100 to $ 150 .
" Plan B has a generic alternative , but ella does not , " said Alina Salganicoff , vice president and director of women ’s health policy for the Menlo Park , Calif . - based Kaiser Family Foundation .
" If you have prescription drug coverage , your policy will likely absorb the cost , but if you do n’t , you ’ll have to pay out of pocket . "
Anti-Choice Advocates Speak Up
At the FDA hearing on ella , two of the 13 people who spoke to the committee were anti-choice advocates .
One of them was Wendy Wright , president of the Washington - based conservative group Concerned Women for America .
She told the committee that ella " interferes with the lining of the uterus " and that the FDA should not " unleash " it on " unsuspecting women . "
Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo , chair of the U.S. Catholic bishops ’ Washington - based Committee on Pro-Life Activities , wrote the FDA and charged that ella could be slipped to women " by unscrupulous men with the intent of causing an early abortion without a woman ’s knowledge or consent . "
Similar objections are echoed on the Web sites of anti-choice groups including the Washington - based LifeNews.com , Students for Life of America of Arlington , Va. , and the Chicago - based Pro-Life Action League .
Ella ’s next step is for the same FDA administrators who oversaw the June 17 hearing to review the drug ’s application and respond to its maker ’s request for approval .
Pro-choice advocates worry that the political opposition could lead to delays in this process , which typically takes at least several months .
Pro-Choice Activists ’ Concerns
When Plan B was under fire from anti-choice activists during the Bush administration , the FDA took more than three years to approve the drug .
" Under President Obama , the agency has taken steps to bring its handling of emergency contraception in line with the science , " said Amy Allina , program director of the Washington - based National Women ’s Health Network .
" But there is still an age restriction on over - the - counter distribution of Plan B despite medical community consensus that this is inappropriate and serves only to block timely access for young women .
With that mixed record , we think it ’s an open question whether the agency will bring similar political concerns to its decision on this new emergency contraceptive . "
Activists also worry about access to ella .
Before Plan B finally became available as an over - the - counter drug in 1999 , several anti-choice doctors and pharmacists refused to write or fill prescriptions for the drug when women asked them for it .
During the June 17 hearing , the FDA committee upset some pro-choice activists by asking whether there should be any restrictions placed on ella ’s sale–such as a recommendation that women take pregnancy tests before using the new drug .
" This requirement is n’t made of other emergency contraceptives and we think it ’s unnecessary and potentially confusing , " said Allina .
" Pro-choice advocates breathed a sigh of relief during the hearing when the committee moved past that concern . "

Oprah is not going to go out on top .
Last week was the lowest rated in the 24 - year history of her show according to Nielsen .
“ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” has been in reruns for several weeks but compared to the same week last year — which was all reruns , too — the ratings were down an eye - watering 23 percent , according to tvbythenumbers.com , a ratings Web site .
The audience for Oprah was just over 4 million viewers — the lowest it has ever been since the show first went on the air in 1986 .
The bottomed - out ratings have had little practical effect on the daytime talk show against which all the others are measured .
Her ads remain the highest - priced on afternoon TV and getting big - name guests is still no problem .
The falling audience numbers may be a reaction to Winfrey ’s announcement earlier this year that 2011 would be her show ’s final season .
Viewers have begun to disconnect from her in anticipation of her departure from five - days - a - week TV .
Insiders have been saying for a while that Oprah ’s influence may be at an all - time high , but her impact on TV is starting to fade badly .
This week , Forbes named Oprah its No. 1 most powerful celebrity for the fourth time and reported that she has earned a staggering $ 315 million over the last year .

Thousands of demonstrators from across the left - wing of Israeli politics held a rally in Tel Aviv Saturday afternoon to protest 43 years of Israel ’s occupation of the West Bank , and a government that organizers said is “ drowning Israel ” .
The protestors began their demonstration with a march from Rabin Square to the Tel Aviv museum , where speeches were held .
The demonstration , which was held under the slogan " The Government is Drowning Us All " , was originally planned solely to protest the occupation , but following last Monday ’s deadly raid on a Turkish boat attempting to break the Gaza blockade , the rally also addressed those upset about the government ’s policies in regard to the Gaza Strip and the raid that left 9 foreign citizens dead and several IDF soldiers wounded .
Periodically during the course of the demonstration , dozens of right - wing counter protestors attempted to disrupt the proceedings , and at one point a smoke grenade was thrown at the rally .
While the main rally was proceeding at the museum , counter protestors gathered in an adjacent patch of sidewalk and sang praise for the Israeli Navy SEALS and performed renditions of the Israeli national anthem .
As busloads of left - wing activists drove past at the end of the evening , counter protestors chanted “ traitors ” , “ terror supporters ” , and “ go to Gaza ” behind a wall of border patrolmen and YASSAM riot police .
Adam Keller a spokesman for Gush Shalom , one of the organizers of the event , told the Jerusalem Post that the demonstration “ was an even bigger success than he expected ” and said he believes the last week ’s events increased the number of participants .
“ Many people did n’t agree about to what level they oppose this government , but they feel suffocated by it , and feel that it is antagonizing the entire world .
” Keller ’s sentiments were shared by Peace Now Head Yariv Oppenheimer who said that the demonstration was much larger than he expected and that it showed that “ people are opposed to this government that is driving us towards international isolation .
” Oppenheimer added that he hopes the larger - than - expected rally leads to a new wave of opposition to the government , and praised what he said was a lack of anti-IDF slogans , placards , or sentiments at the rally .
Some animals have sharp teeth , some have fragile wings , some are predators , some chew on grass , but they all need to survive .
Even harder to believe , some carnivores can go extinct pretty fast if they do n't find an " intelligent " method of hunting .
On the other hand , small animals with poor defense mechanisms need to find a smart way of surviving and hiding .
Nature has found the solution : " camouflage " .
The evolutionary ability of transforming or adapting to the environment to become a contained part of it .
In one way of another , most of the animals have developed such a skill , and they can easily trick the eye .
From changing colors to changing body shapes , vertebrates and invertebrates appear as if ... they are not there .
This post will exemplify the camouflage technique , even in the underwater world .
Prepare to train your eyes for spotting the animals and their amazing disguises !

Hundreds of activists deported from Israel following a bloody raid by Israeli commandos on a pro-Palestinian flotilla returned to a hero 's welcome in Turkey early today .
Nine bodies were on the first plane .
Deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc and several Turkish lawmakers welcomed them at the airport after Turkey pressured Israel to release the detainees , most of whom are Turkish .
Others were from Arab countries , Europe and the US .
" They faced barbarism and oppression but returned with pride , " Arinc said .
A few thousand jubilant relatives and supporters , waving Palestinian and Turkish flags , burst into applause outside the airport , chanting " God is Great ! "
They later walked to the perimeters near the tarmac to see their loved ones .
Another crowd celebrated their return in downtown Istanbul .
" Turkey is proud of you ! " the crowd chanted as they shouted " Down with Israel ! "
Three air ambulance planes carrying wounded activists had landed in Ankara earlier .
They were bussed to a medical centre to undergo treatment , NTV television said .
The flotilla aimed to break a blockade that Israel has imposed on the Gaza Strip and carry food and other supplies to the Palestinians who live there .
Earlier , Israel 's prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , rejected calls to lift the blockade on Hamas - ruled Gaza , insisting the ban prevents missile attacks on Israel .
He labelled worldwide criticism of his navy 's bloody raid on a pro-Palestinian flotilla as " hypocrisy " .
" This was not the Love Boat , " Netanyahu said in an address to the nation , referring to the vessel boarded by commandos , setting off clashes that led to the deaths of nine activists .
" It was a hate boat . "
While Israeli officials spent most of the day trying to contain the flood of diplomatic condemnation of the raid , Netanyahu was anything but conciliatory in his first nationally broadcast comments since Monday 's military action .
" Israel is facing an attack of international hypocrisy , " he said , asserting that the Jewish state is the victim of an Iran - backed campaign to arm the Hamas rulers of Gaza with missiles that could hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem .
Netanyahu said the aim of the flotilla was to break the blockade , not to bring aid to Gaza .
If the blockade ended , he warned , hundreds of ships would bring in thousands of missiles from Iran , to be aimed at Israel and beyond .
The result , he said , would be an Iranian port on the Mediterranean .
" The same countries that are criticising us today should know that they would be targeted tomorrow , " Netanyahu said .
Seven planes were being used to deport 527 activists to Turkey and Greece , Israeli interior ministry spokeswoman Sabine Haddad said .
Seven other activists remained in Israeli hospitals for treatment of wounds suffered during the Israeli raid , she said .
After all the planes took off , the Israeli foreign ministry said three activists remained in detention over " documentation and other issues " .
The three were from Ireland , Australia and Italy .
About a dozen female activists scuffled with security officers at the airport but were quickly subdued by authorities , Israeli officials said .
Officials said no charges would be filed and the women were deported as planned .
The UN , Europe and others harshly criticised Israel after its commandos stormed the six - ship flotilla in international waters , setting off the clashes .
About 700 activists – including 400 Turks – were trying to break the Israeli and Egyptian naval blockade of the Gaza Strip by bringing in 10,000 tons of aid .
Turkey 's parliament urged its government to review all ties with Israel as the country prepared to welcome home Turkish activists who had been detained after the raid .
Israel rejects claims that Gaza – which has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since the Islamic militant group came to power in 2007 – is experiencing a humanitarian crisis .
Israel says it allows more than enough food , medicine and supplies into the territory .
As Netanyahu rebuffed calls to lift the blockade , cabinet minister Isaac Herzog indicated Israel would oppose calls from the UN and others for an independent investigation of the raid .
" We are the last nation [ that ] you can say does n't check itself , " he told The Associated Press , while acknowledging that Israel was facing serious diplomatic trouble .
" We are trying to take full control of this crisis management and move forward . "
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the US is " working to improve the humanitarian conditions " in Gaza , but he also stressed the Obama administration was " greatly supportive " of Israel 's security and " that 's not going to change " .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , also did not call for an end to the blockade , but she pressed Israel to allow greater access to humanitarian relief supplies .
The Irish prime minister , Brian Cowen , has appealed to Israel to let a private Irish ship deliver its aid cargo to Gaza , but he admitted that Israel would probably block the ship because part of the cargo was concrete , which Israel bans from Gaza because it might be used by Hamas .
The 1,200 - ton ship Rachel Corrie is also carrying wheelchairs and other medical supplies , organisers said .
It was named after a US student crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer while protesting against house demolitions in Gaza .
The ship was supposed to join the aid flotilla but was delayed by mechanical problems and is waiting off the Libyan coast .
Those aboard include Máiread Corrigan , a 1976 Nobel peace prizewinner from Northern Ireland , and Denis Halliday , who previously ran UN humanitarian aid programmes in Iraq .
Israel dropped plans to prosecute dozens of pro-Palestinian activists detained in the raid , opting instead to deport them all immediately in an apparent effort to limit the diplomatic damage from the raid .
" Keeping them here would do more damage to the country 's vital interests than good , " Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein wrote in the order .
In Turkey , Yavuz Dede , the vice - president of the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief , alleged Israel had failed to account for all the passengers and crew on the six ships and was deliberately delaying the activists ' departure to cover up the missing persons .
" We see this delay in the planes ' [ taking off ] as an attempt to disguise the loss of people , " Dede told a press conference at the foundation 's Istanbul headquarters .
The Israeli interior ministry , however , said all those aboard the aid convoy had been accounted for .
Haddad listed 702 activists being deported and seven still in Israeli hospitals .
She said five were taken to the Lebanese border and repatriated there .

Since the creation of the victims fund was announced last week , Fox News has been going ballistic with claims that President Obama bullied BP and abused his power .
These claims went to whole new level today when on FNC ’s Journal Report , John Fund referred to the $ 20 billion put up by BP as a new model for how a company is , “ nationalized . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

While the panel from the also Murdoch owned Wall Street Journal was bemoaning the misery of BP , John Fund took it to whole new level by claiming that by getting BP to place $ 20 billion in escrow , Obama had nationalized the company .
Fund said , “ It ’s almost like we have different models on how you nationalize a company .
There ’s the original model with General Motors and Chrysler , and now there ’s a new model , the next Toyota for example .
You are going to basically face such liability that the federal government is going to effectively own your future . ”
John Fund does not seem to know what the term nationalize means .
Nationalization by definition means to convert from private to government ownership .
The last time I check , the United States government does not own BP .
In fact , I would like to hear Mr. Fund explain how Barack Obama , the President of the United States , could nationalize a foreign corporation ?
It is not possible .
There are several things that Obama could do .
He can cancel BP ’s government contracts .
He can revoke all their drilling licenses , but he ca n’t nationalize them .
BP has nothing in common with the automobile bailout .
Neither GM nor Chrysler caused the biggest environmental disaster in US history .
The auto bailouts can be argued until the end of time , but it really stretching it to compare them to BP .
What Fund is truly upset about is that BP is being held accountable .
What he means by nationalization is not a government takeover , but government holding corporate America accountable .
The arrogance of the people , and news organizations , that are defending BP is mind blowing .
These people sincerely believe that BP should not be held accountable in any way for their negligence in the Gulf .
To put this in perspective , BP has over $ 1 trillion in unsold oil reserves .
I think they can afford to put a down payment of $ 20 billion in escrow for the victims .
By giving people like John Fund airtime , Fox News has proven once again that no Obama falsehood is too big , or too small to be advanced .
On his last full day of freedom before Army CID investigators took him into custody , 22 - year - old Bradley Manning pondered what would happen if his secret life as a self - described Wikileaks " hacktivist " were ever exposed .
" What would you do if your role [ with ] Wikileaks seemed in danger of being blown ? " was the question posed by ex-hacker Adrian Lamo , who 'd been chatting with Manning online for about five days .
" Try and figure out how I could get my side of the story out , before everything was twisted around to make me look like Nidal Hassan , " wrote back Manning .
Manning , an Army intelligence analyst at Forward Operating Base Hammer in Iraq , doubtless thought it was a hypothetical question .
But by that time , May 25 , the 29 - year - old Lamo had already tipped off FBI and Army investigators , and the former hacker was at that moment working to get more information for the government , which would result in Manning 's arrest the next day .
' I Can't Believe What I'm Confessing to You ' : The Wikileaks Chats
On May 21 , 22 - year - old Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning initiated a series of online chats with former hacker Adrian Lamo after a story on Lamo was published at Wired.com .
The chats continued over several days , during which Manning claimed that he was responsible for leaking classified material to the whistleblower site Wikileaks .
Lamo tipped off the FBI and the Army about Manning 's claims , and on May 26 , Manning was seized by Army authorities and put into pre-trial detention in Kuwait .
He remains in Kuwait while the Army Criminal Investigation Division and other agencies investigate whether he leaked classified information and determine if he should be charged with any crime .
Below are excerpts from the chat logs , which Lamo provided to Wired.com .
We have substituted the instant messenger screen names with real names .
The excerpts represent about 25 percent of the logs .
Portions of the chats that discuss deeply personal information about Manning or that reveal apparently sensitive military information are not included .

Manning is being held in pretrial detention in Kuwait , and has n't been able to defend himself publicly .
His lawyer has n't responded to e-mails from Wired.com .
But his own words to Lamo describe his transformation from dutiful soldier into a leaker .
From his chats , it 's clear that Manning was a deeply unhappy and conflicted man , and his personal problems may have combined with a growing cynicism over U.S. foreign policy .
But Manning isolated a key turning point in his regard for the military ; he said it was when he was ordered to look the other way in the face of an injustice .
Manning had been tasked with evaluating the arrest of 15 Iraqis rounded up by the Iraqi Federal Police for printing " anti Iraq " literature .
" The Iraqi federal police would n't cooperate with U.S. forces , so I was instructed to investigate the matter , find out who the ' bad guys ' were , and how significant this was for the FPs , " he wrote .
But when Manning had the literature translated , he discovered it was a scholarly critique of Iraq Prime Minister Al - Maliki titled Where Did the Money Go ? , he wrote .
The document was nothing more than a " benign political critique … following the corruption trail within the PM 's cabinet .
" I immediately took that information and ran to the [ U.S. Army ] officer to explain what was going on .
He did n't want to hear any of it .
He told me to shut up and explain how we could assist the FPs in finding MORE detainees . "
He continued .
" Everything started slipping after that .
I saw things differently .
I had always questioned the [ way ] things worked , and investigated to find the truth .
But that was a point where I was a part of something .
I was actively involved in something that I was completely against . "
The Defense Department declined to comment on anything Manning wrote in his chats .
" Any information that was discussed could likely be in the realm of classified information so I would n’t be able to go on the record about anything , " said spokesman Major Shawn Turner .
" I would be breaking the law myself if I talked about what could potentially be information from classified documents . "
Manning did n't say when the arrest of the detainees occurred , but at the time he began communicating with Lamo in late May , he said he'd been digging through classified military and government networks for more than a year .
In late 2009 he discovered the video of a 2007 U.S. Apache helicopter strike in Baghdad that killed two Reuters employees and an unarmed man who drove up to the scene afterward in a van and tried to rescue one of the wounded by pulling him into his vehicle .
The man 's two children were in the van and suffered serious injuries in the hail of gunfire .
" At first glance it was just a bunch of guys getting shot up by a helicopter , " Manning wrote of the video .
" No big deal … about two dozen more where that came from , right ?
But something struck me as odd with the van thing , and also the fact it was being stored in a JAG officer ’s directory .
So I looked into it . "
He found more information about the video and the people depicted in it .
" It was unreal , " he wrote Lamo .
" I mean , I 've identified bodies before .
It 's rare to do so , but usually it 's just some nobody .
It humanized the whole thing , re-sensitized me . "
In late January , while on leave in the United States , Manning visited a close friend in Boston and confessed he'd gotten his hands on unspecified sensitive information , and was weighing leaking it .
" He wanted to do the right thing , " 20 - year - old Tyler Watkins told Wired.com on Sunday .
" That was something I think he was struggling with . "
He leaked the video to Wikileaks in February , and it was published online by the organization April 5 under the title " Collateral Murder . "
Manning contacted Watkins to find out how it was being received in the United States and was concerned that his effort would have been for nothing .
He hoped that exposing the video would help prevent similar incidents from happening again .
He told Lamo that the public reaction to the video gave him " immense hope . "
" CNN 's iReport was overwhelmed , " he wrote .
" Twitter exploded .
People who saw , knew there was something wrong .
I want people to see the truth , regardless of who they are .
Because without information , you cannot make informed decisions as a public . "
Manning claimed in his chats with Lamo that he sent other data to Wikileaks , including a second video showing the notorious 2009 Garani air strike in Afghanistan – that Wikileaks has previously acknowledged is in its possession but has not yet published – and a database of 260,000 classified State Department diplomatic cables .
" I just could n't let these things stay inside of the system and inside of my head , " he wrote Lamo at one point about some of his leaks .
Ethan McCord , a soldier who was seen in the published Iraq video carrying the wounded children from the bombed out van told Wired.com in the wake of the release that he approved of its public exposure .
Manning added McCord as a friend on Facebook after he saw a TV interview with him , never revealing to his fellow soldier that he was behind the leak .
He marveled to Lamo about the six - degrees - of - separation nature of his connection to McCord .
" It 's almost bookworthy in itself , how this played .
Event occurs in 2007 , I watch video in 2009 with no context , do research , forward information to group of FOI activists , more research occurs , video is released in 2010 , those involved come forward to discuss event , I witness those involved coming forward to discuss publicly , even add them as friends on FB without them knowing who I am .
" They touch my life , I touch their life , they touch my life again ... full circle . "
" Life 's funny , " Lamo replied .
McCord told Wired.com this week that he thought Manning was a friend of a friend when he accepted his Facebook friend request , and never communicated with him .
When he saw Manning 's name in news stories earlier this week identifying Manning as the leaker , he thought the name sounded familiar and checked his Facebook account .
" It was just kind of shocking to see that , and know that this guy had friend requested me on Facebook , " he says .
He read through Manning 's Facebook page and saw someone who seemed overwhelmed with frustration .
" There 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's just angry , McCord said .
" There 's so many things that are like , wow , he 's in a dark place at the moment .
I do n't know if it was the Army or what . "
McCord says he still supports
Manning leaking the video and does n't think he should be punished for it , but was " a little distraught " over news that Manning might have released other sensitive information , such as the classified State Department cables .
" [ The video ] did n't show anything that was top secret or anything else like that , " he said .
" But if he was leaking secrets and stuff that could potentially take the lives of other soldiers or civilians , then I do n't stand behind that .…
There 's a thin line between responsibility and just being reckless and endangering . "
In early May , Manning was demoted from Specialist to Private First Class after punching a colleague in the face during an argument .
" Something I never do ...!? " he told Lamo .
" It was a minor incident , but it brought attention to me , " he said .
At this point , his life , which was already in turmoil , began to unravel as his career began to implode .
He told Lamo , " I 'm isolated as fuck .
My life is falling apart , and I do n't have anyone to talk to . "
He described being overwhelmed by personal issues and stresses that were quickly piling up .
He indicated he was " self - medicating like crazy " during his off - work hours .
" I had about three breakdowns , successively worse , each one revealing more and more of my uncertainty and emotional insecurity . "
Manning loved his job and told Lamo that he had received a number of award recommendations and commendations for work that led to " the disruption of ' Former Special Groups ' in the New Baghdad area . "
He had helped identify previously unknown enemy support zones and his analyses helped the Army identify and target insurgent leaders in the region .
Watkins , Manning 's friend , told Wired.com that Manning was very good at his job and struggled with the decision to leak the Iraq video .
" By doing that , he put his career in imminent danger , " Watkins said .
" He had put a lot of work and effort into doing his job well and is very good at what he did .
To do this , and to get caught , basically kills any chance of career advancement . …
It 's not something career - wise and personal - wise that you necessarily bounce back from . "
Manning told Lamo that he was n't so much afraid of getting caught and facing the consequences of his actions but " of being misunderstood , and never having the chance to live the life I wanted to . "
Looking beyond the Army , he hoped to get a job in graphics design , web development or even intelligence analysis or domestic and international politics .
But he also seemed to sense the unlikelihood of this if he were ever caught for leaking .
" I think I 'm in more potential heat than you ever were , " he wrote Lamo .
He said that Julian Assange had offered him a position at Wikileaks .
But he said , " I 'm not interested right now .
Too much excess baggage . "

And , since the great majority of flu deaths occur after being hospitalized for days up to weeks , it 's logical to review the treatment drugs and protocols and what is different between Canada and the U.S.
An exhaustive review by this writer reveals two clear suspects , the antiviral drugs called ribavirin and oseltamivir .
Since both countries promote flu vaccines , though declined by the large majority of citizens in both countries , and both exhibit similar flu rates , it is clear that Canada has essentially eliminated pediatric flu mortality , while something is terribly wrong in the U.S .
By comparison , during the same four - year time span starting the flu season of 2006 - 2007 , the identical U.S. pediatric group had 553 flu - associated deaths , with also the same proportion having severe preconditions , resulting in 138 deaths of those otherwise healthy .
Flu statistics are from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 's FluView .
Thus over the last four years Canada averaged but a single paediatric flu- associated death per year ( not having severe chronic health issues ) among its paediatric population of 7.86 million , Canada 's total population being 33 million ( Flu statistics are from The Public Health Agency of Canada 's Fluwatch website ) .
Importantly , this has taken place with 60 % ( or more ) of their paediatric group remaining unvaccinated .
Canada the last four years totaled sixteen " flu-associated " fatalities for their paediatric age category , defined as everybody under 18 , and this included all H1N1 and seasonal cases .
Three - quarters of these deaths had severe and chronic underlying health conditions , as did the mortality of a similar percentage of adults over 18 .
RIBAVIRIN
The first suspect is a dangerous chemotherapy drug , called ribavirin , that has been increasingly used over the last decade in the U.S. for hospitalized cases with flu and associated respiratory infections , particularly the syncytial respiratory virus ( RSV ) .
This chemotherapeutic drug has brand names of Virazole , Copegus , Rebetol , and was initially synthesized in the 1970's to investigate its use for cancer treatment when the War On Cancer investigated cancer - attacking therapies .
Though never used for cancer , ribavirin was found to have extensive in - vitro ( in the laboratory petri dish ) action in stopping replication of various viruses .
It is a nucleoside analogue and not only does it inhibit viruses , in human cells it takes the place of DNA chain links called guanine and adenosine .
When a human cell tries to divide by replicating its DNA for a new cell , ribavirin substitutes itself and very effectively stops the DNA replication , thus aborting the new cell ( and the parent cell dies also ) .
This is how chemotherapy typically works when used for cancer treatments , though ribavirin's exceptional cell - killing action takes place throughout the entire human body more than most .
For many decades , a frequent co-infection of flu found in both infants and elderly called respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) has been found in flu patients , and starting about a decade ago ribavirin became increasingly recommended for RSV by various authorities including Aetna Insurance , The American Heritage ® Stedman 's Medical Dictionary , the Second Edition , and Dorland 's Medical Dictionary for Health Care Consumers .
To this writer , there is no justification for these recommendations , but an example of one writer following another and never checking basic toxicity studies .
Pertinently , ribavirin is also known as the drug of choice ( given with interferon ) to treat Hepatitis C , again because of its antiviral properties .
But , this use is for short treatments as even ribavirin proponents acknowledge its many dangers , particularly dose - sensitive hemolytic anemia , hypoxia , and cardiac arrest via destruction of red blood cells .
Of the estimated 8,000 annual U.S. Hepatitis C deaths , many may be directly or in part from the treatment itself as this writer can testify with family experience in the matter .
As for ribavirin and RSV frequently associated with flu , health care professionals increasingly go to medical websites , and WrongDiagnosis.com is one of the world ’s leading providers of online medical health information ( they say so themselves ) .
According to WrongDiagnosis they are an independent , objective source of factual , mainstream health information for both consumers and health professionals .
Here is what WrongDiagnosis.com says about ribavirin for RSV :
" Among the goals of treatment are support of respiratory function , maintenance of fluid balance , and relief of symptoms .
Mild cases resolve without treatment .
Severe infections require hospitalization to provide supplemental oxygen , humidified air , and hydration by I.V. fluids .
Respiratory support using mechanical ventilation may be needed .
Ribavirin aerosol may be used in those who have severe RSV or are immunocompromised . "
However , here is what is found on WebMD , sponsored by the entity RxList :
" Deaths during or shortly after treatment with aerosolized Virazole have been reported in 20 cases of patients treated with Virazole ( 12 of these patients were being treated for RSV infections ) .
Several cases have been characterized as " possibly related " to Virazole by the treating physician ; these were in infants who experienced worsening respiratory status related to bronchospasm while being treated with the drug . "
So , American providers may employ ribavirin depending on their reference source and habit .
But , do Canadian doctors ever use ribavirin for RSV , flu- associated or not ?
A representative answer comes from the Province of British Columbia with their health site called HealthLinkBC ( their term " very rarely " basically means never ) :
" Ribavirin ( Virazole ) is an antiviral medicine that is very rarely used to treat people with RSV infections who have a high risk of developing complications .
Studies so far have provided conflicting evidence regarding its effectiveness .
The doctor will consider the particular circumstances of the person being treated before making a recommendation about ribavirin . "
The 2003 experience of doctors in the Canada Province of Ontario is telling , and their experience with ribavirin is crucial .
Canadian doctors in Toronto hospitals gave strong doses to virtually all patients during the 2003 SARS Panic that had seized the medical world .
SARS was defined as being mild pneumonia symptoms and having contact to SE Asia , initially thought caused by a mutated corona virus ( later disproven ) .
After experiencing quickly rising hospital deaths , and belatedly realizing hemolytic anemia symptoms were caused by ribavirin , Canada authorities blew the whistle and stopped its use , and deaths quickly fell off .
Not by coincidence , not a single American died of SARS and there was only a single death in all of Europe , as all respective health authorities declined the use of ribavirin .
All other SARS deaths ( but one in South Africa ) took place in SE Asia and China with extensive documentation of patients strongly dosed with ribavirin .
Even more telling , one Chinese Health District did not use ribavirin and had no mortality , while in contrast neighboring Districts using ribavirin recorded significant mortality .
The total SARS deaths were 43 in Canada , 1 in Europe , 1 in South Africa , and 738 in SE Asia and China .
Learning their lesson from SARS , Canada 's doctors have apparently taken it to heart , and it seems extremely unlikely their RSV treatments include the chemotherapy ribavirin , unlike apparent widespread use in the U.S.
Flu deaths in both Canada and the U.S. are almost all listed as flu- associated and one of these associations is RSV .
With Canada averaging but one pediatric flu - associated death a year ( of those previously healthy ) , they certainly are doing something right .
OSELTAMIVIR ( TAMIFLU )
The second questionable drug affiliated with U.S. pediatric flu death is oseltamivir , also known as Tamiflu , another antiviral drug effective in a petri dish against virus replication .
The petri dish is one thing , but its cellular toxicity in humans is another , and makes this writer question any legitimate use .
There is a wealth of evidence citing its dangers .
For instance , in 2007 Japan authorities banned Tamiflu after determining it was THE causal factor in teenager suicides , and in August , 2009 the UK's Telegraph news reported there were 400 cases of significant Tamiflu side effects as many panicked by the Swine ( H1N1 ) flu rushed to take the antiviral medicine .
Despite the U.S. CDC saying Tamiflu was marginally effective ( if at all ) when quickly used at onset of flu symptoms , medical records show it is inexplicably employed continuously until a patient is either discharged , or dies .
This is specifically documented in the MMWR weekly report of September 4 , 2009 with a chart of 36 pediatric deaths showing every death but one after a hospital stay ( involving at least an overnight admission to the ICU ) was in all likelihood continuously treated with oseltamivir or other antivirals at unspecified dosages .
( See : HERE . )
However , adult fatality case reports cite double - strength oseltamivir dosing , an ominous clue that suggests what may also be happening in pediatric patients .
FLU VACCINATIONS
Since flu has been convincingly demonstrated by Canada to be of minimal risk to kids , it makes sense to seriously question the safety and risks of flu vaccines .
Flu vaccinations are endlessly promoted and the U.S. CDC has for years designated the first week of December as National Flu Vaccination Week , with countless media promotions and the CDC press releases in the news .
However , news of Canada 's next - to - zero flu toll is unknown to the American public .
Also ignored by U.S. media ( and apparently by CDC ) is recent dramatic news from Australia .
Australia 's ABC News reported April 23 , 2010 that seasonal flu vaccines for young children had been deemed too dangerous with reactions greatly under- reported , and Australian doctors have now been warned not to give the seasonal flu vaccine to children under the age of five , after a child fell critically ill and dozens more suffered serious adverse reactions after receiving the vaccine in Western Australia , with The Australian Medical Association backing this move to suspend vaccinations in children under five around the entire country .
Canada 's paediatric group averaging a single flu - associated death per year the last four years strongly questions the sanity of promoting a mercury - laden flu vaccine jab that also brings many other toxic ingredients such as aluminum - compound adjuvants and many other alien substances into cellular contact of fragile developing neurological systems , particularly infants and kids as young as six months .
It is vital to note Canada ’s minimal flu toll takes place while many are actually declining the vaccine jab .
From the April 21 , 2010 Times Colonist in British Colombia comes " Only 40 per cent of B.C. 's population chose to be vaccinated against H1N1 , which meant roughly 2.5 million of the 4.3 million doses ordered by the province were not used , said Ida Chong , minister of healthy living and sport . "
Importantly , all of Canada ( except New Brunswick ) * called off the seasonal jab in lieu of the H1N1 jab , thus eliminating the role of multiple flu shots .
*( See HERE for a May 17 post by this writer on New Brunswick advocating both seasonal and H1N1 flu shots , resulting in much higher sickness rates ) .
So , Canadians by a wide margin refuse flu vaccines yet have but one flu - associated paediatric mortality a year , as close to zero as it gets .
From this writer 's perspective , the documented risks of flu vaccine can be dire and deadly , while the jab 's benefit is an illusion wrongly promoted by evidence also as strong as it gets .
To wit : the U.S. vaccine adverse event reaction system called VAERS from September 2009 to the present recorded 16,982 flu-vaccine reactions among all ages .
But this is just the tip of the iceberg , as experts have long stated at most 10 % adverse reactions are actually recorded in the VAERS database .
Canada 's doctors have figured out flu treatment and the hazards of the chemotherapy ribavirin by the School of Hard Knocks , while Australian doctors have blown the whistle about extreme flu vaccine dangers to their kids .
Meanwhile the U.S. public is kept in the dark , exhorted to take 6 - month old infants to be vaccinated , and further having them treated by medical protocols using pervasively deadly ribavirin created for cancer chemotherapy , and / or with copious doses of toxic Tamiflu .
How can U.S. Health Generals and mainstream media not notice Canada ’s weekly reports having identical record - keeping as the CDC ?
Or , pay attention to Australia ’s warning with their flu season preceding the U.S. ?
Or review and report objectively the unambiguous dangers of antiviral drugs ?
Instead , health officials are typified by their CDC spokeswoman nationally broadcast last October on National Public Radio stating “ mercury in flu vaccines poses absolutely no risk to infants and children " -- a statement that left me speechless then , as it does now .

The man who stole your old age : How Gordon Brown secretly imposed a ruinous tax that has wrecked the retirements of millions
Gordon Brown 's trusted lieutenants gathered round their leader in the plush penthouse suite of the Grosvenor House Hotel on London 's Park Lane .
Room service was kept busy and the alcohol flowed as the select handful of politicians and advisers surrounding the then Shadow Chancellor met regularly in the crucial weeks leading up to the General Election of May 1997 to plot the economic future of Britain .
One of the gang , the wealthy Labour MP and businessman Geoffrey Robinson , was picking up the tab but it was Brown who was calling the shots .
Meetings like this reflected how he liked to work - in absolute privacy and with the total loyalty of a tightly - knit group of like - minded associates .
Stand and deliver : Gordon Brown is the man who destroyed what was once the world 's best pension system
With the likes of the ambitious Ed Balls and the abrasive spin-doctor Charlie Whelan , these were ' blokey ' occasions , but between the political gossip and the talk about football , the serious issues they decided on would profoundly affect millions of British companies , investors and workers for years , even generations , to come .
The Brown cabal needed to find ways to raise extra tax revenues for the wide - ranging programme of reforms New Labour planned .
So , on one fateful night in that suite overlooking Hyde Park , they decided that , once in power , they would launch a massive multi-billion - pound raid on a gold - plated , copper - bottomed sector of the British economy - its pension funds .
Up until this point , company pension funds had enjoyed an important tax break on the financial investments they made in order to build up the capital from which employees could be paid when they retired .
By long tradition , the funds paid no tax on the dividends they received from those investments .
The view of Brown and his penthouse cronies was that this concession had to stop .
The tens of millions of people who paid into such corporate pension schemes - where employee contributions were , by and large , matched by their employer - were over - privileged , they argued .
Moreover , almost all company pension funds were in surplus - so much so that many employers had cut their contributions - and could easily take the hit of around £ 5 billion a year .
And , anyway , a buoyant stock market - at the time rising by an average of 15 per cent a year - would mitigate any potential loss .
It sounds like a dull technicality they were planning , one of those impenetrable Budget footnotes that pass most people by and for which the nit- picking , number - crunching Brown would become notorious over the coming years .
But the harsh reality of that decision over pizza and beer 13 years ago is that a generation of hard - working people , who had paid into pension schemes over many years and thought they had secured their futures , face an impoverished and uncertain old age .
Ed Balls ( left ) and Charlie Whelan ( right ) were also Brown 's trusted lieutenants
Worse still , the decision the Grosvenor gang made that night was kept secret .
Those meeting in the penthouse knew that what they proposed was an ideological bombshell .
New Labour had been assiduously reaching out to business and seeking to increase its electoral appeal to the middle class .
Abolishing tax credits flew right in the face of this .
Brown 's inner sanctum therefore resolved to keep their plan strictly to themselves .
The document detailing it was locked away in Robinson 's safe .
What Brown and co then implemented was nothing short of highway robbery .
It would betray the retirement dreams of millions of ordinary British people .
Back at the start of the 20th century , Britain led the world in pension arrangements , with the first state - run pension scheme to sustain people in their old age after their working lives were over .
But , in parallel , successive governments also recognised the importance of people being self - reliant , too , and offered tax relief to encourage employers to set up private occupational pension schemes and their employees to join them .
Here was one of the greatest social welfare developments of the century , a win - win situation for all involved .
For employers , these company pensions were a way of engendering loyalty among the workforce .
For employees , who paid a percentage of their wages into the pot , they were both a form of deferred salary earned through long service and a guarantee for the future .
For governments , the stronger the occupational schemes , the less funding they had to commit directly to state pensions .
From an economic point of view , the tens of billions of pounds saved within pension funds could be used as an investment tool to finance the requirements of industry .
There were inevitably wrinkles in the system and things that needed fixing , but , generally speaking , the state of British pensions in the lead - up to the 1997 General Election was healthy .
The occupational side was pretty much the envy of the world .
Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont marginally reduced the tax credit the pension funds claimed on dividend payments
Through the good years of rising company profits and rising share prices , the pension funds had prospered , thanks in part to the tax breaks they enjoyed .
Inevitably , covetous eyes were cast on this gold mine , first by a Tory chancellor , Norman Lamont .
Desperate to raise revenue in 1993 , he marginally reduced the tax credit the pension funds claimed on dividend payments .
At the time the measure was little noticed and produced only a mild reaction from the pensions industry .
Company pension funds continued in robust health .
But Lamont 's mini-raid left the door guarding pension funds slightly ajar - for Brown to come charging through four years later like a bull in a china shop .
The fact is that tinkering with pension calculations is a dangerous activity .
The future stability or otherwise of any fund depends on extremely complicated sums about the life expectancy of the scheme 's participants .
If these turn out to be even slightly out - of - kilter , then there is a danger that the scheme will run out of cash .
But in late 20th - century Britain , a fundamental shift was happening in those basic sums because more and more people were living longer .
What 's more , that longevity was going up by leaps and bounds rather than in small , slow increments , and there seemed no end to it .
A demographic time bomb was ticking away under all pension calculations .
Back in the Fifties , an employee retiring at 65 lived , on average , only another three or four years to draw his or her pension .
Now , that period of retirement is more likely to be 20 years or more , and rising indefinitely as scientists - and the pensions industry - realise that there is no notional biological ' maximum age ' beyond which the human race cannot go .
In tandem with this soaring life expectancy has been a fall in the birth rate .
One hundred years ago , when state pensions were introduced , there were 22 people working for every retired person .
By the end of this decade , the ratio will be 2:1 .
By 2025 , the number of over - 60s in Britain will pass the number of under - 25s for the first time .
All this has huge implications for pensions .
No policymaker has a crystal ball but it was obvious in the lead - up to the 1997 general election that pensions were going to be a critical issue in the years ahead .
Keeping the sector healthy would be a major challenge .
Occupational pensions , in particular , would have to be an ever more important component of the nation 's welfare system for old age , in order to ease the burden on the state .
Those New Labour economic planners in the hotel penthouse must have known all this , and they had a chance to fix it .
Inheriting a booming economy that would allow them to put ambitious plans into action , they were in an excellent position to make pensions fit for purpose in the new millennium .
But what followed was a shambles .
Arriving at the Treasury as Chancellor of the Exchequer the day after the election , a triumphant Brown took from the box of tricks he and his cabal had concocted his secret plan to rob the pension funds of their tax allowance .
He felt justified in doing so because , as he pointed out , Lamont and the Conservatives had already trimmed the relief in 1993 .
Just as importantly , he argued , most company pension funds were hugely in surplus and could well afford to surrender the concession .
He flourished a report from a private firm of accountants - commissioned and paid for by the wealthy Robinson out of his own pocket during those Grosvenor House days - which concluded the downside would be minimal .
Civil Service economists urgently set to work to establish if this was true .
But as they road - tested the plan and its consequences , they quickly found major holes in it .
Four separate papers by the best brains in the Treasury and the Inland Revenue disagreed with Brown 's judgment that the raid on the pension funds would cause little or no long - term harm .
All four papers were in no doubt that the value of pension funds would fall .
One predicted a drop of up to £ 75 billion in the overall private pension pot and resultant hardship for the eight million people in such schemes .
If the shortfall was to be made up , employers and employees would need to contribute an extra £ 10 billion a year for the next ten to 15 years .
In the end , those who would suffer most would be those not in a position to top up their pension contributions - namely , the lower - paid .
For Labour 's core voters , their chances of a comfortable retirement without money worries would be wrecked .
It is not clear whether officials actually advised that the policy be scrapped entirely or just shelved for further investigation , but there is absolutely no doubt that they told Brown he was playing roulette with Britain 's world - renowned system of occupational and private pensions .
He ignored them .
More than that , he went out of his way to conceal their doubts from public gaze .
It would be ten years before the documents were released showing Civil Service objections to the raid on pension dividends - and then only after a two - year campaign under Labour 's own Freedom of Information
Act forced them out into the open .
But , at the time , all Brown and his gang were concerned about was ' being able to get away with it without anyone complaining ' , as one observer put it .
They were hooked on the idea that occupational pensions were too generous to corporate Britain .
They refused to recognise the obvious truth that if the system was weakened , the burden of pensions would fall back on the state .
It 's perhaps not surprising that Brown 's plans were hatched and tested in extraordinary secrecy .
It 's how he works .
But what is astonishing is that Blair was among those kept in the dark .
Even when the new prime minister was finally made aware of the pensions proposal , he seems not to have been told the full extent of officials ' doubts .
Then , when a civil servant warned him that the costs of Brown 's plans could be ' enormous ' and the consequences ' unsolvable ' , he took no action .
It was an early sign of the dangers caused by their fractured relationship - of Brown 's stubborn determination to do his own thing regardless of Number 10 and of Blair 's unwillingness to confront him , even when the livelihoods of millions of people were put at risk .
In his first Budget speech two months after the election , Brown sold the raid on the pension funds as part of a dynamic package to modernise and streamline the corporate tax system and encourage companies to invest in growth .
In reality , it was no such thing .
The primary motive - as Robinson , who had been in on those penthouse discussions , was later to confirm in his memoirs - was nothing to do with stimulating the economy .
It was to raise extra revenue of £ 5 billion a year for the incoming government to spend without being seen to be raising taxes , pure and simple .
It was a stealth tax .
But so clever was the deception that few immediately grasped the significance .
Conservative critics were silenced by the argument that their party had been the first down this particular road - though there was a big difference between reducing tax credits on dividends , as Lamont had done , and abolishing them entirely .
The City and investment community were muted in their response , in part because the implications took a while to absorb , in part because they were unwilling to make an enemy of a new and obviously powerful chancellor .
Robert Maxwell embezzled £ 400 m from the Mirror pension fund
The Press , right and left , was too enthralled with the reforming zeal of the new regime after 18 years of Conservative rule to make a serious issue of such a recherche matter as retirement provision , which was difficult to understand and explain .
Specialists , however , quickly grasped what was going on .
The National Association of Pension Funds was horrified and estimated the cost to employers of keeping their pension funds topped up would be at least £ 50 billion over the next decade .
' Even Robert Maxwell [ the tycoon who embezzled the Mirror pension fund ] took only £ 400 million , ' it declared sarcastically .
There was an inherent flaw in Brown 's strategy - it was predicated on the dangerous belief that the economy would continue to improve and the stock market continue to grow in value .
It made no allowance for the economy hitting choppy waters , let alone a credit crunch , a recession and a collapse in share prices not unlike the Great Crash of 1929 .
The insane belief that share prices always rise ( because they had in the recent past ) contributed to Brown and his sidekicks ignoring Treasury advice in 1997 .
It was an appalling misjudgment .
Had it not been for that fateful decision in Brown 's first Budget , pension funds might well have been able to weather these storms .
But the reality was that they were not equipped to absorb the loss of between £ 5 billion and £ 6 billion a year in tax - free dividend income .
Nor was this just a straight loss each year but one with serious knock - on effects .
In 2005 , one leading industry expert I spoke to calculated the cumulative cost over that first Labour decade to the pensions industry at a staggering £ 100 billion - which would have been sufficient to meet all the challenges of longer life expectancy and a weak stock market .
Well , he would say that , you might think .
But , far from being an exaggeration , his figures turned out to be an under -estimate .
In January 2009 , the Office of National Statistics calculated that the black hole in Britain 's occupational schemes had reached an astonishing £ 194.5 billion .
The thoroughly spurious claims by Brown and those around him that corporate funds were rich enough to take the punishment proved complacent in the extreme .
In a mere ten years , New Labour reduced almost a century of secure retirement to rubble .
The 1997 dividend tax - heist turned the nation 's previously wealthy private - sector occupational pensions system into a basket case and a headache for almost every company in Britain , including the richest and most profitable , such as oil giant BP .
But worse , by making shares less attractive for pension funds to hold , it also did irreparable damage to the stock market .
It tore the underpinnings from investment in shares , diminished returns and decimated the nation 's savings .
Brown 's ill - conceived policy - implemented against the best advice and without proper consultation - proved a disaster .
It was a far more important factor in the ruination of the nation 's pension system than changes in mortality assumptions .
Had the dividend tax credit remained intact , the retirement crisis which Britain now faces would never have happened .
That crisis has far - reaching implications and impacts on many fronts , even causing potholes in our roads to be left unfilled and dustbins un-emptied .
Because of shortfalls , masses more cash has had to be pumped into local authority pension schemes .
Unlike most public sector pension funds - which are directly paid for by the taxpayer - local authority schemes generally operate on the same basis as private sector plans with the employers and employees making contributions .
They too have been badly hurt by the pensions tax raid and its impact on investment returns .
A quarter of the council tax we pay now goes on pension payments rather than ensuring that the roads are repaired and the rubbish collected .
That crisis also meant that the amount paid out in social security benefits shot up .
The collapse in occupational pensions for those on low incomes means the Government is having to shell out more in hardship payments to the elderly through the Pension Credit system .
But the biggest impact is being felt by those who were in final - salary defined - benefit pension schemes in the private sector .
These were once the commonest form of pension and the safest , guaranteeing an employee a fixed proportion of his or her final salary at retirement depending on years of service .
The black hole in these schemes is now so large that most companies can no longer afford them .
One by one , these final salary schemes were to be closed - even in Britain 's greatest companies .
More and more firms are opting for ' money purchase ' schemes where an individual builds up a pension pot , the income from which is subject to the vagaries of the stock market .
The depressing statistics speak for themselves .
In 1995 , before the pensions tax credit was removed , nearly five million people were in open final - salary pension schemes .
By 2000 , this number had fallen to just over four million and by the end of 2008 to less than a million .
In 1997 , 90 per cent of private - sector occupational pensions were final salary .
A decade later , two - thirds of these had been closed to new members .
Because pensions seem so technical , it can be difficult to appreciate what a switch from one type to another actually means in practical terms .
In fact , everything changes if you are moved from a final - salary , or defined - benefit , scheme to a defined contribution one .
The guarantee of a pension based on a fixed percentage of your salary disappears .
In essence , the element of risk passes from the employer to the employee .
A robust pensions system is replaced by one that is far less durable because payouts largely depend on the performance of the trustees and their advisers as managers of investment funds .
The result is that , however much they have saved for their old age and however responsible they have been , those people unlucky enough to retire during a downturn in financial markets will see their expected pensions substantially reduced .
Back in 1997 , Brown was warned unequivocally by Treasury officials that this would happen - that his pensions ' raid would encourage firms to end final salary schemes .
But he went ahead regardless - Five years later , the leading audit firm Ernst & Young informed the 2,000 members of its £ 410 million final - salary pension scheme that it was being closed and they would be transferred into a money - purchase scheme .
This was a first .
Until then , there had been lots of cases of final - salary schemes being closed to new members but never for existing ones .
Now the Rubicon was crossed .
Shortly afterwards the struggling food retailer Iceland revealed similar plans .
I criticised this development in my Daily Mail column , but the trend was unmistakable and unstoppable .
In 2005 , Rentokil Initial became the first FTSE 100 company to shut its final salary scheme to existing employees .
The next year , Harrods did the same , followed by Debenhams .
By 2008 , final - salary schemes were nearly dead as one after another closed .
The following year , Barclays bank brought its to an end for its 18,000 members .
Staff were told the scheme had moved from a surplus of £ 200 million to a deficit of £ 2.2 billion in a year .
BP , the nation 's richest company , had boasted one of the UK's best occupational pension plans with a largely non-contributory final - salary plan covering more than 69,000 people .
In June 2009 it revealed that new employees would pay between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of their salaries into a new money - purchase scheme .
In January 2010 , Alliance Boots , owners of Boots the Chemist , closed its final - salary pension scheme to some 15,000 employees who had been paying into the plan for decades .
This was despite the fact that the Boots scheme had been one of the first to take defensive action after the Brown tax raid , by reinvesting its portfolio in government stocks to protect itself from future stock - market unpredictability .
The worry about stock - market turbulence , it need hardly be repeated , was one of the main reasons why Brown was counselled against abolishing the dividend tax credit .
For some companies , problematic pension funds became the tail wagging the dog .
Among those struggling with vast legacy deficits were British Airways , British Telecom and the government - owned Royal Mail .
In each of these cases , the pension fund deficit has overshadowed almost everything else these companies do .
The £ 3bn black hole at BA came close to derailing its recent merger with Spain 's national carrier Iberia , which insisted that it be hived off into a separate entity where it could not contaminate the merged airline .
The stellar performance of BT , in the new digital age , is constantly overshadowed by the £ 10 bn - plus black hole in its pension fund .
The never - ending rise in postal charges and the constant deterioration of service can partly be attributed to the management 's struggle to keep the company 's pensions promises .
Far from improving the financial situation of British industry and encouraging new investment , as Brown and his colleagues claimed would happen , plugging the holes in occupational pensions was starting to take priority over all else .
The Grosvenor House gang continued to deny responsibility for this state of affairs .
They maintained that the pressure on pensions was down to the fall in the stock markets and the fact that people were living longer .
They also claimed companies were at fault for under - funding their pension schemes .
Everything and everyone was to blame , in other words , except New Labour policy .
But others have no doubt who was the architect of this disaster .
' Irresponsible government ' , declared economist Ros Altmann , by a man who ' just ignores what he does n't want to hear , then tries to cover up the consequences and hide it from everybody ' .
Gordon Brown decided pension funds were a ripe target and knowingly destroyed what was once one of the great pension systems in the world .
Eleven million people with company pensions and a further seven million with personal pensions were affected by the sleight of hand dreamt up in that posh Park Lane penthouse .
Not everyone would suffer , however .
Because - as we will see in the next installment - when it came to pensions , the Labour government made sure that one favoured sector of society would be feather - bedded against the downturn , whatever the cost to the rest of us .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- A European Parliament delegation visit to Washington revealed a split within Europe over whether each country would support implementing the so - called " Volcker rule , " a legislative proposal on Capitol Hill that would bar big commercial banks from making speculative proprietary derivatives and stock investments for their own accounts .
" Proprietary trading would be a question for the larger institutions .
We are not currently , to my knowledge , trying to ban that , " said Wolf Klinz , chairman of the European Parliament 's special committee on the financial , economic and social crisis .
The Volcker rule proposal -- named after ex-Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker , who chairs President Barack Obama 's economic - advisory panel -- would also cap the size of big banks and force financial institutions to divest hedge funds and private - equity units .
However , Kay Swinburne , a member of the panel from the United Kingdom , said the U.K. backs some version of the Volcker rule .
" With regards to proprietary trading , they [ U.K. ] are one area of Europe who believe the Volcker rule makes some sense , " added Swinburne .
" I do n't think it will be a complete separation , but the direction the U.K. is heading is looking at separately capitalizing proprietary - trading desks and pricing in risk .
The U.K. believes strongly that the proprietary traders need to have some more light shed on them . "
Swinburne also said that it was possible a recommendation on the Volcker rule could be done through capital - requirement directives from the European Union , but that Britain was not going to wait for " the rest of the world to catch up . "
A provision in the Volcker rule that would require big banks to divest private - equity and hedge - fund divisions is not relevant for most of Europe , according to Klinz .
" Some banks have very small private - equity arms , but it is negligible , I would say , " he said .
It 's unclear how strong the Volcker rule itself will be in the United States when lawmakers on Capitol Hill complete their work on sweeping bank reform later this month .
So far , a House bank - reform bill only permits bank regulators to impose these restrictions at their own volition .
The Senate bill , for its part , is slightly tougher and requires bank regulators to conduct a study on the Volcker rule and follow its recommendations .
As members from both chambers reconcile the two versions , a tougher Volcker - rule provision introduced by Carl Levin , the Democratic senator from Michigan , could still be in play .
One possible scenario : Bring it in to replace another controversial measure in the bill that requires big banks to spin off swaps desks into well - capitalized affiliates .
Global bank tax is dead
Swinburne said the United Kingdom will press ahead with plans to impose a new tax on banks even after G - 20 finance ministers dropped plans for a worldwide levy after a meeting in Busan , South Korea over the weekend .
" It became quite clear over the weekend that , the U.K. , if they can find a method of implementing , would go ahead with a banking levy regardless of whether everyone else moved with them .
They felt it important to the stability of their banking system , " she commented .
Finance ministers at the meeting in Busan scrapped the plan in the face of opposition from Canada , which did not bail out its banks during the financial crisis , as well as Japan and China .
Europe 's Klinz said that it seemed very unlikely that the G - 20 countries could agree on a common approach , but added that the continent could still work out some sort of tax .
" We know from G - 20 meeting that there will not be a G - 20 common approach , most likely .
In Europe , the position is still very much in favor setting up a fund to make financial sector pay in case of another financial crisis , and also to pay a tax on financial transactions . "
With a number of women ’s sports leagues , we often do n’t think about women competing directly against men in the sports world .
However , it has happened in the past , and it continues to happen today .
Women coach men ’s sports teams at the school level , and there are women in sports management positions .
And , while we do n’t see too many women competing directly against men , it does happen .
Here are 20 inspirational female athletes who have held their own going up against men :
Up to and Including 1950
Women made solid strides in the sports world prior to 1950 .
Determined to get beyond the stigma against women in sports , and determined to pave the way for women ’s rights in all areas of life , these female athletes showed what they were made of .
May Kaarlus :
While there had been women billiard players in the past , the sport was mostly regarded as a male past - time .
Kaarlus , though , took it a step further and is considered the first woman to specialize in trick shots .
In 1901 , she amazes New York City , performing billiards trick shots that her male counterparts fail to master .
At 16 , the ambidextrous Kaarlus is a sensation in a sport that , for years after becoming popular in 15th Century France , barred women from using a regular cue .
Madge Syers :
It seems a foreign concept to us now , but in the early 1900s , professional figure skating was dominated by men .
In fact , it never occurred to anyone that a woman would enter a figure skating championship — until Madge Syers did so in 1902 .
Since the rulebook did n’t specify gender , Syers entered the World Championships and won a silver medal .
However , many thought she should have won gold , and there are reports that Ulrich Salchow , who was presented with gold , gave her his medal .
The International Skating Union immediately changed the rules to ban women from competing against men after this upset , and eventually set up a venue for women to compete against each other .
Lula Olive Gill :
The first woman jockey to win a horse race in California showed that it was possible to race and win .
At the time , in 1906 , few women were jockeys , and they raced against men .
Lula Olive
Gill won a horse race , and later that same year , Ada Evans Dean rode her own horse to victory after her jockey had become ill .
Indeed , Dean won twice — in spite of never having raced before .
Eleanora Sears :
This great - great granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson was an all - around athlete .
While she was most well - known for her prominence in women ’s tennis and women ’s squash , Eleanora Sears shocked her high society neighbors by participating in — and excelling at — sports considered the province of men .
She played in trousers on a men ’s polo team , and skippered a yacht that beat Alfred Vanderbilt ’s yacht .
She also participated in speedboat racing and football .
Gertrude Ederle : Just as women were being recognized as swimmers , Gertrude Ederle decided to swim the English Channel .
She had already won medals for women ’s swimming in the Olympics , and beat out men and women at other swimming events .
When she crossed the English Channel , only five men had done it before her .
Ederle not only swam the Channel , but beat the fastest male swimmer by nearly two hours .
A couple of weeks later , when Mrs. Clemington Corson swam the English Channel , she also beat the best male time , even though she did n’t swim it faster than Ederle .
Jackie Mitchell :
There were a few women in professional baseball , mostly in the minor leagues , in the early part of the 20th century .
One of these was Virne Beatrice “ Jackie ” Mitchell Gilbert .
She was a pitcher , and played for the Chattanooga Lookouts .
When this minor league team played an exhibition against the New York Yankees , Mitchell struck out Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth .
After this , Mitchell ’s contract was voided ( baseball being “ too strenuous ” for women ) and the commissioner instituted a ban against women in professional baseball that lasted until 1992 .
Conchita Cintrón : Bull fighting has long been considered a male sport .
However , in 1937 Conchita Cintrón began bull fighting at the age of 13 .
She fought for 13 years , and slew 800 bulls .
She did as well — or better — than many of the men , and is considered the first woman to compete at a high level as a professional bull fighter .
Joan Pflueger : Trap shooting was considered a mostly male sport , and Joan Pflueger often shot against men .
One of her biggest feats was winning the Champion of Champions event against an all - male field when she was 18 .
She also won numerous honors in women ’s shooting events .
She has been inducted into the Florida Trapshooting Hall of Fame , and is remembered as one of the best trapshooters ever , male or female .
Sally Stearns :
The first female coxswain in a male boat in the male - dominated sport of rowing was Sally Stearns , of Rollins College .
With Stearns as coxswain , the team won some crew races , and initially , they disguised her as a boy .
Her presence was a shock to some , when it was revealed , but there have been female coxswains in male boats since .
After 1950
Since the middle of the 20th century , women have continued to try and compete directly against men .
It remains an uphill battle , but there are some solid and inspirational female athletes continuing to blaze the trail .
Planting of new trees has fallen to its lowest level in more than three decades across Britain , leading conservationists said yesterday .
Efforts to replace woodland in the United Kingdom , once so densely forested that trees which have sustained human populations for 6,000 years covered 90 per cent of the land mass , have slowed dramatically in the past six years , falling from 12,000 hectares of newly - planted woods in 2004 to just 5,000 hectares last year .
Britain is one of the least wooded countries in Europe , with half the average tree cover , and half of its ancient woodland lost since the 1930s .
It is a worrying development at a time when reforestation is a priority to offset the effects of climate change .
Figures released by the Forestry Commission , the Government body in charge of managing Britain 's woodlands , show that 2.85 million hectares of land in the UK is covered by woods – equivalent to 12 per cent of the total land area .
According to the Commission , the figure represents an increase in woodland of 0.2 per cent since 2002 .
But conservationists challenged the statistics , saying they failed to take into account factors including a huge loss of hedgerow trees and swathes of woodland cut down to make way for wind farms and developers .
This means that far from increasing the amount of tree cover in Britain , it is actually likely to be falling .
The Woodland Trust , Britain 's leading woodland conservation charity , said there had already been a loss of 9,000 hectares of tree cover in England between 1999 and 2008 .
The charity called on the Government to reverse the falling trend in new tree planting , which has dropped from a peak of 28,300 hectares in 1976 to less than a fifth of that level .
Sue Holden , the trust 's chief executive , said : " There figures are truly worrying but should be seen as a clarion call to us all to reverse the downward trend as a matter of urgency .
Woods and trees are not a luxury but essential for our future quality of life .
" We are concerned that with planting rates so low , the result may be a loss of woodland cover , at a time when increasing it is essential .
There is an urgent need to compensate for these losses with large - scale woodland creation elsewhere . "
Despite efforts by the Forestry Commission and private landowners to bolster planting , with the vast majority of new planting using wildlife - friendly broadleaf rather than coniferous species , the conservationists argue that four main factors have obstructed the programme to expand Britain 's woodlands .
These are : pressure to build new housing ; demand for windfarms ; moves to fell woodland to create open habitat to increase biodiversity ; and the reshaping of forests in the landscape .
For example , in Snowdonia , 3,500 acres of forest has been earmarked for felling to make way for wind turbines , while the Trust says that some 800 woods equivalent to the size of Birmingham have been under threat from developers in the last decade .
The problem is compounded , according to the trust , by a devastating loss of mature trees outside woodlands in locations such a hedgerows or fields .
In England alone , there has been a 64 per cent decline in " individual " trees .
The Forestry Commission said it accepted there had been a decline in tree planting , but says it has plans which will see 100,000 hectares of new woodland planted in Wales by 2030 and 50,000 hectares planted in Scotland by 2015 .
Federal officials have removed the management team overseeing a national database of dangerous or incompetent caregivers after questions were raised about its accuracy .
The reassignments of the division director and four managers came in response to a joint ProPublica - Los Angeles Times story last month that found the repository was probably missing thousands of serious disciplinary cases against health providers .
Congress ordered up the database more than 20 years ago .
It was supposed to provide an alert system for hospitals , flagging them to disciplinary actions taken in any state against nurses , therapists , pharmacists and other licensed health professionals .
It finally became available to hospitals Monday .
But it comes with a warning : Federal officials are “ currently reviewing the completeness and accuracy of state licensure information . ”

The Health Resources and Services Administration ( HRSA ) declined Monday to comment on the personnel changes .
But in an internal e-mail sent last week , Mark S. Pincus , the newly named acting director of the Division of Practitioner Data Banks , confirmed the reassignments .
Pincus had previously led the program from 2004 to 2007 .
Pincus replaces Darryl A. Gray , who told reporters last month that his staff “ constantly ” monitored state regulators ’ websites to ensure the federal database was complete .
Gray did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment Monday .
ProPublica ’s own review found that at least 20 states , including California , failed to adequately report the sanctions they took as required by federal law .

After reviewing these findings , Mary Wakefield , HRSA ’s administrator , conceded the database was incomplete .
She ordered an audit , offered technical assistance to states and sent letters to every governor requesting their help .
In the letters , she wrote that agencies that did not report disciplinary actions to the database would be publicized .
State officials say they are taking steps to ensure their records are complete .
Many said the federal government had never questioned them about their missing records .
In California , for example , the executive officers of the agencies overseeing psychiatric technicians and occupational therapists had n’t reported any disciplinary actions .
In the last two years , dozens of psych techs had their licenses restricted or taken away after serious misconduct .
Both agencies said they plan to report in the future .

Hospitals began using the National Practitioner Data Bank in 1990 to research doctors and dentists .
But a series of problems delayed its expansion to other health providers until now .
On Monday , hospitals were finally able to access data on about 280,000 nurses and other practitioners who have been disciplined by states .
Federal officials are still assessing how many more will be added once the gaps are filled .
The database is not open to the public .

Google ’s ( s goog ) Chrome browser continues to gain market share as Microsoft ’s ( s msft ) Internet Explorer continues to decline —
Firefox ’s share , meanwhile , remains largely unchanged , according to the most recent surveys of browser usage .
StatCounter said that in May , usage of IE 6 fell below the 5 percent mark in the U.S. and Europe for the first time , with overall usage of Internet Explorer at around 53 percent , while Firefox remained relatively flat at about 31 percent .
Chrome ’s share rose to 8.6 percent from the 6 percent mark at the beginning of the year .
Results from NetMarketShare show a similar trend , although slightly different overall numbers : the research firm has IE dropping to below 60 percent from 67 percent ( StatCounter shows the browser at 52.7 percent overall ) and Firefox at the 24 percent mark , up 2 percent from the same period last year .
NetMarketShare has Chrome ’s usage at 7 percent in May , up from just 3 percent a year ago .
Web traffic company GetClicky , meanwhile , shows Internet Explorer ’s market share at just over 50 percent at the end of May , while Firefox stood at 32 percent .
The firm ’s usage logs put Chrome at close to 10 percent market share .
As Om recently noted , the Mozilla browser continues to have a substantial position , and does n’t appear to be losing much share to Chrome .
However , it does n’t appear to be gaining much either , and the Google browser is gaining ground rapidly ( albeit from a much smaller user base ) .
Whether Firefox — which used to be the “ cool ” upstart browser — can regain some of its lost momentum remains to be seen .

After a stuttering start , the big day has arrived for England 's World Cup hopes .
Many fans were left scratching their heads following Friday 's dreary 0 - 0 draw against Algeria which leaves their team facing the unthinkable - early elimination from the World Cup .
However , there is hope .
England 's destiny is in their own hands ahead of their final Group C match against Slovenia at Port Elizabeth on Wednesday at 1500 BST .
BBC
Sport takes a look at the permutations ahead of England 's vital match and the equally - important game between the USA and Algeria in Pretoria .
ENGLAND BEAT SLOVENIA , USA DRAW OR LOSE AGAINST ALGERIA
The dour performance against Algeria is forgotten and a nation rejoices ( or something like that ) as England keep their World Cup hopes alive .
England would qualify as Group C winners with five points and secure a meeting with the runners - up from Group D ( possibly Germany ) .
If USA draw , Slovenia advance as runners - up .
If USA lose , goal difference would determine whether Slovenia ( currently +1 ) or Algeria ( - 1 ) go through in second place .
ENGLAND BEAT SLOVENIA , USA BEAT ALGERIA Fabio Capello can breathe easily in this instance too as England book their place in the last 16 .
England and USA would finish level on five points and goal difference would determine who progresses as Group C winners .
If goal difference remains level , as is the case at the moment , goals scored ( currently England 1 , USA 3 ) would decide who finishes top .
ENGLAND DRAW , USA DRAW
In this scenario , England need a high scoring draw on Wednesday .
Slovenia would go through as group winners , with England and USA finishing level on three points .
Goals scored would decide who progresses .
There is the possibility for drama even greater than that of a penalty shoot - out - if both sides are totally even then lots will be drawn to decide who goes through and who is out .
ENGLAND DRAW , USA WIN OR LOSE England head for the departures gate and will probably not take much solace from the fact that they will be unbeaten and be home in time to watch the tennis at Wimbledon .
Should USA win then they would finish level with Slovenia on five points and progress , should Bob Bradley 's men lose then Algeria , with four points , would take the runners - up spot .
ENGLAND LOSE Doomsday .
England are eliminated and finish the group with two points .
The post - mortem begins .

Advertisement World Cup organisers say they will not ban vuvuzelas from stadiums in South Africa , despite numerous complaints .
The sound of the plastic horn has been likened to the drone of a thousand bees or a herd of stampeding elephants .
Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo says the noise affects player concentration , while some fans watching on television claim they cannot hear the commentary .
But a World Cup spokesman insisted vuvuzelas are " ingrained in the history of South Africa " and will remain .
Rich Mkhondo also said vuvuzelas had worldwide appeal .
" Let us not make this a South Africa instrument alone , " he said .
" A vuvuzela is now an international instrument .
People buy them and stuff them in their suitcase to go home .
" Only a minority are against vuvuzelas .
You either love them or hate .
We in South Africa love them . "
England defender Jamie Carragher said the noise did not bother him when he came on as a half - time substitute during the 1 - 1 draw with the United States and he said he had already bought two to take home to his children in Liverpool .
I have always said that Africa has a different rhythm , a different sound
Fifa president Sepp Blatter " When I came on I did n't notice it too much .
I think you notice it more when you are watching on TV , " he said .
" But my kids have been on the phone and asked for two so I 'll have to take two home for them .
I 've got two in my bag already .
" Anyone who watches me play at Anfield will know that I am louder than the vuvuzelas ! "
Fifa president Sepp Blatter also weighed into the debate and believes vuvuzelas are part and parcel of football in South Africa .
" I have always said that Africa has a different rhythm , a different sound , " he commented on social networking site Twitter .
" I do n't see banning the music traditions of fans in their own country .
Would you want to see a ban on the fan traditions in your country ? "
A recent survey found that the sound emitted by a vuvuzela was the equivalent to 127 decibels - louder than a drum's 122 decibels or a referee 's whistle at 121.8 decibels .

Portugal star Ronaldo is the latest World Cup star to voice unease about the instrument .
" It is difficult for anyone on the pitch to concentrate , " said the Real Madrid forward .
" A lot of players do n't like them but they are going to have to get used to them . "
France captain Patrice Evra blamed the noise generated by the vuvuzelas for his side 's poor showing in their opening group game against Uruguay , which finished goalless .
He added : " We can't sleep at night because of the vuvuzelas .
People start playing them from 6 am .
" We can't hear one another out on the pitch because of them . "
Backing for the under - fire vuvuzela has come from the England Supporters ' Band , which has not missed an England game - home or away - since 1996 .
Trumpeter John Hemmingham , who is leading an eight - man team in South Africa , said the plastic instruments were part of the local culture and should not be banned from stadiums .
606 : DEBATE
I 'm all for them - let South Africa host the tournament in their own inimitable style
BBC Sport 's Peter Scrivener
" It 's the way the South Africans express their joy and pleasure at the tournament being here , " said Hemmingham .
" It 's certainly a challenge for us but there 's no point whinging about it . "
Some people have complained the noise from the vuvuzelas has stopped fans from generating chants around the ground .
But Hemmingham , who was at Saturday 's game between England and the United States in Rustenburg , revealed : " We did n't have any problem .
" The fans around us were all singing along and a lot of our fans were joining in with us using their vuvuzelas .
It all added to the atmosphere .
" There was definitely a different vibe about the place - the South Africans are loving it - and when in Rome , you just have to go along with it .
" I bet there is not a single South African player complaining about the vuvuzela .
They see it as more than just a noise , it 's about the whole spirit of the thing . "

Diego Stocco forged a niche for himself in the music world by creating sounds using custom - made instruments and unusual sources .
His sonic palette includes sounds culled from sources as simple as sand and as drastic as a burning piano .
The hybrid instruments Stocco concocts , like the Experibass , generally involve sawing common musical instruments in half and attaching them to other instruments or less - conventional objects .
Film composers use Stocco ’s sought - after sounds — which are delivered in a multisample format or in loops — in their scores , earning the Italian - born experimentalist a full page of credits as “ music sound designer ” on IMDb .
For Guy Ritchie ’s recent production of Sherlock Holmes , he was credited as “ featured soloist , ” because composer Hans Zimmer hired Stocco , who moved to Los Angeles in 2007 , to perform parts on his Experibass .
These videos were made using pictures and video Stocco took during recording sessions .
He composed the songs entirely from sounds created in each sound - design session .
The text that accompanies the videos comes straight from Stocco .
Above :
Bassoforte ( Wired.com Exclusive )
“ A few days ago , I started thinking about how I could repurpose the keyboard of the dismantled piano I keep in the garden , so I thought to build a new instrument by combining it with some other parts I had lying around .
I ended up with this mechanical hybrid thing I thought to call “ bassoforte . ”
“ The neck is from a broken electric bass , the bridge is a door handle , the pickups are from a guitar , and the part at the top where the strings are attached is a chimney cap , which works as a resonator as well as adding a percussive sound .
“ The track I created is a tribute to my dad , who is a big fan of Western comic books and spaghetti Western films ( and because of him , I am too ) . ” — Diego Stocco
The Burning Piano
“ I sampled sounds and noises while the piano was burning .
Since I only had one take , I recorded as much material as possible .
“ Initially I was pointing the gas - flame lighter directly at the strings , and I was playing single notes , but eventually the fire started to burn the hammers and other parts of the piano , and at that point the strings were exploding because of the temperature .
Later during the day , I moved the piano and recorded additional sounds with the rest of the burned strings . ”
— Diego Stocco
Music From Sand
“ I had some sandbags in the backyard that I used in November during a rainy day .
I was moving them to a different spot when I heard the noise of the sand .
I thought that maybe I could try a new sound - design technique , so I bought some piezo - film transducers and started to experiment with them .
“ The entire track is created only out of tuned sand tones — no additional sounds or waveforms .
I emphasized the inner notes of the sand grains and mapped them on a sampler as a series of instruments .
The grooves are all played live with various techniques , including taping two piezo films to my fingers . ”
— Diego Stocco
Experibass
“ While visiting a luthier a few weeks ago looking for parts , I had an idea in mind for an instrument I wanted to build .
My curiosity was to hear the sound of violin , viola and cello strings amplified through the body of a double bass .
I came up with a quadruple - neck experimental somethingthat I thought to call “ experibass . ”
“ To play it , I used cello and double bass bows , a little device I built with fishing line and hose clamps , a paintbrush , a fork , spoons , a kick - drum pedal and a drum stick . ”
— Diego Stocco
Music From a Bonsai
“ I always liked bonsai trees .
I was curious to try the approach I used for “ Music From a Tree ” on a smaller scale , so I bought a bonsai and recorded this little experimental piece .
“ To determine the key , I used the lowest note I could play and recorded the rest around it .
Besides playing the leaves , I used bows of different sizes , a piano hammer and a paintbrush .
As far as microphones go , I used my Røde NT6 , a customized stethoscope and tiny MEAS piezo transducers .
“ I played all the sounds and rhythms only with the bonsai .
I did n’t use any synthesizer or samplers to create or modify the sounds . ”
— Diego Stocco
Dissonant Echoes
“ A short , abstract piece created during one of the sessions I did for an upcoming project .
I used an old dismantled piano , antique zithers collected in the past few months and metallic wind chimes .
Played with piano hammers and a dulcimer bow . ” — Diego Stocco

The flints date to a time when no humans were thought to be in Britain
Archaeologists have found what they say is the earliest evidence of Neanderthals living in Britain .
Two pieces of flint unearthed at motorway works in Dartford , Kent , have now been dated to 110,000 years ago .
The finds push back the presence of Neanderthals in Britain by 40,000 years or more , said Dr Francis Wenban - Smith , from Southampton University .
A majority of researchers believe Britain was uninhabited by humans at the time the flint tools were made .
An absence of archaeological evidence suggests people abandoned this land between 200,000 years ago ( or 160,000 years ago , depending on who you ask ) and 65,000 years ago .
But one researcher , unconnected with the study , said he was not convinced by the evidence presented so far .
As soon as sea levels dropped , and a ' land bridge ' appeared across the English Channel , they made the journey by foot to Kent Dr Francis Wenban - Smith , Southampton University
Dr Mark White , from Durham University , said he would like to assess the findings in detail before considering whether they posed a challenge to the majority view that humans were absent from Britain at this time .
A flint hand tool and a waste flake discarded by a Neanderthal whilst making a similar tool were unearthed at the M25 / A2 road junction at Dartford , during an excavation funded by the UK's Highways Agency .
Dr Wenban - Smith and colleagues from Oxford Archaeology have dated the sediments in which the hand axes were sitting to 110,000 years ago , placing them squarely within the " abandonment period " .
The finds at Dartford come from when sea levels were dropping after a period when they were high enough to make the English Channel impassable .
Image caption Neanderthals may have been drawn to Britain by mammoth and rhino herds
" We know that Neanderthals inhabited Northern France at this time , but this new evidence suggests that as soon as sea levels dropped , and a ' land bridge ' appeared across the English Channel , they made the journey by foot to Kent , " said Dr Wenban - Smith .
The dearth of evidence for human occupation in Britain between 200,000 and 65,000 years ago has perplexed researchers .
The English Channel would have posed a physical barrier to humans trying to cross from the continent .
But sea levels fluctuated during this period ; there were other times when hunters could have walked from France to southern England .
For instance , from 200,000 - 130,000 years ago the sea level was predominantly low .
Humans should have been able to get here , but , for some reason , they did not show up .
Opportunity knocks
" It could be something subtle like the rapidity of changing climate , altering its state from warmer to colder conditions .
That may have meant it was too hard for the Neanderthals to develop a sustainable adaptation , " Dr Wenban - Smith told BBC News .
" Neanderthals were cold adapted and maybe it just took them that time to adapt to the cold environment of that period .
So that , before 130,000 , they had n't really cracked it .
But after 115,000 , they had cracked it . "
Around 130,000 years ago , sea levels rose and Neanderthals would have been blocked from entering Britain by the English Channel .
But around 115,000 years ago , sea levels fell again .
To Dr Wenban - Smith and his team , the flint tools from Dartford suggest that , this time , humans were able to take advantage of the opportunity .

The artefacts were found during works off the M25 motorway at Dartford
One theory is that Neanderthals may have been attracted back to Kent by the flint - rich chalk downs visible from France .
These supported herds of mammoth , rhino , horse and deer - an important source of food in sub-arctic conditions .
The finds were dated using a method known as optically stimulated luminescence ( OSL ) .
This exploits the presence of radioactive isotopes in the natural environment .
Naturally occurring minerals such as quartz and feldspars record the amount of radiation to which they have been exposed .
Some minerals store a proportion of the energy delivered by the radiation and then release it at a later date in the form of light .
The amount of light released by such minerals can be used to calculate the radiation dose a sample has received and thus give an estimate of the time that has elapsed since it was buried .
Dates discarded
But Dr
White raised doubts over the reliability of OSL dating , saying the technique was more or less " in constant development " - especially at this time range .
He added that assumptions about background radiation and average water content could significantly affect results .
" I have n't seen the flints , but I 've no doubt they are genuine .
Currently , with what has leaked to the press , I have no idea of the context of these finds , " he told BBC News .
" I suspect there is a possibility the OSL dating [ technique ] might not be giving us the true date .
And that would be my only [ reservation ] . "
" I have similar dates from a site near Dover in Kent , which have come out between 90,000 and 100,000 years ago .
But I do n't think OSL is giving us a correct date and I have disregarded them . "
Neanderthals split from our evolutionary line some 500,000 years ago .
They were characterised by a short , muscular physique , a barrel chest , large brain and prominent facial features .
Dr Wenban - Smith along with other researchers think that " classic " Neanderthal features appeared about 200,000 years ago .
But other scientists describe much older fossils as Neanderthals .
These include the 400,000 - year - old partial skull unearthed at Swanscombe in Kent and 230,000 - year - old human teeth excavated at Pontnewydd in Wales .

Get the latest on the Joran van der Sloot case and the slaying of Stephany Flores .
Watch " Nancy Grace " at 8 p.m. ET on HLN .
Lima , Peru ( CNN ) -- Peruvian police said Thursday they found skin underneath the fingernails of a 21 - year - old student Joran van der Sloot is accused of killing .
Miguel Canlla
Ore , a colonel in the Peruvian National Police and head of homicide , told journalist Victoria Macchi that the amount of skin was small and that laboratory DNA tests that might indicate who it came from had not been completed .
Peruvian authorities have charged the 22 - year - old Dutchman with murder in the death of Stephany Flores , whose body was found June 2 in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot .
He also is the lead suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba .
Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with Holloway 's disappearance but was never charged because of a lack of evidence .
A court document obtained by CNN shows Flores had a cranial fracture and other injuries to her face and neck and showed signs of asphyxiation .
Forensic tests in the hotel room where her body was found showed blood on the floors , hallway and mattress , the document said .
According to transcripts of van der Sloot 's confession , he said he elbowed Flores in the face before strangling her and then suffocating her with his shirt .
The transcripts were provided to CNN by a police source who has not been named because he was not authorized to pass along the material .
Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail in his computer connected with the Holloway case .
After killing Flores , police say , van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile , where he was arrested June 3 .
He was returned the next day to Peru .
Van der Sloot is being held in a high - security area of the Miguel Castro Castro Prison , where only two of 10 cells are occupied and he has no contact with the general prison population .

It 's all in your head
Chris started developing Subversion in December 2006 .
Originally slated as Introversion 's second game and due for release shortly after Uplink , Subversion exploded into an epic and highly experimental project , and is undoubtedly our most ambitious game to date .
In fact it turned out to be a little too ambitious and in October 2011 Chris announced that he had suspended work on Subversion and something new was on the way ...

Subversion gets Suspended
October 17 , 2011
Around June last year , we pushed ourselves as hard as we could and made a playable slice of the game , and demonstrated it publicly at the World Of Love conference in London .
The demo went well , but was heavily scripted .
Internally we had come to realise that somewhere along the 6 years of part - time development , we had lost our way .
We could n’t even remember what sort of game it was supposed to be anymore .
We ’d ended up with a game that looked and sounded brilliant , classic Introversion with its blue wireframe and sinister faceless characters .
But there was a massive gaping hole where you would normally see a “ core game ” .
We ’d tried and tried to fill that hole with ambitious tech and experimental systems , but you could n’t escape it .

This is the most recent two week sprint .
Weâve got a new Audio guy - PJ
Belcher - doing our music and sound effects for us right now , as sadly our previous audio hero Alistair is unavailable .
The results so far are excellent - Each emotional element of the music is separated out and played on its own audio channel , and we can adjust the volumes based on your game situation .
So if a guard becomes suspicious of you , we fade up a musical element to represent that .
If you get into a fight , we fade up some heavy scary drums and guitar .
When your guys are hiding deep inside a high security area , we bring in some tense cellos and percussion to nail it home .
Weâre mixing about 10 different tracks together to form the game music right now , and itâs sounding really great .

Everything takes a long time in this project , and i'm not entirely sure why .
Even something simple like allowing the user to plant a bug on a cctv camera has turned out to be a massive job , with interface redesigns and heavy rethinking on how the player interacts with the world .
I 'm overthinking everything , always looking ahead to situations that wo n't become problems for months , trying to design and implement everything correctly first time .
This is usually a bad idea .
Iterative improvement and replacement often gets you to a better solution faster than aiming for the perfect solution first time .
And even if you write a system and then totally replace it , you still learn a huge amount - writing a system wrongly is often the best way to learn how to do it right .

Subversion is going to be set in a modern High Tech environment , with you taking " mission control " over a team of skilled operatives in a hostile High Security building .
You will be using Sabotage , Social Engineering and Grifting , custom Electrical and Mechanical devices , Distractions , Hacking , Stealth , Acrobatics , Precision demolitions , Trickery , whatever gets the job done .
In the best case scenarios your enemies will never know you were even there .
When things go wrong , a well prepared escape plan and well timed precision violence will get you out of a tight spot - or maybe not .

When your guys open the safe on the 25th floor and find this time bomb inside , and the timer is ticking down from 30 seconds , thatâs how long you have before the whole thing explodes in your face .
Do you cut the red wire , or the blue wire ?
Cutting the right wire will stop the timer and disarm the bomb , cutting the wrong wire will set it off .
With the system described above , this would become a genuine choice based on the actual operation of the components used to build the bomb .
A little bit of rapid research will tell you this particular type of detonator is activated by sending a 1 signal to the 2nd pin .
So you cut the 2nd wire , stop the timer , and complete the mission .

My aim has been to handle all the basic collisions and forces that you naturally find in a game world â ie I want to stop people walking through walls , or each other , and I want people to be able to walk into Elevator cars and be lifted up when the car lifts up , that kind of thing .
There is a ton of work already done in the area of real time physics , and Iâve no intention of writing a full physics simulation system â itâs not required for Subversion , and itâs the kind of job I could just vanish into for a year and emerge at the other end with some software that pretty much every other games company under the sun has already written .
I believe a simpler solution is appropriate for Subversion .
Nevertheless , Iâd always been curious how hard it would be to bring some rigid body physics to the game world , and Iâd been investigating a free 3d physics library called BulletPhysics .

Would you believe i've been writing about Subversion for over two years ?
Over that period of time it 's become difficult to find old postings and videos about Subversion , so today I decided to change that .

Iâve been having a lot of fun with Subversion recently .
Iâm heavily into the Simulation task now , and Iâve been working on the supermarket sliding doors for a while .
I started thinking ahead and decided it was time to implement some proper collision detection , so that the doors would crash into each other if pushed too hard , or would crash into their outer mountings if opened too far .
Of course I then started thinking about situations such as placing a bin in - between the two sliding doors â the doors would push the bin inwards until it blocked both doors , at which point the doors would jam and then re-open .
And before you know it , weâre into the deadly realm of realtime physics .

I want to design a system in which I can build highly complex systems made up of lots of smaller Common Components .
I took a shot at this with the Elevator Systems last year , but I was too focussed on getting the script system working well .
So in the elevator system almost every component is running a custom script â the Sensors , the Doors , the Buttons , and of course the control computer .
I now believe I can build almost any system for Subversion out of a few standardised components â specifically Sensors , Actuators , Emitters , and Controllers .
Sensors detect an object or event in their zone â such as Motion , Proximity , Heat , Light , whatever .
Actuators are basically motors , and move other objects around .
Emitters are things like lights , lasers , speakers .
And finally Controllers are the computer systems that make everything work â and these are the only objects that really need custom LUA scripts .

Subversion has had a tough ride during the latter half of 2008 .
During that time we shipped Multiwinia and we also did the Chronometer project , so time has been short .
Work has still occurred on Subversion , but a lot of it is internal â difficult to demonstrate , and more concerned with the inner workings of the project than externally flashy stuff .
So I donât have a huge amount of cool new stuff to show , but this blog was never about showing the polished finished article â itâs about the development process of an Introversion game .

One of my intentions is to create a really swish graphical user interface â the sort that everyone wishes computers really used , and the sort that you only ever see in films .
One of my ideas is to do away with the traditional 2d interface and project everything onto the inside of a sphere .
Focussed windows can be brought closer in 3d space , and you effectively have a huge desktop extending 360 degrees around you .
Looks kinda swish , so long as you have 4xAA .
Otherwise the jaggies get you .
Iâm not 100 % sold on this interface idea yet , but itâs a fun experiment .

A couple of weeks ago I had a very strong image of a particular type of map editor for Subversion , that would be extremely easy for me to create , and ( far more importantly ) extremely easy for pretty much anyone to use .
I was thinking about older games like Dungeon Keeper , and newer indie stuff like Dwarf Fortress , and they donât bother with any complex geometry â they restrict the whole game world to squares , and do everything on a grid .
Itâs like drawing on graph paper , and every square can be empty or it could be a wall , or water , whatever .
Initially this might seem extremely limiting , but both of those games manage to exhibit lots of possibilities to the player and donât feel particularly restrained because of their grid like nature .
I decided to run with this concept for a while and threw together a simple graph - paper prototype in a few hours .

Iâve started working on some of the simulation aspects of Subversion .
Itâs a huge and daunting area , and a big part of the problem with taking on such mammoth tasks is often not knowing where to start .
The building generator in the previous blog post generates relatively simple external facades based on the traditional tapered Manhattan skyscraper , then fills in some minimal structural detail on each floor â the floor itself , the steel supporting columns that run up the centre of the building , and an elevator shaft .

Subversion is at a crossroads right now â it could go in several different directions .
My gut tells me Iâve spent long enough generating cities for now , and the results are pretty good â itâs time to move in a level and start thinking about the buildings themselves .
Iâm actually thinking of starting work on the Simulator next .
In other words , the system that simulates the activity of the world and lets you interact with it in interesting ways , otherwise known as The Game .
Itâs become obvious that some people within Introversion â 
Mark in particular â are nervous there is no game to show for all this blue - sky work so far , and are probably quite - rightly worried weâre dealing with another Darwinia .
But my mind is pretty clear â  I can see the game playing out in my head â itâs just a very long way off , almost impossible to create at this point even after all the work thatâs been done .
Itâs very easy to get lost in one particular area â like fractal tree generation in Darwinia , which I spent weeks working on while ignoring the major problems with the game itself .
I can feel Subversion solidifying , but itâs a slow process , as anyone whoâs been watching the evolving city shots will know .
Subversion is undoubtedly the most ambitious game weâve ever attempted to create â massive in scope and totally uncompromising in itâs requirements .
But every day I work on it Iâm even more convinced - this is the big one , Introversion Softwareâs Magnum Opus , and itâs going to be the best game we will ever make .

Subversion 's procedural city generator system has been coming along very nicely , as a result of a few breakthroughs and sudden flashes of inspiration .
The system is currently capable of building a city covering a 10 Km square area of ground .
I 've now written procedural generators for every single step of the process , meaning you can now start with flat empty land , click " Generate All " , and come back in a minute or two without any human involvement required .
It can take several minutes sometimes , depending on the complexity and density of the city .

This work is a direct continuation of the prototypes I showed in Part 3 .
Those prototypes have now been rewritten ( properly ) and lots of extra progress has been made .
We now have a system that can generate a complete city from the satellite view down to individual buildings , and you can step in at any stage of development and add your own customisations , or you can just let everything generate itself randomly .
You can create huge volumes of content extremely quickly , by layering generator on top of generator on top of generator .
Each step of generation feeds into the next , producing incredible levels of complexity .

After playing around with some really simple wall layouts for a few days , it dawned on me that I could make a fairly major progress leap by importing some map data from somewhere else ( for testing purposes of course - not as the actual game levels ! ) .
All of the test offices that Iâd built in my simple editor were extremely basic , because Iâm not going to waste time building complex maps when the format is changing all the time .
But there are hundreds of games out there with similar map data structures , and thousands of levels that have been made before , sometimes in incredible detail .
So I had a little think and came up with the obvious answer â 
Doom maps .

The second Subversion prototype has been started , and this time itâs all about Buildings .
Specifically , procedural generation of Office Buildings .
The first thing that was obvious is how similar the algorithms are to the previous prototype â the same fundamental code that generated those large cities and street networks can be used to generate office layouts .
Instead of extending streets we are extending walls , and instead of searching for blocks ( surrounded by streets ) we are searching for rooms ( surrounded by walls ) .
Itâs also exactly the same code that can convert a city block into a set of allotments , with each allotment containing one building .

These screenshots represent the first weeks work in writing a procedural City Generator .
Just a few incredibly simple rules govern the growth of roads in these prototypes .
By making small changes to those rules , you can vastly change the result .
Encouraging roads to run North - South or East - West results in Manhattan style street grids , whereas encouraging roads to circle population centres results in lovely radial street patterns .
These are obviously very early prototype shots but I wanted to show the incredible power ( and beauty ) of procedurally generated content , even at this early stage .

To fully understand the history of Subversion we have to look back at the history of our company .
A few months after Uplinkâs release , work had just been completed on the 1.2 â Nakatomiâ  patch and fans rejoiced at the newly explorable LAN dungeons weâd created .
Feeling weâd done enough to support Uplink for the time being , we pushed on and began work on our next game .
The date was the 29th of July 2002 , and the project codename was Subversion .

Let 's not beat around the bush – the Village People certainly did n't - this camp dancefloor barnstormer is n't one of the worst World Cup songs of all time .
Truth be told , it 's not even the worst German World Cup song of all time .
That particular honour goes to Peter Alexander and the 1986 squad for Mexico Mi Amor , featuring half - hearted sombrero - and poncho - themed japery from Lothar Matthäus and Pierre Littbarski , plus the amusing spectacle of Toni Schumacher " playing " the trumpet .
But it would be a gross dereliction of journalistic duty if we failed to doff our hat to the disturbing mental images conjured up by this official collaboration between a group of camp - looking blokes in dodgy outfits and the Village People : a team of buff , ball - fondling Teutons and the gayest ensemble in the history of disco .
Throw in the fact that the German football team 's collective sobriquet is this close to being a perfect euphemism for the love that dare not speak its name and it simply has to go straight in at No1 with the proverbial bullet .
Obligatory schoolboy sniggering aside , there 's no question that the Village People 's guest appearance on Germany 's 1994 World Cup song was good for team morale ; the arrival of the iconic cop , Native American , cowboy , leather - clad biker and admiral on set was amusing enough to prompt Matthäus and Jurgen Klinsmann to smile simultaneously while standing near each other for the first and last time .
Village People were originally a concept group , the brainchild of French composer Jacques Morali and the band 's original cop Victor Willis in the mid-70s .
When public demand for live performances grew on the back of the pair 's studio success , they were forced to assemble an actual group by advertising for dancers to perform alongside Willis .
" Macho types wanted : must dance and have a moustache , " read the appeal .
The video for Far Away In America could well be the subsequent auditions .
Emetic tracksuits ?

Stereotypical blond Scandinivian poodle perms ?

Much has been written about Danish Dynamite , the Sepp Piontek - managed ultra- attacking Denmark side of John Sivebæk , Jesper Olsen and Michael Laudrup that ended up winning nothing but making plenty of friends along the way .
Indeed , an awful lot of it has been written in this epic by Rob Smyth and Lars Eriksen , of this parish , in which space and in one case possibly pride precluded the authors from giving anything more than a cursory mention to a World Cup song that , 24 years after being recorded , continues to get more enthusiastic airings than the Danish national anthem from the home support in Copenhagen .
The original idea was for the lyrics of Re-sepp - ten to be written by the readers of the Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet , but when this went predictably pear - shaped , TV host and actor Jarl Friis - Mikkelson was brought on board to whip their ideas into the kind of fluid coherence befitting the style of play for which Piontek 's side were a byword .
Needless to say , he failed dismally , albeit in a good way - while laughing at this audio- visual study in cheese , it 's worth bearing in mind that , unlike today 's professional footballers , these guys were happy to make complete fools of themselves for the public 's amusement long before the invention of mobile phones or webcams .
Some info : the title Re-sepp - ten refers to Piontek and the Danish word for a medicine prescription .
The Kevin Phillips lookalike in the wife - beater vest is Henrik Stanley Møller .
The female singer 's name is Dodo Gad , lead singer of Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos and as she sings the now infamous line " Mother Denmark loves all Danish boys who can bang ... the ball , " Preben Elkjær can be seen cracking up in the background , while simultaneously phnarr - phnarring the impression that he'd be more than happy to show her how well he can bang , given half a chance .
Denmark went out of 1986 World Cup in the second round , but Fifa 's technical report noted that their " readiness to risk something , linked to a full physical commitment " provided them " with an exceptional dynamism " .
Whether it was referring to their style of football or this video remains unclear .
3 ) Give It A Lash Jack ( Liam Harrison And The Goal Celebrities ) Country : Republic of Ireland .
World Cup : Italy 1990 .
Give it a lash Jack !
Give it a lash Jack !
Never , never , never say no !
Oirland !
Oirland !
Repub-a-lic of Oirland !
Rev it up and here we go !
The soundtrack of an Irish summer and opportunistic Paddywhackery of the highest order , which is unsurprising considering it marked the Republic of Ireland 's first jaunt to the World Cup finals and the end of poverty as the country 's greatest export until quite recently .
Unsurprising , but not right .
This was n't an official dirge , but it 's difficult to imagine how the appearance of the eponymous hero Jack Charlton or his squad giving carefully choreographed fist - pumps in a recording studio could conceivably have made the uber - cheap video any more naff .
Eschewing the Eurobeat oeuvre generally favoured for ditties of this nature , songwriter Liam Harrison opted instead for a blatant pig - under - the - arm staple delivered in a cod Oirish blarney that made Tom Cruise 's performance in Far And Away sound authentic .
Beginning with a low , rhythmic rumble of " Here we go !
Here we go !
Here we go ! " , the song also sampled the opening bars of the Irish national anthem , rhymed the words " cry " with " qualified " and suggested in a manner that can only be described as sinister that if the Irish squad returned victorious from Italy , they'd be stuffed and mounted by a taxidermist .
Perhaps deliberately , they went out in the quarter - finals .
Despite all this , Give It A Lash Jack topped the Irish charts in June 1990 , but was quickly eclipsed as the most embarrassing episode of Irish football song - related tomfoolery when several thousand liquored up natives massed outside Dublin 's Mansion House to catch a glimpse of Nelson Mandela and greeted the bemused South African leader with a chorus of " Ooh aah , Paul McGrath 's da ! "
If William Wallace had delivered an entreaty this impassioned prior to the Battle of Stirling Bridge , not only would the combined English forces of John de Warrennee and Hugh de Cressingham have won , their infantry and cavalry would n't even have had to muddy their spats once their Scottish opponents had shrugged their shoulders with a collective " meh " , downed broad - swords and headed for home .
Del Amitri's crie de couer scaled the dizzy chart heights of No15 in June 1998 , a considerably higher ranking than the team in whose honour it was written will ever earn again from Fifa .
Catchy and accomplished in a strummy , strings and sideburns sort of way , it almost certainly has no place on a roll of shame where assorted South Korean actors and comedians failed to make the cut on the grounds that this effort was deemed far too good .
Do n't Come Home Too Soon is almost certainly the first recorded instance of a World Cup song recorded by morose folk singers imploring their country 's national football team not to embarrass themselves at a tournament .
Lead singer Justin Currie shipped much criticism for releasing what many saw as the musical equivalent of a white flag of surrender before Scotland had even kicked a ball , but considering the team 's " previous " , it 's no surprise he was maudlin and knew the jig was already up .
True to form , Scotland failed to progress past the first round , finishing bottom of their group behind Brazil , Norway and Morocco .
" And the world may not be shaking yet , but you might prove them wrong .
Even long shots make it , " crooned Currie , presumably alluding to the squad 's dash to St Étienne - Boutheon Airport after their 3 - 0 hiding at the hands of Morocco .
5 ) We 're On The Ball ( Ant & Dec ) Team : England .
World Cup : Japan and South Korea 2002 .
Having forged multi-million - pound careers out of being cheeky Geordie chappies with no discernible talent for doing anything beyond standing beside each other in a particular way that helped confused TV viewers tell which one is which , Anthony " Ant " McPartlin and Declan " The one on the right " Donnelly decided to plot their next move .
Realising the Great British public were dumb enough to lap up any old guff to which they turned their hand , the gruesome twosome decided to clamber aboard the World Cup song bandwagon in 2006 , by recording a number that confirmed their well - documented inability to sing , which would be accompanied by a video that confirmed their well - documented inability to act .
The result was On The Ball , a painfully unfunny " musical skit " which began with our heroes hatching a fiendish plan over breakfast in a greasy spoon to swap places with England manager Sven - Goran Eriksson and his assistant Tord Grip , disappearing dubiously in a phone box from which they emerged dressed as ninjas and then going on to mastermind victory for England in the World Cup .
Or something .
It could be argued , by people with too much time on their hands , that We 're On The Ball was a shamelessly cynical attempt to emulate the success of David Baddiel , Frank Skinner and The Lightning Seeds triumph with Three Lions in 1996 .
The alternative view , that it was little more than harmless , poorly - performed fun by a pair of eejits messing about for cheap yuks is no less depressing .
When push comes to shove it was just a rubbish song and plenty of those get recorded every day .
Perhaps the only mildly amusing facet of the whole debacle was that it was Dec that drew the short straw and was forced to impersonate the nondescript Grip by ... occasionally revealing a T - shirt with his name printed across the chest .
Evidence of Donnelly 's subsequent relationship with an attractive blonde TV presenter meant he should have got to play Sven .
More " ouch ouch " than " ciao ciao " , this is the Swedish song for the 1990 World Cup , which stands apart from other anthems in that half of it is in Italian , half in Swedish and none of it good .
We 're not sure what else to say about it really , except to point out that it was recorded by these bozos and its effect on the Sweden team in Italy was so deleterious and dispiriting they were even beaten by Scotland .
With thanks to James Dart , Sean Ingle , Rob Smyth , Raphael Honigstein , Lars Eriksen and Marcus Christenson .
The UN Security Council has agreed a statement following Israel 's raid on Monday on a convoy of aid ships bound for Gaza .
Here is the full text :
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza .
The Council , in this context , condemns those acts which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded , and expresses its condolences to their families .
The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel .
The Council urges Israel to permit full consular access , to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and wounded immediately , and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination .
The Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary - General on the need to have a full investigation into the matter and it calls for a prompt , impartial , credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards .
The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable .
The Council re-emphasizes the importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860 .
In that context , it reiterates its grave concern at the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza .
The Security Council underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli - Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties and re-emphasises that only a two - State solution , with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours , could bring peace to the region .
The Security Council expresses support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway and urges the parties to act with restraint , avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions , and all international partners to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region .

Introduction
Understanding the characteristics , causes and definition of learning disabilities is an imperative aspect of becoming a qualified special educator .
Current statistics claim there are 2.7 million students being served as learning disabled today ( Heward , 2009 ) and 6.3 % of students who are seen by speech and language pathologists in the school systems are also receiving services for another disabling condition that affects learning .
Often overlooked is the domain of giftedness by those who seek to become special educators .
This remarkable condition is briefly discussed .
This paper serves as a brief overview of learning disabilities communications disorders and giftedness as well as students who are dually diagnosed .
Learning Disabilities
Currently there is no single definition of Learning Disability ( LD ) that is commonly accepted .
However , according to Hewett ( 2009 ) there are two definitions that have the most influence .
The first is the federal definition found in the Individuals with Disability in Education Act ( IDEA ) which states :
In General — The term “ specific learning disability ” means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language , spoken or written , which disorder may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen , think , speak , read , write , spell , or to do mathematical calculations .
Disorders Included —
Such term includes such conditions as perceptual disabilities , brain injury , minimal brain dysfunction , dyslexia , and developmental aphasia .
Disorders not included —
Such term does not include a learning problem that is primarily there result of visual , hearing , or motor disabilities , of mental retardation , of emotional disturbance , or of environmental , cultural , or economic disadvantage .
( P.L. 1008 - 466 , Sec.602 . [ 30 ] ) ( p. 173 )
The second definition that bears weight among professionals today is the product of a collaborative effort comprised by thirteen professional organizations .
The National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities ( NJCLD ) stands by the following definition :
Learning disabilities is a general term that refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening , speaking , reading , writing , reasoning , or mathematical abilities .
These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed due to central nervous system dysfunction , and may appear across the life span .
Problems in self - regulatory behaviors , social perception and social interaction may exist with learning disabilities , but do n’t constitute a learning disability by themselves .
Although learning disabilities may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions ( for example , sensory impairment , mental retardation , serious emotional disturbance , or with extrinsic influences ( such as cultural differences , insufficient or inappropriate instruction ) , they are not the result of those conditions or influences ( pp 1 , 174 ) .
Heward ( 2009 ) continues to define learning disabilities by outlining the criteria for qualifying for services in the public school setting .
Summarized are termed the IQ - Achievement Discrepancy as the student has a severe difference between what he or she knows and what is produced in the classroom .
These difficulties are not caused by another factor or condition and the student must have special education services ( i.e. , specially designed instruction ) to achieve in school .
The characteristics of learning disabilities run in conjunction with the deficit in the particular processing area affected .
Described by the Learning Disabilities Association of America ( n.d. ) , learning disabilities are an interruption of a processing component of auditory , visual and sensory information entering the brain .
Typically information enters the brain and is sequenced and organized involving working , short and or long term memory .
The information is integrated using sequencing , abstract reasoning or organization .
Finally , the quality of what is produced ( output ) is the product of the input and processing ( n.d. ) .
A person with a learning disability will have a unique pattern of difficulties that may gather around common difficulties such as language processing manifested in poor auditory perception , sequencing / abstraction / organization , memory and language disability .
Learning disabilities are a neurologically based processing problem many times of an unknown origin ( Heward , 2009 ) .
Cited in Exceptional Children , an Introduction to Special Education , 9th ed. ( Heward , 2009 ) categorizes the assumed causes of learning disabilities as “ brain damage , heredity , biochemical imbalance , and environmental factors ” ( p.187 ) .
Research on brain damage or dysfunction is showing some promising signs for detecting biological causes of specific learning disabilities and evidence is mounting indication increased exposure to sound teaching and extra tutoring can increase the neural pathways that assist with learning to read ( 2009 ) .
Heredity or the genetic predisposition to learning disabilities has some credibility in causation especially in determining reading difficulties ( 2009 ) .
Heward ( 2009 ) maintains that biochemical imbalances are not given much recognition in the professional field as a verifiable cause for learning disabilities at this time while environmental factors probably contribute greatly to a child ’s performance in school and chances of needing special education services ( 2009 ) .
Considerations of selection and adaptations of curriculum are vital to the success of the student with learning disabilities .
Heward ( 2009 ) outlines the reading , written language and math underachievement as critical areas where excellent curriculum and adaptations are needed .
Reading problems are the most prevalent of all learning disabilities .
Phonemic awareness and rapid naming speed need .
Fluency and comprehension are key focus points for teachers .
Written language deficits can be enhanced by using frequent practice and a systematic approach that has proven results for the individual student .
Systematic practice with instruction that offers guided , meaningful practice giving feedback to the student will help the student to succeed ( 2009 ) .
Emphasis on appropriate feedback is extremely important for the student with a learning disability .
Anita Archer , Ph.D. , educator and author , once said , “ Practice does not make perfect ” .
“ Practice makes permanent ” ( n.d. ) .
A student left to do multiple repetitions the wrong way will only further increase frustration with learning and will not produce positive academic results .
Communication Disorders
Communication disorders are defined by Heward ( 2009 ) as “ an impairment in the ability to receive , send , process and comprehend concepts or verbal , nonverbal and graphic symbol systems ” ( p. 329 ) .
A child with a deficit in communication is from the start going to have a more difficult time in school .
At risk for this student is success in accessing academic materials , processing information and social skill development .
Thatcher , Fletcher & Decker ( 2008 ) , emphasize the importance the role of literacy and communication have stated :
The critical role of communication in schools cannot be understated .
Communication skills are necessity both in academic and social atmosphere of the school environment …
Literacy is obviously a critical skill for school success and lifelong success .
Research demonstrates the relationship between speech and / or language and literacy acquisition . ( p.579 ) .
Speech disorders are characterized by three impairment , articulation , fluency and voice disorders .
Additionally , how a child processes language either expressively or receptively will influence speech and language development .
Many speech and language disorders etiology may be tied to an organic cause such as brain damage from trauma or cerebral palsy .
However , most are functional disorders that have no specific known cause ( Heward , 2009 ) .
Dual Diagnosis
Dual diagnosis or co morbidity is the presence of more than one diagnosis or condition at the same time .
Often a child with a learning disability will also have problems attending in class or behavior problems .
These conditions may be the result of having to struggle in class and the child ’s emotional health and or may be caused by other factors such as Attention Deficit Disorder ( ADD ) or Attention Deficit / Hyperactive Disorder ( ADHD ) Heward ( 2009 ) .
The inception of IDEA has caused an exacerbation in the number of children now able to qualify as learning disabled .
Current numbers suggest about 2.7 million students are receiving services .
Furthermore , Pinborough - Zimmerman , Satterfield , Miller , Bilder , Hossain & McMahon ( 2007 ) findings confirm 6.3 % of school aged children receiving speech therapy services for communication disorders are experiencing co-concurring conditions including intellectual disabilities , autism spectrum disorder and emotional , behavioral disorders ( 2007 ) .
These numbers have grave implications for the public school system as it strives to provide essential services for these children .
Giftedness
Giftedness , or “ those children who give evidence of high - achievement or capability in areas such as intellectual , creative , artistic , or leadership capacity , or in specific academic fields , and who need services and activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop those capabilities ” ( Heward , 2009 , p.528 ) comes in many forms and is often misunderstood and underrepresented in education .
Heward ( 2009 ) characterizes the gifted child as having the ability to learn , retain and use large amounts of information relating ideas across domains and being able to make judgments based on reasoning .
Also the child with special talents and abilities is able to see and understand systems in ways typical persons may not be able to grasp while evoking the ability to comprehend and manipulate abstract thought and creating ingenious solutions to problems by reframing the question ( 2009 ) .
Identification and assessment of giftedness usually involves a combination of tests , achievement measures and observations of the child ’s performance and interest levels in specific domains .
Porath ( 2006 ) describes an interesting developmental psychological model to better understanding giftedness .
Looking carefully at the development of children ’s thought and the conceptual understanding , gifted children hold is a quality indicator of giftedness .
Porath ( 2006 ) describes an integrated model of giftedness by claiming children follow the same developmental path toward understanding , but the gifted child ’s “ conceptual understanding is markedly more complex and flexible than average … they follow the same path but the nature of the journey is qualitatively different ” ( p. 147 ) .
An example of the richness of a gifted child ’s ability is demonstrated in the narration of a make believe story .
The following is an example of a six - year - old describing the problem in his story :
The planet ’s atmosphere started to burn .
Gold went down like a shooting star , like a bullet from the sky .
Flying like a flaming jet from powers of the universe .
Guns were shooting down from there .
He goed [ sic ] up in space and swept them down .
Even the bad guy ’s shooters could n’t resist the power .
He had the mightiest parts on his spaceship than ever ( Porath , 2004a ) ( p.150 ) .
The gifted child will tell an elaborated plot using psychological insights and a demonstration of understanding actions of others and the motivational structures that guide the characters .
A higher order of social thought and incorporation of emotion , empathy , social - psychological pieces to the story are included .
Simply put a six - year - old storyteller with giftedness tells a story that is more in tune with an eight - year - old using more than one concept in the plan and showing the ability to present complicated problems , with varied resolution demonstrating a rich knowledge of language and genre ( 2006 ) .
Conclusion
Developing a working knowledge of the plight of the child with learning disability , giftedness or a dual diagnosis discussed here is significant for a person seeking to become a special educator .
Information supporting current literature , defining and addressing key features of these conditions and uncovering the causal factors assists in preparing the teacher for maximizing the services he or she provides while endeavoring to motivate the student toward high achievement .
Really , it is .
The Cats today announced the above marketing brilliance will follow in the footsteps of memorable taglines from seasons past , such as the unforgettably original " Drop That Puck ! " , blazing a trail to professional sports respectability .
" We Came To Play " .
No exclamation point ?
Was Tallon informed of this ?
Granted , the club is located in a non-traditional market , needs to reach out , make some local noise , blah blah ... but I 'm not sure to which demographic this was designed to appeal : children ?
The elderly ?
The opposing team ?
On the other hand , I am definitely sure this is n't aimed at existing hockey fans .
Recalls the scene in Slap
Shot when the newly acquired , pumped - up Hanson Brothers storm out of a locker room for their Chiefs debut , prompting Johnny Upton 's timeless - and NSFW - retort .
Obviously a significant amount of research and polling went into the result of today 's announcement , so it must be effective .
Oh well , that 's progress .
Seemingly all the teams do it now , like spotlights and fireworks and t- shirt throws and cheerleaders .
A billion years ago I had to cringe through Hartford regurgitating lowball schlock like " Fire on Ice " and " Meet The New Boys in Town ! " ( that last one represented what The Whale received in return for Ronnie and Ulfie from Pittsburgh .
The local gentry famously did n't buy it . ) ; unfortunately those marketing tricks were far better than the club they represented .
Ultimately - for fans - it's about the product Dale Tallon puts on the ice , not what Michael Yormark is using to sell it .
If this campaign gets a few extra buttocks firmly planted in the 19,250 16,750 seats , call it a smashing success .
UPDATE : our pal John from the awesomeness that is Raw Charge wants to know what your alternate suggestions may be ...
Lembit Opik 's first foray into standup comedy shows that strangeness follows him around like a heat - seeking Cheeky Girl .
Less than a month after losing his Montgomeryshire seat , the former Lib Dem MP took the stage last night at the Backstage Comedy Club in central London , a cramped basement venue just a rat 's tail from Leicester Square tube .
It was his standup debut , a 15 - minute set alongside another six comedians ( the best of whom was the excellent Josh Widdicombe ) .
Alongside the critics in the audience , I spotted at least one press photographer , as well as Stephen Pound MP – a mate of Opik 's – and a smattering of TV cameras .
Not many first nights are quite like this .
Nor are many of them so lacking in material .
We endured a largely gag - free introduction thanking his lingerie model girlfriend , Katie Green , and the Conservative voters of his former constituency for enabling him to be there .
There were self - deprecatory references to losing his parliamentary seat after 13 years , allusions to the Cheeky Girls and corruption in parliament , a duff anecdote about his name – almost an anagram of " I like to be MP " , he told us – and a small section about the Daily Mail , which had quoted the event 's promoter , Robert Meakin , on the likelihood of Opik being bottled off the stage .
Then , unwisely , Opik picked up a shoe and attempted ventriloquism – perhaps an attempt to upstage the previous act , comedian / vetriloquist Nina Conti .
Ducking behind the brogue and adopting a silly voice , he did n't so much tell jokes as explain that , because Conti 's monkey was only a puppet , and this was a real shoe , his was the superior act .
He prefaced this section with the words : " Now , I was told not to do this . "
Whoever offered the advice was surely right .
But here 's the curious thing – behind Opik 's Liberal Democrat rosette ( which he wore on stage , presumably in self - mocking reference to his disastrous election night ) you could sense confidence , lucidity , composure , sharpness .
His set had structure .
All of this gives him two years on other novice comedians .
One gag about becoming mayor of London , which gently ribbed Boris Johnson , and another about being ignored in a lift by Nick Clegg , were nicely delivered .
What are we to make of Opik 's transformation into a comedian ?
Maybe it 's post- election catharsis , perhaps even mid-life crisis .
It was most definitely a publicity stunt .
But perhaps we should n't write him off just yet .
Opik clearly has an appetite for adulation and holding court , both of which are sated by standup comedy .
So who knows ?
Perhaps this really was a career change .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg will launch Thursday a coalition of mayors and business leaders to advocate for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policy , including legalizing undocumented immigrants and more strictly fining businesses that hire illegal workers .
" Our immigration policy is national suicide , " Mr. Bloomberg said at a forum in Midtown Wednesday .
" We educate the best and the brightest and then we do n't give them a green card — we want people to create jobs but we wo n't let entrepreneurs from around the world come here . "
During his latest inaugural address , Mr. Bloomberg vowed to push to rework the nation 's immigration laws in the same way that he waged battle against illegal guns .
This effort will be a cornerstone of the mayor 's third - term agenda , aides said .
The coalition , the Partnership for a New American Economy , supports developing a secure system for employers to verify employment eligibility and strict penalties for businesses that fail to comply .
The group wants to increase opportunities for immigrants to enter the workforce and for foreign students to stay in the country .
The group will advocate for securing the nation 's borders and beefing up enforcement to prevent illegal immigration .
The coalition supports establishing a legal path for the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the country now .

Protesters who get within five metres of the G20 security fence and refuse to provide ID , or leave could get arrested according to new powers granted by Queen ’s Park to police for the duration of the G20 summit .
Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair insisted that the regulations were meant to stop those who might want to penetrate the fence and also tried to deflect criticism that the rules were enacted in secret .

“ So far , no one has come down to attempt to breach this fence .
We are now a few days away from the summit in Toronto and that information is quite public , I ’m here explaining it to people , ” he said .
“ We have n’t changed the rules .
We have put up a fence .
We have told people very very clearly that we will not be allowing the public access into that area .

Millions of BitTorrent users who have chosen to hide their identities through a VPN service may not be as anonymous as they would like to be .
Due to a huge security flaw , those who use IPv6 in combination with a PPTP - based VPN such as Ipredator are broadcasting information linking to their real IP - address on BitTorrent .
As pressure from anti-piracy outfits on governments to implement stricter copyright laws increases , millions of file - sharers have decided to protect their privacy by going anonymous .
In Sweden alone an estimated 500,000 Internet subscribers are hiding their identities .
Many of these use PPTP - based VPNs such as The Pirate Bay ’s Ipredator or Relakks .
Thus far , these services were believed to adequately hide a user ’s IP - address from people they connect to in BitTorrent swarms , but this is not always the case .
At the Telecomix Cipher conference a security flaw was revealed that allows third parties to find the true IP - address of someone connected through a VPN .
The security risk is caused by a lethal combination of IPv6 and PPTP - based VPN services , which are very common .
IPv6 is the Internet protocol that will succeed IP v4 .
The protocol is promoted by Windows 7 and Vista , among others , and most people are using it without even realizing it .
The technical details of the vulnerability , explained in this talk ( see below ) , reveal that the true IP - address of users using IP v6 can be easily traced .
Even worse , it seems that the Swedish Anti-piracy Bureau may already be using this flaw to gather data on ‘ anonymous ’ BitTorrent users .
The vulnerability is not limited to BitTorrent either .
It can expose people who believe that they are hiding their real IP - address through nearly every connection .
In addition to this gaping hole in VPNs such as Ipredator and Relakks , the talk exposes several other weaknesses from a privacy point of view .
Among other things , it is fairly easy to find MAC - addresses and computer names of people who use the same VPN .
The people who run Ipredator are aware of the issue , and TorrentFreak was informed that their users will be notified about the problem .
Other VPNs using the same system may want to do the same .
From our understanding of the issue , turning IP v6 off should alleviate the threat and make users fully anonymous again .
Do you struggle to remember the differences between baking powder and baking soda ?
Want to know if you can substitute one for the other ?
Your burning questions , answered .
Baking powder and baking soda .
Both of them are used so frequently in quick baking projects that unless you are a recipe developer , rarely do you consider what each of them actually does for your finished product .
Why do my scones call for baking powder , but my buttermilk biscuits call for a mixture of powder and soda ?
Is there an easy way to substitute one for the other if I do n't have both on hand ?
And why do I have to bake my muffins right after mixing the batter ?
With traditional or " slow " breads , that leavening agent — the thing that creates bubbles that keep the bread light — is a living fungus called yeast .
As the yeast consumes sugars present in the flour , it releases carbon dioxide gas , forming thousands of teeny tiny air pockets inside the dough and causing it to rise .
Once you pop that dough in the oven , those air pockets heat up and further expand , and a phenomenon known as oven spring takes place .
Finally , as the gluten gets hot enough , it sets into a semisolid form , giving structure to the bread , and turning it from wet and stretchy to dry and spongy .
The only problem with yeast ?
It takes a long , long time to work .
Enter baking soda .
Unrestricted by the protracted timeframes of biological organisms , it relies instead on the quick chemical reaction between an acid and a base .
What Is Baking Soda ?
Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate .
It reacts with acids immediately upon contact to produce carbon dioxide .
Carbon dioxide gets trapped within batters and expands upon baking , leavening your quickbreads .
Because it reacts immediately , quickbreads made with baking soda must be cooked immediately after mixing .
Because of its alkalinity , it can also hasten browning reactions , adding color ( and thus flavor ) to things like pancakes , cookies , and muffins .
Learn more about how baking soda works and some surprising ways it can improve your savory cooking , too .
What Is Baking Powder ?
Baking powder is sodium bicarbonate mixed with a powdered acid and a starch .
It does not require an external acid in order to activate .
Most baking powders are " double acting , " meaning they produce carbon dioxide once upon coming in contact with moisture , then again after heating .
Because of this , baking powder - leavened goods are generally lighter and fluffier than those that rely on baking soda alone .
This does n't mean that you can let a baking powder batter just sit around expecting the second batch of bubbles to do all the leavening for you — the initial reaction is vitally important to the texture of your baked goods .
You can read up on how baking powder effects your cookies right here .
Can I Substitute Baking Soda for Baking Powder or Vice Versa ?
With this knowledge , it should be clear that while it 's possible to substitute baking powder in a recipe that calls for baking soda ( use a ratio of three measures of baking powder for every measure of baking soda ) , you can't expect the flavor profile to remain the same with all the extra acid that baking powder adds to the mix .
On the other hand , it 's quite simple to substitute baking powder with your own homemade mixture of baking soda , cornstarch , and cream of tartar ( a powdered acid ) .
For every teaspoon of baking powder , use 1/ 4 teaspoon of baking soda , 1/ 2 teaspoon of cream of tartar , and 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch .
But do bear in mind that your homemade mixture will not be double - acting , requiring you to be extra hasty to get your pancakes on the griddle or your zucchini bread in the pan immediately after mixing the batter .

Avalanche captain Adam Foote will be staying around for at least one more season .
The Avs will announce later today that Foote has agreed to a new , one - year contract for the 2010 - 11 season .
Foote , who turns 39 in July , would play his 19th NHL season .
“ Adam ’s veteran leadership has been , and will continue to be , a big part of our success , ” Avs general manager Greg Sherman said in .
“ He provided stability last season and set an example for our young players right from the start of training camp .
We are pleased to have our captain back for another year . ”
He had a solid 2009 - 10 season , and said he wished to return .
Foote will receive a base salary of $ 1 million , but will have a number of incentives as part of the deal that could at least double that amount .
He made $ 3.25 million with Colorado in 2009 - 10 .
He was a plus - 8 in 67 games for the Avs , with no goals and nine assists .

Joe Biden : Look , you can argue whether Israel should have dropped people onto that ship or not and the – but the truth of the matter is , Israel has a right to know – they 're at war with Hamas – has a right to know whether or not arms are being smuggled in .
And up to now , Charlie , what 's happened ?
They 've said , " Here you go .
You 're in the Mediterranean .
This ship – if you divert slightly north you can unload it and we 'll get the stuff into Gaza . "
So what 's the big deal here ?
What 's the big deal of insisting it go straight to Gaza ?
Well , it 's legitimate for Israel to say , " I do n't know what 's on that ship .
These guys are dropping eight – 3,000 rockets on my people . "
Now , the one thing we have to do is not forget the plight of these Palestinians there , not Hamas – they 're in bad shape .
So we have put as much pressure and as much cajoling on Israel as we can to allow them to get building materials in , glass ...
Charlie Rose :
That 's what they 're trying to bring in , building materials .
Biden :
Yes , we know that , but they could have easily brought it in here and we'd get it through .
And so now the question is what do we do ?
Well , we had made it clear , the President of the United States has spoken three times , yesterday with Bibi , or the day before yesterday , he 's spoken once yesterday with a guy that I have spent a fair amount of time with , with Prime Minister Erdogan in Turkey ; the Turks , we passed a resolution in the UN saying we need a transparent and open investigation of what happened .
It looks like things are ...
Rose : International investigation ?
Biden : Well , an investigation run by the Israelis , but we 're open to international participation , just like the investigation run on the sunken sub in – off the coast of Korea .
That was run by South Korea , but the international community joined in that investigation .
And so that is very possible here as well .
I might add by the way for all those who say the Israelis , you know , you know , you can't trust them , the Israeli Supreme Court ruled today that every one of the people on those ships had to be released immediately .

Bank of America Corp. and other banks are preparing new fees on basic banking services as they try to replace revenue lost to regulatory rules , in a push that is expected to spell an end to free checking accounts for many Americans .
Free checking accounts , which have been widely available for more than a decade , have been a boon to middle - class consumers and attracted low - income customers to the banking system for the first time .
Customers will likely be required to pay new monthly maintenance fees on the most basic accounts that do n't generate a lot of activity .
To avoid a fee , customers will have to maintain certain account balances or frequently use other banking services , such as credit and debit cards , automated teller machines and online accounts .
" If you put $ 1,000 in a checking account and do n't do anything with it , it will be hard to get that for free , " says Sherief Meleis , a managing director at Novantas LLC , a consulting firm that advises banks .
Consumer - grade SSDs are fast , without a doubt , but those who demand extreme performance at any cost , or perhaps for enterprise applications , the fastest SSDs on the market are PCI Express - based , like the ioDrive and ioXtreme from Fusion - io , for example .
OCZ also offers their Z - Drive with similar performance , though while these speed demons are available for purchase , only a fraction of consumers can afford their sky high asking prices .
As with most technology though , wait a few months and something faster , smaller , and more affordable with come along to shake things up a bit .
At Computex 2010 , we were introduced to the OCZ Revo drive .
This game changer is a PCIe based SSD that addresses two near - fatal flaws of Fusion 's ioDrive - not bootable and crazy expensive .
With read / write speeds exceeding 500 MB/s , boot drive capability , and only a 15 % price premium over current SSD options from OCZ , the Revo drive is set to make a significant impact on the SSD market and not just in the enterprise or workstation markets but at the consumer level as well .

As the Spanish EU Presidency launched the ‘ European Wind Initiative ( EWI ) – a € 6 billion ten year research and development roadmap for the wind energy sector – the European Wind Energy Association ( EWEA ) said that , if properly funded , it would give European companies a competitive boost .
“ The European Wind Initiative is a big step forward in our efforts to maintain and strengthen Europe ’s global leadership in wind energy technology , ” said Christian Kjaer , CEO of EWEA .
“ The industry is ready to invest in accelerated R&D but the challenge is for the European Commission to come up with a plan to ensure its contribution .
Other regions of the world are investing significantly more in public research than the EU and its Member States and it remains to be seen how the EU will make its contribution . ”
The EWI is the result of several years of joint effort by the European wind energy sector , the European Commission and EU Member States working towards common goals that include :
Maintain Europe ’s technology leadership in both onshore and offshore wind power
Enable wind energy to supply 20 % of Europe ’s electricity in 2020 , 33 % in 2030 , and 50 % in 2050
Create 250,000 new skilled jobs in the EU in the wind energy sector by 2020
The EWI focuses on four main technology areas : new turbines and components , offshore technology , grid integration , resource assessment and spatial planning .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The U.S. military is investigating whether American taxpayer dollars from a more than $ 2 billion contract are being used to pay off Afghan insurgents in return for not attacking contractors .
The issue at hand is whether contractors working for the U.S. government in Afghanistan are paying protection money to local security companies , which in turn give the money to Afghan insurgents so they will not attack the contractors .
The money allegedly ending up in Taliban or warlord hands is from a number of Pentagon contracts , according to a U.S. military official not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation .
In order for trucks to pass safely through certain areas in Afghanistan carrying everything from ammunition to food for the U.S. military , the contracted trucking companies pay the local security companies responsible for their safe passage .
The security companies allegedly have ties to the Taliban or warlords who control the roads in a specific region of the country , according to the official .
The official said there is a tight lock on releasing details of the case because investigators are still following the actions of some of the security firms .
The official would not say how much money has been paid or what part of the country this is occurring .
Army Criminal Investigation Division ( CID ) spokesman Christopher Grey said the CID does have an investigation on " host- nation trucking " underway but he would not discuss details .
The Afghan Host Nation Trucking contract is split among eight companies to provide ground transportation in Afghanistan for over 90 percent of Department of Defense ( DoD ) goods and materiel , including food , water , fuel , equipment , and ammunition , according to a congressional subcommittee .
Since mid-2009 , contractors have completed over 40,000 missions , subcommittee statistics show .
Most goods and materiel , including U.S. military vehicles , are shipped through Pakistan to Bagram Airfield and then distributed to several hundred U.S. camps , airfields , forward operating bases , and firebases .
A separate congressional investigation to be released Tuesday raises similar questions about a $ 2.16 billion trucking contract to provide transportation for a majority of U.S. goods and materiel in Afghanistan .
" It would mean that the United States is unintentionally engaged in a vast protection racket and , as such , may be indirectly funding the very insurgents we are trying to fight , " said U.S. Rep.
John F. Tierney , D - Massachusetts , chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs , said in December .
The subcommittee is holding a hearing on the issue on Tuesday in Washington .
If anyone had any doubts that the movement for justice in Palestine is growing by leaps and bounds , in numbers , breadth , and determination , check out what happened this morning in Oakland , CA :
• somewhere between 700 and 1,000 demonstrators from all over the San Francisco Bay Area made their way at 5:30 on a Sunday morning deep into the Port of Oakland to stage a spirited community - labor picket line in front of a berth where an Israeli freighter , the Zim Shenzhen , was due to dock ;
• dock workers from Local 10 of the International Longshore & Warehouse Union refused to cross the picket line ;
• under the terms of the ILWU contract , an arbitrator was summoned to the site , he upheld the legality of the dock workers ’ refusal to cross the line , and the company was compelled to cancel the shift and send the workers home .
Waving Palestinian and Turkish flags and chanting " Free , free Palestine – do n’t cross the picket line " and " An injury to one is an injury to all – the Israeli apartheid wall will fall , " the demonstrators blocked three gates to the berth for more than four hours .
The turnout was all the more impressive because the BART , the Bay Area subway system , does n’t even start running until around 8 a.m. on Sunday , and even after people got to the assembly point in West Oakland , we had to walk more than a mile to get to the berth .
The event was organized by an ad hoc coalition of dozens of community and labor organizations .
The main leadership came from Palestinian - Americans and other Arab Americans , with the Bay Area branch of ANSWER also playing a key role .
The idea arose in response to a call issued in the wake of Israel ’s attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla by the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions , which asked workers around the world to stop unloading ships carrying Israeli goods .
For veteran Bay Area activists , today ’s victory echoed a historic milestone in 1984 , when ILWU workers in San Francisco refused to unload a ship called the Nedlloyd Kimberley , because its cargo came from South Africa .
Just 10 years later , Nelson Mandela was elected president , and apartheid – in its South African form – was dead .
With today ’s day shift cancelled , most of the picketers have now gone home to get caffeine , food , and rest , but we ’re not done yet : we ’re going back to the site at 4 o’clock this afternoon to put up another picket line , in hopes that the ILWU workers will again refuse to cross the line and unload the ship .
If you ’re in the Bay Area , be there or be square – it ’s your chance to make history .
Just head for the West Oakland BART at 4 to march or get a ride to Berth 58 .
There ’s more information here .
The Manomet Center analysis , however , concludes that there is only a small amount of such leftover wood , and that whole trees will have to be taken to fuel Massachusetts wood - burning power plants .
“ The study is not representative on how we plan to operate , ’’ he said .
Matt Wolfe of Madera Energy Inc. , which is proposing a wood - burning power plant in Greenfield , said the study incorrectly assumes whole trees would be cut to fuel the power plants .
Rather , he said , most wood for his plant would come from tree tops and branches left over from logging operations or from storm damage , land clearing for new development , or tree - trimming operations .
“ This industry , which has been around for 30 years , takes forest byproducts and combusts them in a way that is carbon neutral , ’’ said Bob Cleaves , president of the Biomass Power Association , a national industry group based in Maine .
Advocates of wood burning said that they had not had time to read the full study but that burning wood is renewable and has been viewed as such for years .
The study has important implications for policy as President Obama aims to lower US greenhouse gas emissions some 80 percent by 2050 to avoid the most serious consequences of man-made climate change .
Wood is projected to be one of the fastest - growing sources of renewable energy in the next decade , but if the benefits take too long to appear , policy makers under urgent deadlines may choose not to embrace it .
What ’s more , that increase in greenhouse gases can take a far longer time for forests to absorb than previously thought — a generation or more in many cases .
If a wood - burning power plant replaces a coal - fired one , it can take about 20 years before any net benefits are realized .
It can take more than 90 years if a wood - burning plant replaces a natural gas plant .
But the Manomet study shows that wood burning releases more heat - trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per unit of energy than oil , coal , or natural gas .
Wood burning has been promoted as a “ green ’ ’ energy source because growing forests can absorb the same amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted from burning wood , essentially canceling out the pollutants .
“ These findings have broad implications for clean energy and the environment in Massachusetts and beyond , ’’ said Ian Bowles , state secretary of energy and environmental affairs .
The six - month study by the Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences in Plymouth comes amid controversy over the proposed construction of two large wood - burning power plants in Western Massachusetts .
Burning wood to generate electricity can be worse for global warming than burning coal , according to a Massachusetts - sponsored study released yesterday .
That surprising conclusion immediately prompted state officials to reconsider substantial financial incentives provided to wood - burning plants .
The study indicates wood burning still may make sense in certain cases .
For example , heating buildings with wood is more efficient than wood - burning power plants , and it can start helping the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in as little as five years .
Wood - burning ’s environmental benefits can vary significantly , depending on the type of wood or piece of tree being burned , what kind of fossil fuel it is replacing , what type of energy it is producing , and how people manage forests , according to Tom Walker , the study team leader .
Many , but not all , types of wood burning create a “ carbon debt ’’ that growing forests gradually repay by reabsorbing gases before a “ carbon dividend ’’ begins .
Massachusetts has offered financial incentives for wood - burning power plants since 2002 , considering them to be part of a portfolio of renewable power along with wind and solar .
By 2020 , state electricity suppliers will be required to get 15 percent of their energy from such green sources .
Without the credits , wood burning is not competitive with more traditional forms of energy .
But when two large wood - burning ( also called biomass ) plants were proposed a few years later , in Russell and the one in Greenfield , a large and vocal group of residents opposed them , asserting they would be fueled by cutting trees on public and private lands across Massachusetts .
The controversy reached a crescendo last year , and in December , the state Department of Energy Resources suspended incentives for new wood - burning plants until the Manomet study could be completed .
Now that it is , Bowles said his agency will publicly review the study this summer , and develop new rules in the fall .
The suspension of credits for new plants will continue until then .
The study counters earlier estimates showing there is plenty of wood available for wood - burning power plants in the state , saying there would not be enough sustainably harvested wood to fuel even one large wood - burning plant .
Walker said the study tried to look at what was “ economically and socially available ’’ from the forests , meaning in part what landowners would realistically sell .
Jana S. Chicoine , who has led the fight against the Russell plant , said she was pleased at the findings , calling the study a “ policy earthquake .
We always made the case this was not a NIMBY issue but a policy failure and now we have the state saying exactly the same thing , ’’ she said .
John Hagan , president of the Manomet Center , said the report leaves policy makers with key questions .
“ Do you want to wait 10 , 20 , 30 years just to get to the point [ wood burning ] is as good as coal ?
That is a real social question :
Do we as a society want to make the climate worse before it gets better ? ’’

Image caption Moscow and Kiev are on friendlier terms again these days
The Ukrainian parliament has approved a bill that effectively rejects any ambition to join Nato .
The law , submitted by President Viktor Yanukovych , cements Ukraine 's status as a military non-aligned country - though it will co-operate with Nato .
President Yanukovych was elected earlier this year , vowing to end Ukraine 's Nato membership ambitions and mend relations with Russia .
His predecessor , Viktor Yushchenko , had pursued a pro-Western foreign policy .
Under him , relations with Moscow had declined dramatically , with the Kremlin refusing to talk to him .
Since his February inauguration , Mr Yanukovych has wasted no time in re-shaping Ukraine 's foreign policy in a more Moscow - friendly way , the BBC's David Stern in Kiev says .
In April , he agreed to extend the lease allowing Russia 's Black Sea fleet to be stationed in the southern port of Sevastopol by 25 years in return for cheaper gas .
An extension of the lease , due to expire in 2017 , had been opposed by Mr Yushchenko .
The main element of predictability and consistency in Ukraine 's foreign policy is its non-aligned status Mykola Azarov , Ukrainian Prime Minister
Moscow had made known its opposition to Ukraine 's plans to join Nato , and opinion polls indicate the majority of Ukrainians opposed Nato membership too , our correspondent reports .
The new bill bars Ukraine 's membership in any military bloc , but allows for co-operation with alliances such as Nato .
" The main element of predictability and consistency in Ukraine 's foreign policy is its non-aligned status , " Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said as he submitted the bill .
However , the new law will not affect Ukraine 's political and economic integration with Europe .
Joining the European Union remains a priority , Mr Azarov said .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A World War
Two bomb found in central Germany exploded on Tuesday , killing three people , as disposal experts were about to defuse it , local authorities said .
Six people were injured , two seriously , when the bomb dropped by Allied aircraft on the university town of Goettingen went off unexpectedly , the town ’s fire department said .
Authorities had evacuated thousands of residents beforehand so experts could defuse the 500 kg bomb , a fire department spokesman said .
Bombs left over from World War Two are regularly defused in Germany and rarely explode unexpectedly .
I was just amazed with the various furniture I saw in the video below , for they are space saving , extremely practical and are also really well designed .
They are more than a simple folding bed or an expanding table but actual transforming pieces that would be efficient within any apartment , room or home .
The maker is explaining throughout about the furniture design , but the video is totally worth watching !
The process , as explained by Resource Furniture , combines a Furniture Designer , a Mechanical Engineer and also a Hardware company to put together amazing sets that could make any room , studio apartment or space a lot more useful and enjoyable .
If you are more of a Geek , then you should definitely have a look at the Geeky Furniture we covered before or the Geeky Coffee Table Designs that could really be a fit in at least one room in every home .
Thanks Itamar for the tip !
It seems unthinkable , even now , that the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico could bring down the mighty BP .
But investment bankers get paid to think the unthinkable — and that is just what they are doing .
The idea that BP might one day file for bankruptcy , particularly as part of a merger that would enable it to cordon off its liabilities from the spill , is starting to percolate on Wall Street .
Bankers and lawyers are already sizing up potential deals ( and counting their potential fees ) .
Given the plunge in BP ’s share price — the company has lost more than a third of its value since Deepwater Horizon blew — some bankers and analysts say BP is starting to look like takeover bait .
The question is , who would buy BP , given its enormous potential liabilities ?
Shell and Exxon Mobil are both said to be licking their chops .
And already , flinty legal minds are dreaming up scenarios in which BP would file a prepackaged bankruptcy and separate the costs of the cleanup — and potentially billions of dollars in legal claims — into a separate corporate entity .
Damnable over - long game names .
YOU DENY US OUR PUNS , YOU BABBLING SWINE .
Grr. Anyway ( I lose track of how many posts I ’ve written whose second sentences begin with ‘ anyway ’ .
Anyway . ) at the 1C event during which I cooed at Men of War : Vietnam the other week , I was also privy to a few more details on 2011 ’s long - awaited sequel to mod -gone - pricetaggy FPS Red Orchestra .
The series began life as a multiplayer title , but this one , sometimes referred to as RO2 , will feature a solo mode .
While the game itself was n’t playable at the event , and the only video footage was a slideshow of screenshots , I do have in my possession a clutch of new screens and facts .
To see them , you must dance widdershins around Ludlow Cathedral at 4 am on the first night of the summer solstice .
The ancient legends do tell of another way to access them , but you could never hope to work it out .
Bugger .
Oh , here you go , then .
The additional mystic ritual of clicking on these blighters will enlarge and uncrop them – worth it , certainly , as they ’re a pretty - lookin ’ bunch , regardless of their browniness and , I suspect , posiness .
And here ’s some word - based info - splat too .
Apologies for the lack of commentary in this post , but I really have n’t seen anything of the game outside of this lot myself .
Quite impressed with the engine , though , and the surfeit of wide - open spaces would seem to suggest some frantic and large - scale fighting .
I do n’t doubt that veteran multiplayer FPS players will be glad of something fairly hardcore but blessed with modern visuals .
Oh – also worth mentioning that devs Tripwire Interactive ( who you ’ll also know from Killing Floor ) are working with the leading lights of the RO modding community on this one .
Hopefully that means a best of both worlds game – i.e. both fans and normals will be catered for .
More details on that setup here .
Finally , go press release !

OVERVIEW :
In this step we 're going to measure out three rectangles of known sizes , and make rectangles of masking tape of exactly these sizes -- one on each of our three surfaces .
It is important to note that the purpose of making these tape rectangles is to provide contrast for the photo you will shortly be taking .
That being said , it is important to select a tape color that provides good visual contrast with your wall .
SELECT SIZE OF RECTANGLES :
The size of the rectangles you select is , ultimately , an arbitrary decision -- but it will be influenced by :
Size of your printer / output device ( I was going to output to 24 " wide vinyl ... so I made my rectangles just a shade under 24 " )
( I was going to output to 24 " wide vinyl ... so I made my rectangles just a shade under 24 " )
Size and proportions of your image / logo ( My image was a circle .
So my 3 rectangles are roughly the same size .
If your logo has an eccentric shape , or is markedly off - center , you might want to make one / some of the rectangles larger or smaller . )
For my project , I selected rectangles of 22 " x 22 " , 22 " x 24 " , and 18 " x 18 " .
Yours will probably be different .
I chose slightly differing dimensions so that they would be visually distinct from one another ( so that the edges would be staggered ) .
This helped out quite a bit , and I would recommend doing this .
MEASURE AND MARK THE RECTANGLES ON THE WALL :
Use a pencil and measure out the rectangles by marking the correct distance from each wall .
If you have a combination square or a spirit level , these might help to double - check your measurements .
I 'm not saying that you have to have it exactly right down to the millimeter , but the more accurate you are at this stage the more accurate the transformation will be .
So , why not spend a little extra time on this step and get it as close as you can ?
TAPE THE PERIMETER OF EACH RECTANGLE :
You 're looking to make a " box " of masking tape for each of the three rectangles .
Look at the picture of the finished boxes to help you out if you 're having a hard time visualizing it .
Remember : Keep those taped lines level / plumb and keep your angles square !
I 've worked for years as a signmaker , so my visual sense of " level " is pretty ( preternaturally ) accurate ... if you 're having doubts about your ability to do it visually , it might be time to whip out the spirit level / combo square again at this point .
Lastly : take your X - Acto knife and trim away the excess tape leaving something close to perfectly square corners .
PROVIDE A CONTRASTING COLOR WHERE THE BLUE RECTANGLES TOUCH ONE - ANOTHER :
I mentioned that we 're gonna be photographing this , right ?
So , unless you want to drive yourself crazy staring at pixels in your image - editor and trying to decide where one blue shape stops and the next one begins , we should provide a visual " break " between the two boxes .
I used colored electricians tape .
In the final analysis , I would n't recommend this .
The tape was fussy and difficult to work with .
If you have an alternate color of masking tape , use that to define the edges .
Or use a thin bead of paint , or a marker , or stickers , or whatever you 'd like , but in summary :
Wherever one blue rectangle touches another blue rectangle on a different wall , provide a high - contrast visual break between the two .

Nathan Linder , a MIT student , turned a lamp , pico projector , webcam , and computer into a full blown robotic personal assistant that will change the way you view your desk lamp .
The LuminAR robotic lamp " sees " what you 're doing through its webcam and augments your actions accordingly .
It displays information , like web pages , videos , and more , through its pico projector and can even read and recognize user gestures and input .
The idea , according to Linder , is to " transform surfaces and objects into interactive spaces that blend digital media and information with the physical space " .
The only downside about this robotic desk lamp is that you 'll still need a regular desk lamp for light .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - BP
Plc on Tuesday said it will donate net revenues from oil recovered from its stricken Gulf of Mexico oil well to restore wildlife habitats on the coastlines of four affected Gulf Coast states .

“ BP is committed to protecting the ecosystems and wildlife on the Gulf Coast , ” BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said in a statement .
He said proceeds from the sale of oil recovered from the seven - week - old leak a mile beneath the water ’s surface “ will be used to further this commitment . ”
The possibility that BP might profit from sales of oil collected from the leak has fueled criticism toward the company .
John Hofmeister , former president of Royal Dutch Shell ’s U.S. operations and author of “ Why We Hate The Oil Companies ” said BP ’s plan was appropriate .
“ It ’s a diminimous amount relative to the total BP daily oil production , but symbolically , under the circumstances , it ’s the right thing to do , ” Hofmeister said .
BP ’s seabed oil collection efforts have brought in more than 73,000 barrels ( 3.06 million gallons / 11.6 million liters ) .
Of that , 22,000 barrels ( 924,000 gallons / 3.5 million liters ) came from a tube inserted into a leaking pipe last month .
That pipe was sheared from seabed equipment at the wellhead last week , and a containment cap placed atop its remnants has collected more than 51,000 barrels ( 2.1 million gallons / 8.1 million liters ) so far , according to BP .
At Tuesday ’s closing price of $ 71.99 for U.S. crude futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange , 73,000 barrels would sell for about $ 5.2 million .
That is a small fraction of BP ’s daily global production of 4 million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2010 .
A smaller fraction would be oil collected by skimming operations , which has reached about 368,000 barrels of oily water so far .
BP spokesman Jon Pack said that as gathered , the oily water is taken to various Gulf Coast refineries to separate water from the oil so it can be processed .
Pack could n’t say how much skimmed oil has been separated from water .
BP does n’t own all the oil .
Its partners , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co Ltd own 25 percent and 10 percent , respectively .
They would be owed proceeds on their portion of any sales .
Also , 8.7 percent of sales are owed to the U.S. government in royalties , Pack said .
The net revenue BP would donate to habitat protection and restoration would be its portion of the sales , he said .
BP has spent more than $ 1 billion so far on the overall response to the spill , from sea to shore , including efforts to rehabilitate oiled wildlife .

My mother is laid to rest with my Vermont - born father in the Mississippi Delta region of the state of Arkansas .
She rests not far from the family farm where she was born .
We still produce rice and soybeans there and family histories that break through the simplistic narrative produced by the national media about Sen.
Blanche Lincoln ’s Arkansas Democratic Party primary victory .
There are miles of Arkansas roads where tourists seldom go .
The food , farming and duck hunting are good .
The people are often generous and friendly .
And poverty and abandoned factories are easy to see .
The historic economic underdevelopment of the African American community is both a legacy of slavery , segregation and substandard schools and a result of generations of failed policies of tax cuts , deregulation and business - friendly governments in “ the land of opportunity . ”
African Americans and low - income European Americans or “ poor white folks ” suffer from low wages , low or no benefits , few unions and under - funded schools .
Football , good Southern or soul food and Christianity unite most .
There are many faces of Arkansas , but outside of a few outposts of organization the majority of Arkansas workers are unorganized , disorganized , atomized as workers .
Arkansas workers are organized around football , family , food , denominations and the military .
This is , after all , the state where Bill Clinton ran for governor on a platform of opposition to the state teachers union .
If you do n’t believe me , read Clinton ’s autobiography .
There was justice in the efforts of organized labor and MoveOn.org in sending millions to Arkansas to defeat the betrayer of the “ public option ” in health care reform and the enemy of the Employee Free Choice Act , none other than the so - called Democrat , Sen. Blanche Lincoln .
Although we came close to beating her , simply put : “ close does n’t cut it . ”
Many Democrats , disgusted with her performance , might just stay home in November .
Arkansas is full of Republicans who wo n’t .
The real issue is the unfulfilled historic legacy of organized labor ’s plans to organize the South .
Millions for a primary might have been the winning ticket if a real grassroots “ organize the South ” campaign , coordinated with all of labor together rather than piecemeal , had been in place .
The Farm Labor Organizing Committee ’s incredible victory organizing farm workers in North Carolina , and the United Food and Commercial Workers ’ victory at Smithfield ’s meatpacking “ super plant ” there , suggest the way forward .
Total commitment on the ground , real coordination , an army of “ do or die ” grassroots skilled organizers willing to take up the struggle against racism within the working class movement , would be the soul of such a campaign .
Nothing less will do .

A vulnerability on Facebook forced hundreds of thousands of users to endorse a series of webpages over the holiday weekend , making the social networking site the latest venue for an attack known as clickjacking .
The exploit works by presenting people with friend profiles that recommend — or " Like , " in Facebook parlance — links with titles including " LOL This girl gets OWNED after a POLICE OFFICER reads her STATUS MESSAGE . "
Those who click on the link see a page that 's blank except for the words " Click here to continue . "
Clicking anywhere on the page automatically forces the person to add the link to his list of Likes .
Clickjacking is a term that was coined in late 2008 by web application security researchers Jeremiah Grossman and Robert " RSnake " Hansen .
It describes attacks that allow malicious website publishers to control the links visitors click on .
Virtually every browser is vulnerable , although many browsers come with safeguards that can make exploitation harder .
The Facebook worm that hit over the weekend superimposes an invisible iframe over the entire page that links back to the victim 's Facebook page .
As a result , as long as the person is logged in , his profile automatically recommends the link to new friends as soon as the page is clicked on .
Twitter was attacked by a series of clickjacking exploits last year that forced users to publish tweets against their will .
The exploits stopped after company engineers finally tightened down their site .
Facebook engineers will undoubtedly follow suit , if they have n't already .
But this is n't the first time Facebook has been hit by clickjacking .
Sophos has more here . ®
This post was updated to correct a statement about Adobe Flash .
The animation software is just one of many many web - based technologies that can be abused in clickjacking attacks .
Man arrested over claim chef was ‘ tortured by broccoli ’
A member of staff at one of Britain ’s top restaurants has been arrested after two chefs alleged they were assaulted while working in the kitchen .
One chef claimed he had his trousers set on fire with a blow torch and had red - hot pans pressed on his arms .
He also says he was stung on the back of his neck with nettles while making a nettle risotto and was beaten with a rolling pin .
Boiling point : The Star Inn is at the centre of the allegations
He alleges he saw another chef being punished by being held aloft by his legs and having his head dunked in a vat of lukewarm broccoli and Stilton soup which was later served to guests at the Star Inn at Harome , North Yorkshire .
It was the first restaurant in Yorkshire to win a Michelin star .
North Yorkshire Police have arrested a 26 - year - old man at the centre of the allegations , said to have taken place earlier this year .
He has been released on police bail pending further inquiries .
Yesterday a police spokeswoman confirmed the allegations .
The Star Inn is co-owned by chef Andrew Pern , who is in his 30s , and his wife Jacquie .
Although the couple are separated , they still run the business .
Yesterday Ms Pern said : ‘ We are dealing with the matter in accordance with our employment procedures .
' We are taking the allegations extremely seriously . ’
The Star Inn is the Good Pub Guide County Dining Pub Of The Year for 2010 .

JOHANNESBURG  Kaka , Elano and Robinho are set to return to Brazil 's starting lineup for the World Cup second - round match against Chile on Monday , giving the team an attacking boost .
Coach Dunga may not be able to count on Felipe Melo , however , because the defensive midfielder injured his left ankle in Brazil 's 0 - 0 draw against Portugal on Friday .
Reserve midfielder Julio Baptista hurt his left knee also against Portugal and may not be available .
Kaka will be back from his suspension for the red card he received in the 3 - 1 win over Ivory Coast , while Elano should be fit after recovering from a right ankle injury that forced him out of Friday 's match in Durban .
Elano trained without restriction on Saturday and was n't bothered by the injury .
" I 'm upbeat because I practiced normally and did n't feel any pain , " he said .
Robinho was rested for the final Group G match against Portugal after a minor left thigh problem , but Brazil doctor Jose Luis Runco said the striker can return against Chile .
" I would have played against Portugal if it was a decisive match and Brazil had n't advanced yet , " Robinho said .
Without the three playmakers , Brazil struggled to create scoring opportunities and failed to get past Portugal 's defense at Moses Mabhida Stadium .
The result still gave Brazil first place in the group , but halted its seven - match winning streak .
The five - time champion had n't been held scoreless since a 0 - 0 home draw with Venezuela in a World Cup qualifier last October .
Dunga said the absence of the three regular starters , especially Robinho , played a part in Brazil 's failure to score .
" Robinho could 've given us an edge , " Dunga said .
" He can make a difference with his dribbles when there is not a lot of space , like it was the case against Portugal . "
Elano had scored a goal in each of Brazil 's first two matches , and Kaka and Robinho each had assists .
Daniel Alves replaced Elano on Friday , while Julio Baptista came in for Kaka and Nilmar for Robinho .
Nilmar came close to scoring when his close - range shot was tipped on to a post by goalkeeper Eduardo in the 30th minute .
Felipe Melo was substituted by Josue just before halftime , and Runco said the Juventus player is doubtful to face the Chileans at Ellis Park .
He twisted his ankle in a hard challenge from Portugal defender Pepe .
Pepe received a yellow card for the foul .
Felipe Melo minutes earlier had also received a yellow for a hard foul on Pepe .
Runco said Felipe Melo and Julio Baptista improved considerably from their injuries but were still receiving intensive treatment .
Felipe Melo has been a regular starter in Dunga 's team since making the squad just before last year 's Confederations Cup , which he helped Brazil win .
Wolfsburg 's Josue , which has n't play much with Brazil recently , will probably replace him against the Chileans .
Julio Baptista , who replaced the suspended Kaka against Portugal , was replaced by Ramires in the 82nd minute after twisting his knee .

For many years , an anonymous donor has provided very generous support to the Council for Secular Humanism , an affiliate of the Center for Inquiry ( CFI ) .
In recent years , this donor has given $ 800,000 annually .
This sum is equivalent to about 25 % of the annual combined public support for CFI and its two operating affiliates , Council and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry ( CSI ) .
It appears this donor will not be providing any gift this year .
No information has been forthcoming from the donor concerning the donor ’s intent , and repeated efforts to contact the donor have elicited no response .
In recent years , this major donation has been received within the first few months of the year .
Through the first four months of this year , the deficit for our combined operations has been over $ 300,000 , so the absence of the donation is already being felt .
Moreover , without the donation , we are on pace to have a deficit in excess of $ 900,000 .
We cannot possibly maintain operations with a deficit of this magnitude .
Given the significance of this donation , and the silence of the donor , CFI and its affiliates have had no choice but to undertake immediate drastic reductions in expenditures .
It has been extremely difficult to do so because last year we made a concerted , successful effort to streamline our operations and make them more efficient .
In fact , we reduced costs by over $ 600,000 , without materially affecting our work , with the exception of the suspension of The Jesus Project .
Now we are forced to cut down to the bone .
We are making very painful decisions — we are laying off several employees , and , although programs will continue , we are moving out of our offices in Tampa and Washington , D.C.
We are reluctant to take these measures , but as indicated , we have no choice .
We are trying to take as conservative an approach to this crisis as possible .
Our cost - saving measures will save us only about $ 120,000 in 2010 and about $ 330,000 in 2011 .
We are reluctant to slash more because of the adverse impact further reductions would have both on our programs and our staff .
But this means that if we are to sustain our operations and avoid further reductions , we need our supporters to rally behind us .
Given the extraordinary situation , we need an extraordinary outpouring of support .
Religious dogma and pseudoscience are not going away .
Today , more than ever , there is a need to defend science , secularism , and humanist values .
Together , CFI , CSI , and the Council do more to advance humanism and science than any other organization .
And together , the supporters of CFI , CSI , and the Council can ensure that this important work continues .
We ask you to stand with us so we can meet this daunting financial challenge .
Please
donate
as generously as you can — today .
Thank you for your commitment and support .
If you prefer to donate by telephone , please call

And that 's why it is ridiculously obvious that when the Miss USA Organization , co-owned by Trump and NBC television , released a racy video lingerie photo shoot of this year 's contestants ... the sole purpose was to pump up the ratings for this Sunday night 's telecast of the 2010 pageant on NBC .
The photos seemed designed to generate controversy and buzz about the pageant , TODAY 's Matt Lauer suggested to pageant president Paula Shugart .
" Yes , to some degree it 's marketing , " Shugart admitted
Is this what the Miss USA represents ?
It used to be all - American girls , the leaders of the future .
These are the leaders of the future ?
Son of a bitch ...
Posh Spice is smoking hot
I.No .
This past pageant got 6.6M , which is the same as last year .
You may be tempted to think that these scandals are blown up in the media in order to boost ratings for the pageant .
Yet while everyone knows about the controversies , you can't find one person ( other than me ) who actually watched the pageant .
The marketing has all failed , from Vanessa Williams to Carrie Prejean .
Why would they think seeing half naked women in lingerie would entice me to want to watch them fully clothed ?
Whoops ?
IIa .Wrongolongoria .
The controversy is n't to get viewers to watch the Pageant , the controversy is to get viewers to watch the Today Show .
Shows do n't operate on their own , they 're soldiers in a standing army .
Miss USA is run by the Miss Universe Organization , owned by Donald Trump and NBC Universal , which is co-owned by GE and Vivendi .
That means the Miss USA pageant can be enjoyed as a loss leader for MSNBC , NBC , USA Network , Bravo , A&E , Hulu , Activision / Blizzard , and Universal Studios .
And rival media is free to capitalize on it if they want .
Oh , is she Muslim ?
Then off to Fox News and Glen Beck and etc .
You think CBS is talking about it because they want to boost NBC 's ratings ?
Whenever someone talks about a television 's show 's ratings as if they have valuable information , punch them in the mouth .
IIb .
Small aside : if the game is eyeballs , then it becomes less relevant that they get the facts straight once you are watching ; only that you watch .
If you 're watching this Fahrenheit 500 deliver the business news from a bar , you 're probably not worried about accuracy .
Why do I suddenly want a drink and a plane ticket ?
III .CBS
News , unaffiliated with the pageant but hey , it 's news , right ?
gets to ask , " Are Rima Fakih 's Sexy Shots [ of her in the stripping contest ]
Any Worse Than The Lingerie Photos ?
The answer , obviously , is yes , they are worse , they are much worse , and by worse I mean much better .
If I have only one click left , I wanna see the stripper pole .
Lingerie ?
What is this , the set of Falcon Crest ?
Bring on the pole .
" Americans are a puritanical lot that can't handle sexuality . "
Oh , no , they handle it just fine , otherwise it would n't be everywhere .
They just can't handle it when they 're
When you 're by yourself and the sex scene in a rated R movie comes on , do you change the channel ?
" It seems wrong to watch the expression on her face change as she mounts him .
I choose to turn away .
" But with every passing year of marriage those scenes frustrate , you try to avoid them .
Not when you 're Alone , of course , but when you 're watching with your spouse : you worry it is reminding them how inadequate you have become .
It happens also when you 're with people you 're not intimate with .
Are they watching how you are watching it ?
If you 're too interested , will they think you 're a pervert , and if you appear bored , will they think you 're a prude ?
So there 's dead silence as everyone in the room pretends they 're not pretending .
The word for all of this is shame .
It 's perfectly normal to feel this way .
But you chose this world , this is the one you wanted .
What kind of a world is it where we want sexuality in everything , have normalized sexuality in everything , but are ashamed to be caught looking at it ?
A world that prefers to be alone , of course .
IV.A quick word on the homosexualization of public sexuality , or , what 's up with all the naked guys in ads and movies nowadays ?
Is everyone gay ?
No .
Otherwise it would n't work .
When a guy gets caught watching a naked girl in a movie , he 's got some pretending or explaining to do .
When a guy gets caught looking at a naked guy in a movie , he still gets the signifier of sexuality to use any way he wants , but without the shame .
That the ladies might like it is an added plus .
V. There 's a simple reason why the stripping pics are " worse " than the lingerie pics : she wasto pose in lingerie ; sheto strip on her own .
If there is one thing that makes Americans -- or at least the media , which both reflects and creates American tastes -- nervous , it is n't sex , but sex that it can't control .
Maybe it 's a uniquely American thing , maybe not : as long as sex / iness comes with a price tag , we 're ok with it .
Controlled , manufactured , artificial -- safe .
Lingerie shoot ?
" She had to do that for the pageant . "
Oh , so that 's the answer .
It 's not real .
But if she 's caught stripping for fun , then ... what does that say about me ?
The feminist argument is it sets a standard for women that they are forced to at least wonder about .
" How can I compete ? "
But it 's worse for men .
Playboy is fine . drives us bananas .
" They do it ... for nothing ?
They 're willing to get naked on camera for nothing ... yet every time I try to be nice and buy one of them a drink , they wo n't even look at me ...
I do n't get it , I do n't get it ... " Wanton displays of sexuality leave no room for rationalizations .
" That kind of girl only wants a rich guy . "
But she did it forSo ?
America tends to be deferential to prostitutes and porn stars , because it understands them .
It 's powerless against sluts .
Which is why we call them sluts in the first place .---

A unique rental and opportunity
Once completed , the new Florida dome will be available to rent on a weekly basis .
During non-rental times , the home will be open for scheduled tours .
Being able to actually live in a dome before building one is an opportunity that the Siglers would have found extremely advantageous .
Although they have toured nine domes , the Siglers would have liked to have experienced life in a dome before making the major investment of actually building one .
Seeing the Eye of the Storm on Sullivan ’s Island was the decision maker .
“ That home was proof that domes could be built beautifully , ” said Valerie Sigler .
“ We feel privileged to provide people who are curious about domes or those contemplating building a dome a chance to live in one first .
We have spent so much time , effort , and energy researching this technology that we are thrilled to share the information and experience with others .
It is our hope that opening our home to visitors will increase awareness of the dome ’s advantages .
At the same time , we are dedicated to building a beautiful structure whose appearance will expedite the dome ’s acceptance in upscale neighborhoods , ” The Siglers .
Getting neighborhood approval
Before the Siglers were allowed to build the dome , they had to provide written confirmation of acceptance from their neighbors before the Santa Rosa Island Authority would approve the conceptual plans .
An overwhelming 97 % of neighbors and business owners were encouraging and very supportive .
Having also been victims of hurricanes and rising insurance costs , the islanders were eager to learn about a structure that is built to survive the harsh beach environment .
“ When we were canvassing the area , we were amazed at how many people had wanted to build domes , investigated domes , or had family and friends interested in domes .
Most said they had not pursued their desire to build a dome because they did not want to conquer the opposition of the neighbors .
We think the timing was opportune for introducing the dome into the beach neighborhood because of the extensive storm damage our island has received .
We received excited anticipation rather than glares as we contacted our fellow islanders , ” said Mark Sigler .
Researching hurricane survival
In 1995 , after Hurricanes Erin and Opal severely damaged their home , Mark began researching building techniques that would alleviate such extensive devastation .
What he discovered was the Monolithic Dome .
Withstanding 300 + mph winds , storm surges , termites , rising energy costs , fires , and even earthquakes , airformed concrete domes are almost indestructible .
Mark knew that it would be a true sanctuary , a place to come home to — even after a hurricane .
Having a home to return to after a hurricane would be a tremendous relief and comfort .
“ Knowing that the structure one calls home can also be a sanctuary , brings a sense of peace and comfort , ” asserts Valerie Sigler .
“ Our desire is to reduce the human suffering associated with the destruction of one ’s home in a natural disaster .
We want to cultivate and promote awareness of the superior building technologies that can alleviate unnecessary loss .
Many of the new technologies are more energy efficient and environmentally benign than their predecessors .
Protecting the delicate balance of the barrier island while building structures is the ultimate goal , ” state the Siglers .
Blending with the environment
Taking into account the pristine white beaches , the dunes , the emerald waters , and the peaceful nature of the environment , the Siglers wanted to create a home that would blend with and compliment its surroundings .
Designed to be environmentally friendly with its low impact nature , the air and tension support structure can thrive in the harsh beach environment and has the ability to merge into the landscape .
By utilizing the latest technologies , the Siglers hope to build an example of a structure that makes logical sense in the humid and harsh beach environment .
When visiting the island of Malta in 1999 , Mark was very affected by the age of the houses there .
He said , “ The beautiful limestone homes were centuries old , housing generations of a family .
What an incredible legacy to leave your family — a home that has withstood the test of time ; a home that is created to thrive in its environment ; a home that shelters and is a refuge in the storms of life .
The reality that one could build a home that embraces these ideals was right before our eyes . ”
Although not made from Malta limestone , the concrete Airform structure could offer a home that would last for generations .
Their Dome of a Home
Construction of the Monolithic Dome began in March 2002 .
Bob Bissett is the genius designer who educated the Siglers about the newest technologies and also drew the construction documents .
The Siglers welcome a home that is designed to welcome them after the hurricanes have dissipated .
And they invite you to visit their Dome of a Home website .
FEMA Grant Awarded to Sigler Family of Pensacola Beach , Florida
by Kris Garrison , Editor
Due to the flood district that exists in Escambia County , Florida , 11,000 residents of the county received a letter from the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program ( FEMA - sponsored ) stating that if their property had been flooded at least three times and they have had a unspecified dollar amount of damage , they were eligible to apply for a FEMA sponsored grant .
The spirit of the grant was to mitigate damage caused by the floods .
The grant offered three options : 1 ) Demolish existing house and begin a new structure 2 ) FEMA buy out the property 3 ) Elevate the existing structure .
The Siglers went to work on their application .
What started out as a 22 - page application became a thick notebook containing the application and pages of information about the benefits of building a Monolithic Dome in a hurricane / flood prone area .
Their notebook traveled to FEMA ’s regional office in Atlanta , Georgia and caught the interest of The Institute for Business and Home Safety .
After quite some time , the Siglers received a letter stating their application had been advanced to the next stage .
The Siglers opted for replacing their original home with a Monolithic Dome .
Valerie Sigler said , “ We were hoping that proposing something unusual would catch their eye and it did ! ”
The Siglers were awarded the FEMA grant which provides 75 % of eligible cost .
The dome shell is considered eligible costs .
All remaining cost will be paid for by the Siglers .
As of May 1 , 2002 , their Monolithic Dome has been inflated .
Pensacola Beach virtually destroyed , but Dome of a Home still stands !
Hurricane Ivan Report from Dome of a Home
by Valerie Sigler
September 17 , 2004
Mark ’s decision to stay in Dome of a Home with the news crew from MSNBC during category 4 Hurricane Ivan was a testament to his faith in the structure that we had built .
Kerry Sanders , the MSNBC correspondent , had been reporting on hurricanes for twenty - one years .
He also felt confident in the engineering and design of the home .
As I stayed in contact with Mark throughout the evening as Hurricane Ivan approached , he expressed surprise and delight with how well the structure was responding .
Live coverage was broadcast on MSNBC until the equipment succumbed to the storm .
2:30 AM — The eye of Hurricane Ivan is now making landfall .
Pensacola Beach is in absolutely the worst position ( upper right hand quadrant – east ) as the storm arrives .
Most of the MSNBC crew is asleep .
Asleep ?
I guess that is testament to the confidence the crew had in the home and the fact that the noise from the storm was not unbearable .
Mark is awake listening as the wind intensifies and the water is crashing across the island .
The storm surge and rain caused five feet of water to rise underneath the dome .
Mark says he can hear debris crashing into the dome , but does not feel any movement of the dome from the surging Gulf although the water is flowing over the entire island .
Although he has no visual confirmation , he said it sounds like there are tornadoes howling around the island .
The most unnerving sensation is the realization that there is no land until you reach Gulf Breeze .
7:30 AM — Daylight has brought devastating visuals of a storm whose damage far exceeds that of Hurricane Opal in 1995 .
Dome of a Home has maintained its structural integrity !
Everyone is safe and the home will be livable again with some necessary repairs .
We did have wind driven rain leak through the windows and flood the floors .
The good news is that the dome is still standing , albeit with some exterior damage from the staircases that were ripped away by the waves .
The geo - thermal system is damaged , the fences gone , and the garage concrete floor has disappeared .
Mark has been traipsing across the island and says that the devastation is extensive .
All lower floors are gone with the blow - out walls doing exactly as designed — being blown away , literally .
It seems evident the entire beach was covered with at least 5 feet of water .
All of the garages and their concrete floors have disappeared .
The Catholic Church ’s roof has sustained much damage and the school looks like it has been hit hard .
Homes that were older and still on the ground level have basically vanished .
The surge has subsided on the Gulf side , but the Sound side of the island is still under waist deep water .
After Ivan Came Dennis : Dome of A Home fairs well and Florida residents start to clean up
by Rebecca South , Editor
July 11 , 2005
Hurricane Dennis , which made landfall on Sunday afternoon on Pensacola Beach , Florida , did not pack the punch Floridians had feared .
Thankfully , Dennis did not do as much damage as his big brother Ivan did last year .
CNN Reports :
In the western Florida Panhandle , where the storm crashed ashore Sunday afternoon with 120 mph winds and storm surges higher than 10 feet , the memory of last September ’s Hurricane Ivan tempered reactions , despite mountains of debris .
“ Without the Ivan experience , we would have thought this was a terrible experience , ” said Hunter Walker , administrator of Santa Rosa County .
I have not yet heard from the Siglers as to the details of their home ’s state , nor the surrounding area , but from news reports and information from other sources , it looks like Dome of a Home is a -okay .
July 10 , 2005
Hurricane Dennis is due to hit Pensacola Beach , Florida in a matter of hours .
Unlike last year , no one is risking it by staying on the beach during the storm .
According to CNN , Hurricane Dennis is an even stronger , more dangerous storm than Hurricane Ivan .
The CNN website reports : Dennis ( a Category 4 storm ) is stronger than Hurricane Ivan — a Category 3 storm which pounded the Gulf Coast after it came ashore last September near Gulf Shores , Alabama .
At 12 p.m. ET Sunday , Dennis was centered 65 miles south - southeast of Pensacola , Florida .
The hurricane is moving north - northwest at near 18 mph .
Its maximum sustained winds were at 140 mph .
The storm was expected to keep turning to the north - northwest as it approached shore .
Monolithic received this email from Valerie Sigler this morning :
We are not staying in the house — no media to help educate the public , so there is no point in risking anyone ’s life .
After Hurricane Ivan , no one in the media seems too eager to stay .
When Jim Cantore ( of the Weather Channel ) says there is no way he is staying , that is good enough for me .
Everyone is just devastated .
And frustrated !
Again !
We have all depleted our reserves of energy , optimism , money , and physical ability to deal with the repeated hits .
What is truly frustrating is the debris that will soon become flying projectiles , surfing concrete slabs , and dumpsters transformed into floating battering rams .
It is absolutely criminal that there was no official mandate requiring the removal of the dumpsters .
Houses that have been repaired will be destroyed by the metal boats pounding the home over and over in the wave action .
If FEMA is truly trying to mitigate further damage , they would require the removal of such items , not to mention all of the FEMA trailers still left on the beach .
Last month , to the day , we had a wake – up call with Tropical Storm Arlene .
It was obvious then that we were not ready for a major storm .
Was this trial run utilized ?
No , we still have so much debris to contend with 10 months later that essentially we would have major damage with even a minor storm .
A minor hurricane will pick up the projectiles and float the debris and cause tremendous damage .
So , what we have here is the UNNECESSARY potential for something minor to become major because no one took responsibility to have the dumpsters and debris dealt with .
Negligence beyond belief .
My stairs were ready for their final coating .
I hope they will fair better than last time , but if it is the stairs versus a dumpster , the stairs will be destroyed .
I just do n’t know .
I do know each storm is so different , so we can only wait and wait .
Media has been showing up as we prepare to leave .
Several newspapers , news channels , even radio has contacted us .
It is pretty routine by now .
But , not near as interesting a story since no one is staying in it during the storm .
Human interest is the key .
I just hope we have a success story after the storm .
July 9 , 2005
Note : Valerie wrote the following letter to her much loved home and was gracious enough to share it with us .
My Dear Sweet Serenity ,
As we once again prepare you to face Mother Nature ’s fury , I want to share a moment with you .
So we can sit quietly together , I filled you with beautiful sounds of peaceful music instead of fearful rhetoric .
I feel your Spirit of strength gives me the courage to leave you alone to face the storm .
When people assume I want to stay only to protect my investment , they underestimate my love for you .
You ’re my child .
Such intense labor pains , but such a beautiful creation .
I really feel like we were only midwives assisting the birth of a home destined to be .
Ironically , or maybe not so ironically , today is the memorial service for Jonathan Zimmerman , the architect that designed you .
Last month , he succumbed to cancer .
We were scheduled to be in San Francisco today to pay our respects .
Instead , we ’re preparing you , his creation , to do what you were designed to do : not to compete with Mother Nature , but to work with her .
I have asked Jonathan to stand guard to protect you .
Yes , I believe you have a guardian angel now .
So , you really wo n’t be weathering the storm alone .
Jonathan will be there with you .
I asked Granny and Grandpa to show up , too .
So , I think you will not be quite so lonely .
No partying .
I do worry about that , you know .
I mean , the lonely part , not the partying .
Serenity , I want you to know how deeply you ’re loved .
Hundreds and hundreds of people tell us how much they love you , how you are their favorite house , how they drove miles and miles just to see you , how much fun they had vacationing with you .
You even had guests from the UK fly all the way to Florida just to play the guitar and to resonate with your music .
You are a celebrity .
How many people can boast of your media success in less than two years ’ time .
The media from Saudi Arabia , the UK , Canada , Germany , and the United States has placed your picture across the globe , quite literally .
You made your debut in so many venues : the Weather Channel , the Travel Channel , National Geographic , MSNBC news , Countdown with Keith Olbermann , Scarborough Country , Discovery Channel , Good Morning America , ABC news , Fox news , and the list goes on .
Your fame and reputation baqua square according to Feng Shui is the screened in porch that protrudes on the north side .
It ’s definitely been working overtime .
I need to place more emphasis in the wealth and prosperity area .
What good is all that fame , if we ca n’t afford to keep you ?
Anyway , I just want to tell you that we and a lot of other people love you dearly .
I love you dearly .
We are all with you in Spirit .
You have been an inspiration to many , including us .
Love , Valerie

Less than a year after Hurricane Ivan ravaged the coastline of Pensacola Beach , Floridians are facing another evacuation , hurricane and possibly disaster .
In an email the Monolithic Dome Institute received last week from Valerie Sigler in Pensacola Beach , she said , “ This area still looks devastated from last year ’s storms .
I am grateful we built the dome .
Feels like the safest place in town .
We were under tornado warnings [ July 5th ] and [ July 6th ] from Tropical Storm Cindy ’s arrival .
I just went back to sleep , not worried about it .
What a wonderful feeling . ”
CNN Reports :
The three - day forecast projection for Dennis has the storm striking Sunday afternoon near Pensacola , Florida at either Category 3 or 4 , depending on how much the storm strengthens over the warm waters of the Gulf .
Escambia County , which includes Pensacola , officials ordered evacuations of coastal and low - lying areas beginning 7 p.m. ET Friday , including the resorts of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key .
Ten shelters have been opened for evacuees .
Deja Vu
This must feel like Deja Vu to Mark and Valerie Sigler of “ Dome of a Home . ”
In September of 2004 Pensacola Beach , Florida was deserted due to evacuation orders , but the Siglers had permission to stay because of their Monolithic Dome home .
The Siglers were n’t alone .
They served as gracious hosts to NBC News reporters on the day prior to the storm as they set up cameras in and outside the dome .
Reporters stayed through the night broadcasting live as often as possible .
Before the eye approached , Pensacola reporters clenched railings on the front porch while reporting to America and gauging wind speeds as often as possible .
At one point during the night , after recording a 65 - mile an hour wind speed and practically yelling to be heard over the fierce wind , one reporter chose to go inside the dome to visit with Mark .
It was obvious upon entering the dome that it was not only quiet and strong , but provided a safe haven from the storm .
Mark gave the reporter an explanation of dome construction and bragged about the dome ’s strength , engineering and safety .
Note :
This article is a combination of several pieces written about Dome of a Home in 2002 - 2005 .
A goal by David Villa in the 61st minute proved to be the game - winner as Spain won its first World Cup title , defeating Brazil in the final of the 2010 tournament in South Africa .
Before fans get caught up in any irrational exuberance hear this — the match was part of a blink - of - the - eye computer simulation using EA Sports ’ 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa videogame , which went on sale on April 27 , on an Xbox 360 system to play the entire 32 - team , 64 - game tournament that will not begin , for real , until next June 11 when the hosts face Mexico in Johannesburg .
The 90 - minute match took the computer game only 15 minutes to play .
( Games can also be played online against far - flung opponents … you know , the world ’s game . )
“ The game is a real - world representation , ” Matt Prior , EA Sports ’ game producer , said in a telephone interview .
“ We have a massive group of data collectors in each area of the world and those guys , all fanatics , collect player attributes like speed , strength and tackling , over 40 attributes for each player and we feed all that data into the computer . ”
The realistic simulation , which in addition to the 32 teams in South Africa includes data on 199 national teams , is a close cousin of the FIFA 10 ( and the forthcoming FIFA 11 ) videogame franchise that saw more than two billion games played online last year around the world .
Both are available for Xbox , Wii and Sony PlayStation consoles .
Some tournament “ highlights ” : South Africa became the only World Cup host not to advance past the first round ; the United States lost to England , 2 - 1 , in its first match , but then beat Slovenia and Algeria to advance to the knockout round ( where it lost to Germany in a penalty kick shootout ) ; only African two teams advanced past the first round , but both were eliminated , Cameroon by Italy , 2 - 1 , and Nigeria by France , 2 - 1 ; England beat Australia , 3 - 1 , in the Round of 16 , defeated France , 2 - 1 , in the quarterfinals , but was ousted by Brazil in the semifinals in , what else , a shootout .
Prior said the game ’s developers have fine - tuned the program and added several features that make the game more realistic .
The game now take account of games played at altitude , which effects players ’ stamina and the physics of the ball .
Using a feature called Dynamic DNA , players during the real World Cup will benefit from tournament statistics that can be downloaded and incorporated into games .
Players can even go back to qualifying matches and , for example , jump to the point in the France - Ireland playoff match when Thierry Henry was about to handle the ball and change the result , not to mention history .
“ We constantly get calls from real players who play the game to suss out the opposition , ” Prior said .
“ In England , all the big stars play it and they want tips and often criticize the way they are portrayed in the game . ”
In the “ final , ” Brazil takes a 1 - 0 lead in the 30th minute on a goal by Felipe Melo .
Twelve minutes later , Spain ’s David Villa , the tournament ’s leading scorer with seven goals , tied the match , and then tallied the eventual game winner in the 61st minute from a cross by Andrés Iniesta .
Cesc Fàbregas added an insurance goal in the 88th minute for Spain .

The mayor said it has a " stylish , swooshing exterior "
Final designs for London's " new Routemaster bus " have been unveiled .
The double - decker uses green technology to be 40 % more efficient , it has two staircases and an open platform enabling people to " hop - on hop - off " .
London Mayor Boris Johnson said the new bus for the capital would be " iconic " and " beautiful " .
A spokesman for Transport for London hoped the bus , which has three doors to speed up boarding , would be in service in 2012 .
A Transport for London spokesman said the bus would be 15 % more fuel efficient than existing hybrid buses , and 40 % more efficient than conventional diesel double deckers and much quieter on the streets .
It has a " glass swoop " at the back and " an asymmetric design for the front - end completes the futuristic look " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Johnson said : " This iconic new part of our transport system is not only beautiful , but also has a green heart beating beneath its stylish , swooshing exterior . "
He added : " I expect to eventually have hundreds of these on London 's roads , and for cities around the globe to be beside themselves with envy for our stunning red emblem of 21st Century London . "
Peter Hendy , London 's Transport commissioner , said : " Designing and building a new bus exclusively for London is an exciting project to be working on and one of which we are all proud .
" This beautifully designed , environmentally friendly vehicle built for the capital will be loved by Londoners for many years to come . "
Stop and notice Mark Nodder , group managing director of manufacturer Wrightbus , said : " I think the design is genuinely groundbreaking , people are really going to stop and notice these buses on the streets of London . "
In December 2005 the original Routemaster was withdrawn from general service on accessibility and environmental grounds , but it is still used on two heritage routes in London .
In July 2008 , a competition was launched by Mr Johnson to design a new Routemaster bus for the capital , attracting 700 entries .
Warwickshire - based sports car maker Aston Martin , along with architects Foster and Partners , won the £ 25,000 prize jointly with Wiltshire bus maker Capoco Design .
The contract to build the new bus for London was awarded to Wrightbus in January 2010 .

In any modern account of the history of India Pale Ale , you ’ll generally find a declaration that the casks of well - hopped beer sent out to India by ship via the Cape of Good Hope in the late 18th century matured and developed quickly in a way that the same beer kept at home in Britain did not .
It was this accelerated maturation in a short time ( three to four months or so ) caused by travelling through the warm waters and hot climate of the central Atlantic and the Indian Ocean as the sailing ships twice crossed the equator that gave IPA the character that was so much appreciated by expatriate Britons in Bombay , Madras and Calcutta , supposedly .
But is this actually true ?
You ’ll be pushed to find contemporary ( that is , 18th and 19th century ) confirmation of the “ hot maturation ” theory for IPA ’s popularity in India .
Contemporary writers talked about the enthusiasm with which IPA was consumed in the Indian heat , but never seemed to mention whether it was altered to the good on its way east .
Certainly “ hot maturation ” ca n’t be the cause for any popularity for IPA back in Britain , since if the beer did go through any accelerated changes on the voyage to the sub - continent , this could n’t be happening to the beer stored in chilly cellars back home .
Are current writers on beer guilty of assumptionism ( otherwise known as “ you ’re making this up ” ) , the crime of assuming without evidence that situation A must surely have brought about result B – that beer on board a sailing ship travelling through the tropics must surely have matured quickly ?
For the defence , there is irrefutable evidence that wine certainly undergoes accelerated maturation when heated over months : this is precisely what happens in the making of Madeira .
And how did the style of wine known as Madeira originate ?
Why , by casks of wine being bought on the island of Madeira , in the Atlantic , by the officers of sailing ships on their way to India from Europe .
When it arrived in India , having been heated to temperatures of 40C ( 104 F ) or more for months in the holds of the wooden ships as they travelled under the baking sun , the Madeiran wine had acquired a new , fuller , deeper , rounder flavour .
After the wine makers back on Madeira discovered what had happened to their product on its journey east , and how it was more popular ( and could be sold for a higher price ) because of the changes brought about by hot maturation , they artificially recreated at home the conditions on board the India - bound ships .
By heating their wines in tanks surrounded by pipes full of steam , keeping the contents of the tanks at 40C for months , the Madeiran wine makers were able to produce vintages that had undergone the same changes as the wine that had been at sea for 12 or 16 weeks under the sun .
Subsequent scientific studies have shown that for every 10C ( 18 °F ) increase in temperature , the ageing rate of wine doubles in the case of “ low energy barrier ” reactions and leaps an amazing eight times in the case of “ high energy barrier ” reactions .
In other words , at 43C , compared to a cellar temperature of 13C ( 55 F ) , some ageing reactions are happening eight times faster , and others a staggering 448 times faster .
A wine spending three months at 43C , therefore , will have some of the characteristics of a wine that has spent two years in a cellar , and some of the characteristics of a wine that has spent 112 years in a cellar .
Not all of those reactions will produce good results of course : the Madeirans were lucky that their wine evolved very well under hot maturation conditions .
But does the same thing actually happen with beer ?
Pete Brown wrote a best - selling book , published last year , in which he took a cask of Burton - brewed IPA to India by ship .
He decided that , yes , the ship - borne beer had aged better and matured more than the same brew kept at home .
But while I ’m not knocking his huge achievement in organising the trip ( and getting an excellent , highly readable book out of it ) , Pete himself never actually drank ship - borne IPA alongside stay - at - home IPA .
Earlier this year I decided I had the opportunity to conduct an experiment myself to test the “ hot maturation ” theory .
Take two 75cl bottles of Meantime Brewery ’s fine naturally conditioned IPA , 7.5 per cent abv , made in Greenwich , with East Kent Golding hops like the original IPAs .
Leave one sitting in a cool cupboard in West London .
Take the other by aircraft to the Middle East and place it , wrapped in a thick black plastic bag , outside on a shaded Abu Dhabi balcony for three months .
Turn the bottle over occasionally to stir up the yeast inside and try to reproduce the sometimes violent rocking that casks of ship - borne IPA must have suffered on their journey from Britain to the sub-continent .
In Abu Dhabi the beer would undergo temperatures that rose as high as 45C ( 113 F ) , and seldom , if at all , dropped below 26C ( 79 F ) even at night .
Fly the bottle back to London , open it alongside its non-traveller companion and contrast and compare .
I was lucky to have a professional brewer to help me do the contrasting and comparing : Steve Wright , top man in the mashing and pitching department at Hopback Brewery in Salisbury .
He ’s an old friend of a couple of very old friends of mine , and Steve and I were both invited to a barbecue our mutual pals were holding .
I took along the two bottles of Meantime IPA so that he could give his expert take on the experiment .
The result was a relief , because I ’ve been repeating the “ hot maturation ” meme myself when writing about IPA , with the growing fear that it might not actually have any reality .
But the two bottles , stay - at - home IPA and three months in the Gulf heat IPA , were unmistakably different , the beer that had made a 7,000 - mile round trip instantly recognisable .
The bottle that had been in the heat certainly was n’t noticeably oxidised , skunked or suffering from any other fault , Steve and I agreed , and it was very drinkable .
More than this , the IPA that had stood on the Tropic of Cancer being gently baked was deeper , rounder than the same beer that had been kept in conditions no hotter than a chilly English Spring .
With the hot - matured IPA the Goldings “ Seville orange ” was even more marmalade -y , the malt more rotund , more caramelly .
The stay - at - home IPA was silver trumpets , with everything higher , brighter ; the well - travelled , “ maderised ” version was golden trombones , a baritone to its brother ’s tenor .
Which one was better ?
I liked them both very much , and I wished I had taken more bottles with me , and kept more at home , to make more side - by - side comparisons .
If the stay - at - home beer just had a fetlock ahead of the “ hot matured ” beer , this was probably , I think , because we were drinking something that had not been designed to undergo a “ maderisation ” process :
I ’m sure a beer could be made to thrive even more when subject to hot maturation than Meantime ’s IPA did .
Surprisingly , this is an experiment that seems not to have been done very much : Dr John Harrison of the Durden Park Beer Club , the British home - brew group that specialises in recreating old beer recipes , kept a well - hopped IPA in a cask in his shed over an English summer at least once , and we tasted the results at the seminar the British Guild of Beer Writers held on IPA at the old Whitbread brewery in London in 1994 .
But an English summer wo n’t reach the temperatures even a Gulf spring will , and the changes to the beer will be nothing like as pronounced .
I suggest that if you want to try this one at home , you ’ll have to be able to keep your beer at or above 40C for extended periods , and not let it drop below 26 C at any time .
That means , for professional brewers , a brewery somewhere in or near the tropics where casks can be stored in hot shade , or a heated storeroom , or a set of Madeira - style tanks warmed up by steam pipes or their equivalent .
For any brewer wanting to supply a particularly “ authentic ” form of IPA , however , I ’d suggest “ hot maturation ” for three months is just the gimmick to put you ahead of your rivals .
Your customers will certainly be able to taste the difference .
SACRAMENTO , Calif ( Reuters ) -
The board of Calpers , the biggest U.S. public pension fund , voted on Wednesday to ask California ’s government for an additional $ 600 million in funding to bolster its finances .
The vote by the board of the $ 202 billion California Public Employees ’ Retirement System comes as Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers face the arduous task of balancing the state government ’s books , which requires closing a budget gap of more than $ 19 billion .
The request by Calpers for more money will increase the state government ’s contribution to the retirement system for its next fiscal year , which begins July 1 , by 18 percent to $ 3.9 billion .
The cost of California ’s public pensions has become a top political issue in the state -- so much so that Schwarzenegger has said he will not sign a budget plan unless it has provisions to reduce those costs .
Calpers has said it requires more state money because its members are retiring earlier and living longer , and because of investment losses during the recession .
Calpers President Rob Feckner acknowledged the fund ’s request would come at a difficult time , but said the board ’s fiduciary duty requires it .
“ Whether it ’s a hard political sell or not , it ’s our job , ” Feckner told Reuters .
Calpers ’ board also voted to raise health - care premiums by an average 9.1 percent for the fund ’s nearly 1.3 million health program members starting in January 2011
Separately , Calpers Chief Investment Officer Joseph Dear said he sees recent turmoil in financial markets arising from Europe ’s financial woes underscoring fragile nerves among investors .
“ We ’re concerned , but this downturn and volatility seems to be an overreaction , ” Dear told Reuters .
Dear also said he has struck deals with Calpers ’ outside money managers to reduce their fees .
Ares Management and Relational Investors agreed to lower fees , totaling savings to Calpers of $ 40 million over five years , Dear said .
The two managers had agreed not to hire placement agents for business they may seek to sell Calpers , Dear added .
Placement agents are middle - men used primarily by private equity companies to market investments to pension funds .
Calpers has been trying to distance itself from placement agents amid a controversy over one of its former board members who become one of the middle - men .
He is being sued by California ’s attorney general ’s office , which claims he improperly influenced investment decisions at Calpers .

The way apparel has been worn and created by skateboarders over the past 50 years has had a tremendous impact on popular culture at large .
In Skateboarding Is Not A Fashion , the authors have taken great effort to document all aspects of this aesthetic movement ; from its roots in the 1950s as an offshoot of surfing culture , through the early 1980s when skateboarding “ found itself ” after a crucial underground period of soul searching and DIY expressions of individuality .
Early generations of surfers and skaters wore coastal lifestyle brands such as Jantzen , Hang Ten , Jams , Vans and Hobie .
As the culture progressed and developed its own distinct identity , brands core to the scene such as Vans , Santa Cruz , Powell - Peralta , Sims , Alva , Jimmy ’Z and many more jumped into the fray with their own apparel .
Nearly every area of garment design was touched by skate wear ’s aesthetic– influencing the design and fashion of innumerable media from printed T - shirts to board shorts and denim to track suits along the way .
Telling the inside story of skate couture in the words of those who lived it , Skateboarding Is Not A Fashion features original commentary from designers , company founders , and pro skateboarders who have defined skateboarding ’s look for entire generations .
Skate personalities we meet include Stacy Peralta , Lance Mountain , Tony Alva , Brad Bowman , Steve Olson , Steve Caballero , Steve Van Doren , and many more .
Skateboarding
Is Not A Fashion even addresses the design influence of accessories and safety gear of skate fashion ranging from helmets to kneepads and gloves , not to mention accessories such as bags .
Skateboarding ’s unique attitude and style have captured the imagination of millions over the decades–and Skateboarding Is Not A Fashion Vol 1 . is the culture ’s magnum opus lookbook .

Fresh from his victory in last week ’s Kentucky Republican senatorial primary , Rand Paul found himself caught in a whirlwind when MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow asked whether the 1964 Civil Rights
Act properly outlawed racial segregation at privately owned lunch counters .
Speaking circuitously if not evasively , Mr. Paul finally said :
“ [ O ]ne of the things freedom requires is that we allow people to be boorish and uncivilized .
But that does n’t mean we approve of it . ”
So although he supports striking down segregationist state Jim Crow laws , he objected to Title II of the Act , outlawing racial discrimination in “ public accommodations . ”
“ Had I been around I would have tried to modify that , ” he said .
However , after a torrent of media and blogospheric criticism , he changed course , telling CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer , “ I would have voted yes … .
I think that there was an overriding problem in the South , so big that it did require federal intervention in the sixties . ”
Which Rand Paul had it right ?
The first one .
Had he known and related the full story , he could have avoided the metamorphosis .
I write as a libertarian , something Rand Paul claims not to be .
The essence of the libertarian philosophy is that each person owns him - or herself and whatever belongings he or she honestly acquires .
Thus individuals are due freedom of association and , logically , non-association .
It also follows that the owner of property should be free to set the rules of use , the only constraint being that the owner may not use aggressive force against others .
Admittedly , that leaves room for loathsome peaceful behavior , such as running a whites - only lunch counter .
Who imagined that freedom of association could n’t have its ugly side ?
Nevertheless , individuals are either free to do anything peaceful or they are not .
If politicians decide , we have arbitrary government .
But government is force , and force is moral only in response to force .
Some champions of Title II acknowledge the opponents ’ consistency with the libertarian principle but suspect it is motivated by racism .
Logically , that is absurd .
Even if every racist invoked libertarian grounds for opposing laws mandating desegregation in private establishments , it would not follow that everyone who invokes libertarian grounds is a racist .
( Southern racists were hardly libertarians ; they supported government - mandated segregation . )
Libertarian opponents of Title II are also accused of being so unmoved by racial bigotry that they are blind to the importance of Title II .
But there is no inconsistency in abhorring bigotry and opposing a government - based solution .
A final charge made against Title II opponents – from left and right – is that they are so obsessed with doctrinal purity that they ignore real - world consequences , abominable as those may be .
The premise here is , as Maddow put it , “ [ U] nless it ’s illegal … there ’s nothing under your worldview to stop the country from re-segregating …. ”
Why assume that legislation was the only way to stop segregation and today is the only thing preventing resegregation ?
We can easily imagine scenarios in which private nonviolent action could pressure bigots into changing their racial policies .
But we do n’t need to imagine it .
We can consult history .
Lunch counters throughout the South were integrating years – years !
– before the civil rights bill was passed .
It happened not out of the goodness of the racists ’ hearts – they had to be dragged , metaphorically , kicking and screaming .
It was the result of an effective nongovernment social movement .
Starting in Greensboro , North Carolina , in 1960 , lunch counters throughout the South began to be desegregated through direct but peaceful confrontation – sit-ins – staged by courageous students and others who refused to accept humiliating second - class citizenship .
Four years before the Civil Rights
Act passed , lunch counters in downtown Nashville were integrated within four months of the launch of the Nashville Student Movement ’s sit -in campaign .
Students were beaten and jailed , but they won the day , Gandhi - style , by shaming the bigots with their simple request to be served like anyone else .
The sit-ins then sparked sympathy boycotts of department stores nationwide .
The campaign was n’t easy , but people seized control of their own lives , shook their communities , and sent shockwaves through the country .
State and city governments were far slower to respond .
Why is this inspirational history ignored in the current controversy ?
I can think of only one reason .
So - called progressives at heart are elitists who believe – and want you to believe – that nothing good happens without government .
To acknowledge that young people courageously stood down the bigots long before the patronizing white political elite in Washington scurried to the front of the march would be to confess that government is not the source of all things wonderful .
Recall Hillary Clinton ’s belittling of the grassroots civil rights movement when she ran against Barack Obama : “ Dr. King ’s dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 … .
It took a president to get it done . ”
History says she is wrong .
People were realizing the dream directly .
One might reasonably ask if Title II at least did no harm since it only codified what was already happening .
The case can be made that it was harmful .
The effort to pass the Act diverted the grassroots movement from self - help , mutual aid , and independent community action to lobbying , legislation , and litigation – that is , dependence on the white ruling elite .
Direct efforts undertaken by free individuals were demoted to at best a supporting role .
That was a loss for freedom , justice , and independence .
Our country is the worse for it .
Sheldon Richman is the editor of The Freeman .
He lives near Little Rock , Arkansas .
Under the Control of Dogs Act 1992 , owners can be fined up to £ 5,000 for failing to use a collar and tag .
The officials were also checking whether the animal 's owners were failing to clear up its mess .
However , it is believed that no evidence was obtained .
A spokesman for Allerdale council said the investigation was in response to a complaint from a resident about a particular dog .
Wikileaks – the exposer of all things secret – has been in the news for a variety of reasons the past month or so starting with their appeal for help keeping the site open .
No sooner than did they manage to meet a large portion of their operating cost needs than along come word that Wikileaks was one of the many sites being constantly monitored by the Department of Homeland Security and their MiB stepchild the NSA .
Then on March 15 , 2010 CNET reports that apparently the US Army expressed the opinion that Wikileaks posed a danger to possible military operational security and information security which humorously enough came to light because the report was published on Wikileaks .
A leaked U.S. Army intelligence report , classified as secret , says the Wikileaks Web site poses a significant “ operational security and information security ” threat to military operations .
Classified U.S. military information appearing on Wikileaks could “ influence operations against the U.S. Army by a variety of domestic and foreign actors , ” says the report , prepared in 2008 by the Army Counterintelligence Center and apparently disclosed in its entirety on Monday .
This also ended up as a post at the New York Times that said Wikileaks has been placed on the Pentagon list of enemies that threaten the security of the United States .
To the list of the enemies threatening the security of the United States , the Pentagon has added WikiLeaks.org , a tiny online source of information and documents that governments and corporations around the world would prefer to keep secret .
The Pentagon assessed the danger WikiLeaks.org posed to the Army in a report marked “ unauthorized disclosure subject to criminal sanctions . ”
It concluded that “ WikiLeaks.org represents a potential force protection , counterintelligence , OPSEC and INFOSEC threat to the U.S. Army ” — or , in plain English , a threat to Army operations and information .
All this pales to the report that Wikileaks is about to produce evidence of a US Military cover - up of a murder – that is if they survive to produce the evidence .
The first clue that something was up may have actually showed up on the Wikileaks Twitter stream back in February when they thanked people for their help in cracking US military encryption on a video file
Finally cracked the encryption to US military video in which journalists , among others , are shot .
Thanks to all who donated $ / CPUs .
Then more recently , once again on their Twitter stream , they announced that they would be releasing video proof of a murder cover -up
WikiLeaks to reveal Pentagon murder - coverup at US National Press Club , Apr 5 , 9 am ; contact press-club@sunshinepress.org
However there is some concern beginning to build that the folks behind Wikileaks may have finally bitten off a secret even to big for them to release .
This morning the blog From the Morgue has posted a timeline of worrying posts by Wikileaks to their Twitter stream yesterday
WikiLeaks to reveal Pentagon murder - coverup at US National Press Club , Apr 5 , 9 am ; contact press-club@sunshinepress.org
WikiLeaks is currently under an aggressive US and Icelandic surveillance operation .
Following / photographing / filming / detaining
If anything happens to us , you know why : it is our Apr 5 film .
And you know who is responsible .
Two under State Dep diplomatic cover followed our editor from Iceland to on Thursday .
One related person was detained for 22 hours .
Computer ’s seized .
That ’s http://www.skup.no
We know our possession of the decrypted airstrike video is now being discussed at the highest levels of US command .
We have been shown secret photos of our production meetings and been asked specific questions during detention related to the airstrike .
We have airline records of the State Dep / CIA tails .
Do n’t think you can get away with it .
You cannot .
This is WikiLeaks .
As the blog does point out the follow - up silence could very well be due in part to timezone differences however one has to wonder if there will finally be a limit to what powerful agencies in the world will put up with when it comes to their secrets being released to the public .
I ’ll be keeping an eye on this story and will post any updated information I come across – or finds me .

There are parties , concerts and a Marilyn Monroe lookalike competition
Hundreds of blonde Latvian women have been marching through the capital Riga to try to bolster the national spirit in time of recession .
Most of the participants dressed in pink and wore high heels .
The blonde parade began last year and was planned as a one - off but it is back by popular demand and is now a two - day festival .
Latvia has been hit badly by recession .
Its economy shrank by 18 % in 2009 and it has Europe 's highest unemployment .
' Proud to be blonde '
The BBC's Damien McGuinness , who attended the festival , says that this might not be everyone 's idea of female emancipation but if the aim was to bring a smile to recession - weary Latvians , the idea certainly worked .
He says there are parties , concerts and a Marilyn Monroe lookalike competition .
Money collected from the event will go to Latvian charities .
Marika Gederte , president of the Latvian Association of Blondes , told the BBC the idea came out of the economic gloom .
" I was so tired , you know , every day opening the computer and reading the newspapers and just reading about problems .
We decided ... let 's do something nice .
And I asked myself the question : what can I do for my country ?
And this is what I did ...
We are very proud to be blonde . "
Next year , our correspondent says , Riga 's blonde ambitions are even bigger , with a blonde carnival planned - like Rio , just a little bit blonder .
Claims of African economic growth hide stark divisions of rich and poor
By Barry Mason
25 June 2010
“ Africa is rich and its stock is rising .
The value of its land and minerals is going up .
There is no lack of resources , no deficiency of knowledge and no shortage of plans .
Africa ’s progress rests above all else on the mobilisation of political will , ” Kofi Annan , former United Nations secretary general , recently told the Financial Times .
The article was part of a series that presented a glowing picture of African development .
“ Africa has about 10 percent of global oil reserves , possibly more .
South Africa has 40 percent of the world ’s gold .
The continent has more than a third of cobalt reserves and base metals abound .
Its agricultural potential is barely touched ” , it continued .
Africa could be on the verge of joining the rising economies of Brazil , Russia , India and China , the so - called BRIC group , the Financial Times claimed .
The average gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth of sub-Saharan African countries is just under 5 percent this year and will rise to 6 percent next year after a decline last year .
The story has been circulating for some months .
US based economists Xavier Sala- i-Martin and Maxim Pinkovskiy told the Guardian in March that poverty and inequality were decreasing in Africa .
Their claims have been met with some scepticism , and rightly so .
Stefan Dercon of Oxford University says they rely too much on government statistics in coming to their conclusions whilst ignoring other data .
“ They believe the evidence that many of us would least trust and throw away the evidence we tend to think is fairly accurate .
Painstakingly collected household consumption and income surveys , especially when over various years using the same method in each year , give a rather detailed picture of whether there is massive enrichment or not .
And unfortunately , the evidence for Ethiopia , where I have been doing this for years , does n’t show such massive improvement . ”
Alongside Dercon ’s work is the evidence of two recent reports monitoring the promises made at the G8 meeting held in Gleneagles , Scotland , in 2005 .
The recently published Africa Progress Panel ( APP ) Report for 2010 has a foreword by Kofi Annan , who again claims that Africa is entering a period of economic growth .
But Annan has to admit that none of the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) for Africa have been met or are likely to be met in the foreseeable future .
The MDGs were agreed on by the United Nations in 2000 .
They include the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger ; the achievement of universal primary education ; the promotion of gender equality ; the reduction of child mortality ; the improvement of maternal health ; combating HIV / AIDS , malaria and other diseases ; ensuring environmental sustainability ; and developing a “ Global Partnership for Development ” .
The report demonstrates that the absolute and relative numbers of people living in poverty remain high in Africa , that many people face food and nutrition insecurity , are unemployed or underemployed , and have minimal access to basic services such as energy , clean water , health care and education .
Far from declining , the level of inequality is increasing as the economies of some sub-Saharan African countries grow .
More than 70 percent of Africans depend on subsistence agriculture to make a living .
Yet agriculture is one of the most neglected sectors in terms of aid and investment .
Climate change is making the conditions under which agriculture is practiced more and more uncertain .
Drought and other extreme weather events are producing famine and forced migration .
The other report was produced by the One organisation , which was launched in 2007 by the rock singer and development activist Bono with great fanfare , specifically to monitor the G8 promises made at Gleneagles .
After five years , the report has to admit that there is little to show for the G8 pledges on development .
It is an admission that reflects the total bankruptcy of the aid industry .
One in six African children dies before the age of five .
The causes of this horrendous death toll are not hard to find .
It costs barely $ 1 to vaccinate a child against measles , yet a child dies of measles almost every minute because adequate vaccination programmes have not been put in place .
Children are vulnerable to disease because they are malnourished .
Nearly one third of children in sub-Saharan Africa are underweight for their age .
Nor do they have access to clean water and sanitation that would cut the risk of disease .
The prospects of these children for the future are poor .
Only about half of the primary age children in sub-Saharan Africa are enrolled in school , and one in three of those enrolled does not complete the course .
For Kofi Annan to speak about African development in such glowing terms flies in the face of the evidence and is little short of criminal .
Some African economies have been buoyed by continuing demand for minerals and oil from China and India .
But the wealth produced does not filter down to the majority of the population .
It remains with a wealthy elite or enriches the global corporations and banks that claim the right to control Africa ’s immense resources .
To take one example : the Nigerian economy grew by 7.23 percent in the first quarter of 2010 mainly as the result of increased oil production .
Meanwhile , in northern Nigeria , women are sweeping up fallen grain in the market places to feed their families .
In the Delta , where the oil is produced , the environment has suffered decades of degradation from oil spills .
Local fishermen and farmers have had their livelihoods ruined and face high rates of disease .
The profit from Nigeria ’s oil enriches the very same companies that are responsible for the devastation of the Gulf of Mexico , while the majority of the population face deteriorating conditions .
June 17 ( Bloomberg )
-- " The
index of U.S. leading indicators
rose 0.4 percent in May , signaling the world ’s largest economy will keep expanding in the second half of the year .
The Conference Board revised April data to show no change rather than the previously reported 0.1 percent drop . "
Remember all of the gloomy headlines after last month 's original estimate of a 0.1 point decrease ( Note : the Bloomberg report incorrectly calls it a 0.1 percent drop , when it should have been a 0.1 point drop , or a 0.09 percent drop ) , which has now been revised to show no change in April ?
" Key US indicators point to economic recovery losing steam "
" Leading indicators drop , experts still expect “ sluggish ” economic growth "
" US Economy : Leading Index Signals Recovery to Cool "
" Uh oh : Leading economic indicators slip in April "
" US : Leading Index Dips ; Slower Growth Ahead "
MP : Given today 's revisions , the leading index has increased or stayed the same for the last 14 months , which is only the third time that has happened since 1998 .
The 12 - point increase in the leading index from the most recent March 2009 low of 97.9 to the all - time May high of 109.9 is the largest 14 - month point gain in the history of the Conference Board 's leading index going back to 1959 ( see chart above ) .
In percentage terms , the 12.26 % increase over the last 14 months is the highest since 1984 .
Also , market maven Dennis Gartman strongly emphasizes the " Ratio of Coincident to Lagging Indicators " as an accurate metric to assess turning points in the business cycle , and featured a graph of this ratio back to 1958 in today 's " The Gartman Letter " turned higher in early 2009 and it has been trending higher ever since . "
Today 's Conference Board report shows that the " Ratio of Coincident to Lagging Indicators " increased from .9314 in March to .9351 in April to .9397 in May .

After having formed a bullish reverse Head & Shoulders pattern ( by breaking above “ neckline ” resistance at 47 ) on daily bar charts , the Keefe , Bruyette & Woods U.S. Bank Index ( BKX ) reversed lower and has just retested its neckline , this time as support .
The key question now is whether its “ neckline ” will continue to act as support and fend off sellers , or give way to them instead .
If , in fact , this neckline can hold as support , resumption to an upward bias would likely occur , eventually targeting a test of the 78.50 area .
That would , of course , represent a healthy increase percentage - wise from Friday ’s closing levels and would likely improve overall market sentiment dramatically .
If , on the other hand , the 47 area fails to act as support , a break in the recovery spirit and drearier investor psychology could well emerge .
In the intermediate - term , larger banks may now face narrower margins as they conform to the newly passed financial reform bill .
In addition , a flattening yield curve will likely restrict the banks ’ ability to recapitalize itself over the near - term .
Further , these banks ’ credit card operations will likely reduce top line revenues because of their inability to accurately price their products to “ risk ” .
Instead , the recently crafted credit card reform legislation will likely reduce margins and dampen credit extension to consumers .
Nevertheless , extraordinarily low interest rates should have a positive impact on asset values , helping to reduce provisions for loan losses .
In addition , qualified borrows will clearly benefit from depressed interest levels helping them to grow their businesses .
In either event , the direction of the BKX should become resolved sometime soon with the 47 level squarely in focus .

The Lebanese foreign ministry on Tuesday announced that Israel would suffer the consequences for any attack against Lebanese ships heading for Gaza .
Open gallery view Lebanese Gaza - bound aid ship ' Julia ' awaiting green light to set sail .

In a letter to the United Nations , Lebanese Foreign Minister Ali Ashami wrote that Israel will be held fully responsible for any attack on Lebanon .
" [ Lebanon ] can not prohibit a ship from leaving its ports if its cargo , passengers and destination all comply with Lebanese law , he added .
Israel has warned that it would use all necessary means to stop a Lebanese Gaza - bound aid flotilla waiting for Lebanon 's green light to set sale .
The " Julia " ship is currently docked at the port in Tripoli , and has apparently received permission to set sail .
Lebanese Transport Minister Ghazi Aridi said Monday he had authorized the ship to sail to Cyprus , saying that a state of war between Lebanon and Israel prevented the boat from heading directly to Gaza .
" Lebanon and Israel are in a state of war and no ship has ever sailed from Lebanon to Israel , " Aridi told Reuters .
" Now what the Cypriots will decide , I do n't know .
Cyprus may not allow them to sail to Gaza , " Aridi said .
Last week , Israel 's UN ambassador Gabriela Shalev urged the government of Lebanon and the international community to prevent the small group of ships from trying to break the blockade of Gaza , warning that Israel reserved the right to use all necessary means to stop the vessels .
Gabriela Shalev sent a letter to UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon warning that the attempt by the organizers to sail from Lebanon and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza could escalate tensions and affect peace and security in the region .
" Israel reserves its right under international law to use all necessary means to prevent these ships from violating the existing naval blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip , " Shalev wrote .
The Neon Helium Productions ( NeHe ) online tutorials ( http://nehe.gamedev.net/) are the best resources available for coders trying to learn specific OpenGL rendering techniques in C / C ++.
The CL - OpenGL library ( http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-opengl/) is , to my mind , the most straightforward mapping of the OpenGL , GLU , and GLUT APIs into Common Lisp .
In this series , I hope to combine the best of both so that the aspiring Lisp coder can quickly access these OpenGL techniques .
I am aware that someone else reworked the first six tutorials for CL - OpenGL .
However , I ca n’t track those down any longer .
The original website is gone .
I am also aware that I wo n’t have a great deal of time for this sort of coding in the near future , but I hope to tackle a bunch of these this summer .
Most of the tutorials are fairly short .
In this first tutorial , we ’re going to generate a simple template file that opens an OpenGL window .
; ; ; *.lisp
# <: use " glut- template.lisp " >
Here is the resulting : intro.lisp .
To get started with CL - OpenGL , you will need a Lisp implementation that supports ASDF and CFFI , a git client , and OpenGL libraries .
I will probably flesh this section out at some later date .
For now , I am just barely going to touch on the prerequisites .
Lisp implementation .
CFFI .
git client .
OpenGL libraries .
( Under Windows , you may need FreeGlut.dylib . )
Once you have all of the above , you will need to clone the CL - OpenGL repository so that you have the sources on your machine .
The CL - OpenGL git repository is http://github.com/3b/cl-opengl.git.
# clone -repository.sh
% cd / where / you / want / to / put / the / cl-opengl / sources
% git clone http : // github.com / 3 b / cl-opengl.git
You need to ensure that the cl- opengl / directory that you just created is included in your asdf:* central - registry * list .
For example , I have this in my ~/.sbclrc file
; ; ; asdf-prep.lisp
( dolist ( subdir ( list ; ; ... some other packages ...
# P " cl-opengl / " ) )
( push ( merge - pathnames subdir # P " /usr/local/asdf-install / site / " )
asdf : * central - registry * ) )
Once you have CL - OpenGL installed , you ’ll be able to use the following template .
; ; ; glut-template.lisp
# <: use " load opengl " >
( defclass my - window ( glut : window )
( )
( : default - initargs : width 400 : height 300
: title " My Window Title "
: x 100 : y 100
: mode ' ( : double : rgb : depth ) ) )
# <: use " initialization method " >
# <: use " additional glut methods " >
# <: use " create an instance of our window " >
Usually , we ’re going to load OpenGL , GLU , and GLUT .
; ; ; load opengl
( require : asdf ) ; need ASDF to load other things
( asdf : load - system : cl-opengl ) ; load OpenGL bindings
( asdf : load - system : cl-glu ) ; load GLU bindings
( asdf : load - system : cl-glut ) ; load GLUT bindings
Our initialization method can do anything we need to do in terms of loading textures or fonts or what - have - you .
We could do some with the normal CLOS initialize - object method if it is stuff we can do before OpenGL is initialized .
For our purposes though , we need to wait until after OpenGL is ready but before our window is displayed so we make sure to go before the glut : display - window call .
; ; ; initialization method
( defmethod glut : display - window : before ( ( win my - window ) )
# <: use " prepare opengl " >
)
To prepare the default OpenGL environment that we ’re going to use , we ’re first going to turn on smooth shading .
This allows colors to blend across our polygons .
Later tutorials will go into more detail about smooth shading .
; ; ; prepare opengl
( gl : shade - model : smooth ) ; enables smooth shading
The next line here sets the color used to clear the screen .
OpenGL color values range from zero to one with zero being the darkest and one being the brightest .
The parameters here are ( in order ) the red , green , blue , and alpha channels .
The alpha channel does n’t really come into play when clearing the screen , so it does n’t much matter in this instance .
We ’re going to use a black background .
; ; ; prepare opengl ( cont . )
( gl : clear - color 0 0 0 0 ) ; background will be black
The next several lines prepare the depth buffer .
OpenGL keeps a variety of buffers that are the same dimensions as your window .
You were probably expecting the color buffer that stores the actual pixel values that are rendered on the screen .
The depth can be used to keep track of the depth of the last item drawn to the screen or to prevent an object from drawing if it does n’t have a depth thats less than the current value of the depth buffer for the current pixel .
; ; ; prepare opengl ( cont . )
( gl : clear - depth 1 ) ; clear buffer to maximum depth
( gl : enable : depth -test ) ; enable depth testing
( gl : depth- func : lequal ) ; okay to write pixel if its depth
; is less - than - or - equal to the
; depth currently written
We are also going to tell OpenGL that we ’d like it to make things in perspective look as nice as possible .
; ; ; prepare opengl ( cont . )
; really nice perspective correction
( gl : hint : perspective - correction - hint : nicest )
Almost all applications will need at least a GLUT display function .
Usually , they will do more than this , but this will get us started .
; ; ; additional glut methods
( defmethod glut : display ( ( win my - window ) )
( gl : clear : color - buffer - bit : depth- buffer-bit )
( gl : load - identity ) )
The following method gets called when your window is first created and any time your window is resized .
We will use it to prepare our projection matrix .
; ; ; additional glut methods ( cont . )
( defmethod glut : reshape ( ( win my - window ) width height )
# <: use " glut reshape -- prepare viewport " >
# <: use " glut reshape -- prepare projection " >
# <: use " glut reshape -- switch to model view " >
)
To initialize the viewport , we simply take the given width and height and use them as the horizontal and vertical extents of our coordinate system .
; ; ; glut reshape -- prepare viewport
( gl : viewport 0 0 width height ) ; reset the current viewport
Next , we ’re going to prepare the projection matrix .
We ’re going to set things up for a perspective view so that distant objects appear smaller than closer objects .
We ’re going to assume that the window accounts for a 45 - degree field of view from left to right .
We ’re going to assume that objects in our scene can be anywhere from 1/10 to 100 units in front of our viewpoint .
First , we switch into the mode where matrix commands will change the projection matrix .
Then , we make sure we ’re starting from the identity matrix .
Then , we prepare our perspective transformation assuming 45 - degrees from left - to - right and a proportional amount from top - to - bottom ( taking care not to divide by zero in the proportion ) .
; ; ; glut reshape -- prepare projection
( gl : matrix - mode : projection ) ; select the projection matrix
( gl : load - identity ) ; reset the matrix
; ; set perspective based on window aspect ratio
( glu : perspective 45 ( / width ( max height 1 ) ) 1 / 10 100 )
Once we are done setting up the projection matrix , we need to switch back to the model - view matrix so that further transforms will affect the space we ’re viewing rather than where we are viewing things from .
; ; ; glut reshape -- switch to model view
( gl : matrix - mode : modelview ) ; select the modelview matrix
( gl : load - identity ) ; reset the matrix
To create and display an instance of our window , we simply go ahead and create and instance and pass it to glut : display - window .

EXCLUSIVE : Gary Coleman's New Will Leaves Everything To Ex-Wife ; Lawyer Claims It 's Not Valid
EXCLUSIVE : Gary Coleman's New Will Leaves Everything To Ex-Wife ; Lawyer Claims It 's Not Valid
EXCLUSIVE : Gary Coleman's New Will Leaves Everything To Ex-Wife ; Lawyer Claims It 's Not Valid
Gary Coleman ’s new will leaves everything to his ex wife Shannon Price , RadarOnline.com is reporting exclusively .
The existence of this will , written in 2007 , was reported by RadarOnline.com exclusively Monday morning .
And while Price is named as the sole beneficiary there is a big problem with the new will that makes it invalid , according to a lawyer involved in the case .
Coleman died May 28 at age 42 .
The new will is a hand - written codicil to the 1999 will , attorney Kent Alderman told RadarOnline.com exclusively .
He says he has a copy of it .
“ It is one full page and was hand written and signed by Gary Coleman in 2007 , ” Alderman told RadarOnline.com .
Alderman represents Coleman ’s ex manager Dion Mial , who is named as executor of Gary ’s estate in the 1999 will .
And as RadarOnline.com reported exclusively , Mial stands to benefit financially from that will because of a trust provision .
But the new document , which is certain to spark a court battle , changes everything in that will .
“ It is something Gary Coleman sat and wrote it out in 2007 and it was one of the papers forwarded to me by my client , ” Alderman told RadarOnline.com .
But Alderman claims that under Utah law the codicil is invalid because Price and Coleman divorced .
“ It is treated as having been revoked when a divorce occurs after it was written , ” he said .
“ If they had remarried then the codicil would again be valid . ”
Price told Good Morning America on Monday that the couple planned to remarry .
But they did n’t .
Utah law will treat the new document from the Diff ’rent Strokes star as “ null and void , ” Alderman told RadarOnlne.com .
“ A copy of this handwritten codicil has been given to Gary ’s parents , Dion Mial and Shannon his ex-wife has the original , ” Alderman added .
“ Utah has adopted a uniform probate code made by the American Bar Association that is followed by 38 states which deal the same way with this situation .
“ Gary made the codicil that left all his assets to his ex-wife in 2007 but then divorced in 2008 which means the codicil is null and void . ”
Alderman said if Gary had adjusted the divorce papers and made it clear the codicil was still valid it would be enforceable but Coleman did not do that .
As a result , he says , the 1999 will is the valid one .
Somehow , we think Price may disagree .
What kind of milk is best for making Cheese ?
When we caught up with Elisabeth Fekonia she was clutching her new Cheese - making DVD as she was preparing for an official launch at the local library near her home at Cooroy in Queensland .
We had a number of people ask if you need to keep a cow or a goat at home in order to make your own cheese ?
Elisabeth says you can still make cheese from any kind of milk although raw milk is best if you can get it .
“ Alternatively pasturised only milk is okay if you can find it on the shelves of your store . ” she said .
Cheesemaking implements , knives , containers and presses can be easily made from recycled materials as long as they are sterilized with hot water before use .
If you ’re in the market for a cow and have a small acreage Elisabeth recommends a Jersey cow as a great milking breed .
“ This cow produces the creamiest of cheese . ” she said .
“ and also the most cream for making fresh butter . ”
As for buying a goat , not all breeds are best .
Elisabeth recommends you get yourself a Anglo - Nubian breed .
“ They make the creamiest milk which is great for cheese - making . ”
Cheese - making can be a complex process but Elisabeth has been teaching her popular cheese - making course for 15 years and says she regularly seeks feedback from students to help her improve her teaching skills .
“ You got to listen to your students and seek written feedback . ” she says .
“ Over the years I have learnt to be particular over certain cheese - making techniques and explain things clearly so that any beginner can easily learn the process and not be left behind .
I have tried to be very clear in this DVD and explain the whole process in simple terms that anyone can grasp . ”
Elisabeth stresses that people need a healthy immune system to stay well .
She is a keen supporter of Probiotics .
“ Getting healthy bacteria into your gut flora to enhance your immune system . ” she says .
“ Making one ’s own fresh yoghurt with culture and kefired milk is essential in your family ’s diet .
It will boost your health and vitality . ”
Elisabeth describes the cow as the matriarch of the Farm .
“ When you get a cow you will soon realize the advantages of getting a pig and even some chickens . ” she explained , “ When you make cheese you will have some excess Whey .
That Whey is half the nutritional value of milk .
You do n’t throw it away and lose the benefit .
You feed it to – the pigs ! ” she laughs .
“ But it does n’t end there .
The pigs are then herded into secure pens in the garden to root around in the soil churning over the mud , depositing manure and cycling nutrients that then feed our vegetable garden .
This is typical Permaculture . ” says Elisabeth .
“ The chickens are also part of the cycle .
I grow Sunflowers and feed the seeds to the chickens and get eggs and meat in return .
These cycles are common on Permaculture farms like ours . ”
“ Everyone should try and make their own dairy products and feel the difference . ”
She said .
Over the last century or so , trawlers have gotten more powerful engines , fish - detecting radar , lighter nets , and vast onboard freezers .
What the fleets might really need , though , is a time machine .
After all , bottom - fishing fleets in United Kingdom waters today have to work 17 times harder to catch the same amount of fish as their sail - powered Victorian counterparts did , according to a new study .
To address innovations have made fishing more efficient over the years , the study authors devised a new measure : units of " fishing power . "
After analyzing historic catch records from England and Wales , the researchers conclude that the amount of fish caught per unit of fishing power has fallen by 94 percent since 1889 .
That does n't necessarily mean the number of fish along the seafloor , such as cod and haddock , dropped by 94 percent .
But it 's probably " a very good approximation , " lead study author Ruth Thurstan , a graduate student at the University of York in England , said via email .
The decrease in catches is " truly shocking , " given how much more efficient fleets have become , Thurstan said in a telephone interview .
The statistics sting all the more because they involve not just one species but an entire section of the marine ecosystem , she added .
The U.K. seafloor could be undergoing a wholesale shift as a result , with exploding populations of baitfish and crustaceans , for example , taking the places of their former predators .
For better or worse , the Britain is n't alone in the fisheries decline .
The fisheries is " very much in line with what studies have shown in other ecosystems , " said Andrew Rosenberg , a University of New Hampshire marine - sciences professor who was n't involved in the new study .
" We 've seen the same thing in the western Atlantic , in the North Sea , and in the Baltic , " said Rosenberg , a former U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) fisheries manager .
" In the Mediterranean you probably have even greater declines . "
Fishing Better , Catching Fewer
Bottom - dwelling fish landings at U.K. ports rose from 1889 — the first year reliable records were kept — through the mid-20th century as the fleet grew larger and technology made fishing much more efficient , according to the new study , published May 4 in the journal Nature Communications .
Trawlers , which drag bag - shaped nets along the seafloor , began trading sails for steam engines in the 1880s , allowing the fleet to fish more distant , deeper waters for longer periods .
Net technologies further improved catch rates , and refrigeration stretched the fishing boats ' capabilities even further .
But since World War II , despite ever increasing investment in a more efficient fleet , trawler catches in U.K. waters have been dropping , presumably due to overfishing .
For example , today 's trawling fleet off the U.K. annually catches about half what its sail - powered predecessor did in 1889 , the study says — and less than a quarter of the peak annual catch in 1938 .
Fishing Fears Nothing New
Even in 1889 trawl fishing had already been practiced for centuries off Britain .
" Fish stocks around the U.K. were already in decline , and it was being noticed at the time , " study leader Thurstan said .
In fact , the records used in the new study were begun as a result of two Royal Commissions of Inquiry to address Victorian fishers ' concerns over shrinking stocks .
The study found that the first steep declines in U.K. trawler catches began in the 1960s .
That 's a full 20 years before the formal enactment of the European Union 's Common Fisheries Policy ( CFP ) , which fishers often blamed for the current state of European fisheries .
But the earlier date for the first steep declines does n't mean the CFP is completely off the hook .
" The stocks have continued to decline throughout the [ time of the ] CFP , so it has n't allowed the recovery of many of the stocks , " Thurstan said .
Can Seafloor Fishery Be Fixed ?
Gavin Gibbons is a spokesperson for the National Fisheries Institute , which represents the U.S. fish and seafood industry .
Fishery collapses , he says , are n't due to increases in fleet efficiency but rather to poor management .
What 's needed , Gibbons said , is proper direction , based on better knowledge of stock status , reproduction , and sustainable catch levels .
With that in place , he said , fish generally can be harvested sustainably .
" Understanding the seafood science behind safe harvest levels and following them under strong unified management schemes has been a recipe for success that NOAA has employed for years [ in the U.S. ] , " he added .
The University of New Hampshire 's Rosenberg is also hopeful for solutions to overfishing 's effects .
" We need to accept that we 've fundamentally altered these ecosystems , but that does n't mean that everything is irreversible , " he said .
For example , bottom - dwelling haddock on North America 's rich Georges Bank were decimated to the point of collapse in the early 1990s , Rosenberg said .
Though abundance remains far below historic levels , stocks increased tenfold from 1995 to 2005 , due to restrictive guidelines , he said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Wall Street Journal is offering some businesses firesale prices for full - page ads in its highly anticipated New York edition to seduce advertisers away from The New York Times .
Wall Street Journal Managing Editor Robert Thomson and other executives plan to unveil the edition during a press briefing on Monday morning .
The section will cover local news , culture and sports , and will be incorporated within the Wall Street Journal .
It will be circulated in the New York area .
Rupert Murdoch , whose News Corp owns the Journal , is betting that New Yorkers want an alternative to the Times , and he is willing to risk the ire of any shareholders not interested in pulp and ink .
David Joyce , an analyst at Miller Tabak , said investors “ tend to hate ” the newspaper assets of News Corp .
“ They wish it could be spun out , but you have to go into News Corp assuming they ’re going to be around .
Newspapers , the power and influence that come along with ( them ) , are integral to the News Corp strategy . ”
To entice advertisers onto the pages of the New York edition , the Wall Street Journal is deeply cutting the cost of a full - page ad and , as a bonus , throwing in a full - page ad in the New York Post , also owned by News Corp .
Some local businesses can buy a full - page ad for $ 19,000 , according to a Wall Street Journal presentation to advertisers that was shown to Reuters by a source .
That is a steep discount to full - page print ads in large newspapers that can cost up to
$ 90,000 .
A Dow Jones source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said only a few New York area businesses not currently advertising in the Wall Street Journal or the New York Post were being offered the discount .
“ With News Corp having a vast array of diversified assets , they can afford to essentially buy market share in the New York newspaper market by offering cut-rate advertising , ” said Miller Tabak ’s Joyce .
“ That could perhaps hurt New York Times ’ finances . ”
WHACKED BY RECESSION
The newspaper industry , already weakened by a migration of advertising to the Internet , has been roiled by one of the worst economic downturns in generations .
Days before the new edition of the Wall Street Journal was due to hit the streets , several newspaper companies , including the New York Times Co , published quarterly financial results that revealed it could be a long road back to ad revenue growth .
The Wall Street Journal , however , showed advertising revenue growth in the first quarter .
“ Competitors have been accusing each other of rate cutting since the beginning of time , ” Michael Rooney , chief revenue officer of the Wall Street Journal , said in an emailed statement .
“ The simple fact is that the Times ’ ad revenue is down 12 percent and our ad revenue is up 25 percent in the latest quarter . ”
Scott Heekin-Canedy , president of the New York Times , told analysts and investors on an earnings call on Thursday that the newspaper was feeling some heat in the New York advertising market .
“ We are seeing pressure , but we do n’t believe it ’s so far having any effect on our business , ” he said .
On the call , Times Chief Executive Janet Robinson ticked off a litany of strengths , including higher online traffic and national advertising share , to explain why the New York Times was prepared to do battle over the city ’s newspaper market .
“ We do n’t shy away from competition , ” Robinson said .
“ We never have , we never will . ”
In an interview on Friday , Heekin - Canedy said the New York Times relies on the strength of its relationships with advertisers .
“ We do smart discounting and come up with ways besides price to achieve objectives . ”
HELLO AMERICA
The Wall Street Journal has long been viewed as a vehicle to reach national audiences .
“ A number of our clients that run in the Wall Street Journal are happy for the broad reach against that core audience , ” said Scott Kruse , managing director of GroupM , an advertising agency that places ads for clients such as Sprint Nextel Corp and Volkswagen .
“ A lot of our clients do n’t just want New York . ”
Kruse said the New York edition of the Wall Street Journal would have a daily circulation of 235,000 , which he described as a small add - on for Journal advertisers .
“ The question is do you really need a local overlay on top of what you are doing . ”
Sharon Enright , associate media director for advertising agency RPA , said the Wall Street Journal had approached them about the New York project but , “ It does n’t make sense for us . ”
Enright said that she and her colleague Marie Zymkowitz buy ads in the Wall Street Journal to reach a national upscale audience .
TODAY NEW YORK , TOMORROW ?
Under Murdoch , the Journal has the coffers to fund the experiment .
The newspaper already produces a weekly section dedicated to San Francisco and it cranked up distribution in Detroit when the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News cut home delivery .
“ I would not underestimate Mr. Murdoch because he is playing with a large sum of cash , ” said Benchmark analyst Edward Atorino .
“ Some people are waiting with bated breath , including Janet . ”
Did Sarah Palin get breast augmentation surgery ?
Palin showed up to the Belmont Stakes last weekend wearing a white t- shirt that has some people saying her girls might have been surgically enhanced .
Internet seems to be going wild as bloggers debate if she had them done or not .
Since there is no official word from Miss Palin , we would like you guys to see if you think she did .
If you did write – “ Yes ” in comments , else write “ No ” !

It could very well by a good bra , but let us keep the speculations on !
" Our doubts are traitors ,
and make us lose the good we oft might win ,
by fearing to attempt . "
— William Shakespeare , Measure for Measure
There is a great menace roaming about telecommunications land .
All worthy companies fear the thing and urge its banishment .
Armies of lawyers , economists , and politicians watch the distant hills for its shadow and sound the alarm upon the first sign of its appearance .
The fiend has a name : it is called " uncertainty , " especially the regulatory kind .
It must be stopped at all costs , cry the ISPs and their allies , especially the uncertainty that comes in the form of a proposed Internet non-discrimination rule .
" The uncertainties and other harms resulting from the rule will only multiply going forward , " writes Verizon to the Federal Communications Commission .
" The combination of the prohibitions in the rule and the array of uncertainties it would create would lead to less innovation and competition . "
Amen , declares the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which says that the FCC must refrain from imposing " a new , burdensome regulatory regime on broadband Internet access service providers that would create regulatory uncertainty .
Given these turbulent economic times and the enormous cost of building out broadband infrastructure , the United States cannot afford policies that would hinder private sector investment in this critical technology . "
By contrast
As these parties sound the alarm , other powerful voices claim the opposite — that the absence of net neutrality rules will bring on this terrible condition .
Given Comcast 's P2P blocking antics and the Apple - rejecting - Google Voice episode , the FCC must act as soon as possible , counsels Google .
" There is increasing uncertainty about whether particular practices , such as blocking of applications on wireless handsets , are permissible , " the search engine giant warns .
" Rather than continued uncertainty , the Commission should establish clearly to whom the rules apply , and what conduct is proscribed or permitted . "
Ditto , begs Sony Electronics .
Bring us not dark uncertainties from below , oh FCC , but reassuring angels from above .
Open Internet rules " would provide the regulatory certainty necessary for [ Sony ] to continue its investments in Internet - delivered content , services and applications , " the company pleads .
" By contrast , the absence of regulatory certainty caused by D.C. Circuit 's recent decision in Comcast v. FCC undermines incentives for continued investment and job creation . "
But wait . . . what 's this ??
Sometimes proponents and opponents of net neutrality provisions team up to tell the FCC that , no matter how much they disagree on the issue at hand , on one point they concur : The U - Beast Must Die .
" We would support a framework that ensures that regulatory uncertainty and the risk of harsh penalties do not chill innovation or prevent providers of from managing their networks or offering their services in reasonable ways , " wrote Verizon and Google together in a joint filing on the Open Internet question .
Whatever your position on a neutral net , perhaps you can summon up some sympathy for the FCC here .
Whose uncertainties should the Commission make more certain ?
For which side should the agency go forth and make the rough places smooth ?
Having suffered
The problem gets even worse .
Almost everyone who comes before the FCC wants the Commission to exorcise regulatory uncertainty from the corpus , regardless of the issue .
In the recent proceeding to open the 2.3GHz Wireless Communications Service zone to wireless broadband ( now hopefully resolved ) , the longstanding problem involved resolving interference issues with Sirius XM satellite licenses .
" Having suffered through more than a decade of regulatory uncertainty , " wrote the organization representing wireless license holders , " the WCS Coalition fully supports the adoption of technical and service rules within the next two months that permit the WCS band to be put to its highest and best uses . "
The coalition includes Comcast and AT&T / BellSouth .
Baloney , responded Sirius .
There was nothing stopping these companies from launching WiMAX on that band .
" Having created their own regulatory uncertainty , WCS licensees have the temerity to rely on that uncertainty for their failure to provide service over their spectrum , " Sirius wrote .
" Sirius XM understands regulatory uncertainties .
Operating under similar uncertainties and no formal repeater rules since its inception , Sirius XM has nonetheless spent more than $ 10 billion to build out its spectrum , developing a thriving business serving millions of customers . "
Current and future
But the mother of all uncertainty battles is playing out over how to get the wireless industry more spectrum licenses .
The FCC's National Broadband Plan calls for the agency to find ways to encourage broadcasters to sell the wireless industry their spectrum through " incentive auctions . "
The wireless companies say they face something even bigger than uncertainty ; they 're staring down a " looming spectrum crisis " if something is n't done .
And even the FCC is sympathetic .
" Given current trends and future uncertainty , virtually all the major players in the wireless industry have stated on the record that more spectrum is needed , " the agency 's NBP notes .
The broadcasters , however , have rejected proposals to reconfigure their tower systems in order to facilitate this transfer
" As the Commission develops the much needed National Broadband Plan that will ensure that all Americans , regardless of income and ethnicity , have affordable access to broadband in the near future , " it must " explicitly confirm that broadcasters will not be at risk due to regulatory uncertainty , " urges MGM Worldwide Television Distribution .
What 's ironic about all this , of course , is that all these industries are endlessly in the public 's face with speeches about the need for a " competitive marketplace , " " robust competition , " " bold innovation , " and " risk taking . "
Then a day after the latest " thriving on uncertainty " innovation trade show , they 're over at the FCC , the Federal Trade Commission , and the Department of Justice asking the government to make everything more predictable for them .
We suggest that telecommunications executives who seriously expect certitude in our time should do one of three things : go work for the IRS , open up a funeral parlor , or spend their days watching the Die Hard movies .
As for the rest of us , the words of Voltaire will suffice : " Doubt is not a pleasant condition , but certainty is absurd . "
Mud -smeared BP logos , boycotts , and an almost halved market value indicate deep disgust over the handling of the oil slick
At a BP service station in downtown Manhattan , the British company 's green and yellow logo has been defaced with huge brown smears of mud .
Protesters clad as oil - soaked mermaids have occupied garage forecourts , anti-BP demonstrations are taking place from Los Angeles to Florida , and a boycott BP campaign is creating a buzz on the internet .
BP 's name is , quite simply , dirt .
Americans are disgusted with the once proud London - based energy company .
As political leaders threaten criminal prosecution and possible seizure of the company 's assets , and environmentalists bay for blood , BP 's stock is plummeting : it has fallen by a third since the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire on 20 April , causing the worst oil slick in US history .
In financial circles , questions are growing about whether BP can salvage its reputation in the US and whether the company can survive as an independent entity at all .
" Ultimately , we 've got no idea how much this accident is going to cost , " said Dougie Youngson , an energy analyst at Arbuthnot Securities .
" People have been throwing around numbers like $ 10bn , $ 15bn , $ 20bn , but the reality is we just do n't know .
They 've made five attempts to plug this leaking well and they 've all failed . "
Youngson believes there is a real possibility the Deepwater disaster could destroy BP , leading to a break - up of the 101 - year - old company , which employs 80,000 people , operates 22,400 petrol stations and generated $ 239bn of revenue last year .
He said : " The longer this situation goes on , the more realistic that becomes . "
The US interior secretary , Ken Salazar , has warned that BP 's " life is very much on the line " .
The company 's market value has dropped from $ 122bn to barely $ 80 bn .
John Kilduff , an energy analyst turned hedge - fund manager at Round Earth Capital , told CNBC television : " It 's questionable whether they can continue to do business in the United States . "
Seemingly aware of its rock - bottom public image , BP this week hired Anne Womack - Kolton , once press secretary to the former vice - president Dick Cheney , to bolster its public relations effort in the US .
A CBS poll found that 70 % of Americans disapprove of the way BP has handled the oil spill .
And the worst has yet to come : so far relatively little oil has washed up on the US coast ; in the weeks ahead , images of stricken birdlife , clogged marshland and blackened beaches are likely to be ubiquitous .
James Hoopes , a professor of business ethics at Babson College , in Massachusetts , said it was hard to imagine a worse public relations fiasco .
" This has to be one of the all - time disasters for corporate reputation .
The most graceful course of action for BP would be to hang its head for a very long time and admit it has some deep issues to deal with . "
The company 's predicament is far worse than Exxon 's battering in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef off Alaska .
Not only is BP a foreign company with little claim to US loyalty but it is a repeat offender : memories are raw of BP 's Texas City refinery blast in 2005 which killed 15 workers after serious safety lapses , and of the damage caused to the Alaskan wilderness in 2006 by leaking BP pipelines which , the firm admitted , had not been maintained adequately .
" Is BP dishonest , is it ill - intentioned ? " Hoopes asked .
" I do n't think there 's any evidence to suggest those things .
But the ethical lapse concerns a lack of caution and lack of responsibility in handling what is an inherently risky business .
Accidents happen but there is evidence to suggest that BP is unusually accident prone . "
As of Tuesday , some 257,000 people had signed up to a Facebook page advocating a boycott of BP .
Additionally , a consumer advocacy group , Public Citizen , is calling for Americans to avoid filling up at BP petrol stations for three months to punish the company .
Tyson Slocum , director of the Public Citizen 's Energy Program , pointed out that BP had pleaded guilty to two environmental charges arising from its Texas City and Alaskan difficulties , before the Deepwater spill took place .
With valuable , tangible , property around the world , BP is not in danger of simply evaporating like Enron , Arthur Andersen or Lehman Brothers – all asset - poor business that had little left after they lost their reputations .
Theoretically , the collapse in BP 's share price could make the firm cheap .
Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch
Shell have been mooted as possible eventual purchasers .
The Obama administration , which wants to cut US dependence on foreign oil money , would have a significant say ; it hands out exploration licences and is unlikely to be keen on Russian , Chinese or Middle Eastern control of strategically important American resources .
Not everybody thinks BP is doomed .
Charles Maxwell , an energy analyst at the US broker Weeden & Co , says he does not consider Deepwater Horizon fatal for BP .
" While you 're right in the melee , the battle rages harsh and hot and fierce around you , but there will come an end to it .
They 'll drill a relief well and it will work , I 'm sure . "
Maxwell said reputational damage would fade since consumers barely distinguished between brands .
He said that BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , who succeeded Lord Browne of Madingley as chief executive in 2007 , had not had enough time to repair the damage wreaked by his predecessor .
To start regaining consumer trust , BP needs to show a more human face to America , said Dan McGinn , a communications expert at TMG Strategies , who suggested Hayward and his colleagues should " emote " more freely .
" Do n't make it so technical , so mechanical .
Give us a sense of passion , that you feel people 's suffering . "
Corporate giants have rebounded from catastrophes before .
The tyre maker Firestone , which seemed terminally tarnished in 2000 when it was accused of covering up flaws in products linked to hundreds of deadly accidents , turned around its reputation .
And General Motors , which filed for bankruptcy just a year ago , is back on its feet , winning market share and praise for new models .
" What we do know … is that you can suffer extraordinary damage in a short period of time but you can also recover , " said McGinn .
He added that the worst sins , in the eyes of the public , were not accidents themselves but a sense of gross incompetence , a perception of cruelty or veneer of sheer arrogance .
" If it comes across that you not only do n't understand but do n't care about the consequences of your actions , that 's unforgivable to Americans . "
Ontario status Indians are to be exempt from the harmonized sales tax when they shop under a looming agreement with the federal and provincial governments .
With the 13 per cent HST coming into force on July 1 , First Nations groups had expressed concern that their long - standing exemption from the provincial sales tax would not be maintained , violating their treaty rights .
The HST blends the 5 per cent federal GST with the 8 per cent PST .
But federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty is poised to agree to the Ontario government ’s request that the PST portion of the levy not be charged to natives at points of sale .
“ Ontario ’s government has decided in principle to maintain the provincial exemption for status Indians .
We respect tax decisions taken by provincial legislatures and assemblies , ” an aide to Flaherty said Wednesday .
In Quebec City , Premier Dalton McGuinty said a deal is “ pretty close ” and that the federal and provincial governments have worked well together and with First Nations leadership .
“ All we want to do is maintain an arrangement that has been in place for over 30 years under a number of different provincial governments of different political stripes , and I think we ’re pretty close to landing what we need to land , ” he said after a meeting with Quebec Premier Jean Charest .
“ I ’m told on principle an understanding has been reached , ” said Nishnawbe Aski Nation ( NAN ) Grand Chief Stan Beardy in an interview from Thunder Bay .
“ Our people and technicians are working on the wording . ”
Meetings with federal finance and provincial officials took place June 11 , said Ontario Regional Chief Angus Toulouse .
Those meetings continued Tuesday and Wednesday .
Ontario ’s Liberal government says blending the GST and PST is necessary to make businesses more competitive and remove red tape .
The HST will cause some daily items such as haircuts , gasoline and home heating fuel to increase in price , but 83 per cent of consumer items wo n’t be affected .
However , provincial point - of - sale exemption is a treaty right , said Beardy .
“ We will do whatever we can to protect that right , ” he told the Star last week from Sandy Lake , 600 km northwest of Thunder Bay .
“ If it means we are forced to take direct action , then that is what must happen .
We have to send a message to Canada and Ontario that treaty rights we agreed to 100 years ago are legally binding . ”
First Nations people living in northern communities struggle with poverty and face high unemployment rates — in some cases as high as 95 per cent .
Added to the high cost of living in the north , being forced to pay the HST would be crippling , said Beardy .
NAN is a political territorial organization representing 49 First Nation communities .
McGuinty said the threat of action such as blockades before the G8 and G20 summits did not play a role in the timing of the deal .
“ I think that ’s reading too much into it , ” he said , adding an agreement has been in the works since the HST was unveiled in 2009 .
The province has been talking about an exemption for status Indians for a long time but the objections have been “ coming on the part of the federal government ” because of the complexity of the proposal , McGuinty said .
However , provincial NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the timing of the agreement directly before the G8 and G20 summits is suspect .

First Nations have been raising the question of the PST exemption since the day they found out about the HST , said Horwath .
“ It is only because the G8 and G20 are imminent and there is a fear of embarrassment and disruption that finally the feds and the province , we think , are coming to the table . ”

OPPONENTS of legalising gay marriage find it difficult to stay away from formulations that imply that legalisation would entail forcing other people to ... do something or other .
Here 's Thomas Messner at National Review online , for instance : " Activists hope that federal courts will use this case [ Perry v Schwarzenegger ] to impose same - sex marriage nationwide . "
Impose same - sex marriage nationwide ?
Clearly , no two adults of the same sex will be forced to marry each other regardless of how the court rules .
This is n't just a cute word game .
Mr Messner 's use of the word " impose " goes to the heart of the issue .
To justify California 's Proposition 8 barring people from marrying loved ones of the same sex , opponents need to show that , at a bare minimum , the state has some rational basis for passing such a law , ie that somebody would be harmed by same - sex marriage .
They have settled on the ( baseless ) argument that gay marriage harms children .
Yet in a long drawn - out trial , the pro-Proposition 8 side was unable to call a single witness who could substantiate that claim .
The sole witness they did call , David Blankenhorn , ended up spending much of his time conceding the benefits same - sex marriage would deliver , both for gays allowed to marry and for society as a whole ; chunks of his testimony ended up in the closing arguments for the wrong side .
In particular , proponents of the law have been unable to explain how legalising same - sex marriages could harm or even affect heterosexual marriages .
Opponents of same - sex marriage may feel , subjectively , that something would be imposed on them by the state 's decision to recognise same - sex marriages .
But what is that something , exactly ?
It 's much easier to show how the state is concretely imposing on gays by denying recognition for same - sex marriages .
In a pluralistic society , you can't claim to have been harmed when the state declines to impose your religious norms on those who do n't share them .
And without some such claim to justify it , Proposition 8 is looking pretty constitutionally shaky right now .

According to some analysts , a sharp decline in major commodity - price indexes has raised the specter of deflation .
The Journal of Commerce 's index ( JCOM ) fell by 8.5 % in May from April while the Commodity Research Bureau 's index ( CRB ) fell by 8.2 % during that period .
Also the growth momentum of these indexes plunged in May .
The yearly rate of growth of the JCOM index fell to 47.9 % from 77 % in April , while the yearly rate of growth of the CRB index plunged to 0.7 % from 24.9 % .
Now if some other price indexes were to come under pressure , would that imply that the economy has fallen into deflationary territory ?
To provide an answer to this question we need to define what deflation is all about .
Contrary to popular thinking , deflation is not about a general decline in prices as such but about a decline in the money supply .
Note that this is based on the same principle that inflation is not about a general increase in prices but rather about increases in money supply .
Since the price of a good is the amount of money paid per unit of the good , obviously , all other things being equal , the prices of goods in general will go up over time with increases in money supply and fall with decreases in money supply .
To establish whether we are in deflation we need to find out what the money supply is doing .
The latest data for our monetary measure , AMS , shows that the yearly rate of growth stood at 4.7 % in May against 1 % in January .
A positive figure for the rate of growth in money supply implies that , at the moment , inflation is still in force .
Note though that during October to December last year we actually had deflation .
The yearly rate of growth of AMS stood at − 6 % in October , − 10 % in November and − 7.1 % in December .
Normally the main driving force in the expansion of the money supply is the central bank 's loose monetary policy .
By means of monetary pumping , the central bank injects money into the banking system .
This money in turn is amplified by commercial banks lending through fractional - reserve banking .
Currently however , there seems to be a breakdown between the Fed 's pumping and commercial banks ' lending activity .
Despite all the massive monetary injections by the Fed , commercial banks have chosen to sit on the pile of pumped cash rather than lend it out .
The level of excess reserves held by commercial banks has climbed to $ 1.05 trillion in early June from $ 1.4 billion in January 2008 while lending remains in free fall .
The yearly rate of growth of lending fell to − 11.4 % in this May from − 0.5 % in May last year .
What matters for money supply , however , is not lending as such but inflationary lending , i.e. , lending that was generated through fractional - reserve banking .
The yearly rate of growth of our inflationary - credit proxy stood at − 5.6 % in May against +3 % in May last year .
( Note however that the growth momentum of the inflationary credit proxy shows at present a visible bounce [ see the right - hand figure below ] . )
Now a fall in inflationary credit , if not offset by the Fed 's pumping , results in a decline of the money stock and hence in deflation .
As we have seen so far , the money stock is still rising , which we suggest means that for the time being the Fed 's monetary pumping via buying of assets is offsetting the decline in inflationary credit .
Observe that currently the Fed is pumping at the yearly rate of 14 % against the pace of contraction in inflationary credit of around 6 % .
Remember that whenever the Fed buys assets from nonbanks it boosts the demand deposits of the sellers of assets to the central bank .
An increase in demand deposits implies an increase in money supply .
So it seems that irrespective of the decline in inflationary credit the Fed can always offset this fall through monetary pumping .
( Again , the Fed could offset this fall by an aggressive buying of assets from nonbanks . )
So in this sense one could argue that , given the Fed 's readiness to pump money on a massive scale , the likelihood of deflation is not very high .
Now , we have to consider the fact that the Fed does n't pay much attention to the money - supply data .
For Fed policy makers , inflation or deflation is associated with movements in the consumer price index ( CPI ) .
After falling to − 2.1 % in July last year , the yearly rate of growth of the CPI climbed to + 2.2 % in April .
We suggest that , on account of a long time lag from changes in money supply to changes in the CPI , the past strong increases in money supply could lead to a further strengthening in the growth momentum of the CPI in the months to come .
In response to this strengthening , the Fed is likely to tighten its monetary stance .
This in turn could significantly slow down the rate of increase of the Fed 's balance sheet .
Hence , given the decline in banks ' inflationary lending , this will result in a decline in the money supply — and hence deflation .
( Even if the Fed were to decide to do nothing , the fall in inflationary credit would lead to a fall in the money supply . )
There is , however , another factor to consider : the fall in the growth momentum of money supply during November 2008 to November 2009 ( the yearly rate of growth fell from + 28 % to − 10 % ) .
The lagged effect from this fall is likely to produce a pronounced decline in economic activity , i.e. , it will severely undermine various bubble activities .
We suspect that a sharp fall in economic activity could cause the Fed to ignore the increase in prices and embark on aggressive pumping .
The increase in the money supply as a result of the Fed 's money pumping is likely to result in a further weakening in the process of real - wealth generation , i.e. , a weakening in the pool of real savings .
A fall in the pool of real savings in turn leads to a fall in economic activity — we cannot fund the production of as many goods as before .
Hence , over time a strong money - supply rate of growth and the production of fewer goods implies a general increase in money per good , i.e. , a general increase in prices .
( Observe that what we have here is a general increase in prices and a fall in economic activity , which is what stagflation is all about . )
Such a scenario is likely to be supportive of the price of gold .
Conclusion
A sharp fall in commodity prices has raised the specter of deflation in the United States .
We suggest that what matters for deflation is the state of the money supply .
As long as the money - supply rate of growth remains a positive figure , there can be no deflation .
Despite a decline in commercial banks ' inflationary credit , the offsetting monetary pumping by the Fed has kept the money - supply rate of growth in positive territory .
There is , however , always the possibility that the Fed could tighten its stance in response to a strengthening in the growth momentum of the CPI .
This , coupled with a fall in inflationary credit , could result in a fall in money supply and thus the emergence of deflation .
However , we are of the view that , on account of the fall in the growth momentum of money supply between November 2008 and November 2009 , US economic activity could come under pressure in a few months time .
As a result , the Fed may embark on strong monetary pumping .
We suggest this could lead to severe stagflation .

A company called Kno , Inc. has announced its flagship product , simply dubbed the Kno .
The device is two large 14 - inch touchscreens joined by a hinge that specifically targets the education sector .
Earlier we dinged the Dell Streak for being a bit on the small side , but the Kno tablet seems to suffer from the opposite problem .
Announced at D8 , the Kno weighs in at 5.5 pounds and more than an inch thick , rendering it comparable to a laptop but with two screens instead of a screen and keyboard .
The company refers to the device as a " digital textbook platform " and has partnered with publishers Cengage Learning , McGraw - Hill , Pearson and Wiley to produce content for the Kno in a beta program that will kick off at major U.S. colleges and universities this fall .
Based on Linux , the Kno also boasts support for Adobe Flash — a hot topic right now since that 's something the iPad does n't include .
Developers are encouraged to participate in building out a third - party app store for the device .
As for pricing , all we know is that it will be " under $ 1000 , " which already sounds too high .
Check out a demo video of the Kno and a few more screenshots below , then let us know what you think :
Will students be interested in picking up a device like this ?

Multitasking is coming to the iPhone in just a smattering of days as part of the new iOS4 operating system .
But it requires some re-programming on behalf of any app that needs to use it .
Need we worry that app writers wo n’t be ready in time ?
Over at PocketLint they ’re running a story with the eye - grabbing headline : “ EXCLUSIVE : iPhone 4 multitasking – massive delays expected . ”
The main thrust of the piece is that “ currently , ” according to PocketLint ’s testers , “ only Apple apps , like the Clock , Mail and Safari , can multitask .
That ’s it ! ”
While the launch of iOS4 may only be a handful of days off , the contention of PocketLint is that it ’s going to be bloody ages until developers get on with the job of building multitasking powers into their apps–if ever .
Why the worry ?
Because multitasking on the iPhone does n’t work like multitasking on a normal computer , where several apps just keep running , regardless of whether you ’re currently looking at their window or not .
To keep the battery - sapping demands of such a system to a minimum , iOS4 operates a pseudo - multitasking system which has several levels of keeping a task “ running , ” even if it ’s not the one currently filling your iPhone screen .
To make this work , Apple ’s had to build in special multitasking code “ hooks ” in its OS so that apps can tell the iPhone exactly how they want to manage themselves while running in the background .
To make the most of this , apps need to actually use these hooks .
Which means they ’ll need to have extra code added in .
PocketLint is concerned that many app writers wo n’t do this speedily , so users ’ experience of multitasking will be unsatisfying .
There are several problems with the argument , however .
Of course PocketLint ’s test for multitasking did n’t reveal many compatible apps : iOS4 is n’t officially released yet , it ’s still a test version .
Taking note of this , many app writers wo n’t release updates to their wares until it ’s officially out , since the odds are they ’ll take the opportunity to release upgraded apps with a few other extras , as well as a mulititasking system .
Why take the time to fix the code and go through the official app submission process without also chasing down bugs and adding in new features to tempt more users to buy your wares ?
PocketLint also hints that Apple ’s been somewhat misleading on this , that many apps wo n’t be able to multitask anyway and that it ’s not “ true ” multitasking .
Thing is , there ’s no big secret : multitasking on the Android platform is n’t quite “ true ” multitasking either ( and Win7 wo n’t have it at all ) .
Apple has , right from the start , made it clear that only certain classes of app will be multitasking - enabled , ( apps like GPS or VoIP ones for example ) and then only under certain circumstances , so that they do n’t secretly sap your battery .
But the system is going to be extremely useful , and it will slightly change how you interact with your iPhone .
When it hits the iPad , its effects will be even more noticeable as it ’ll help this larger device be a more potent generator of content , instead of a mere portal to consuming it .
And as with all these rumors there ’s one huge thing to remember : while buyers of the iPhone 4 will get iOS4 instantly , Apple updates this OS for free ( as does Google for its Android platform ) regularly for existing iPhone users .
This means Apple effectively upgrades , uprates , tweaks and improves your smartphone for free in a way that ’s likely never happened for any phone you ’ve owned previously , where to achieve the same benefits you ’d need a whole new phone .
If you really need to complain about this , then perhaps you ’ve missed the point .

The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) moved closer to boosting its authority over broadband providers on Thursday in a controversial vote that the panel 's Democrats said would protect consumers and its Republicans contended would freeze investment in broadband networks .
The commission voted 3 - 2 to open an inquiry into how the industry is regulated , the first step toward giving the agency the authority to police broadband service providers such as Comcast , Verizon and AT&T .
Democratic commissioners said at the Thursday meeting that the move to greater FCC authority would protect consumers and ensure competition in the broadband market .
But the FCC ’s two Republican voices expressed strong opposition .
Commissioner Meredith Baker raised concerns about the financial implications and future broadband deployment , charging that the vote would " subject the Internet and consumers to years of litigation and uncertainty . "
" There are significant consequences to even initiating this proceeding , " she said .

Commissioner Robert McDowell , the agency 's other Republican , said a net 1.5 million jobs could be put at risk as a consequence of agency action .
The process " has already caused harm in the marketplace , " he said .
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski vigorously defended his process , which lays out three potential frameworks for reshaping the agency 's legal authority after an April appeals court decision some say severely undercut the agency 's position .
" It 's not hard to understand why companies subject to an agency 's oversight would prefer no oversight at all if they had the chance , " Genachowski said .
In the aftermath of the appeals court decision , which Genachowski called a " curveball , " he proposed to place broadband services under the same regulatory framework as telephone service , which is more strictly regulated than broadband .
To protect against overregulation , Genachowski wants to prevent the FCC from applying the most onerous rules that currently apply to telephone service .
That is in part a concession to broadband providers .
Despite previously endorsing this plan , which he has labeled the " third way , " Genachowski said on Thursday he ’s not entirely opposed to two other avenues : leaving FCC authority as is or grabbing even more power for the agency .

" There ’s no point in having a notice and comment process unless people bring an open mind , " Genachowski said , noting that he also supports congressional efforts to update broadband regulations .
He said he will devote FCC resources to lending a hand to the Hill .
But Baker charged that the chairman had already made up his mind on which framework he favors : the " third way " plan .
“ I have concerns the outcome has been prejudged , " she said .
Genachowski's fellow Democratic commissioners added strong support to the move toward greater FCC authority .
Failing to act " would be death by a thousand cuts , " said Commissioner Michael Copps , arguing that it could put the entire spectrum of FCC actions on shaky legal footing .
Commissioner Mignon Clyburn refuted what she characterized as misinformation about the proceeding .
" It will not freeze investment in our networks , " she said .
Industry stakeholders were quick to weigh in about the FCC vote .
Many have charged that the proceeding is a backdoor way to write net neutrality rules without a congressional mandate .
Such rules would prevent broadband providers from favoring certain Internet traffic .

Changing broadband 's regulatory status is a " terrible idea , " Verizon 's top lobbyist , Tom Tauke , said in a statement .
" Rather than attempting to make the new world of broadband fit into the regulatory scheme of the old telephone world , the FCC should acknowledge that this is an issue Congress should address . "
Consumer - minded interest groups , including Public Knowledge , praised the move as beneficial to consumers .
" The Commission ’s simple , uncomplicated action today makes certain that the expert agency in telecommunications has the authority to carry out its mission , " the group 's president , Gigi Sohn , said in a statement .
The majority of congressional members oppose Genachowski's plan , including 77 Democrats who say he should wait for Congress to act .
The leaders of the authorizing congressional committees have indicated that they want to update the Communications
Act for its first major rewrite since 1996 , but said their process could be complementary to Genachowski's .
Experts say congressional action could take years .
Meanwhile , a group of 32 House Democrats led by Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - Wash . ) sent a letter of support to the chairman on Thursday to coincide with the vote .
A handful of Democratic senators have also endorsed the plan , including Senate Commerce Communications Chairman John Kerry John Forbes KerryMellman :
Do debates matter ?
President Trump faces Herculean task in first debate Trump , Biden have one debate goal : Do n't lose MORE ( D - Mass ) .
Scientists are reporting the first evidence that a plastic antibody -- an artificial version of the proteins produced by the body 's immune system to recognize and fight infections and foreign substances -- works in the bloodstream of a living animal .
The discovery , they suggest in a report in the Journal of the American Chemical Society , is an advance toward medical use of simple plastic particles custom tailored to fight an array of troublesome " antigens . "
Those antigens include everything from disease - causing viruses and bacteria to the troublesome proteins that cause allergic reactions to plant pollen , house dust , certain foods , poison ivy , bee stings and other substances .
In the report , Kenneth Shea , Yu Hosino , and colleagues refer to previous research in which they developed a method for making plastic nanoparticles , barely 1/50,000th the width of a human hair , that mimic natural antibodies in their ability to latch onto an antigen .
That antigen was melittin , the main toxin in bee venom .
They make the antibody with molecular imprinting , a process similar to leaving a footprint in wet concrete .
The scientists mixed melittin with small molecules called monomers , and then started a chemical reaction that links those building blocks into long chains , and makes them solidify .
When the plastic dots hardened , the researchers leached the poison out .
That left the nanoparticles with tiny toxin - shaped craters .
Their new research , together with Naoto Oku's group of the University Shizuoka Japan , established that the plastic melittin antibodies worked like natural antibodies .
The scientists gave lab mice lethal injections of melittin , which breaks open and kills cells .
Animals that then immediately received an injection of the melittin - targeting plastic antibody showed a significantly higher survival rate than those that did not receive the nanoparticles .
Such nanoparticles could be fabricated for a variety of targets , Shea says .
" This opens the door to serious consideration for these nanoparticles in all applications where antibodies are used , " he adds .
There was n’t a single game in my youth that commanded my attention like Sonic the Hedgehog did .
I put more hours into the four titles on the Genesis than all other games combined .
I collected the comic books , watched the TV series , bought the action figures — I loved the franchise .
It was an absolute tragedy to me to grow up and see Sonic Team release terrible game after terrible game featuring the blue blur .
I have wanted nothing more than for SEGA to reboot Sonic the Hedgehog and let me forget the the last 16 years of garbage ever happened .
Fortunately for me , SEGA finally heeded the call , and I was finally able to get a taste of the true successor to Sonic 3 at SEGA ’s E3 booth .
I ’m going to get right to it and say it : Sonic 4 does not suck .
The build that I played is definitely a work in progress , but the game is not going to continue the trend of abominable gameplay and design .
The game is fast , simple , and classic .
Funny enough , the secret to its success is one that SEGA perfected back in 1994 .
The gameplay feels completely natural .
As I began to play , I knew exactly what I was capable of , how fast I could go , and how to reach certain areas .
The familiar style that I had grown to love in my childhood was completely intact , and the way I played Sonic 4 on my first try was the same way I would play Sonic 3 on my 100th playthrough .
SEGA has nailed the gameplay design , and I am happy to say that Sonic 4 plays exactly as it should — as a classic Sonic game .
That being said , the sense of speed in Sonic 4 is n’t quite as absurd as it had become by Sonic and Knuckles .
We were assured at the booth that Sonic ’s speed is still being tweaked and that it will be boosted before released , however .
Sonic is in good , attentive hands .
In Sonic the Hedgehog , stages were very brief and over before you knew it .
By the time Sonic and Knuckles came out , each act was so long that racing against the 10 minute time limit finally became a factor .
The length of the acts in Sonic 4 seemed to be about the length of those found in Sonic 2 .
It is a comfortable median length between the two extremes .
The stages themselves offer much from the design of the original styles .
As you speed through them , you will see optional paths and hard to reach secrets in all directions , just begging you to slow down and explore .
Discovery by both intention and mistake was a huge part of the gameplay in the original games , and it procures a certain sense of excitement as you find more in the acts as you re-play the game .
Sonic 4 captures this sense of excitement , and allows the player to play the act as they wish , rather than sticking them on a rail in the way the 3D titles required .
On the subject of the acts , Sonic 4 approaches the full game in a way that is quite different than the originals .
In Sonic 1 and 2 , the player had to progress through the entire game from start to finish .
If you died , you would start over from the beginning .
Sonic 3 introduced a save system that not only let players record their progress , but it also enabled a stage select for the stages completed at the point of the save .
Sonic 4 actually lets the player choose any act of any stage right from the beginning .
You do n’t have to play the game in order — you can start where you want .
It is an interesting design choice , but when you consider the effort needed for collecting all of the chaos emeralds to obtain the true ending , being able to attack it from any angle becomes an advantage .
A big part that has been missing from the recent Sonic titles is appropriate music .
They have all featured grunge songs with awkward lyrics .
Knowing the legacy of the music on the original Sonic games , these new games had a sense of identity crisis thanks to the poor choice in music .
Despite the noise on the busy show floor , I did find the music in Sonic 4 to be fantastic .
It has an excellent retro feel as if it was actually designed for playback on the Genesis .
No more guitar solos and whiny voices , this was real Sonic music .
I did experience a few issues with Sonic 4 .
The one thing that struck me immediately was Sonic ’s animations .
Sonic 4 is a 2.5D game — it plays like a side scroller while the world is presented in 3D .
Sonic ’s 3D model looks fantastic , but his animations looked a little bizarre to me .
Transitions between animation types looked weird and rigid — Sonic ’s feet always seems to slide on the ground rather that grip it , and other various details felt off to me .
Perhaps its just the nature of a game like this in 3D , or perhaps I ’m just a nit - picking animation nut .
The animations were hardly distracting though , and it certainly is n’t a deal breaker , but it would be nice to see a little more polish in the animations before release .
Another problem is the addition of a new feature that debuted in Sonic Adventure .
Because of the difficulty of navigating Sonic in open 3D worlds , the game featured a “ homing attack ” that would guide sonic to a target , represented by a flashing reticule , and execute a perfect hit .
This move has been included with Sonic 4 , and I found it to be frustrating because of the side scrolling nature of the game .
It took much of the skill out of navigation and attacking .
For instance , when you come barreling out of a loop and find yourself face to face with a deadly enemy , you ’re forced to make a split second decision on how to survive .

Even before Colorado became the official 11th member of the Pac - 10 , Oklahoma athletics director Joe Castiglione felt the pinch of conference realignment .
As reports swirled that Nebraska is just about ready to announce a shift to the Big Ten , Castiglione , who helped put together the Big 12 in early 1990s as the AD at Missouri , said the news is n't good .
" I think it 's over with them ( Cornhuskers ) , " a dour Castiglione said in a late - night telephone interview with Dave Sittler of the Tulsa World .
" It feels like somebody died .
It 's that emotional for so many people who put so much into creating the Big 12 . "
And now that Colorado has beaten Nebraska to the punch , there are now two near - certain holes in the Big 12's lineup .
Whether this means the league will fold and five teams -- Texas , Texas A&M , Texas Tech , Oklahoma and Oklahoma State -- will also head to the Pac - 10 remains to be seen .
On Thursday , amid the news of Colorado 's move , Sittler posted an item on his blog saying if the Big 12 wants to remain , they need to make a major push to get Arkansas to leave the SEC and also look to add Air Force in the mix .
Brigham
Young is another possibility for the Big 12 if the league 's remaining teams look to keep the league running .
Castiglione acknowledged that BYU and Air Force are two teams the Big 12 might look at if it can convince Texas to help hold the conference together .
Texas , which yields enormous power in the Big 12 because of its revenue - making ability , could lose some of that power in a shift to the Pac - 10 , one reason Castiglione feels the Longhorns could push to keep the Big 12 intact .
" We worked really hard ( with Nebraska ) to try and make this work , " a subdued Castiglione said , according to the Tulsa World .
" But it apparently was n't enough . "

It looks like there 's a new dad who 's trying to capitalize on his children 's death - defying adventures .
This time , not in a balloon , but by sea .
Yes , the father of 16 - year - old Abbey Sunderland , the California teen who was rescued this weekend about 2,000 nautical miles off the coast of Australia while trying to become the youngest person to sail around the world , has admitted to The New York Post that he had a deal for a reality TV show .
And what a clever title it has : " Adventures in Sunderland " !
According to The Post , the show started filming four months ago with the premise of recording the lives of born - again Christian Donald Sunderland and his seven " daredevil kids . "
Donald copped to the fact that he was motivated to do the show because he was broke .
Abby 's solo sail around the globe started last January .
Her parents defended themselves last week for letting her go on the trip in the face of heated criticism after Abby ended up stranded in the middle of the Indian Ocean with no satellite reception .
And Donald is now defending himself in light of these new revelations :
Sunderland insists
Abby 's trip was n't just a stunt .
The reality show was , he said , " the last thing on my mind .
" The wheels in motion for this trip had actually started when Abigail was 13 years old , " he added .
Sunderland also defended his decision to let his daughter take the risky journey .
" I love my daughter dearly , " he said .
" I love the passion of sailing dearly , and this was about Abigail following her dream .
She followed the criteria that I had set out , and met all the requirements to embark on this trip . "

In the past few years , EA has made some significant changes to its FIFA franchise helping it leapfrog what was considered the benchmark of soccer games , Konami ’s Pro evolution soccer .
The PES team has admitted to making some mistakes in the current generation and has promised some significant changes to revitalize the franchise .
EA has also revealed their own set of new features coming to the franchise , but one that has caught our eye is the option to upload your own chants to play during matches .
We ’re guessing most of you must have been watching a fair amount of World Cup games and just in case you have suddenly started enjoying the Vuvuzela “ BZZZZZZZZZZ ” blasphemies in the background , FIFA 11 has you covered in that department .
Not for being rude , or anything of the sort — but simply because they do n’t “ get it . ”
So , I was in Store 2930 in Irving last Friday , and ordered a book on Mudbox ( a 3d modelling software ) .
I was promised by the store clerk that the book qualified for free expedited shipping , but that because of the Memorial Day holiday , shipping would take until Tuesday .
Perfectly reasonable .
Tuesday passed .
Wednesday passed .
Thursday I called the store .
Within the ten minutes of my phone call , the expected arrival date they quoted changed from 6 /2 ( a day late , but they ship UPS , and UPS is often late , I think that ’s why they throw the boxes at your door rather than setting them down gently ) , to 6/5 .
Wait a minute , that did n’t make any sense — how could the date change ?
So the receiving manager , who saw the change , got me in touch with the store manager , who promised to check in on it and call me back .
Everything was courteous and professional , and she called back within ten minutes .
The answer , it turns out , is that my order had not gotten into their system until 6/2 , Tuesday .
For a Friday order , because I ~” ordered it in the afternoon , so it was perfectly reasonable that it would get into the system on the next business day . ”
In other words , B&N promised one thing , could n’t deliver , and then tried to sell me on the idea that the problem was with my expectations , rather than that they overpromised and under - delivered .
That ’s not how a successful business operates — certainly not in the 21st century , where any competent electronic store system should have purchases “ in the system ” within minutes maximum : what are they doing , waiting for some data - entry drone to enter it manually from a sheet of paper ?
That kind of system was on its way out in the 90s .
I know , I temped a couple of them .
I ’m still waiting for my book , which will arrive hopefully by Friday .
Because I really do n’t have a choice .
But a company that oversells , underdelivers , and then tries to sell me on the idea that the problem was my fault for being a rube and believing them , is a company that ’s not getting any additional business .
Sure , I ’ll come by the cafe and have some quiche and coffee , browse for some scifi .. but for anything serious , they ’ve lost my business .
I ’m sure they ’ll survive : my wife and I are small fry , ordering maybe $ 5-700 bucks a year in books .
But that ’s 5 - 7 that will be going to Amazon .
For one and only reason : when they say I ’ll have it on Tuesday ….
by damn , I have it on Tuesday .
Ever wondered the geographical origins of such dissimilar stories as Doctor Faustus and Jaws ?
This map charts the evolution of four classic tales as they traversed continents , centuries , and cultures .

This map by Haisam Hussein from a recent issue of Lapham 's Quarterly follows four famous fictions that pinballed across space and time .
They are :
- Pygmalion : A man falls in love with his female creation
- Oedipus : A king unwittingly kills his father and marries his mother
- Faust :
A man sells his soul to the devil in exchange for power and knowledge
- Leviathan : A mythical sea monster terrorizes the deep

Note how both the Leviathan and Pygmalion routes end rather cheekily in Los Angeles with , respectively , Steven Spielberg 's Jaws and the 1999 Freddie Prinze Jr. teen rom-com She 's All That .

I once had a Japanese girlfriend whose family , in her youth , went through some hard financial times .
Her parents had broken ties with their own parents by eloping in their youths and leaving the island of their birth ( Shikoku ) so there was no local support for them during those days .
At that time , my girlfriend ’s mother found and clung onto a very evangelical Buddhism called Soka Gakkai as her anchor in reality and cure for her anxieties .
The sect she belonged to promised material wealth and happiness to believers .
To obtain these blessings , believers merely needed to chant a simple chant daily in front of a special shrine .
My girlfriend can remember her parents fighting over finances and then she ’d hear her mother chanting for hours in front of their household shrine asking for divine help .
Eventually the family became more prosperous and her mother attributed to her faith .
The mother upon meeting me tried to convert me to become a Soka Gakkai member for a few years .
Many Americans actually belong to the sect here in America .
Because I was curious and to appease her I read several Soka Gakkai Buddhist books and debated with her a bit .
She soon gave up on me .
To her I was just like her husband : stubborn and close - minded .
When my girlfriend was growing up , her father hated the mother ’s new found religion and it drove them further apart .
My girlfriend said she use to hide under her bed when her parents fought and she could hear dishes being thrown at times .
She ’d even fall asleep under the bed to the sound of her mother ’s chants after the fights .
Like her father , my girlfriend hated her mother ’s hyper-emotional religion .
She felt religion ( her mother ’s being the only one she knew ) was silly , superstitious and manipulative .
But she always understood how it offered hope and security for her anxious mother who she still loved so she would not argue with her mother .
Years later , that girlfriend and I were flying over China ( returning from a vacation ) when our jet had severe trouble losing altitude abruptly , shaking and diving .
People who were not belted down hitting the cabin roof , but soon they leveled out the plane though it was still shaking .
My girlfriend had closed her eyes , grabbed the seat and started chanting “ Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō ” ( Praise to the sublime Lotus Sutra ) — the chant of her mother ’s religion .
We flew very low for the rest of the trip but arrived safely .
My girlfriend laughed at herself for chanting and never chanted again .
As for me , after that horrible experience I had severe flight anxiety that would last for 5 years .
Interestingly it some flight simulator training I had which cured the anxiety .
Epiphenom did a fantastic article today listing the many research articles that address how religion comforts anxiety .
Here is a quote from the article that inspired me to write this post : “ when you remind people about death , they tend to grab onto their traditional , cultural values . ”

Have you ever had scary experiences where you became suddenly religious ?
How do you reduce anxiety in your life ?

The antagonism towards the Mail on Sunday for its single - handed destruction of England 's bid to host the 2018 World Cup football championships is gathering pace .
I 'm beginning to wonder whether it could lead to a boycott of Sun-Hillsborough proportions because of growing outrage from all manner of people .
As was reported yesterday , Gary Lineker decided to stop writing for the paper .
And the vast majority of the 289 comments on that story are clearly hostile to the Mail on Sunday ( MoS ) .
Take a look also at the 300 - odd comments below the Sunday blog posting by David Bond , the BBC 's sports editor .
They are overwhelmingly critical of the MoS .
Some 84 % of callers to TalkSport said the MoS was wrong to publish .
The Press Complaints Commission has received about 55 complaints .
Then there are the Facebook pages , such as Boycott the Mail : England fans united and The Mail on Sunday ruined our world cup bid ... so let 's ruin their paper ( with , admittedly , very few members ) .
I have rarely known so many journalists who disagreed with the paper 's decision to publish .
At a media gathering last night I could n't find one who believed the story of Lord Triesman 's private conversation with a duplicitous girl - friend was valid .
One former high - ranking newspaper executive told me that his son had written to the MoS editor ( Peter Wright ) to say he would no longer be reading the paper .
Nor would his friends .
Now take a look at what the BBC's Bond had to say about the affair in his blog on Monday .
He rightly points out that the story was originally rejected by another paper ( the News of the World , I understand ) .
He also takes up the point made by so many about the dubious ethics involved in obtaining the story , which has been a hot topic on many radio phone - ins over the past couple of days .
Triesman was tricked by the woman , Melissa Jacobs , in the most underhand fashion .
Pretending to be his friend , she covertly recorded their private conversation , probably encouraging him to be indiscreet .
In truth , he was n't that indiscreet .
Aside from the business about whether Russia might offer bribes in order to win the World Cup bid , he said nothing of real consequence .
Who , for example , could disagree with his views on John Terry ?
Given that they had been colleagues and friends for some time , Triesman could not possibly have suspected what she was up to .
He was entrapped .
But , aside from the woman 's desire to make money ( along with her agent , Max Clifford ) , here was no point to the exercise .
To publish Triesman 's views - even if tendentious and false ( and maybe they were not , by the way ) - could not be said to be the public interest .
And , as the commenters to websites , the radio phone - in callers , the Twitterati , and a host of journalists keep pointing out , it was certainly not in the national interest .
I find myself in agreement with Philip Stone , the American media commentator , who writes on FollowTheMedia :
Frankly , it was journalism at its most disgusting – a former girl - friend invites the head of the UK Football Association and leader of its 2018 World Cup bid to a private lunch , she carried a secret wire , he talked about some extremely damaging international football bribery allegations , she sold that to a Sunday newspaper for £ 75,000 , he had to resign and justifiably the newspaper got lambasted for an exclusive story that may well have destroyed the 2018 bid .
Stone thinks " the best news to come from all this is the wave of public opinion against the newspaper . "
Then he consider the MoS response , which is an attempt to extricate itself from the mire in which it now finds itself .
Here 's the statement :
This story concerns very serious allegations of corruption at the highest level of sport , made by a man who was leading the England World Cup bid .
The public is clearly entitled to know about such allegations .
We would also like to make it clear that Melissa Jacobs put details of her relationship with Lord Triesman on the internet , and made her recording of her conversation with him , without the knowledge or involvement of the Mail on Sunday .
There is no question of entrapment , the paper was simply reporting events that had already taken place .
This is a definition of disingenuous .
The paper paid £ 75,000 for something already available ?
Pull the other one .
The MoS is trying to escape from its responsibilities in this matter .
It made a severe error in publishing a story obtained from a woman who , as the London Evening Standard revealed , was recently treated for mental health problems .
David Bond , incidentally , raises all sorts of questions about the story 's provenance in his Monday blog that require answers .
The MoS would do well to own up to its mistaken editorial judgment .
Its readers , and England 's football fans , deserve an apology .
Using an off - the - shelf digital camera , Rice University biomedical engineers and researchers from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center have created an inexpensive device that is powerful enough to let doctors easily distinguish cancerous cells from healthy cells simply by viewing the LCD monitor on the back of the camera .
The results of the first tests of the camera were published online this week in the open- access journal PLoS ONE .
" Consumer - grade cameras can serve as powerful platforms for diagnostic imaging , " said Rice 's Rebecca Richards - Kortum , the study 's lead author .
" Based on portability , performance and cost , you could make a case for using them both to lower health care costs in developed countries and to provide services that simply are n't available in resource - poor countries . "
Richards - Kortum is Rice 's Stanley C. Moore Professor of Bioengineering , professor of electrical and computer engineering and the founder of Rice 's global health initiative , Rice 360° .
Her Optical Spectroscopy and Imaging Laboratory specializes in tools for the early detection of cancer and other diseases .
Her team has developed fluorescent dyes and targeted nanoparticles that let doctors zero in on the molecular hallmarks of cancer .
In the new study , the team captured images of cells with a small bundle of fiber - optic cables attached to a $ 400 Olympus E - 330 camera .
When imaging tissues , Richards - Kortum 's team applied a common fluorescent dye that caused cell nuclei in the samples to glow brightly when lighted with the tip of the fiber - optic bundle .
Three tissue types were tested : cancer cell cultures that were grown in a lab , tissue samples from newly resected tumors and healthy tissue viewed in the mouths of patients .
Because the nuclei of cancerous and precancerous cells are notably distorted from those of healthy cells , Richards - Kortum said , abnormal cells were easily identifiable , even on the camera 's small LCD screen .
" The dyes and visual techniques that we used are the same sort that pathologists have used for many years to distinguish healthy cells from cancerous cells in biopsied tissue , " said study co-author Mark Pierce , Rice faculty fellow in bioengineering .
" But the tip of the imaging cable is small and rests lightly against the inside the cheek , so the procedure is considerably less painful than a biopsy and the results are available in seconds instead of days . "
Richards - Kortum said software could be written that would allow medical professionals who are not pathologists to use the device to distinguish healthy from nonhealthy cells .
The device could then be used for routine cancer screening and to help oncologists track how well patients were responding to treatment .
" A portable , battery - powered device like this could be particularly useful for global health , " she said .
" This could save many lives in countries where conventional diagnostic technology is simply too expensive . "
Co-authors of the paper include Dongsuk Shin and Mark Pierce , both of Rice , and Ann Gillenwater and Michelle Williams , both of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center .
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health .

Red Bull Racing may have the fastest car in Formula 1 this year , but the team has made a fundamental mistake .
And the fact that the two drivers collided is not the problem .
That was unfortunate .
The real problem is that one of the drivers – the one leading the World Championship , no less – is no longer sure that he can trust his own team .
Someone in the team has to take the blame for that – and it is not Mark Webber .
At the time of the crash Webber was in the lead and Vettel ’s rash ( some might say desperate ) manoeuvre seemed to catch him out .
Lewis Hamilton , who was following behind in his McLaren was clear that he felt that Vettel was to blame .
“ I saw Sebastian go to the inside , where there ’s not much room , and there did n’t seem to be any reason for him to try to move to the right , ” he said .
Webber was clearly trying to avoid controversy – being loyal to the team – but it was also clear that he was not at all happy .
He explained that there was no reason why Vettel should have been able to close up on him .
“ I was n’t too slow , no .
Seb had a top speed advantage and it looks like he turned pretty quick when he was alongside and we made contact . ”
In a previous post we examined the lap times involved and it was clear that Vettel was suddenly able to speed up in relation to Webber .
Team boss Christian Horner has now confirmed that the drivers did have different engine settings – something he initially denied .
And “ denied ” is an important word .
He did not say that he thought they were on the same setting .
He said that they definitely were .
Later he recanted on that .
Explaining why Horner and Red Bull representative Helmut Marko attacked Webber after the race is going to be difficult to explain .
It is up to the man overtaking to make the move stick and Vettel failed to do that .
Webber did not give him much room but there was no reason why he should have done .
Webber kept to his line , he did not move right or left .
If the road had been wider then Mark would have lost the place , but in the end Vettel drove into the side of his team - mate , presumably thinking that Webber would get out his way .
The problem now is that everyone in the F1 paddock thinks that the Red Bull camp wants Vettel to be World Champion and the whole business has created the ironic situation of Webber being 15 points ahead .
To make matters worse the two McLaren drivers are now between the two Red Bull drivers and so trying to help Vettel will be watched for and could open the way for one of the McLaren men to steal the title – which would not be smart at all .
The big teams have all learned over the years that favouring one driver over another is a very blinkered approach .
It worked for Ferrariwith Michael Schumacher , but in the overall scheme of things , this means that Michael is not given the respect that perhaps he deserves when he is rated along with the all - time greats as he had many advantages and very little pressure .
Williams has always tried to treat its drivers fairly , right back to the days of Alan Jones and Carlos Reutemann .
There were similar problems in the Nelson Piquet - Nigel Mansell era , although Nelson has long since admitted that he stirred up that trouble deliberately to try to destabilize Mansell .
There is no doubt that in 1986 the two Williams drivers lost the title to Alain Prost because they were allowed to race one another .
McLaren has to deal with the same problem with Ayrton Senna and Prost in 1989 and was unable to keep the peace and the same happened in 2007 when Fernando Alonso found it impossible to accept the concept that Lewis Hamilton could be as fast as he was .
This did serious damage to Alonso ’s reputation , although the Spanish media has convinced itself that the English team favoured the English driver .
The Istanbul incident has done nothing to help the relationship between the two Red Bull drivers , although Webber made it clear that he can see a way to get over it .
The real “ f** king disaster ” to which he referred is not about Vettel , but rather about whether he can trust his team or whether he has to watch out for behind - the - scenes meddling .
This uncertainty will weaken the team .
One can dismiss this as paranoia , but what was clear in Istanbul was that almost no - one in F1 outside the Red Bull camp thought Webber could be blamed for the incident .
Red Bull has long had the bad habit of messing with its drivers .
If the team wants to win the World Championship , this must stop .
Down at McLaren they must be laughing all the way to the bank …

Alex comes just as the Coast Guard and BP are preparing to make the oil - collection system at the leaking well on the sea floor more hurricane - ready .
For now , it appears as if Alex will pass far west of the Gulf oil spill .
But even before Alex developed , the end of June and the beginning of July was shaping up to be a crucial moment in BP ’s bid to collect all the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico .
During the next two to three weeks , BP will make major changes at and above the well .
It will bring in a host of new ships to replace those currently on site and radically change the underwater architecture that has captured 15,000 to 25,000 barrels of oil ( 630,000 to 1 million gallons ) daily during much of the past month .
IN PICTURES : Response to the oil spill on the Gulf Coast
In the process , the company will make it easier for ships to connect to and disconnect from its network of subsea pipes in the event of a hurricane .
Here is a snapshot of what is happening now and how that is expected to change during the next few weeks .
What is going on now
Currently , two ships are collecting about 25,000 barrels of oil a day combined .
The first is the Discoverer Enterprise , which can process – in other words , separate from the water and natural gas also captured – about 15,000 barrels of oil a day .
This oil is being sent to shore on tankers , and BP is donating revenues from the oil to a Gulf wildlife fund .
The second ship is the Q4000 , which can only burn the oil it collects .
It is currently burning about 10,000 barrels of oil a day .
Each of these ships collects oil flowing through the failed blowout preventer on the sea floor in a different way , which is important for what comes next .
The Discoverer Enterprise is connected to the containment cap , which is fitted atop the stump of the riser pipe that led to the Deepwater Horizon before the rig sank .
The Q4000 is connected to a valve on the side of the blowout preventer – the choke line , which was used to pump in drilling mud during the failed “ top kill ” operation .
Both ships , however , are connected to the blowout preventer via fixed riser pipes that would have to be disconnected when ships went to shore during a hurricane .
Making the system more hurricane - ready
BP ’s primary goal in the weeks ahead is to replace these fixed riser pipes with flexible riser pipes that would remain connected to the well during a hurricane , their mouths floating about 300 feet below the surface .
Ships returning after a hurricane could more easily connect to a floating riser pipe just below the surface than with the various blowout preventer valves a mile down .
The first flexible riser pipe is almost finished .
It will be attached to a second valve on the side of the blowout preventer known as the kill line .
A new ship called the Helix Producer will connect to this flexible riser .
The Helix Producer can process about 25,000 barrels of oil a day .
It is expected to come online Tuesday .
On Wednesday , BP and the Coast Guard are expected to decide whether to greenlight a project that would remove the containment cap and replace it with a larger cap connected to two flexible riser pipes .
The replacement cap , called an overshot tool , would not sit atop the stump of the original riser pipe , but would bolt directly to the blowout preventer , perhaps creating a better seal .
With two flexible riser pipes , the tool would also allow for two ships to connect to it , potentially doubling capacity .
Media reports suggest that the two ships would be the Discoverer Enterprise and the Toisa Pisces .
Several tankers , including the Loch Rannoch , would ferry the processed oil to shore .
This system , if given the go - ahead Wednesday , would be in place by mid-July .
Around the same time , BP plans to replace the Q4000 and its fixed riser pipe with the Clear Leader and a new flexible riser pipe to the choke line .
In total , the new system would be able to process about 80,000 barrels daily .
This system to collect oil at the well is separate from the efforts to skim the oil slick on the surface .
In those efforts , the A Whale supertanker is on its way to the Gulf .
The supertanker could skim 500,000 gallons of oil - contaminated water from the surface of the Gulf daily .

Why has Eton produced so many prime ministers ?
By Paul Moss
BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight
Historic Eton College has now produced 19 of Britain 's prime ministers
David Cameron has become the 19th prime minister of Great Britain to have attended Eton College near Windsor .
Why have so many leaders come from this one school ?
It is the thread that unites some of Britain 's most disparate prime ministers .
What else could Robert Walpole have in common with Anthony Eden ?
What links William Gladstone to Harold Macmillan ?
The answer lies in a single educational establishment , founded on the bank of the River Thames more than 500 years ago .
Eton may not be the most expensive school in Britain , and it certainly does not get the best exam results .
But this one boys ' secondary has produced 19 prime ministers of Great Britain , one of Northern Ireland , and also educated the prime minister of Thailand .
A good Etonian is gentlemanly , intelligent - who could want better than that ?
Ticky Hedley - Dent , Tatler Magazine
What happened to Eton stigma ?
" Kids arrived there with this extraordinary sense that they knew they were going to run the country , " said Palash Dave , who went to Eton in the 1980s .
He does not count himself among that number , insisting his own crowd were rather less full of themselves .
" But by hell did we have that sense by the time we left . "
Palash
Dave attributes this in part to a relentless series of speakers visiting the school , telling pupils they were potential leaders of the future .
But he also says that the school puts a premium on individualism : " You 're encouraged to pursue any dream you might have .
" Eton also allows a degree of dissent and , to a certain extent , encourages it .
That 's very helpful to anyone who wants a leadership role . "
This is not how the school is usually seen .
OLD ETONIAN POLITICAL LEADERS Sir Robert Walpole William Pitt John Bute George Grenville Frederick North William Grenville George Canning Arthur Wellesley Charles Grey William Melbourne Edward Derby William Gladstone Robert Salisbury Archibald Rosebery Arthur Balfour Sir Anthony Eden Harold Macmillan Sir Alec Douglas - Home David Cameron Terence O'Neill , PM of Northern Ireland James Chichester - Clark , PM of Northern Ireland Abhisit Vejjajiva , PM of Thailand With its Victorian - era uniform , and rules dating back through the centuries , Eton is often perceived as a rigid , conformist institution .
But according to Nick Fraser , author of the book The Importance of Being Eton , the school 's success actually lies in the extraordinary range of freedoms it grants to pupils .
They are particularly well - prepared for a life in politics , he believes , because so many school societies , sports clubs and other activities are run by the pupils themselves .
" Boys elect each other to positions of influence .
So from a very early age , you become adept at being charming , buying votes , being smarmy . "
Of course , smarminess can ruin a potentially - great political career , so too any suggestion of arrogance .
Ticky Hedley - Dent of Tatler Magazine , believes that Etonians ' distinctive ability is to exude confidence , without appearing haughty or conceited .
" You can spot an Etonian , because they 're going to a certain place , with a certain goal in mind , and they just go for it , no matter what other people think . "
Hedley - Dent meets plenty of Etonians at social gatherings , and admits to being charmed .
" A good Etonian is gentlemanly , intelligent - who could want better than that ? " Etonian ' mirage ' David Aaronovitch wants better than that .
In fact , the Times newspaper columnist thinks the fuss about Etonians is completely overblown - more a mirage than an aura .
" Every time somebody does something from Eton , we talk about this person being an " Old- Etonian " .
" We do n't prefix Nick Clegg with being an ' Old - Westminsterian ' .
" There 's a degree of class - deference about it . "
We can do what we want to do in life .
Etonians are back on the scene
Dr Joe Spence Aaronovitch 's view is shared , paradoxically , by one of Eton 's great supporters .
Dr Joe Spence taught at the school from 1987 to 1992 .
And although he is now head teacher of Dulwich College , he still believes that Eton has special qualities .
But Dr Spence also believes that the way Eton is talked about has bred resentment .
" In the late 80s and early 90s , there was a touch of defensiveness .
" I know Douglas Hurd felt the Eton label stood against his chances of becoming leader of the Tory Party .
" There was a sense that the days of the Etonian being important might have passed . "
The success of David Cameron in becoming Conservative leader and now prime minister would suggest such fears were premature .
In fact , when Mr Cameron unveiled his first front - bench team , it included 13 people from his old school .
It is a sign , Dr Spence believes , that the Etonian label is no longer a handicap .
And present - day pupils , he says , are well aware of this .
" There 's a renewed confidence that there is no reason that having been here , we should suffer thereby .
" We can do what we want to do in life .
Etonians are back on the scene . "

Francis Crick
by Matt Ridley
HarperCollins £ 12.99 , pp213
In 1955 , Francis Crick had his first meeting with Nevill Mott , who had just taken over as head of Cambridge 's Cavendish Laboratory , the centre where Crick , with American Jim Watson , had recently uncovered DNA 's double helical structure .
The scientist was keen to impress his new boss .
' I must introduce you to Watson , ' Crick remarked .
Mott looked aghast .
' Watson ?
Watson ? ' he stammered .
' I thought you were Watson - Crick . '
Such a conflation of identity is telling , for if such an august scientist as Mott could be so wrong about these DNA pioneers and assume them to be a single person , what chance has the public of understanding their separate roles and personalities .
Indeed , 50 years later , the two men are still regarded more as a double act - molecular biology 's Lennon and McCartney - than as a pair of individuals .
A biography of Crick is , therefore , timely in helping to put this truly great British scientist in perspective .
This , as Matt Ridley makes clear , was a man who gave far more to the world than just the double helix .
Having uncovered DNA 's structure , for which he and Watson won a Nobel Prize , and shown it to be the stuff from which our genes are made , ' the ebullient , loquacious , charming , sceptical and tenacious ' Crick ( Ridley 's words ) then orchestrated a programme that showed how DNA makes the proteins from which we are constructed .
The human genome project and modern biotechnology emanated from these efforts .
Shamefully , Crick was denied a second Nobel , although his genius was widely acknowledged .
As Nobel Prize - winning biologist Jacques Monod put it : ' No man discovered or created molecular biology .
But one man dominates intellectually the whole field because he knows the most and understands the most : Francis Crick .'
Then , at the summit of this career in 1976 , Crick simply abandoned DNA research and emigrated to the Salk Institute , outside San Diego , where he devoted the rest of his intellectual life to brain research .
Having uncovered the secret of life , he now struggled to reveal the secret of consciousness .
He died , in 2003 , still pursuing that goal .
By contrast , Watson quickly settled for life as a panjandrum , as administrative head of the US Cold Spring Laboratory .
But then , the pair were different in many , striking ways .
Watson was a royalist anglophile .
Crick , by contrast , was a republican , atheist , libertarian , drug - taking womaniser .
He once wrote : ' Christianity may be OK between consenting adults in private but should not be taught to young children ' , while his Who 's Who entry for recreation was listed as ' conversation , especially with pretty women ' .
His Cambridge parties , held at the drop of a hat or , more accurately , a joint , were famous , as Ridley reveals .
' A typical party , organised on the slightest pretext , would fill all four floors of the Golden Helix [ the Crick household ] with friends , music ( Mike Oldfield 's Tubular Bells was a favourite ) , punchbowls of drink and the scent of the odd joint in the air . '
Through all this , Crick , although married , flirted with breathtaking candour but ' in such a gallant and open way that few were offended and most were charmed ' .
He campaigned for the legalisation of drugs and came perilously close to being investigated by the police when an acquaintance was jailed for manufacturing LSD ( one of Crick 's drugs of choice ) .
One cannot imagine the tight - laced Watson being involved in such shenanigans .
Nevertheless , the pair got on well , with one exception .
Shortly after their DNA discovery , Crick , then strapped for cash , wanted to make some BBC broadcasts on the subject .
Watson objected vociferously and accused him of self - publicity .
Crick backed down , only to discover a few years later that Watson had written his own account , The Double Helix , which begins with the sentence : ' I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood . '
Crick was infuriated , but despite involving lawyers , failed to have those words removed .
In the end , however , he simply forgave Watson .
From the pages of this biography , Crick emerges as a powerful , dominating figure who ruled seminars and parties with equal ease , and Ridley , an experienced science writer , with a neat turn of phrase and a proper appreciation of brevity , can be satisfied he has done justice to his subject .
His book has pace , conciseness and wit .
Two flaws mar the proceedings , however .
Ridley 's explanations of the unravelling of DNA 's structure are drowned in detail and desperately cry out for editing .
This is a sin of enthusiasm , however .
Less forgivable is the exclusion of an index which , in a book of this importance , is simple sloppiness on the part of Ridley 's publisher .
For all that , the book is a delight , though it does not quite sustain Ridley 's case that ' because of the momentous nature of his discoveries , Francis Crick must eventually be bracketed with Galileo , Darwin and Einstein ' .
Nearly , but not quite .
Australia 's peak Islamic organisation has reacted with disappointment over Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi 's comments yesterday that the burka is " un-Australian " and should be banned .
South Australian Senator Bernardi lashed out in an article which was published on The Drum website , saying the burka " needs to be binned " .
He called it a " repressive domination of men over women " and said it establishes " different sets and expectations in society " .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd responded today , accusing the Opposition of playing a cynical political exercise by floating the idea of banning the burka .
" I think they are walking both sides of the street on this one ... having someone like Mr Bernardi go out there and talk this up , " he said .
" It 's a pretty interesting exercise in cynical politics . "
In his article , Senator Bernardi said it was unfair that people with motorcycle helmets had to remove them to identify themselves , where women wearing burkas did not because of religious freedom .
" As an avid motorcyclist I am required to remove my helmet before entering a bank or petrol station , " he said .
" It 's a security measure for the businesses and no reasonable person objects to this requirement .
" However , if I cover myself in a black cloth from head to toe , with only my eyes barely visible behind a mesh guard , I am effectively unidentifiable and can waltz into any bank unchallenged in the name of religious freedom . "
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says a ban on the burka is not Coalition policy .
" I 'd prefer it was n't widely worn , but I 'm not proposing to ban it , " Mr Abbott told Channel Nine .
But Muhammad Dahir from the Islamic Association of Australia says the burka is not a compulsory part of Islamic culture and most women have no problem showing their face to identify themselves .
" If people want to see your face , then there 's nothing wrong with that , they have to accept these things .
The majority of the Muslim community have no problem with that , " he said .
Mr Dahir admits there are some areas of society where men will force their wives to wear a burka , but he maintains for the rest , it is a woman 's choice to cover herself completely .
" We do accept there are some cases where the man forces the woman [ to wear a burka ] but it 's due to ignorance .
Islam and the husband cannot force the woman to wear a burka , " he said .
" We condemn if there 's a compulsion from the man to force a women [ to do that ] .. but it has nothing to do with the majority of Muslims and the whole community . "
Several European countries are edging closer to the controversial plan to ban burkas all together and this week a woman in Italy was fined for wearing one in public .
Belgium 's lower house of parliament has approved a draft law to ban wearing the full Islamic face veil in public and France , which has the largest Muslim population in Europe , is set to examine a draft bill this month .
Australian values
Senator Bernardi said Australia also needs to move towards a full ban and that migrating Muslims need to adopt Australian values .
" New arrivals to this country should not come here to recreate the living environment they have just left , " he said .
" They should come here for a better life based on the freedoms and values that have built our great nation . "
Mr Dahir agrees that Muslims need to integrate themselves into the Australian community , but he says there is no place for religion in the political arena .
" I recommend to the Muslim community that we must have more interaction with other communities .. but everyone is different , people have different cultures and diversity , " he said .
" They have to keep their culture , we should n't ban them , otherwise we 'll have problems .
We have to be tolerant in these matters .
" If we drag this issue [ into politics ] , especially with the election , we do n't want any politician to bring religion into the political arena .
To me it 's brings a lot of problems and tension to the community .
[ The majority of Muslims ] are living peacefully , we do n't have problems .
" I 'm very happy the Opposition Leader came forward and said he has no policy to ban burka and that 's what leaders should do - condemn this kind of statement .
We need to unite the community , not divide it . "
Greens Senator Sarah Hanson - Young says if politicians want to ban certain items of clothing they could start with budgie - smugglers .
" The flippant comments of Cory Bernardi and Tony Abbott I think do n't really deal with the issue and are the last people I 'd like to be seeing advocating for women 's rights , " Senator Hanson - Young said .
" If you want to have a discussion about banning a certain piece of attire I suggest maybe we should be looking at the budgie - smuggler .
I 'd suggest there 's many people out there who find it quite offensive . "
WASHINGTON  Natural gas will provide an increasing share of America ’s energy needs over the next several decades , doubling its share of the energy market to 40 percent , from 20 percent , according to a report to be released Friday by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The increase , the report concluded , will come largely at the expense of coal and will be driven both by abundant supplies of natural gas  made more available by shale drilling  and by measures to restrict the carbon dioxide emissions that are linked to climate change .
In the long term , however , the future may be dimmer for natural gas if stricter regulations are put in place to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050  a goal set by President Obama .
Although lower in carbon than coal , natural gas is still too carbon - intensive to be used under such a target absent some method of carbon capture , the authors of the report concluded .
The report , one of a series on energy resources , is the result of a two - year effort by 14 prominent energy experts , led by Ernest J. Moniz , an M.I.T. professor who is a former under secretary of energy .
Previous reports focused on nuclear power and coal .
The report was financed in part by the American Clean Skies Foundation , which represents the interests of the natural gas industry .
If you ask people who ’s lighting the innovation fires around Detroit , pretty soon you get directed to the New Economy Initiative for Southeast Michigan .
This coalition of 10 community and philanthropic organizations was formed in 2008 with the goal of pooling resources to “ restore southeast Michigan to a position of leadership in the new global economy , ” according to the group ’s website .
Ambitious seems like the right word for that vision , given the scale of Detroit ’s problems .
The population has dropped by more than half since 1950 , the city budget deficit is likely to hit $ 450 million by the end of this year , and there are nearly 50 square miles of vacant , abandoned land within the city limits .
The area would be lucky to regain a position of leadership in the Midwest , much less top rank on the global stage .
But if you were the type to let the difficulties get you down , you ’d never even get started on solving them .
And David Egner , the New Economy Initiative ’s executive director , is not easily discouraged .
“ The uncertainty will eat you alive if you let it , ” says Egner , who is also president of the Hudson - Webber Foundation , a legacy of the family that founded Hudson ’s department stores .
In Detroit , he says , “ We have to strike a balance between the comfortable certainty of going in a known direction , even if it is wrong — which is what Detroit has been doing for the last couple of decades — and the fear and uncertainty of limitless possibilities . ”
Of course , optimism and a tolerance for uncertainty are practically a job requirement for people in Michigan ’s non-profit sector .
( Before taking the reins at the Hudson - Webber Foundation in 1997 , Egner was an executive at Junior Achievement and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and CEO of the Michigan Nonprofit Association . )
In a long conversation with Xconomy , the first part of which is included below , Egner emphasized all the things Detroit has going for it , such as its manufacturing infrastructure and its strategic location as an international port and a hub for rail , truck , and water traffic .
Even the city ’s empty land can be seen as an opportunity , Egner argues .
That ’s because it makes business expansion cheaper and creates room for experiments like Hantz Farms , planned to become the world ’s largest urban farm .
Egner is realistic , too .
He acknowledges that the city is still paying for its history of political discord and the complacency of its anchor employers , the big three automakers .
Egner says the regional economy probably has n’t hit bottom yet , with a new wave of business failures likely among auto suppliers who are slow to adapt to the new patterns of manufacturing .
But he thinks the money the New Economy Initiative is committed to spending in Detroit — $ 100 million over eight years — will go a long way toward accomplishing the group ’s three major goals .
The initiative is seeking to create a stronger entrepreneurial ecosystem , make better use of the region ’s existing industrial assets , and build up a better - educated better - trained workforce .
For the record , the members of the New Economy Initiative are the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan ( based in Detroit ) , the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Foundation ( Southfield , MI ) , the Ford Foundation ( New York ) , the Hudson - Webber Foundation ( Detroit ) , the W.K. Kellogg Foundation ( Battle Creek , MI ) , the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation ( Miami ) , the Kresge Foundation ( Troy , MI ) , the McGregor Fund ( Detroit ) , the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation ( Flint , MI ) , and the Skillman Foundation ( Detroit ) .
While Egner still runs the Hudson - Webber Foundation , he puts half of his time toward overseeing the New Economy Initiative , which has downtown offices just blocks from Detroit ’s landmark Renaissance Center .
The coalition has to work fast ; barring an extension of the understanding that binds its members together , Egner says , the initiative will run out of money in 2012 and disband by 2015 .
Part 1 of my interview with Egner is below .
We ’ll publish Part 2 later this week .
Xconomy :
This question may sound mean or inappropriate , but I mean it in a constructive way .
Why is Detroit worth saving ?
David Egner :
That ’s not an inappropriate question at all .
Let ’s start with the historical aspects .
Seventy to 80 years ago , this was Silicon Valley .
It was where people came if they wanted to make something and create a business .
Today , it ’s largely driven by autos .
But before that it was stoves , and before that it was lumber .
Detroit has always been a town of hard - working innovators .
It really was the institutionalization of the auto industry that led to us becoming complacent , and in some respects , entitled .
Whether that was through how union contracts were drawn up , or how executives got compensated , there was this entitlement mentality that because of what Detroit had built , it did n’t matter how we got it , we were entitled to have it .
But all of that DNA , or hard work and creative spirit , is still here in a major way .
And we ’re seeing it now at TechTown , where Randal Charlton is running the largest accelerator in the world , and receiving 100 inquiries a day from people trying to figure out how to start businesses .
Look at the comparative advantage points of Detroit versus the rest of the world , or the rest of North America .
You ’ve got the most cross - border international traffic in all of North America .
You ’ve got more goods coming over the Ambassador Bridge from Windsor than … Next Page »

Finding itself in Republican sights and with no Democratic power center to offer protection , National Public Radio is turning into an upscale version of Fox " News . "
Nevertheless , information still gets out if the listener is sufficiently attentive .
On July 5 , NPR ’s All Things Considered interviewed two warmongers for their views on the North Korean missile test .
One was Ashton Carter , a Clinton administration assistant secretary of defense , now at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard .
The other was Ambassador Christopher Hill , an assistant secretary of state in the Bush regime .
The Clinton DoD assistant secretary is coauthor of a recent article advocating a unilateral U.S. military attack on North Korea .
His first pitch on NPR was that the whole region , not just the U.S. , is threatened by North Korea and that everyone should gang up on North Korea to make them behave .
The NPR interviewer asked Carter to reconcile his multilateralism with his own recommendation for the U.S. to unilaterally attack North Korea .
Carter replied that North Korea ’s missile was developed to attack us , so we had to protect ourselves .
When the NPR interviewer asked Carter why deterrence would fail with North Korea when deterrence succeeded in the case of the more powerful Soviet Union , Carter agreed that North Korea was not sufficiently insane to launch an attack on the U.S.
So , if the U.S. is not in danger of being attacked by North Korea , why does Carter want to attack North Korea ?
The answer is , well , you see , if we permit North Korea to develop any weapon with which they might be able to stand up to us on some issue critical to North Korea , well , they might not do as we want them to do .
Carter could not conceive of a world in which any country existed that might be able to behave differently than the U.S. dictates .
Ambassador
Hill agreed , but he came at it in a different way .
Hill ’s view is that it is China ’s , Japan’s , and South Korea ’s responsibility to make North Korea behave as the U.S. wants it to behave .
Both Hill and Carter agreed that no country , with the exception of Israel , has a right to any interests of its own unless it is an interest that coincides with U.S. interests .
No other interest is legitimate .
Listening to the pair of hegemonic maniacs , I realized that the U.S. is the new Rome  there is no legitimate power but us .
Any other power is a potential threat to our interests and must be eliminated before it gets any independent ideas .
The U.S. , however , is far more dangerous than Rome .
Rome saw its world as the Mediterranean and , for a while , Northern Europe , but the U.S. thinks the whole world is its oyster .
The Bush regime is busy trying to marginalize Russia , and neocons are preparing war plans to attack China before that country can achieve military parity with the U.S .
Gentle reader , consider what it means when our government believes other countries have no right to their own interests unless they coincide with U.S. interests .
It means that we are the tyrant country .
We cannot be the tyrant country without being perceived as the tyrant country .
Consequently , the rest of the world unites against us .
How is the U.S. , which has spent three years proving that it cannot successfully occupy Iraq , a small country of only 25 million people , going to control India , China , Russia , Europe , Africa , and South America ?
It ’s not going to happen .
What it does mean is that the U.S. government in its hubris and delusion is going to continue starting wars and attacking other countries until a coalition of greater forces smashes us .
Even among our European allies we are already perceived as the greatest threat to world peace and stability .
Our power is not what it once was .
We are weak in manufacturing and dependent on China for advanced technology products .
We are dependent on China to finance our wars and our budget and trade deficits .
How long will China accommodate us when China reads about Bush ’s plans to prevent China from achieving military parity ?
The Bush regime thinks that it can have every country under its thumb .
Neocons are fond of proclaiming that it is a unipolar world in which the U.S. is supreme .
This is a fantasy , and it is rapidly becoming a nightmare .
