What Christmas truce ?
Carol service for our troops on the Afghan frontline ends with a blast of reality from the Taliban
It was dusk in Helmand .
And as the sun set over the baked earth , commandos wearing Santa hats gathered round the war memorial and began a simple chorus of carols .
Then the Taliban attacked .
There was no time for the troops to think or even to take off their festive hats .
Any hopes of a Christmas truce , when hostilities cease and foes become friends for a few precious hours , were dashed in an instant .
British troops in Helmand Province get into the Christmas spirit with some carols last year - but the peace was quickly shattered by a Taliban attack
It is a tradition that stretches back to the trenches of the First World War , when British and German soldiers shared drinks , sang carols , exchanged gifts and even enjoyed an impromptu game of football in no - man 's - land .
But things are different in Afghanistan .
At the first sound of enemy fire the Royal Marines of 40 Commando threw down their hymn sheets and sprinted to the mortar lines 200 yards away .
Within a minute , they were returning fire .
For three - quarters of an hour , they battled with the insurgents , ear defenders over their festive headgear - the only reminder of the peace the evening had promised .
The soldiers had no time to change their festive headgear - be it Santa or Christmas tree hat - and began firing at enemy positions
Then , as the skirmish ended and darkness fell , the servicemen and women returned to the memorial at Forward Operating Base Inkerman , and resumed the carol service , thankful there had been no British casualties .
The attack , on Christmas Day last year , illustrates the relentless call of duty faced by our troops on the front line .
In Afghanistan , 8,000 will celebrate the season this way .
A further 4,100 will spend the military 's final Christmas Day in Iraq .
Recalling the skirmish , Captain Euan Goodman , of The Rifles regiment , who took the photographs , said : ' We were with the Royal Marines at their camp , which is surrounded by mountains and desert .
We were experiencing Afghanistan 's coldest winter for 20 years but the lads were in really high spirits .

' They were in the middle of a traditional carol service , complete with Santa hats and song sheets , when they came under attack from the Taliban , who had targeted one of the checkpoints .
' There was the sound of machine gun fire and an explosion .
They dropped their hymn sheets and literally ran 200 metres to the mortar lines .
' A few Santa hats were thrown on the ground , but for others there was no time to remove them .
They were still wearing their hats when they fired their mortar rounds .
' It went on for about 45 minutes and by then it was pretty much dark .
But they went back to the war memorial and continued their service .
I think that later they had their Christmas meal .
' It 's supposed to be a special time of year no matter where you are .
But at the end of the day it 's the nature of the job that we have to keep working .
The show must go on . '
Earlier in the day , Captain Goodman , 28 , had helped deliver a goat for Gurkhas to curry for their own Christmas meal .
Regardless of the difficult conditions , soldiers try to retain a touch of festive spirit , he explained .
Traditionally , officers wake their men with ' gunfire ' , a mug of tea containing a shot of rum or whisky - and then serve them their meal .
Captain Goodman , who joined the Army in 2001 , added : ' We try to ensure everyone either gets a slap - up breakfast or a traditional Christmas lunch .
The Royal Marines put the festivities on hold at their base in Inkerman as they dash to return fire - still wearing their Christmas hats
' All the food is prepared at the main base at Camp Bastion and then flown out by helicopters to each camp to heat up in the oven .
We also get inundated with presents from the general public , which are a huge morale boost .
' Thousands of parcels are donated every year and split evenly among the units who then share them out .
You get everything from toothpaste to woolly scarfs .
' It 's much like the traditional present opening you get on Christmas morning - except servicemen tend to have the wrapping off as soon as they get the parcel , whether it's two weeks before Christmas or sometimes long after it 's finished . '
This year there will also be additional free telephone time made available to call loved ones .
The skirmish lasted 45 minutes before troops could resume the carol service - with no British casualties
On Christmas Day , soldiers at Bastion will tuck into the 700lb of replacement turkey , flown in by the RAF after insurgents attacked a convoy carrying the original consignment - topped off with 200 jars of cranberry sauce - along with 300lb of roast pork , 1,000lb of gammon and 150 lb of beef .
The team of chefs will also prepare 350lb of sprouts , 700lb of roast potatoes and 270lb of carrots .
To complete the feast there will be 222 Christmas puddings , 37 Christmas cakes and a ration of one mince pie and one After Eight mint for each serviceman and woman .
In addition , there will be 3,000 crackers - complete with bad jokes - 2,880 party poppers , 3,600 assorted balloons , 2,880 party hats , and 3,000 streamers .
Loner who built network of tunnels out of rubbish in his home dies ' after getting lost in labyrinth '
An eccentric loner is believed to have died of thirst after becoming trapped in a bizarre and intricate network of tunnels built from rubbish in his home .
Investigators believe the labyrinth was so complicated that Gordon Stewart , 74 , may have become lost inside it .
It is thought he may have died as a result of dehydration , after becoming unable to find his way out of the stinking mass .
Neighbours had become concerned that they had not seen him for several days and raised the alarm .
Gordon Stewart is believed to have died of dehydration after becoming trapped in tunnels built from rubbish in his Buckinghamshire home
According to witnesses , the officers were faced with mounds of foul - smelling garbage which he had used to construct tunnels around his home .
Police called in a specialist diving team last Friday afternoon because the smell from the house in Broughton , Buckinghamshire , was so overpowering .
They discovered a confusing system of tunnels networking around the interior of the building , with Mr Stewart lying dead inside .
Locals say Mr Stewart , who wore a ponytail , was often spotted riding his bike around the streets .
Officers discovered him entombed in his own creation , built from discarded carrier bags , boxes , old furniture and other assorted junk .
Foul - smelling : Mr Stewart 's house was filled with rubbish
One neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ' He was slightly eccentric , but very clever .
He was just a collector .
He came home with a load of cardboard boxes and lived in his own world . '
A second described his death as a ' tragedy ' .
Neighbours said Mr Stewart 's home had been accumulating rubbish for at least 10 years .
This week , plastic bags were clearly seen piled across his front window , while outside further bags , broken furniture , computer parts and even an old TV set spilled over his front lawn .
A car dating back to the 1950s stands in the garage believed to have been left untouched for years as garbage built up around it .
A spokesman from Thames Valley Police , said : ' Police were called on Friday at 12.26 pm by a member of public who was concerned for welfare of a resident on Narbeth Drive .
' Police forced entry where they found a man 's body .
There are no suspicious circumstances .'
It is believed Mr Stewart lived alone and has no next of kin .
A post mortem examination is due to be carried out at a later date .
UPDATE : Questions Surround Oliver Stone ’s ‘ W ’ : What Money Will It Make This Weekend ? Did Movie Borrow From Authors ’ Books ?
Was Film Financed By ‘ Suspect Chinese ’ ?
EXCLUSIVE : Fandango , one of the Internet ’s biggest movie ticketsellers , is currently polling moviegoers interested in seeing W , the new Oliver Stone biopic about George W. Bush opening this Friday .
Here are a few preliminary results based on nearly 2,000 respondents who answered its survey from Friday through 2:30 pm today :
If the air in the San Joaquin Valley is clean , then what 's that brown haze everywhere as you drive along Interstate 5 ?
Community groups , public health advocates and environmentalists filed suit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday to overturn an October 2007 rule that allowed valley officials to declare victory in a long battle against the airborne dust technically known as coarse particulate matter ( PM - 10 ) .
According Earthjustice , the environmental law firm that filed the suit in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , air quality monitors in the valley show that federal standards are not being met .
The EPA and the local air district say that the recurring violations are natural ones that do not need to be addressed through further controls .
" At the time of the finding , we said it was either a miracle or they were lying , " said Kevin Hall of the Fresno Sierra Club .
" As more data came in , we became convinced it was the latter . "
Much of the pollution in the valley is due to agricultural activity , such as plowing fields , harvesting crops and truck traffic along unpaved farm roads .
Agribusiness , which has been chafing under air pollution rules , is the most politically influential industry in the valley .
The region includes more than a thousand giant dairy farms , many of which house more than 1,500 cows each .
Recently , the Bush administration exempted factory farms nationwide from some reporting requirements for ammonia , one of the precursors to fine particle pollution .

State bond money designated for pollution control has financed factory farms that have helped turn the valley into one of the nation 's most polluted areas .

Dear Straight Dope :
What exactly is the plural of penis ?
I would say penises , but it seems too simple and obvious .
Is it penis , like deer , or maybe peni , like fungi ?
Sissy , Emerald Isle , NC
SDStaff bibliophage replies :
If you have more than one , you should be writing to Ripley ’s and not to the Straight Dope .
Heck ,
Sissy , if you have even one , the first thing you should do is change your name to Buddy .
In this case , your first instinct is a good one .
The English - style plural is usually acceptable and often preferred .
When you do n’t know what the Latin plural is and do n’t have a dictionary handy , you should choose the English - style plural rather than try to guess .
( Sometimes even dictionaries will steer you wrong ; see below ) .
In your example , penises is a perfectly good plural of penis in English .
Many people who deal with penises professionally use the Latin - style plural penes instead .
That ’s fine too , but even among urologists , penises seem to predominate .
Seems , rather .
“ Penises ” seems to predominate .
Guessing the plural of a Latin word is one of those things where a little learning is a dangerous thing ( but that ’s still “ not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance , ” to quote Terry Pratchett ) .
Those with entirely too much learning know that Latin nouns are divided into five categories , called declensions .
To figure out the plural of a Latin noun without cheating ( i.e. , looking it up ) , it is necessary , and often sufficient , to know which of the five declensions it belongs to .
( There are a few nouns , like virus , that do n’t fit neatly into any of the declensions , but more on that later ) .
For example , you mention peni as a possible plural of penis .
The - i ending is valid for forming the plural of second - declension Latin nouns ending in - us , but of course that does n’t apply to penis .
Part of the problem is that when unaccented , the singular endings - us and - is tend to be pronounced the same in English .
Those with a little learning know that penus , if it were a second declension noun like most - us nouns in Latin , would be expected to have the plural form peni .
Since penus would be pronounced the same–or almost the same–as penis in English , the temptation is strong to use the incorrect peni as the plural .
Peni is an example of what is called pseudo - Latin , something that looks like Latin but is n’t .
A similar mistake is using porpi as the plural of porpoise , but in that case the singular was long spelled porpus under the mistaken impression that it was a Latin word .
Penis is a third declension noun , not second declension .
These nouns often end in - is in the singular and - es in the plural .
The English style - ises is sometimes preferred .
Hence , we have penises ( half of us do , anyway ) , and mantises and pelvises , but only more rarely do you see penes , mantes , and pelves , though they are not incorrect .
In many cases , only the Latin form is acceptable :
We have testes ( some more than others ) and crises and psychoses , but never testises , crisises , or pyschosises .
Another group of third - declension Latin nouns , mostly borrowed from Greek , end in - is in the singular , but the full root is not found in that form .
These you either have to learn by heart or look up .
For example , the Latin plural of iris is irides , which is acceptable in English , but I prefer irises .
I like clitorises , but the Latin form clitorides is also acceptable .
Among second declension - us nouns borrowed into English , the English style plural - uses is often preferred to the Latin - i .
Thus isthmuses and crocuses are generally preferred , but isthmi and croci are still acceptable .
For many words , the Latin style is preferred , but the English is acceptable , as in fungi ( or funguses ) .
Sometimes the Latin style is preferred in technical usage , while the English style is better for the nontechnical .
Mathematically speaking , ellipses have foci , while investigations may have focuses .
Of course the English style - uses requires an extra syllable , and you have to judge for yourself whether it ’s worth it for polysyllabic words .
Nuclei rolls off the tongue easier than nucleuses , but both are acceptable .
Either the long hippopotami or the longer hippopotamuses is acceptable , but it ’s easy to see why some people are attracted to hippos .
In Greek , the African pachyderm was called a riverine horse : hippopotamos ( plural hippopotamoi ) or hippos potamios ( plural hippoi potamioi ) .
Since only the Latinized form in - us is found in English , neither of these Greek plurals is needed .
The shortened form hippo is found only in English and can only take the plural hippos .
You may sometimes see hippoi used in English as the plural of hippo .
Hippoi is properly the Greek plural of hippos ( “ horse ” ) , not of hippo .
Note that rhinoceros is a pachyderm of a different color .
Both words are ultimately from Greek , and the last syllable is pronounced the same in English , but rhinoceri is not proper Latin ( nor Greek ) .
That form has found its way into some English dictionaries , but I would advise against messing with rhinoceri .
In Latin rhinoceros is a third declension noun with the plural rhinocerotes .
Rarely you see the plural form rhinocerontes in English , but that is properly the plural of a variant Latin singular form , rhinoceron .
You ’ll be laughed straight out of the zoo if you try to use either one in English .
Stick to rhinoceroses .
Or better yet , rhinos ( certainly not rhinoi ) .
One other group of Latin nouns in - us is different .
These are fourth - declension masculine nouns .
The plural in Latin is spelled the same as the singular , but the u is pronounced long rather than short .
When these words are borrowed into English , the English - style plural is almost always preferred over the Latin .
We have censuses , hiatuses , sinuses , and fetuses ( or foetuses ) .
The second - declension style endings are never correct , so no cenci , hiati , sini , or feti please .
Apparatus is rarely pluralized in English .
When a plural is needed , either apparatus or apparatuses is acceptable , but never apparati .
It so happens that penus , the near homophone of penis that I mentioned above , is a real word in Latin but of the fourth declension , so the plural is penus , not peni .
It means “ household stock , ” something you would presumably want to stow along with the family jewels .
Yet another group of Latin nouns in - us follow different rules .
If you ’re still taking notes , these form another subset of the third declension .
Typically in these cases the singular does not include the full root .
The plural of genus is genera ( not genuses and certainly not geni ) .
In English the plural of opus ( meaning a creative work ) is opera ( or opuses ) .
In Latin , opera was originally the plural of opus , but in both Latin and English , opera can correctly be treated as a singular .
In English the plural of opera ( the thing that ai n’t over till the fat lady sings ) is operas .
When opera is used as a singular in Latin ( where it meant more of less the same thing as opus ) , the correct plural is operae , but this is rarely if ever used in English .
Octopus is another of these third declension nouns in Latin , borrowed from Greek .
The Latin plural is octopodes , which is acceptable in English , but octopuses ( or even octopus ) seems more at home in English .
The form octopi is quite common in English , but it is pseudo - Latin .
It is based on the mistaken belief that octopus was a second - declension noun like fungus .
It has made its way into many English dictionaries , but I would not recommend getting tangled up with octopi .
It is true that many standard English words have entered the language through mistakes ( an apron from a napron , pea from pease , etc. ) , so octopi may not be totally indefensible .
But people who know Latin , admittedly not a large group , will think less of you for using it .
There is one more common English - us word borrowed from Latin that does n’t follow any of the rules above : virus .
To the Romans a virus was a dangerous or disgusting substance , anything from snake venom to body odor .
Ancient grammarians could n’t agree whether the word was a third - declension noun , a fourth - declension noun or in a class by itself , but the one thing they could agree on was that it did n’t have a plural form .
Ever .
To the Romans , it was a mass noun , not a count noun .
That has n’t stopped English writers from inventing pseudo - Latin plural forms to cover the modern countable senses of the word .
Viri is formed on the false assumption that virus is a second - declension noun .
( Viri in fact is the plural of Latin vir , “ man ” . )
Virii is an even worse mistake .
Only Latin nouns that end in - ius form the plural with - ii .
There are no really common English plurals in - ii other than radii .
That has n’t stopped people from trying out such atrocious forms as virii and penii .
Virii would be the plural of virius , if such a word existed in Latin .
Other suggested plurals include virora , vira , virua , and vire .
The one inescapable fact is that in classical Latin , there was no plural of the word .
In English , the only correct plural is viruses .
Some English - us nouns were borrowed from other parts of speech in Latin or from other forms ( cases ) of the noun than the usual nominative .
Most of us do n’t get boni or ride bi ( but I ’m not judgmental if you do ) .
We get bonuses and ride buses .
Bonus is not a noun in Latin but an adjective meaning “ good ” ; bus is a shortened form of omnibus , which is already a Latin dative plural meaning “ for all . ”
A few English nouns in - us derive from Latin verbs , so they ca n’t be pluralized like Latin nouns .
Mandamus means “ we order ” in Latin , and ignoramus means “ we are ignorant . ”
We can issue mandamuses to ignoramuses , but we can safely ignore mandami from ignorami .
And of course not all nouns that end in - us are Latin at all .
Walruses may sun themselves on taluses , but you will search tali for walri in vain .
Since we ’ve come this far , we may as well deal with some other common Latin plurals that have found their way into English .
First declension Latin singulars end in - a in the singular and in - ae in the plural .
Often the English and Latin style plurals are both acceptable .
You have larvae ( or larvas ) and amoebas ( or amoebae ) .
When speaking of female graduates , you say alumnae ( but not alumnas ) .
Sometimes which form to use depends on the context .
Radios have antennas but insects , unless they ’re trying to tune in a Rimsky - Korsakov number on the wireless , have antennae .
Sometimes the plural form is more common in English than the singular .
Minutia is the singular of minutiae and alga is the singular of algae .
There are a few Latin words in - a that do not form the plural in - ae because they are third declension nouns borrowed from Greek .
The English style plural is usually best .
Traumas , dramas , and dogmas are preferred over traumata , dramata , and dogmata , but stigmata is preferred over stigmas .
You should never accept enemata from strangers .
A subset of the second declension ends in - um in the singular and in - a in the plural .
In English -ums is sometimes preferred .
Forums ( or fora ) , gymnasiums ( or gymnasia ) , podiums ( or podia ) , but bacteria ( not bacteriums ) , phyla ( not phylums ) .
Seers are mediums but radio and television are two media .
Data is the plural of datum in Latin and English .
English also has the plural form datums , but only in the cartographic sense ( meaning a reference point ) .
In English , purists still rail against using data and media with a singular verb .
These are instances of usages that began as mistakes but are now so common that they are arguably correct .
Another example of the same evolution is agenda .
In Latin ( and sometimes in English ) it is the plural of agendum ( meaning “ a thing that needs to be done ” ) but is now almost invariably treated as a singular in English ( meaning “ a list or set of things that need to be done ” ) , with the correct English plural agendas .
Plural forms that take a further pluralization ( correctly or incorrectly ) are called “ double plurals . ”
Other examples include the incorrect forms alumnis and bacterias and the correct operas .
One caution –quorum is a genitive plural pronoun in Latin .
The English plural is quorums , never quora .
Latin words ending in - ies are usually the same in the singular and plural , both in Latin and in English .
Series , species , caries ( as in dental caries ) are correct as singular and plural .
Latin singulars ending in - on are borrowings from Greek and usually end in - a in the plural in Latin .
Phenomena ( or arguably phenomenons , as in “ singing phenomenons ” ) , ganglia ( or ganglions ) .
Sometimes the English - style plural seems more natural , as in automatons ( but automata is acceptable ) .
Criteria is now sometimes used as a singular in English , but it started life as the plural of criterion .
Latin singulars in -x have plurals in - ces or –ges in Latin , but in English - ixes is usually preferred .
Dominatrixes ( or dominatrices ) , indexes ( or indices ) , cervixes ( or cervices ) .
The bones of the fingers and toes are phalanges but infantry formations are more often phalanxes .
There are several odd words whose plurals will not be obvious from the above rules .
One oddball is pubes ( two syllables , meaning the pubic region or pubic hair ) .
It is the same in the singular and plural in Latin and English .
The supposed singular pubis is pseudo - Latin , except when it means the pubic bone ( in full , os pubis , “ bone of the pubes ” ) .
The plural of specimen in Latin is specimina , but in English specimens .
The plural of exemplar is exemplaria in Latin , but exemplars is a better model for English .
Some words from Latin are more common in the plural , so the singular form may not be obvious .
Mores ( as in folkways and mores ) has the rare singular form mos .
Viscera ( the internal organs ) has the rare singular viscus .
Insignia and regalia are the plurals of insigne and regale in Latin , but these singulars are rare in English .
Paraphernalia is a plural in English and Latin .
It has a rare English singular , paraphernal .
The Latin singular , not found in English , is paraphernalis .
Feces ( or faeces ) is plural in Latin with the singular fex ( or faex ) .
It is usually treated as a singular in English .
Stamina started life as the plural of stamen ( “ thread ” ) but is now usually a singular in English , except sometimes when referring to sexual anatomy ( of the botanical kind ) .
Flowers may have many stamina , but Gennifer ’s former lover has much stamina .
The name of our species , Homo sapiens ( literally “ wise human ” ) is singular in both Latin and English .
The plural of the phrase in Latin–in the non-technical sense of a wise human–would be homines sapientes , but there is never any call to use a plural in English .
There is only one species called Homo sapiens .
Homo sapien as the supposed singular of Homo sapiens is an abomination .
I call this a “ double singular . ”
Kudo as the supposed singular of kudos is another example .
Borrowed directly from the Greek , kudos ( “ praise ” ) is already singular .
The questionable form congery formed from the Latin singular congeries is another instance .
Bicep , tricep , quadricep , and forcep are incorrectly formed from biceps , triceps , quadriceps , and forceps , which are already singular .
Gladiolus has given rise to a double singular too .
Gladiolus is a Latin singular with the plural form gladioli .
This is probably the best choice for the plural in English , but gladioluses is also acceptable .
The similarity of sound of - as and - us in unaccented English syllables makes some people believe the word is gladiolas , which they suppose is a plural with the singular form gladiola .
This double singular has made its way into some dictionaries , but the shortened glad would be a happier choice .
Other than Latin words and Greek words mostly borrowed through Latin , few words have been borrowed into English complete with their foreign plurals .
In the case of many of the western Romance languages ( such as French , Spanish , and Portuguese ) , it ’s usually hard to tell because in these languages plurals often end in the letter s , as in English .
Linguists believe this form of the plural in western Romance languages is derived from the Latin forms - as , - os , and - es ( first , second , and third declension masculine and feminine accusative plurals , used for direct objects ) and not , as you might expect , from forms like -es ( third declension nominative plurals , used for subjects ) .
The native English pluralizing suffixes spelled -s and - es ( but often pronounced with a / z/ sound ) come from the same ultimate source ( one class of proto - Indo - European plural endings ) , but by a very different route .
It is largely a matter of chance that Old English and Old French happened to retain the same plural endings , almost to the exclusion of the many other plural endings in PIE .
After the Norman invasion , the introduction of French -s may have hastened the decline of other plural endings in English , but the process was already underway .
We still have oxen and brethren ( if we can tell them apart ) , but we no longer wear shoen and live in housen .
Unlike French and Spanish , Italian gets its plurals from the Latin nominative rather than the accusative .
When borrowed into English , these give us such words as graffiti , which is properly the plural of graffito , but which is now often treated as a singular in English .
A particularly interesting case is bandit .
We anglicized the Italian bandito to bandit in the singular but still sometimes use the Italian plural banditti alongside the English form bandits .
Cognoscenti is the plural of the obsolete Italian cognoscente .
Also from Italian we get many food terms that are plurals in that language , but treated as singular in English : spaghetti , broccoli , and zucchini .
Some Hebrew plurals such as seraphim and cherubim exist alongside the English - style plurals like seraphs and cherubs .
From Arabic , we have jinn ( or djinn ) as the plural of jinni ( or djinni ) .
Other languages are not often honored by having their plurals accepted on equal terms .
For example , you would never say that this Staff Report is longer than many Icelandic sögur ; you would say that this Staff Report is longer than many Icelandic sagas .
And that , I think , is quite long enough .

The first comprehensive inventory of the sea and land animals living in a polar region has been carried out by British and German scientists .
A team from the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) and Hamburg University found that Antarctica 's South Orkney Islands were surprisingly rich in life .
More than 1,200 species were counted , including five new to science .
The data , published in the Journal of Biogeography , will help to monitor how the animals respond to future changes .
David Barnes , from BAS , said : " This is the first time this has been done , not just anywhere in Antarctica , but anywhere in either polar region . "
Below the surface of the sea , it is an incredibly rich environment
Dr David Barnes , BAS
The researchers studied scientific literature dating back more than 100 years , as well as more recent surveys of the land , sea and shores of the archipelago .
They concluded that there were 1,224 species in total , of which 1,026 were found in the Antarctic waters - including sea urchins , worms , crustaceans and molluscs .
Dr Barnes told BBC
News : " There is a widely held belief that life is very rich in the tropics and decreases through temperate areas , through to polar regions , which are thought to be barren .
" That is partly because we see life from the land point of view - and when we see the Arctic and Antarctic , we just see ice .
" But below the surface of the sea , it is an incredibly rich environment , and diving there is a bit like diving on a coral reef . "
He added : " If we look at other archipelagos across the globe that are also isolated , we can see that the South Orkney Islands are actually richer than the Galapagos in terms of the number of species we find in the sea . "
The team also discovered five species that were new to science , including moss - like animals and marine " woodlice " .
Compared with other surveys in the polar regions , this is a relatively low number .

However , finding so few new species was an indication that the team had picked the right spot to survey , said Dr Barnes .
He said : " This is some of the best - studied land anywhere in the Antarctic , because there have been biologists on it continuously for decades .
" Ironically - when you have a place where you do n't find lots of new species , it tells you that you know the life that occurs there fairly well . "
This worm was found in the South Orkney Islands
The scientists will now use the inventory to monitor how this area will respond to future environmental changes .
Dr Barnes said : " If we are trying to measure change over time , and try and ascribe different amounts of change to things like response to regional warming or response to ocean acidification , you need to have this kind of baseline and you need to have confidence in that baseline . "

When I first started this blog back in 2005 , the foodie scene in Omaha was pretty underground .
Slowly we 've seen some encouraging changes .
More locals joining the social sites like Foodbuzz eGullet and Chowhound .
More reviews going up on sites like yelp and urbanspoon .
The Omaha World - Herald finally got a clue and gave food it 's own subsection on their website .
Food and Spirits magazine brought a dedicated local food publication to the area .
And most importantly , more Omaha food bloggers have begun sharing their own thoughts and experiences .
With that , let me introduce you to our fellow Omaha Food Bloggers and announce the creation of the Omaha Food Bloggers Blog Roll .
Blogs marked with awere added after our initial announcement .
Kenton and Melissa make some great food , and better yet , take some amazing pictures of said food .
The many recipes on their site cover both cooking and baking and they 're not afraid to share their experiments .
A couple from Nebraska doing their best to minimize their reliance on processed foods ( i.e. , they strive to eat primarily “ outside of the box ” ) .
They ’ve created this blog as a way of giving people an “ insider ’s view ” of what it ’s like to live a life quite unlike the average American .
While many folks are out at the bars or movies on the weekends , they are likely visiting a local farm or making homemade mayonnaise !!!
Lainey Seyler writes for The Reader , but this is her personal blog where she records her " culinary fiascos and successes . "
She has lots of recipes and provides plenty of entertainment .

By mephisto786 at 2006-06-18 11:48 WHY SLACKWARE WILL ALWAYS MATTER
By Jibril Hambel
Released under a Creative Commons ( Attrib - NonCommerical - No Derivs 2.5 ) license .
Several months ago , some gormless weasel from somewhere stirred up a fuss when he wrote an essay on one of the Nixer sites asking whether the Slackware distro mattered any longer .
Its not really worth googling to find the author and the site where it ran , since it seems to have created an inadvertent meme in the Linux community as advocates , fanboys and editorial writers picked up upon the concept of Slackware ' mattering . '
Misguided and myopic as the essay was , it certainly provoked a reaction .
For a number of very good reasons , the question stuck in many a craw , and triggered a defensive barrage of articles telling the clueless author just why Slack remains a vital distro and a necessary flavor option in the distro hit list , despite the fact that most other distros are moving on to DVD size releases and trying to outrace each other to be latest and greatest .
The premise of this essay is simple : the question is not whether Slackware matters , but WHY it does and WHY it will continue to do so as long as it remains in ongoing development .
I suppose the ' always ' part is a bit of hyperbole ; should a distro become defunct and all development cease , it would be as useful as a Ygdrassil install floppy in 2006 .
But perhaps not .
The question posed by that one article was not whether Slackware was useful or current or important , but whether it ' mattered ' .
So perhaps even a defunct Slackware would continue to matter , especially in light of the fact that a number of slick and solid derivative projects seem to be taking off from the Slack launchpad .
Slackware matters for many reasons .
Some quite up - to - date concerns continue to be addressed by the oldest surviving Linux distro .
Before the Linus Torvald 's bombshell expressing his disdain for the Gnome desktop environment , Slack had already jettisoned the desktop favorite .
For different reasons perhaps , but it showed the Linux fold that some distros were not afraid to dump what no longer worked well enough , rather than cave into contemporary traditions and competitive habits .
Slack can afford to do that because it is still maintained primarily by its founder and it does n't claim the huge number of users seen by Ubuntu , Suse or Fedora .
And the fact that the distro is not overly concerned about dragging more converts into its fold is another reason why it remains an important offering .
While Debian claims to be the universal operating system , the one offering the largest degree of freedoms to its users , and it 's ongoing development promises to keep the users first , one can catch many of those philosophies and promises in Slackware as well , albeit in a slightly different form .
As someone who used Debian daily , I can vouch that their manifestos and promises are being upheld .
But I find many of the same benefits running Slackware .
For the sake of a reference point , I 'll point out that I currently run Slackware 10.2 and Suse 10 on a laptop and a very dated XP ( Service Pack 1 ) and Debian Unstable on the desktop .
Between those three Linux variants , I find all I need to maneuver the GNU / Linux landscape while relying on VMWare to test stuff I do n't necessarily want to install on hard drive .
Why then , with a full blown Slack install , would I go through several nights of hairpulling frustration to get Slack also running virtually on the Window 's VMware ?
Because Slack works a cut above most as a stable , simple , fast and clean production machine , and is also the most educational , and often unforgiving distro to experiment on .
With a virtual Slack , I can hose it as often as needed while plumbing its depths and intricacies , but not lose the work I prefer to do on a Slackware production box .
With other distros racking up as many as 20,000 available apps for their package managers , Slack seems minuscule by comparison .
The number of apps that are officially supported runs to about 600 .
And yet more than one of the ' big ass ' distros out there claim to offer a one app for one job default installation .
With Slack , whether they make that claim or not , it remains more evident .
Rather than tailor their distro to run the most apps , they have designed a distro that aims at getting the job done rather than collecting more software to do the same job with different guis and developer teams .
What your basic Slackware release does n't do is hedge on the conservative side ( except perhaps in kernel matters ) , with Linux software releases .
It aims to provide the latest release that have proven themselves to work without making undue sacrifices to overall stability .
I fully expect the next release to have KDE 3.5 so long as there are no major last minute bugs in its Slack build .
You could , of course , have installed it when it came out and many have , but I 'm talking about Slackware supported here .
The term ' supported ' means a lot to Slackers .
It means it will run , and run well , and wo n't fall down and go * boom * dragging your OS with it .
You 're free to run all the ' unsupported ' software ' you want .
But when something is supported it 's virtually a product guarantee from the Slack folks that it will work .
A first time install of Slack will leave you , well , slack - jawed , if you equate stability with something like Debian Sarge 's 3.3 KDE and OpenOffice 1.4 .
Simply put , Slackware offers the best of both worlds so stability does n't always translate as extremely dated .
Things like this matter .
Slack remains a flavor with very specific strong points and all those pluses have a lot to do with the distro's overall approach .
To oversimplify , the approach can be broken down into a few subheadings that can further illustrate why such a development philosophy is so important as the distro field grows more and more competitive .
There are the standard subcategories of stability , simplicity and speed , which tend to speak for themselves .
Being developed almost single handedly by the man who invented the distro means you would be hard pressed to find someone more intimately knowledgeable about the distro in question .
The fact that its the same person who began the distro in 1992 - 3 means that the cerebral archive of Slack wisdom is more unified and holistic than ' thousand developer ' systems .
The possible drawback is in terms of size and software availability , but if you 're looking to load ten thousand apps on your box you 're not looking for Slackware .
The simplicity of design and structure tends to provide speed to even antique machines , since the idea of cruft and bloat is a non-issue .
These are standard Slack selling points and probably do n't need to be explored further .
What makes it such an important distro in the first decade of the 21st century are words like non-competitive , anti-trendy , slightly arrogant and extremely hackerish .
And I mean that in a good way .
As the battle for the desktop continues to rage , Slackware refuses to join the rumble if it means sacrificing it 's core qualities mentioned above .
It does n't follow trends to corner market shares , it simply does what works .
If Slack were trendy it would have changed its installer to a slick gui and made sure it released as regularly as the rest of the top tenners .
Distro testers and bleeding edge seekers are often frustrated by the lack of consistent release schedules .
Slackers are quite content to wait ' till it 's ready . '
The distro has gotten the rep over the past several years as being arrogant , as being as user - friendly as a coiled rattlesnake , with a user base that cuts newbs no slack at all .
But , like Debian , it never claimed to be a migration tool or a newb friendly point and click world .
The ' unofficial ' # #slackware channel on Freenode counts as one of the most knowledgeable and helpful channels I 've encountered .
Therefore it attracts users who want to increase their Unix skills and competence and explore how a system works , and who want to customize to their hearts content , preferably without relying on third and fourth party control centers .
Users who KNOW the first step in troubleshooting and learning is the man page .
If you want to learn Slack , you will be perusing Unix manuals - not Sam's 24 Hour Linux Distro guides - more often than many other distro users .
Which means the knowledge you glean while slacking tends to be applicable across a wider range of OSs .
And if going into command line to edit configuration scripts still gives you a case of nerves , the hacker in you has yet to develop the bloodlust that leads to reinstalls as you learn by trial and error what it was that hosed your system this time .
Or to realize it is often the fastest and most efficient way to configure your system without worrying about distro configuration tools overwriting your changes .
You do need to spend time on a system like Slack , to maintain the system itself and make it do your bidding .
Because it is a relatively small distro , though , you do n't need a Debian sized education to start tweaking , configuring and customizing .
Debian , in spite of its size remains a pretty bare bones distro , but simply addressing package management could lead to a series of summer intensives at a local community college .
Slack does n't even offer a dependency handler in its own brand of package management .
And that – according to official Slack documents – ' is how we like it ' .
If that 's arrogance , so be it .
Having tried Slack , I find I can at least say I 've never spent hours in dependency hell , and I 've never lost an app because a new one had issues with an old one 's libs .
Arrogance , in reality , is the wrong word , or an incorrect perception from non-slackers .
It 's more of a ' this works , and it works well and simply ... so why do I need the bells and whistles and options I never needed in the first place if I 'm willing to learn the Slack way of doing things ? ” pragmatism .
Efficient pragmatism will always matter .
I have no intention of slighting the many people out there besides Patrick Volkerding ( Slack 's Papa ) who sweat away to keep the old workhouse in tiptop shape and running smoothly .
But I think its safe to say there were times when the debugging and promoting and hacking runs were endured by ' the man ' himself and no one else .
The singularity of vision and the commitment to excellence found in the Slackware distribution come in large part from the sometimes Herculean , sometimes Sisyphean efforts of a man who devoted himself to keeping his vision of an OS alive and kicking through both personal and industry upheavals , and it's why he's one of the few personalities mentioned on a first name ( or initials ) basis alongside Linus , Larry ( of Perl fame ) , RMS and ESR .
And it 's one of things that makes Slack so streamlined , efficient and trustworthy ; so well crafted .
And craftsmanship , commitment , and quality will always matter .

Today 's post is a simple question .
Let 's say , hypothetically speaking , you met someone who told you they had two children , and one of them is a girl .
What are the odds that person has a boy and a girl ?
Consider your answer carefully , without doing a web search , or reading the comments to this post .
Do n't cheat -- but be prepared to explain your reasoning , because the solution might surprise you .
It 's almost like some kind of conspiracy or something .
Israel 's actions in Gaza are justified under international law , and Israel should be commended for its self - defense against terrorism .
Article 51 of the United Nations Charter reserves to every nation the right to engage in self - defense against armed attacks .
The only limitation international law places on a democracy is that its actions must satisfy the principle of proportionality .
Since Israel ended its occupation of Gaza , Hamas has fired thousands of rockets designed to kill civilians into southern Israel .

C ollege professors will be the first to tell you that their lives are boring .
They do n’t usually find themselves in critter - infested catacombs , duking it out with rabid Nazis or fighting supernatural beasts .
They do n’t find themselves becoming the victims of their own research , gaining superhuman powers in the process .
They especially do n’t find themselves in the arms of beautiful , cosmopolitan women .
I mean , let ’s face it : these guys make a living teaching half - conscious college kids and either reading others ’ research or producing their own .
They get more involved with spreadsheets and computer models than they do with any damsels in distress .
But would n’t we like to imagine that these intellectual giants , these defenders of the ivory tower of academia , actually get to use their brains to save the world from the bad guys every now and then ?
Sure , we would .
That ’s why we have the movies .
As a tribute to these professors we wish we had , we have put together a list of the top 10 movie college professors of all time ( Of course , Indy is at the top of the list ! ) :

GOP doubts grow over McCain 's campaign Associated Press
Published : Wednesday October 29 , 2008
Print This Email This AP - Doubts about John McCain 's chances for the presidency grew louder among fellow Republicans on Tuesday as a White House race largely focused on Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania entered its final week .
Even two Republicans once on McCain 's short list for vice president sounded skeptical .
In a fundraising e-mail on behalf of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , Mitt Romney referred to " the very real possibility of an Obama presidency . "
In the Midwest , Gov. Tim Pawlenty gave a dour assessment of McCain 's chances in his state , saying Barack Obama " has a pretty good advantage in Minnesota right now . "
Nationally , a poll by the Pew Research Center found Obama with a 16 - point lead among registered voters .
The survey said Obama had 52 percent and McCain 36 percent , with independent voters supporting the Democrat by a 48 - 31 margin .
The Nielsen media company reported that both are focusing about three - fourths of their advertising in Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Obama , who had been spending four times as much as McCain on advertising , is now airing only twice as many ads as his rival , the ratings company said .
Those three states are battlegrounds , offering a combined 68 electoral votes on Election Day .
The concentration of firepower comes even as Obama mounts a national advertising campaign that will culminate Wednesday evening with a 30 - minute , prime - time commercial on network television .
The candidates also planned appearances on cable TV talk shows , including Obama on Comedy Central 's " The Daily Show . "
The candidates kicked off their final week of campaigning in the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania , which has n't supported a Republican presidential candidate in 20 years and where Obama is ahead in the polls .
McCain is working for an upset and has Pennsylvania as the linchpin to his victory strategy .
" I 'm not afraid of the fight , I 'm ready for it , " McCain told noisy supporters at a rally in this Republican region and home of the world 's largest chocolate factory .
Obama 's advisers say they are confident of victory in the state .
Still , they sent him to rally supporters in Pittsburgh Monday night and to the battleground Philadelphia suburbs on Tuesday .
About 9,000 people stood in the mud and a steady , cold rain at Widener University to hear him .
" I just want all of you to know that if we see this kind of dedication on Election Day , there is no way that we 're not going to bring change to America , " said Obama , uncharacteristically attired in jeans , sneakers and a raincoat .
McCain canceled a second event 50 miles away in Quakertown because of the dismal weather .
McCain appeared with running mate Sarah Palin , who planned to stay in the state for rallies in Shippensburg and State College .
" Pennsylvania , it 's going to be a hard - fought contest here , " she said .
" It 's going to come down to the wire here . "
If McCain does n't win the state 's 21 electoral votes , it 's hard to see how he can win the presidency since Obama is expected to pick up several of the states that helped re-elect President Bush four years ago .
McCain needs one of the blue states to make up for expected losses in the red ones .
Both presidential candidates left Pennsylvania for rallies Tuesday evening in Republican strongholds that have become battlegrounds â McCain to North Carolina and Obama to Virginia .
McCain is increasingly playing defense in states that have been reliably Republican , with the party buying ads in Montana and expanding its advertising in West Virginia .
Early voting in some swing states also appeared to be in Obama 's favor .
In North Carolina , for example , the turnout for early voting has been nearly a third higher than in 2004 and the number of Democrats has been close to double that of Republicans .
Democratic voters in Florida have numbered about 100,000 more than Republicans , and Democrats hold an edge so far in Colorado .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist on Tuesday extended early voting hours from eight to 12 hours weekdays , and to a total of 12 hours this weekend , to help ease long lines at polling sites .
Early voting there ends Sunday .
McCain told Pennsylvania voters he 's the candidate ready to take office , after a military career and years as a prisoner of war .
He hammered Obama as a traditional liberal Democrat seeking to redistribute wealth and even willing to displace America 's favorite pastime with a 30 - minute commercial Wednesday night .
" No one will delay a World Series game with an infomercial when I 'm president , " McCain said to loud applause .
He said Obama 's promise not to raise taxes on those making less than $ 250,000 can't be trusted after his running mate , Sen .
Joe Biden , said in an interview with local television station WNEP that tax relief should only go to " middle - class people â people making under $ 150,000 a year . "
" At this rate , it wo n't be long before Sen .
Obama is right back to his vote that Americans making just $ 42,000 a year should get a tax increase , " McCain said .
" We can't let that happen .
We wo n't let that happen . "
Obama said a vote for McCain would be a vote for a third Bush term , arguing that their proposals are similar , especially on the economy .
" John McCain has ridden shotgun as George Bush has driven our economy toward a cliff , and now he wants to take the wheel and step on the gas , " Obama said .
Obama also cited a comment by McCain 's domestic policy adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , regarding McCain 's plan to offer consumers tax credits to buy health insurance .
Holtz - Eakin told CNNMoney.com that younger voters would n't abandon employer - sponsored health care plans because " what they are getting from their employer is way better than what they could get with the credit . "
Obama said the comment supported his argument that the individual market is a worse deal .
He described the remark as a " stunning bit of straight talk â an October surprisea . "
Holtz - Eakin said Obama deliberately had taken his comment out of context .
In times of economic crisis , it makes sense to fall back on time - proven investing strategies .
Gold is a standard form of investment that has proved its worth time and time again , even in unstable markets .
Historically , the price of gold has remained stable compared to other investment vehicles that tend to fluctuate more drastically .
And its value has held up even as worldwide currencies have fluctuated , due to more consistent prices and returns .
For centuries , this precious metal ’s overall beauty has been based on its varied usage , durability , and beauty .
We often hear how important it is to properly diversify our investment portfolios .
Diversification can strengthen your investments — maximizing returns while reducing risk .
Since gold is not affected by the same factors that might drive the price of GE stock down , for example , investing in this commodity can help stabilize your portfolio .
The value of this precious metal is rated high in most , if not all , markets around the world .
Gold ’s demand for use in personal electronics , dental devices , various other industries , and its potential in areas of scientific research help determine its value .
Investing in gold can be relatively easy .
However , the type of investment vehicle you choose is dependent on your tolerance for risk .
As you get into riskier types of investments , the dynamics of the venture can become more complex .
The simplest way to invest in gold is by purchasing jewelry , gold coins , gold bars , or certificates , in its physical form .
Exchange - traded funds , mutual funds , and buying stock in gold mining companies can also be ways to own gold without having to store it .
However , gold oriented funds and derivatives can be riskier due to the different factors affecting their value .
If you ’re wondering how to invest in gold , you ’re in the right place .
Below , we ’ll cover different types of gold investments and ways to invest in gold to help diversify your portfolio .
Read through for a full scope on investing in gold , or use the links below to jump to a section of your choosing .
Types of Gold You Can Invest In
There are numerous types of gold investments you can purchase to diversify your portfolio .
In fact , according to USGS.gov , because gold is used for a variety of purposes , such as jewelry and technology , it has a unique status among commodities for having a long - term store of value .
However , as with any investment , it ’s important you do your due diligence to ensure you ’re buying from a trustworthy company .
Take a look at some of the common types of gold investments you can make .
Gold Bullion
Like James
Bond ’s arch - nemesis Goldfinger , you might find there ’s no substitute for actually purchasing and owning gold .
While this can be the safest way to invest in gold , it is not without risk .
Gold bullion , also known as gold bars or gold ingots , is assessed by weight and sold by major banks and dealers .
You can also purchase bullion coins , which are minted from gold and bought by banks , brokerage firms , and coin dealers for investment purposes .
Gold bars can be purchased through a number of accredited manufacturers .
Most consumers buy gold bars that weigh between 1 gram and 10 ounces .
The typical gold bar you see in movies and TV shows , known as the Good Delivery Gold Bar , weighs 400 ounces , or 27.428 pounds , which costs around $ 500,000 .
These gold bars are typically traded by central banks and bullion dealers , not the public .
For more information , go to Gold Bars Worldwide .
Actually owning gold , either in the form of gold bars or jewelry , can be a security risk and costly , depending on the insurance and storage options you choose .
When buying pure gold , such as coins or bullion , you often have to pay a fee for your bank , broker , or firm to store it securely .
You may be better off with a gold certificate , which provides a more secure way of owning gold .
Gold certificates are sold by banks .
The certificate confirms the quantity and ownership of the gold , but the actual gold stays in the banks ’ vault .
Gold Coins
Gold coins have been issued by governments across the globe for decades .
In the United States , the U.S. Mint issues gold , silver , and platinum bullion coins , with their value based on gold , silver , or platinum bullion content .
While the price of gold coins can fluctuate based on the world market , these coins can serve as profitable investments .
Gold bullion coins can be bought directly from government authorized dealers .
The U.S. Mint provides a list of authorized bullion coin dealers through its website .
The World Gold Council states that the market value of these coins is determined by the value of their fine gold content plus a markup that varies between coins and dealers .
The U.S. Mint issues two types of bullion coins :
Proof bullion coins , which are coins that are minted and sold in a protective display case designed for collectors
Uncirculated bullion coins are minted coins made for investment purposes and sold to a select number of authorized buyers .
The price of uncirculated bullion coins is dependent on the current market price and a small premium charged by the U.S. Mint .
Investing in gold coins can be beneficial because they are often sold in smaller sizes , making them easier to purchase for a larger population of investors .
There are also many trustworthy dealers to buy from across the country .
As with any investment , it ’s important to do your research to ensure you ’re buying from a reputable dealer and not falling prey to a scam .
Gold ETFs and Mutual Funds
If you are willing to take more of a risk , you ’ll want to consider gold - oriented funds , such as exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) and mutual funds .
Gold ETFs are commodity ETFs in that they track a commodity : gold .
They can track the price of gold , funds covering the global mining industry , and more , making them a popular investment option .
Gold ETFs can also serve as a great alternative to gold bullions and coins .
A benefit of gold ETFs is that you do n’t have to hold onto physical gold and pay for insurance and storage fees .
However , purchasing a Gold ETF often comes with a commission and management fee , but these fees can be lower than managing bullion and coins .
Gold mutual funds are different from gold ETFs in that they invest in a variety of mining stocks rather than gold itself .
While mutual funds can own gold bullion and gold companies , they often include other commodities , which means it might be hard to find a mutual fund that only focuses on investing in physical gold .
A benefit of gold mutual funds is that they can be relatively cheap and diversify among multiple companies and sectors .
Investing in these types of funds is different from investing in gold bullion coins because the increase in their value depends on how well the companies perform , market expectations on the future price of gold , and the cost of mining the gold , among other factors .
Information on these types of funds can be acquired through your investment professional .
Gold Futures and Options
Futures are a type of contract where you agree to buy or sell a specified amount of an item , which , in this case , is gold , on a future date .
Also called derivatives , since the value of futures is derived from the underlying asset , which is gold , gold futures contracts can be a risky investment .
This is because investors typically only have to put down a fraction of the gold cost , such as 20 percent , which creates leverage .
These can become risky if the price of gold drops because you have a specified end date in your contract , which means you ca n’t hold onto the contract with hopes of it rebounding .
Futures contracts can come in the form of structured products such as forward contracts , gold - linked bonds , and structured notes .
Gold forward contracts are agreements to exchange gold at an agreed price at some future date .
Gold - linked bonds can be purchased through bullion dealers and investment banks .
This type of bond has a yield , principal protection , and exposure to gold price fluctuation .
Structured notes involve the purchase of put / call options , which are products designed to generate value based on the investor ’s expectation of market performance .
Gold Mining Companies
There are a variety of large gold mining companies that extract gold that can be used for technology , jewelry , trading , and more .
Purchasing stocks in gold mining companies can be a lucrative investment , depending on the company you invest in , current market conditions , and other factors .
However , it ’s important to remember that when you invest in stocks in a gold mining company , you ’re investing in the company itself , not the actual gold .
This means their stock prices can fluctuate depending on the company ’s performance , not the actual price of gold .
But , as a company , they could have the ability to expand and increase production , which could benefit your portfolio .
Taking time to research a variety of gold mining companies , or mutual funds that invest in the act of mining , can help you make an informed decision and choose a company that ’s profitable .
Gold Jewelry
Gold jewelry is the largest source of annual demand for gold , accounting for about 52 percent of total demand .
With demand for gold jewelry so high across the world , it can make for a good investment , especially if the jewelry is close to 24 karats .
However , jewelry might not always be a good investment .
This is because the initial markup can be extremely high compared to the underlying value of the gold .
So , if you ’re buying jewelry with fewer karats , let ’s say around 10 karats , selling your gold later in life might be less than your initial purpose .
However , investing in gold jewelry can be an attractive option , both literally and figuratively .
This is because you ’re able to wear the gold in the form of a necklace , ring , bracelet , or earrings .
Wrapping Up on Investing in Gold
Whether or not you decide to invest in gold and make it part of your investment portfolio should be based on your careful consideration and ability to tolerate risk .
It ’s important to keep in mind that whatever money you decide to invest , this is money that if you lose it , you will be able to live without while managing your household expenses .
Remember that investing can be a gamble .

In February 2002 , I traveled to Saudi Arabia and interviewed the then crown prince , now king , Abdullah , at his Riyadh horse farm .
I asked him why the next Arab summit would n’t just propose to Israel full peace and normalization of relations , by all 22 Arab states , for full withdrawal from all occupied lands and creation of a Palestinian state .
Abdullah said that I had read his mind ( “ Have you broken into my desk ? ” he asked me ) and that he was about to propose just that , which he later did , giving birth to the “ Abdullah peace plan . ”
Unfortunately , neither the Bush team nor Israel ever built upon the Abdullah plan .
And the Saudi leader always stopped short of presenting his ideas directly to the Israeli people .
Since then , everything has deteriorated .
So , I ’ve wondered lately what King Abdullah would propose if asked to update his plan .
I ’ve even probed whether he ’d like to do another interview , but he is apparently reticent .
Not one to be deterred , I ’ve decided to do the next best thing : read his mind again .
Here is my guess at the memo King Abdullah has in his drawer for President Obama .
I ’d call it : “ Abdullah II : The Five - State Solution for Arab - Israeli peace . ”
Dear President Obama ,
Congratulations on your inauguration and for quickly dispatching your new envoy , George Mitchell , a good man , to the Middle East .
I wish Mitchell could resume where he left off eight years ago , but the death of Arafat , the decline of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank , the 2006 Hezbollah - Israel war in Lebanon , the 2009 Hamas - Israel war in Gaza , the continued expansion of colonial Israeli settlements and the deepening involvement of Iran with Hamas and Hezbollah have all created a new reality .
What ’s the future of scientific peer review ?
The way science is communicated is currently changing rapidly , leading to speculation that the peer review system itself might change .
For example , the wildly successful physics preprint arXiv is only very lightly moderated , which has led many people to wonder if the peer review process might perhaps die out , or otherwise change beyond recognition .
I ’m currently finishing up a post on the future of peer review , which I ’ll post in the near future .
Before I get to that , though , I want to debunk three widely - believed myths about peer review , myths which can derail sensible discussion of the future of peer review .
A brief terminological note before I get to the myths : the term “ peer review ” can mean many different things in science .
In this post , I restrict my focus to the anonymous peer review system scientific journals use to decide whether to accept or reject scientific papers .
Myth number 1 : Scientists have always used peer review
The myth that scientists adopted peer review broadly and early in the history of science is surprisingly widely believed , despite being false .
It ’s true that peer review has been used for a long time – a process recognizably similar to the modern system was in use as early as 1731 , in the Royal Society of Edinburgh ’s Medical Essays and Observations ( ref ) .
But in most scientific journals , peer review was n’t routine until the middle of the twentieth century , a fact documented in historical papers by Burnham , Kronick , and Spier .
Let me give a few examples to illustrate the point .
As a first example , we ’ll start with the career of Albert Einstein , who was n’t just an outstanding scientist , but was also a prolific scientist , publishing more than 300 journal articles between 1901 and 1955 .
Many of Einstein ’s most ground - breaking papers appeared in his “ miracle year ” of 1905 , when he introduced new ways of understanding space , time , energy , momentum , light , and the structure of matter .
Not bad for someone unable to secure an academic position , and working as a patent clerk in the Swiss patent office .
How many of Einstein ’s 300 plus papers were peer reviewed ?
According to the physicist and historian of science Daniel Kennefick , it may well be that only a single paper of Einstein ’s was ever subject to peer review .
That was a paper about gravitational waves , jointly authored with Nathan Rosen , and submitted to the journal Physical Review in 1936 .
The Physical Review had at that time recently introduced a peer review system .
It was n’t always used , but when the editor wanted a second opinion on a submission , he would send it out for review .
The Einstein - Rosen paper was sent out for review , and came back with a ( correct , as it turned out ) negative report .
Einstein ’s indignant reply to the editor is amusing to modern scientific sensibilities , and suggests someone quite unfamiliar with peer review :
Dear Sir , We ( Mr. Rosen and I ) had sent you our manuscript for publication and had not authorized you to show it to specialists before it is printed .
I see no reason to address the in any case erroneous comments of your anonymous expert .
On the basis of this incident I prefer to publish the paper elsewhere .
Respectfully , P.S. Mr. Rosen , who has left for the Soviet Union , has authorized me to represent him in this matter .
As a second example , consider the use of peer review at the journal Nature .
The prestige associated with publishing in Nature is , of course , considerable , and so competition to get published there is tough .
According to Nature ’s website , only 8 percent of submissions are accepted , and the rest are rejected .
Given this , you might suppose that Nature has routinely used peer review for a long time as a way of filtering submissions .
In fact , a formal peer review system was n’t introduced by Nature until 1967 .
Prior to that , some papers were refereed , but some were n’t , and many of Nature ’s most famous papers were not refereed .
Instead , it was up to editorial judgement to determine which papers should be published , and which papers should be rejected .
This was a common practice in the days before peer review became widespread : decisions about what to publish and what to reject were usually made by journal editors , often acting largely on their own .
These decisions were often made rapidly , with papers appearing days or weeks after submission , after a cursory review by the editor .
Rejection rates at most journals were low , with only obviously inappropriate or unsound material being rejected ; indeed , for some Society journals , Society members even asserted a “ right ” to publication , which occasionally caused friction with unhappy editors ( ref ) .
What caused the change to the modern system of near - ubiquitous peer review ?
There were three main factors .
The first was the increasing specialization of science ( ref ) .
As science became more specialized in the early 20th century , editors gradually found it harder to make informed decisions about what was worth publishing , even by the relatively relaxed standards common in many journals at the time .
The second factor in the move to peer review was the enormous increase in the number of scientific papers being published ( ref ) .
In the 1800s and early 1900s , journals often had too few submissions .
Journal editors would actively round up submissions to make sure their journals remained active .
The role of many editorial boards was to make sure enough papers were being submitted ; if the journal came up short , members of the editorial board would be asked to submit papers themselves .
As late as 1938 , the editor - in - chief of the prestigious journal Science relied on personal solicitations for most articles ( ref ) .
The twentieth century saw a massive increase in the number of scientists , a much easier process for writing papers , due to technologies such as typewriters , photocopiers , and computers , and a gradually increasing emphasis on publication in decisions about jobs , tenure , grants and prizes .
These factors greatly increased the number of papers being written , and added pressure for filtering mechanisms , such as peer review .
The third factor in the move to peer review ( ref ) was the introduction of technologies for copying papers .
It ’s just plain editorially difficult to implement peer review if you can’t easily make copies of papers .
The first step along this road was the introduction of typewriters and carbon paper in the 1890s , followed by the commercial introduction of photocopiers in 1959 .
Both technologies made peer review much easier to implement .
Nowadays , of course , the single biggest factor preserving the peer review system is probably social inertia : in most fields of science , a journal that ’s not peer - reviewed is n’t regarded as serious , and so new journals invariably promote the fact that they are peer reviewed .
But it was n’t always that way .
Myth number 2 : peer review is reliable
Update : Bill Hooker has pointed out that I ’m using a very strong sense of “ reliable ” in this section , holding peer review to the standard that it nearly always picks up errors , is a very accurate gauge of quality , and rarely suppresses innovation .
If you adopt a more relaxed notion of reliability , as many but not all scientists and members of the general public do , then I ’d certainly back off describing this as a myth .
As an approximate filter that eliminates or improves many papers , peer review may indeed function well .
Every scientist has a story ( or ten ) about how they were poorly treated by peer review – the important paper that was unfairly rejected , or the silly editor who ignored their sage advice as a referee .
Despite this , many strongly presume that the system works “ pretty well ” , overall .
There ’s not much systematic evidence for that presumption .
In 2002 Jefferson et al ( ref ) surveyed published studies of biomedical peer review .
After an extensive search , they found just 19 studies which made some attempt to eliminate obvious confounding factors .
Of those , just two addressed the impact of peer review on quality , and just one addressed the impact of peer review on validity ; most of the rest of the studies were concerned with questions like the effect of double - blind reviewing .
Furthermore , for the three studies that addressed quality and validity , Jefferson et al concluded that there were other problems with the studies which meant the results were of limited general interest ; as they put it , “ Editorial peer review , although widely used , is largely untested and its effects are uncertain ” .
In short , at least in biomedicine , there ’s not much we know for sure about the reliability of peer review .
My searches of the literature suggest that we know do n’t much more in other areas of science .
If anything , biomedicine seems to be unusually well served , in large part because several biomedical journals ( perhaps most notably the Journal of the American Medical Association ) have over the last 20 years put a lot of effort into building a community of people studying the effects of peer review ; Jefferson et al ‘s study is one of the outcomes from that effort .
In the absence of compelling systematic studies , is there anything we can say about the reliability of peer review ?
The question of reliability should , in my opinion , really be broken up into three questions .
First , does peer review help verify the validity of scientific studies ; second , does peer review help us filter scientific studies , making the higher quality ones easier to find , because they get into the “ best ” journals , i.e. , the ones with the most stringent peer review ; third , to what extent does peer review suppress innovation ?
As regards validity and quality , you do n’t have to look far to find striking examples suggesting that peer review is at best partially reliable as a check of validity and a filter of quality .
Consider the story of the German physicist Jan Hendrik Schoen .
In 2000 and 2001 Schoen made an amazing series of breakthroughs in organic superconductivity , publishing his 2001 work at a rate of one paper every 8 days , many in prestigious journals such as Nature , Science , and the Physical Review .
Eventually , it all seemed a bit too good to be true , and other researchers in his community began to ask questions .
His work was investigated , and much of it found to be fraudulent .
Nature retracted seven papers by Schoen ; Science retracted eight papers ; and the Physical Review retracted six .
What ’s truly breathtaking about this case is the scale of it : it ’s not that a few referees failed to pick up on the fraud , but rather that the refereeing system at several of the top journals systematically failed to detect the fraud .
Furthermore , what ultimately brought Schoen down was not the anonymous peer review system used by journals , but rather investigation by his broader community of peers .
You might object to using this as an example on the grounds that the Schoen case involved deliberate scientific fraud , and the refereeing system is n’t intended to catch fraud so much as it is to catch mistakes .
I think that ’s a pretty weak objection – it can be a thin line between honest mistakes and deliberate fraud – but it ’s not entirely without merit .
As a second example , consider an experiment conducted by the editors of the British Medical Journal ( ref ) .
They inserted eight deliberate errors into a paper already accepted for publication , and sent the paper to 420 potential reviewers .
221 responded , catching on average only two of the errors .
None of the reviewers caught more than five of the errors , and 16 percent no errors at all .
None of these examples is conclusive .
But they do suggest that the refereeing system is far from perfect as a means of checking validity or filtering the quality of scientific papers .
What about the suppression of innovation ?
Every scientist knows of major discoveries that ran into trouble with peer review .
David Horrobin has a remarkable paper ( ref ) where he documents some of the discoveries almost suppressed by peer review ; as he points out , he ca n’t list the discoveries that were in fact suppressed by peer review , because we do n’t know what those were .
His list makes horrifying reading .
Here ’s just a few instances that I find striking , drawn in part from his list .
Note that I ’m restricting myself to suppression of papers by peer review ; I believe peer review of grants and job applications probably has a much greater effect in suppressing innovation .
George Zweig ’s paper announcing the discovery of quarks , one of the fundamental building blocks of matter , was rejected by Physical Review Letters .
It was eventually issued as a CERN report .
Berson and Yalow ’s work on radioimmunoassay , which led to a Nobel Prize , was rejected by both Science and the Journal of Clinical Investigation .
It was eventually published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation .
Krebs ’ work on the citric acid cycle , which led to a Nobel Prize , was rejected by Nature .
It was published in Experientia .
Wiesner ’s paper introducing quantum cryptography was initially rejected , finally appearing well over a decade after it was written .
To sum up : there is very little reliable evidence about the effect of peer review available from systematic studies ; peer review is at best an imperfect filter for validity and quality ; and peer review sometimes has a chilling effect , suppressing important scientific discoveries .
At this point I expect most readers will have concluded that I do n’t much like the current peer review system .
Actually , that ’s not true , a point that will become evident in my post about the future of peer review .
There ’s a great deal that ’s good about the current peer review system , and that ’s worth preserving .
However , I do believe that many people , both scientists and non-scientists , have a falsely exalted view of how well the current peer review system functions .
What I ’m trying to do in this post is to establish a more realistic view , and that means understanding some of the faults of the current system .
Myth :
Peer review is the way we determine what ’s right and wrong in science
By now , it should be clear that the peer review system must play only a partial role in determing what scientists think of as established science .
There ’s no sign , for example , that the lack of peer review in the 19th and early 20th century meant that scientists then were more confused than now about what results should be regarded as well established , and what should not .
Nor does it appear that the unreliability of the peer review process leaves us in any great danger of collectively coming to believe , over the long run , things that are false .
In practice , of course , nearly all scientists understand that peer review is only part of a much more complex process by which we evaluate and refine scientific knowledge , gradually coming to ( provisionally ) accept some findings as well established , and discarding the rest .
So , in that sense , this third myth is n’t one that ’s widely believed within the scientific community .
But in many scientists ’ shorthand accounts of how science progresses , peer review is given a falsely exaggerated role , and this is reflected in the understanding many people in the general public have of how science works .
Many times
I ’ve had non-scientists mention to me that a paper has been “ peer - reviewed ! ” , as though that somehow establishes that it is correct , or high quality .
I ’ve encountered this , for example , in some very good journalists , and it ’s a concern , for peer review is only a small part of a much more complex and much more reliable system by which we determine what scientific discoveries are worth taking further , and what should be discarded .

Rep .
Kucinch and all of his impeachment resolution co-sponsors have been strangely silent on impeachment since they were all re-elected with the campaign donations of the impeachment / accountability movement .
Even Rep .
Wexler who had a very public pro impeachment image has said little .
Did the seriousness of the Bush and Cheney crimes diminish ?
Why are they so silent ?
Since the Democrats now have control of everything , the excuses of House Democrats no longer have any credibility .
It is time to act .
If the Illinois House Members can Impeach Gov. Blogojevich in just 90 Minutes of debate , The Democratic Members of the US House can at least " start " the impeachment process now , prior to January 20th To Prevent Bush from pardoning them .
You do n't have to necessarily fininsh the impeachment process before January 20th , just get the resolutions on record ( listing all possible major witnesses ) and in open debate in the Judiciary Committee .
That should counter Bush 's pardons .*
CALL Rep .
Kucinich and all of his co-sponsors and ask each of them to file a flood of their own single article impeachment resolutions before January 20th .
You can reach them through the US House operator at 202-224-3121 or 800-828-0498

Amazing solar - powered fridge invented by British student in a potting shed helps poverty - stricken Africans
It 's the kind of simple yet brilliant invention that would have the tycoons of Dragons '
Den salivating with excitement .
Not only is the fridge solar powered , it can also be built from household materials - making it ideal for the Third World .
Emily Cummins , 21 , came up with the idea while working on a school project in her grandfather 's potting shed .
The fridge is now improving the lives of thousands of poverty - stricken Africans .
Emily Cummins holds the portable eco-fridge .
It can keep perishable goods , such as milk or meat , cool for days at a temperature of around 6C
And Miss Cummins hopes to patent a more sophisticated portable model for use in transporting medical supplies around hot countries .
From the age of four , when she was given a hammer as a gift , Miss Cummins has spent much of her spare time making things out of ordinary materials .
She has won awards for a toothpaste squeezer for arthritis sufferers and for a water - carrying device , again for Third World use .
Emily with her grandfather Peter Harrison , 78 , in his potting shed where she created the fridge
Her ' sustainable ' fridge works through evaporation and can be used to keep perishable goods such as milk and meat cool for days .
Without using any power , temperatures stay at around 6 c .
The fridge comprises two cylinders - one inside the other .
The inner cylinder is made from metal but the outer cylinder can be made from anything to hand , including wood and plastic .
Miss Cummins , from Keighley , West Yorkshire , said : ' A fridge is something that people can't seem to live without .
' I wanted to keep it really simple and so I set about researching how we cooled things years ago .
The simplest method of cooling something could be seen when you look at how we cool biologically - through sweating or evaporation .
' That idea led me to the design and the fridge was born . '
After her A - levels she spent five months of her gap year in Africa , perfecting and demonstrating her product .
In Namibia she became known as ' The Fridge Lady ' .
Miss Cummins returned to the UK to start a business management course at Leeds University .
She had been refused a place on an engineering course because , to her dismay , she did n't have the correct qualifications .
Last year she met the Queen at Buckingham Palace after being invited to a prestigious women in business event .
The basic pattern of the Stimulus Depression continues : the more the government tries to stimulate it , the more depressed the economy gets .
According to the latest report in the New York Times , after hundreds of billions of dollars in spending , the stimulus is not working .
The banks who were supposed to be saved by the first round of bailouts are actually in worse shape and need more federal cash .
The Times notes that the source of the problem is that " Private investors are scarce .
For all but a small group of healthy banks , bankers and analysts say , the government may be the only investor left . "
But the obvious question is : why are private investors scarce ?
Maybe it has something to do with the terms of the " stimulus " aimed at them .
The Times story contains only one hint at this :
Mr. Obama 's economic team is planning a broad overhaul of the program to impose more accountability and more restrictions on executives at companies that receive government money .
" More accountability " means more government management of the banks ; more restrictions means more measures designed to reduce the profitability of the banking industry and drive out the best talent .
For an example of what all of this " accountability " means , consider the Wall Street Journal 's overview of the government 's treatment of the healthiest of the big nationwide banks , Bank of America .
" Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis earned kudos last year for stepping into the breach when the mortgage market and Wall Street cratered .
BofA 's purchase of Countrywide Financial and its September agreement to buy Merrill Lynch offered a welcome dose of optimism and private capital amid the panic .
In December , Mr. Lewis realized that he had been too optimistic … .
After BofA shareholders approved the Merrill purchase on December 5 , Mr. Lewis saw Merrill 's assets plunge in value and began to explore a way out .
At least he wanted a better price ….
Mr. Lewis 's effort to protect his common shareholders was vetoed by his most important shareholder , the feds .
In October the US Treasury had insisted on investing $ 15 billion in his bank .
Come December , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told him that Merrill had to be saved , and that BofA had to be the savior ….
In other words , the feds believe that the way to calm financial markets is to force the nation 's largest , and a heretofore healthy , bank to swallow toxic assets it did n't want . "
But here 's the really awful part : the Treasury 's forced investments in Bank of America are held in the form of preferred shares paying an 8 % dividend .
Yet the bailout agreement forced on the bank " limits quarterly common stock dividends to a penny a share . "
Oh yes , and Bank of America " will also have to accept new executive compensation limits .
And the bank will need to submit for government approval a plan to modify troubled mortgages . "
The Journal 's commentary concludes : " Mr. Lewis does n't seem thrilled that the government has a larger piece of his business .
When asked yesterday when the bank might escape federal ownership , he replied , ' I wish I knew , ' and then added , ' clearly as soon as possible . ' "
Similarly , Bloomberg 's David Pauly describes the incoming administration 's attempt to suppress the stock dividends paid by banks , a measure which effectively eliminates the " last reason to own bank shares . "
" Banks have traditionally paid hefty dividends .
In the years before the onset of the subprime mortgage crisis , payouts by Bank of America Corp. , for instance , yielded about 3 percent to 4 percent of the company 's stock price and grew steadily .
Now President - elect Barack Obama plans to take away even that attraction , Lawrence Summers , who will head the new administration 's National Economic Council , informed Congress this week .
Obama …will order the Treasury Department to limit dividends paid by commercial banks and investment banks that receive " exceptional assistance " from the government to " de minimis amounts . "
While investors have known that current yields were ballooned by falling share prices and that massive bank losses made some payouts unsustainable , many may have bet that relatively stronger banks would still maintain nice returns … .
Now , what dividends , if any , banks can pay may depend on how extraordinary " exceptional " may be interpreted and how trifling " de minimis " may turn out to be … .
It seems likely that dividends of all the major bank recipients of Washington rescue money will be restricted . "
Again , while private investors may be out of luck , the government will still get its dividend : " Obama 's Treasury may want to assure the banks have enough money to pay the dividends they owe US taxpayers .
The preferred shares in financial institutions that the government bought in the rescue effort pay 5 percent dividends for the first five years , 9 percent after that . "
All of this reminds me of a minor subplot from the 1990 film Goodfellas .
The movie is interesting as a relatively un -glamorized portrait of the life of mobsters — though that wo n't necessarily make for a fun evening 's viewing .
The subplot involves the hapless owner of an Italian restaurant that becomes a favorite hangout for the mobsters .
When they become a bit too rowdy , the owner goes to the godfather and asks him , in the politest possible way , if he can tell his men to keep it down and stop scaring off the regular customers .
The godfather immediately demands a part - ownership in the restaurant — and it is clear that this is an offer the owner can't refuse .
What follows is a series of scenes in which the mobsters feel free to show up at the restaurant and steal cases of beer from its coolers , for example , or walk out after a large meal without paying the bill .
After all , they 're business partners , are n't they ?
Eventually , having bled the restaurant dry through this kind of petty theft , they set fire to the place in order to collect the insurance money .
That 's how the banks must be feeling right now about their own unwanted " business partner , " the federal government .
Having been coerced into accepting bailout money from the Treasury , they now find that their new partner is draining away every last bit of wealth that used to belong to the bank 's real owners , its private shareholders .
No wonder that the LA Times reports that " An index of 24 major bank stocks has fallen every month since September and dived 29 % just since year - end , to a 13 - year low Friday . "
Much more of this mob-style " stimulus , " and private shareholders will have been driven completely out of the financial industry — which will then be taken over by the goodfellas at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve .
Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis gave former Merrill chief John
Thain an unceremonious heave - ho earlier today , a mere month after the Merrill deal closed , after one too many nasty surprises : the deterioration of Merrill in the fourth quarter , the revelation that Merrill effectively stiffed BofA by paying bonuses early , thus depriving the bank of the opportunity to review the payments and ascertain whether they were appropriate .
The Wall Street Journal gives a tidy synopsis :
Bank of America had lost confidence in Mr. Thain….after Mr. Lewis learned of mounting fourth - quarter losses at Merrill from the transition team handling the Bank of America - Merrill merger rather than from Mr. Thain himself .
And when Mr. Lewis asked Mr. Thain what happened , the Bank of America CEO did not get a “ good explanation for what was happening and why , ” this person said … .
The Bank of America CEO also concluded Mr. Thain has exercised “ poor judgment ” on a number of fronts .
He left for a vacation in Vail , Colo. , after the losses came to light , bonus payments at Merrill were accelerated so they could be collected before the end of the year and Mr. Thain had planned to fly this week to Davos , Switzerland , even though Bank of America had signaled that such a trip was not a good idea , this person said .
And CNBC ( with a slideshow ) had a bit of fun chronicling some of Thain ’s spending as Merrill CEO :
When John Thain became Merrill Lynch ’s CEO in early 2008 , he hired Michael S. Smith Design to revamp his office suite , spending approximately $ 1.22 million according to documents … .
The following is a list of the items in his suite : Area Rug $ 87,784
Mahogany Pedestal Table $ 25,713
19th Century Credenza $ 68,179
Pendant Light Furniture $ 19,751
4 Pairs of Curtains $ 28,091
Pair of Guest Chairs $ 87,784
George IV Chair $ 18,468
6 Wall Sconces $ 2,741
Parchment Waste Can $ 1,405
Roman Shade Fabric $ 10,967
Roman Shades $ 7,315
Coffee Table $ 5,852
Commode on Legs $ 35,115 … .
Thain also paid his driver $ 230,000 for one years work , which included the driver ’s $ 85,000 salary and bonus of $ 18,000 , and another $ 128,000 in over - time pay , documents show .
Drivers of top executives are often paid about half that amount .
Adding a bit of gas to this fire , New York State Attorney General is reported to be investigating the early payment of Merrill bonuses .
In the larger context , what does this mean ?
It was reasonable to guess that Thain would not have survived long even without pulling a few fast ones on his pending employer .
Bank of America still has a traditional banking culture , and that has not done well with higher pay , more flexibly run acquistions ( for instance , BofA lost many wealth managers and important clients when it acquired private bank US Trust , and private banking is not a terribly free - wheeling business ) .
That is n’t to defend
Thain , merely to point out that even under less questionable circumstances , he might not have lasted very long .
But is this move a sign of a sea change in attitudes towards CEO and senior level prerogatives ?
Sadly , I doubt it .
Yes , the worst excesses may be reined in , but so much unjustifiable behavior came to be seen as acceptable by boards ( with compensation consultants providing a paper trail to boot ) that it will take a long time to effect more fundamental change .
Did anyone object to Sandy Weill putting working fireplaces into his offices ( a vastly greater expense than Thain ’s decorating ? )
Did GE shareholders know of all of Jack Welch ’s perks until they came out in his divorce ?
But the noise about Thain ’s compensation is probably less important than how it unintentionally serves to divert attention from the real issue .
Many ( all ? ) of the big players in the financial sector are insolvent , period .
Their credit losses ( whether marked to market or a realistic cash flow basis ) are bigger than their net worth .
These firms are therefore wards of the state .
Yet we keep pretending that they are still private concerns , still keep the managements in place that created the mess , still allow them to pay themselves orders of magnitude more than average workers .
As we have discussed , this is looting and the looting continues .
Why , for instance , has no one raised the issue of accounting fraud ?
Lehman ’s financial statements gave no hint that it had a over $ 100 billion hole in its balance sheet .
Yet no one seems interested in pursuing the fraud line of thinking ( save some unhapy shareholders ) and one wonders whether Lehman was alone .
Financial firms took on massive leverage and with it , huge risk , to boost profits and the pay of staff and senior officers .
Even the financial press was reporting that credit spreads were far too narrow ( ie , those taking risk were not getting enough income in relationship to the likelihood of losses ) .
But those in the best position to understand those risks kept piling them on , because it was a “ heads I win , tails you lose ” bet .
And Thain got kudos for selling Merrill to BofA at what turns out to have been an inflated price .
The fact that this characterization is widely accepted says the public has been played for fools .
Merrll ’s shareholders should have been wiped out , and its bondholders should have taken a hit .
Instead ,
Thain transferred Merrill dud assets to the public and was ( until today ) applauded .
ABC Cancels Pushing Daisies , Eli Stone , Dirty Sexy Money
ABC announced on Thursday night that Pushing Daisies , Eli Stone and Dirty Sexy Money have all been canceled .
The news came for Daisies starshortly before she was to appear at the premiere of her new movie Four Christmases .
Chenoweth was told that all 13 of this years episodes would air , with the final episode leaving views up in the air with a cliffhanger finish .
The show , in it 's second season , is bitter sweet for the actress .
She received an Emmy nomination for her role as Olive Snook .
When reporters caught up with her last night she said , " I just found out an hour ago .
Pushing Daisies will probably forever be one of the happiest times of my career .
I loved being a part of that show , such quality , and I 'm very sad . "
Lead male actors include Lee Pace in Pushing Daisies , Jonny Lee Miller in Eli Stone and Peter Krause in Dirty Sexy Money .

Fans of the grotesquely overpaid Jonathan Ross – apparently he has them – have expressed fears this week that when he returns to the airwaves in the new year he will have lost his " edge " .
This is because he has been told not to make gratuitously obscene remarks , and to swear less .
I think the BBC should go the whole hog and make him present the Daily Service in order to earn his money .
I still can't understand why it is regarded as side - splittingly hilarious for somebody to ask an interviewee about his or bodily functions or sexual practices , or to utter the words ---- and ---- a lot .
But perhaps it is proof of Ross 's genius that he convinced his paymasters that it was .
Seven children from Toura al - Gharbeiah village ( near the West Bank city of Jenin ) were arrested on Tuesday by the Israeli authorities ; they are currently detained in Salim detention and interrogation center , in the northern West Bank .
Two of the children are only 12 years old ; two are 13 ; another two are aged 15 ; and the seventh is 17 .
A Defense for Children International ( DCI ) - Palestine lawyer yesterday visited the children .
According to information collected by the lawyer , between midnight and 4:00 am on Tuesday 20 January , the Israeli intelligence , police and army entered Toura al - Gharbeiah village and arrested the seven children from their respective homes .
The children were then assembled in a public building in the village , and interrogated there .
They were alleged to have thrown stones at the Wall and were intimidated into confessing .
The eldest , Murad ( 17 ) , was accused of possessing weapons , but he denied the allegation .
Murad told the DCI - Palestine lawyer what happened on Tuesday morning .
Shortly after midnight , Murad was watching television at home when he heard noise outside .
He got up to look through the window and saw four jeeps belonging to the Israeli police guards .
Less than a minute later , someone knocked and Murad opened the door .
An Israeli police officer , accompanied by two soldiers , asked Murad his name and told him “ Do not try to escape , the house is surrounded . ”
He asked him to wake up other family members .
After the rest of the family was up , the soldiers took Murad outside , laid him on the ground , tied his hands behind his back with plastic cords , and blindfolded him .
Murad lay on the ground for half an hour while the soldiers searched the house .
Then , they walked him to the military jeep .
While they were walking , a soldier started beating him on the face and hands .
Murad reported that one of his fingers started to swell as a result of the beating .
They shoved him into the jeep , and drove for 20 minutes .
Then Murad was taken out of the jeep and brought to a billiards room .
He was still in the village .
His blindfold was removed and an interrogator told him that they had found weapons in his house .
He pressured Murad to confess to owning them ; all the while screaming at him and threatening him .
The interrogation went on for 40 minutes .
Murad did not confess .
When the interrogation was over , Murad was blindfolded again , and left in the room until 9:00 am . …
During that time , he heard the voices of other young detainees , including his brother Bashir ( 15 ) .
Some of the children were crying .
At 9:00 am Murad was transferred to Salim detention and interrogation center .
During the journey , a soldier was shouting at him and insulting him ; he felt very scared .
After being interrogated in the billiards room in the village , the children were transferred to Salim detention and interrogation centre , near Jenin .
When the DCI - Palestine lawyer met them on Wednesday , 21 January , the children had already confessed , under duress , to throwing stones at the Wall .
Murad had still not confessed .
DCI - Palestine and their partners Addameer believe that such young children are particularly vulnerable to abuse in the Israeli military justice system and should be released immediately , all the more so , in light of the trivial nature of the alleged offense .
The children ’s lawyer has requested a hearing today , Thursday 22 January , in order to ask the military judge for the release of the young children .
The children are : Morad Q. ( 17 ) , Bashir Q. ( 15 ) , Osaid Q. ( 12 ) , Subhi A. H. ( 12 ) , Amer Q. ( 13 ) , Mohammad A. ( 13 ) and Emad A. ( 15 ) .
At the end of December 2008 , there were 342 Palestinian children held in Israeli prisons and detention / interrogation centers , including seven girls , and five administrative detainees .
The December 2008 figures reveal the highest reported numbers of child detainees in 2008 .
In addition , on 17 January , DCI - Palestine issued a statement expressing concern that numbers of children arrested by the Israeli authorities in the West Bank has doubled in the first two weeks of January .

Now that the official Amazon Mobile iPhone app is here , it 's easier than ever to check prices from anywhere , even while shopping in retail stores .
And the company 's clever new " Amazon Remembers " service will use humans to identify product pics snapped with the iPhone , even if they include shoes worn by the person sitting next to you on the subway .
Both are Good Things , but can too much of a Good Thing turn a little sour on the tongue ?
Do n't even try to hide it
I confess there have been occasions when I went to a retail store , learned about and handled products , then went home and ordered them less expensively over the Internet .
After getting a laptop and an EVDO card , the practice went at time a bit further ; I would retreat to the parking lot , check online deals , and make a buying decision there in the front seat of the car .
But actually scanning the Internet for lower prices while standing in the store ?
The practice might feel a bit like being caught reading a dirty novel in the back of the library stacks ( " Can I help you with anything ? "
" Uh , no , just looking , thanks !
Please go away ! " ) but Amazon wants to make it mainstream .
In the official App Store description of its new iPhone app , the company suggests it can be used for " comparing prices on Amazon and 9,000 other merchants to those in the retail store you are visiting . "
It 's certainly a consumer - friendly idea , though one wonders if it will cause that throbbing vein on the necks of Best Buy and Borders execs to throb a bit more quickly .
For Amazon to explicitly suggest that shoppers take advantage of bricks - and - mortar stores — an expensive investment that Amazon has purposely not made — and then use the benefit derived from those stores to order the product cheaply online , well , that 's a pretty straightforward declaration of war .
Retailers certainly can't be pleased with idea of all those 1 - click iPhone orders going to Amazon even as customers stand in their stores , fondling their merchandise .
Not antagonizing your customers is the first rule of business , but it 's not real hard to imagine some stores approaching heads - down iPhone users with a crisp , " May I help you , ma'am ? "
Amazon Remembers , so snap away !
Once , while rumbling through the darkened tunnels of the Prague Metro , the train pulled up to a station stop , the doors opened , and a man with a monkey on his shoulder stepped inside .
It does n't look so odd when written down in print like that , so let me say it again : he had a live monkey .
On his shoulder .
On the Prague Metro .
I did what anyone would do — waited until he turned away ( the monkey continued to level its creepy simian gaze at me ) and snapped a surreptitious photo .
I mean , the dude had a monkey !
On his shoulder !
On the Metro !
I bring this up only to point out that snapping pictures without permission of people at close range in public places is generally something of a taboo ; at the least , it can be shockingly impolite .
( Though when you have a monkey ! on your shoulder ! on the Metro !
I 'd say you 're fair game . )
Which is why Amazon 's new " Amazon Remembers " feature sounds potentially unsettling .
So many chances for shopping
Amazon Remembers uses the iPhone camera to snap images , which are uploaded to the cloud and farmed out to humans for identification with Amazon products .
Cool enough when the product is a book cover , of course , but what if it's an article of clothing currently worn by someone sitting next to you on the subway ?
We are treading in the deep waters of etiquette here .
Amazon has no problem with the practice , though .
In its official App Store description , the company suggests that people start snapping away in public .
" Seeing if Amazon Remembers can find a pair of shoes for sale like the one the person sitting next to you is wearing , " it offers .
Perhaps
I 'm betraying my own sense of personal space here , but I would not feel pleased to see people holding out their iPhones to photograph the label on my jeans , the brand of my shoes , or the cut of my scarf when I 'm riding the El from Oak Park to the Loop .
Pirates of the Amazon
Oddly enough , this week also saw the release of some software that does the same thing to Amazon that Amazon encourages iPhone users to do to other retailers .
" Pirates of the Amazon " is a Firefox extension that compares Amazon products with items available on The Pirate Bay ; when it finds a match , the add - on creates a " download 4 free " button directly on the Amazon product page .
Clicking it retrieves the file using BitTorrent .
It 's not the same thing , of course , being utterly illegal , immoral , and generally piratical ( which is sort of the point ) .
It 's also not currently available , with the site displaying a " The Ship was hit .
We 're offline " message at the moment .
Personally , if I had to draw behavioral lines around various practices , I would n't be a " Pirate of the Amazon , " but I would use the Amazon iPhone app to price check stores — and I 'd return to the parking lot to do it .
Why ?
For the same reason I would n't tell my dinner hosts that their instant mashed potatoes reminded me of caulk in a bowl , though I might make the observation to my wife in the car on the way home .
As for Amazon Remembers , snapping standalone objects is fine and useful , but taking pics of someone 's shoes , laptop case , watch , hat , or gloves in public feels a bit too much like being a paparazzi .
If someone sitting beside me in a coffee shop started snapping iPhone pictures of my jeans , I can't imagine liking it a whole lot , but neither can I really imagine people walking up to strangers all over the country and asking , " Hey , do you mind if I take this picture of your pants with my phone ? " and getting a positive result .
There are no black and white lines here , though , just shades of grey ; how would you handle these issues ?

1 ) It is a complete wast of time to become upset when I refuse to shake your hand after you exit the arcade .
You just had anonymous sex with a man , woman , tranny , or you just got finished masturbating .
Had you grabbed the key to the restroom and washed your hands I might just have considered it , otherwise I have no interest in touching you .
You really have no reason to be offended at this one , just think about it for a moment .
2 ) I 'm sorry if you have only limited time to have gay sex with a stranger during your lunch break .
If the only customers I have in the arcade are so old you are wondering how they remain upright , much less get it up , I simply can't waive a magic wand and fill the arcade with an all gay swim team .
It really does n't matter how horny you are , complaining incessantly about it changes nothing .
Along that same line , I am not a resident fall back option and I 'm sorry , but offering me cash for sex will not change my mind on this one ( ever ) .
3 ) We offer the options of entering a booth with a window , a glory hole , or a private booth .
If you enter a booth with a window , please do n't be surprised if you look up and find someone watching you , coming to the counter and demanding that I throw whomever out because they were peeking at your willy will honestly accomplish little .
If you enter a booth with a gloryhole , please do n't be surprised if at some point a penis comes through it .
Also do n't be surprised if a voice comes through it asking for you to stick your penis through the hole , it 's what it 's there for .
These traumatic events can all be avoided by entering a private booth where you can masturbate to your hearts content in relative privacy .
4 ) You enter a booth , insert a 1 , 5 , 10 , or 20 dollar bill into the bill acceptor , and have a seat .
The movie will play until the time limit for the amount of money you put into the machine runs out .
If at that time you have not managed to relieve yourself you have still received what you paid for .
Screaming at me will not get you more time in the arcade , it will just get you thrown the fuck out .
Sitting in a booth with no money in the machine while you desperately try to grunt out a quick one is just not acceptable .
If I knock on the door offering to get you change and you come out all grumpy saying something like " I just spent 7000 dollars here " or " do you know how much I spend here in a month " we now have a problem .
You see , the concept really is simple yet I feel the need to break it down for you .
If I go to McDonalds , order a cheese burger and eat it , I would not be allowed to sit there and eat unlimited cheese burgers all fucking day because I paid for the first one .
Duh !!
same thing here , once that TV screen goes black YOU GOT WHAT YOU PAID FOR !
If you want to continue , fish out another bill or if you are broke GO THE FUCK HOME AND FINISH THERE.4 )
This one is important , so pay it some fucking attention .
If you happen to be a horny gay man ( nothing wrong with that ) and inappropriately proposition another man in the parking lot and he punches you in the mouth , YOU HAD IT COMING .
I want to reiterate for the slow among us , YOU ASKED FOR IT !!!
Please wait until you are in the arcade to cruise for dick .
We offer a wide range of products that straight people need , so do n't assume because someone is going to the adult bookstore they are gay .
That is just fucking stupid you moron .
5 ) My job is to police the arcade and sell shit .
That is all I get paid to do and it's all I care about .
I could care less if you have a wedding ring on as you suck off 12 dudes , I do n't care if you are cheating on your wife with a woman of " questionable standards " , I do n't care if you enjoy dressing in your little sisters cloths and putting on a show for strangers in a window booth , I DO NOT GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THERE .
I do not need a play by play description of what you were just doing .
Keep it to yourself or write it in your journal or whatever .
Just leave me out of it , I will not be impressed , seriously .
6 )
If you pee in the trashcans and I catch you you will be cleaning that booth and I will be berating you the entire time it takes you .
You sick fucker what the fuck did your mother teach you when you were little .
I will then take your fucking picture and show it to every one who works here .
You will never be allowed back in , EVER !!!!!!7 ) I understand that sex creates wet spots on clothing , etc ... but if you come walking out of the arcade with cum in your beard , on your shirt , pants , whatever , I reserve the right to point and laugh .
We thoughtfully provide paper towels just for that situation .
If you choose not to use them then I choose to laugh and call you a douche bag .
8 ) We have janitors clean the arcade 3 times a day , every day .
I can do little for you if the booth you so desperately need to whack off in has a load of cum dripping down the monitor .
I will not be rushing back there to clean that up real quick for you .
If the little present left by the previous occupant offends you so much you have 2 options , 1 ) Walk your ass to another , cleaner , booth . 2 ) reach up and grab a paper towel from the dispenser and clean it up your fucking self .
That 's it , throw the biggest tantrum you can and you will still be left with the same 2 options .
I do hope you find this little piece of information helpful .
Have a wonderful day !

A hidden city fare occurs when a flight from point A to point B happens to make a connection in point C and is cheaper than a direct flight from point A to point C .
This is a quirk of the way in which airlines price their routes , which has little to do with the distance flown .
The prices are driven by market conditions .
Prices drop when there is a lot of competition on a route .
The flight from A to B might be a very busy route , with several airlines serving that market , while the A - C and C - B routes might be not as busy .
Usually such hidden city fares occur when A and C are n't hubs for the carrier in question , but B is , and B is dominated by the airline .
So the airline routes you through B , but charges you less than if you were to purchase two round - trip tickets ..
Theoretically , you could buy a ticket from A to B , get off at point C , and throw away the B to C portion , saving some money , if point C was your ultimate destination .
Airlines frown on this practice , and taking advantage of a hidden city fare is explicitly forbidden by their rules .
If you happen to skip a leg of your flight ( e.g. , logged as a no - show on the airline 's computer ) , the airline has the right to cancel all subsequent legs , and will do so to discourage folks from using hidden - city fares .
So the only case in which you can " safely " take advantage of a hidden - city fare is when you 're taking a one - way flight .
If you buy a round - trip ticket from A to B through C , skip the C to B leg , and try to board the return flight at B or C , you 'll find that your reservation has been cancelled and you 'll be required to buy a new ticket at the full - price one - way fare .
You also can't take advantage of a hidden city fare if you 've checked any baggage , as your baggage will be sent through to your ultimate destination .
Airlines have started to really crack down on the use of hidden city fares .
They can not only cancel subsequent flights on their own lines , but also recommend cancellation of subsequent flights on other carriers .
They 've programmed their airline reservation systems to watch out for hidden - city reservations , flagging potential violations in the passenger 's record , and in some cases will automatically cancel all subsequent legs if one leg is skipped .
Even if the reservation system does n't automatically cancel the subsequent legs , the agent at check - in will see the warning flag and will be very suspicious of any skipped legs .
Some airlines ( e.g. , Delta ) have a practice of checking you in for all outbound flights at the point of origin .
But this does n't make them any more susceptible to folks who use hidden city fares , because if you do n't show up for the return flight at B , they 'll still cancel all your remaining legs .
Also , sometimes the boarding passes are marked " check - in required " .
Hidden city fares happen most often when the connecting point is dominated by one airline ( the carrier of your flight ) and the ultimate destination is a competitive market .
If you happen to catch an earlier flight than your scheduled one , be sure to reconfirm your subsequent flight segments .
Any departure from your ticketed reservation can potentially cause your itinerary to be flagged as a hidden - city violation ( e.g. , " NOSH " for no - show ) , if the gate agent did n't record the earlier flight properly .
If you 're the dishonest type and are going to lie about actually having taken the skipped segments , at least have the intelligence to remove the ticket and boarding pass ( keeping the stub of the boarding pass ) from the ticket packet .
[ I once saw a couple try this stunt in New York , and the gate agent caught them at it .
The wife had removed her ticket and boarding pass ; the husband had n't .
The husband claimed that the gate agent at the hidden city had forgotten to remove the ticket .
The gate agent did n't let them on the flight because the computer showed that they had missed TWO segments of their flight -- from the hidden city to their ultimate destination and back .
In addition , the gate agent had been on duty the last time they passed through , and did n't remember seeing them board .
The agent 's supervisor concurred . ]
If you know in advance that you want to skip a segment of your flight ( e.g. , you 're flying from A to C via B , but want to get off in C , visit with some friends , then drive up to B to visit some more friends and return home ) , tell this to the travel agent when you buy the ticket .
They can make a note about it in the record so that your return flight wo n't be automatically cancelled when you miss the B to C leg .
BEN BERNANKE said today that the TARP plan , and any subsequent debt - financed bail - outs , pose no credit risk to America .
That is probably true , but it ’s a rather remarkable statement .
We have arrived at our current situation due in part to the insatiable demand for American debt .
During the savings glut that characterised much of the past decade governments and individuals desired American assets because they viewed them as relatively risk - free .
That enabled the government to run up enormous debts , while facing low real rates ( especially on longer - dated securities ) , and made credit a little too easy .
Now America is counting on its assets ' risk - free status to persist .
It plans , in fact , to help save the global economy by incurring still more debt .
The risk - free perception means that America can borrow whatever it needs for a low cost , and can do so without threatening its risk - free status .
This is n't typically how credit - worthiness works .
The prospect of an American default seems incomprehensible no matter how much debt the government issues .
But is it really ?
Suppose a major creditor nation posed a security risk and threatened to dump all its American debt on the market .
In that case default could happen despite American solvency .
That situation is improbable , but feasible .
After all , many politically inconvenient creditor nations hold substantial American debt .
And stranger things have happened .
And there must exist some level of debt that the market views as unsustainable .
Yesterday I mentioned Willem Buiter , who believes that Britain reduced its credit rating as a result of its bank bail - out .
America has avoided this problem thanks to the dollar 's role as a global reserve currency .
But does issuing so much debt ultimately undermine that role ?
An extraordinary amount of wealth has been created , all over the world , during the last twenty years .
This was largely possible because of the belief that there exist certain assets that pose little risk , and a currency that will always be in demand .
The dollar continues to be the world 's reserve currency , albeit with some new competition from the euro .
Demand for Treasuries remains strong .
That suggests the world wants to maintain its faith in American stability , though to be fair , potential competitors look , if anything , worse at this point .
What would it take to change this global view of America ?
A recent international study fails to support the common belief that the number of calories burned in physical activity is a key factor in rising rates of obesity .
Researchers from Loyola University Health System and other centers compared African American women in metropolitan Chicago with women in rural Nigeria .
On average , the Chicago women weighed 184 pounds and the Nigerian women weighed 127 pounds .
Researchers had expected to find that the slimmer Nigerian women would be more physically active .
To their surprise , they found no significant difference between the two groups in the amount of calories burned during physical activity .
" Decreased physical activity may not be the primary driver of the obesity epidemic , " said Loyola nutritionist Amy Luke , Ph.D. , corresponding author of the study in the September 2008 issue of the journal Obesity .
Luke is an associate professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine .
Physical activity is defined as anything that gets your body moving .
U.S. government guidelines say that each week , adults need at least 2 ½ hours of moderate aerobic activity ( such as brisk walking ) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity ( such as jogging ) .
Adults also should do muscle - strengthening activities , such as weight - lifting or sit-ups , at least twice a week .
Physical activity has many proven benefits .
It strengthens bones and muscles , improves mental health and mood , lowers blood pressure , improves cholesterol levels and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease , diabetes , breast cancer and colon cancer .

But Loyola research suggests that weight control might not be among the main benefits .
People burn more calories when they exercise .
But they compensate by eating more , said Richard Cooper , Ph.D. , co-author of the study and chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology .
" We would love to say that physical activity has a positive effect on weight control , but that does not appear to be the case , " Cooper said .
The recent study included 149 women from two rural Nigerian villages and 172 African American women from the west side of Chicago and suburban Maywood .
Adjusted for body size , the Chicago women burned an average of 760 calories per day in physical activity , while the Nigerian women burned 800 calories .
This difference was not statistically significant .
Diet is a more likely explanation than physical activity expenditure for why Chicago women weigh more than Nigerian women , Luke said .
She noted the Nigerian diet is high in fiber and carbohydrates and low in fat and animal protein .
By contrast , the Chicago diet is 40 percent to 45 percent fat and high in processed foods .
Results of the new study are similar to those of a 2007 study of men and women in Jamaica .
Researchers from Loyola and other centers found there was no association between weight gain and calories burned during physical activity .
" Evidence is beginning to accumulate that dietary intake may be more important than energy expenditure level , " Luke said .
" Weight loss is not likely to happen without dietary restraint . "
Other centers involved in the study of Chicago and Nigerian women include University of Ibadan in Nigeria , Howard University , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and University of Wisconsin .
By now , we all know if you write something embarrassing on the Internet under your own name , it 's your own fault if your missive lives forever on Google 's ( GOOG ) search engine .
But what if you do something embarrassing outside ?
Should there be a right to protection against Google 's roving cameras , integrated into Google Maps ?
The residents of 8 Sampsonia Way in Pittsburgh , PA may be wondering that .
In case you 're wondering , it seems we 're looking at LARP ( " live action role play " ) , which is sort of like Dungeons & Dragons .
Except instead of sitting around in someone 's basement with dice , you dress up in faux medieval armor and attack people with tinfoil swords .
All of which reiterates what we 've always felt about Google Street View : Amazingly cool , but also kind of unnerving .
Next time , head into the deep woods , fellas .
UPDATE : A commenter lets us know our supposed LARPers are actually part of an art project to bring fantastic scenes to Google Maps .
Someone using Google ’s Street View map may be surprised when looking down Pittsburgh ’s Sampsonia Way .
In May , artists Ben Kinsley and Robin Hewlett staged outlandish scenes , including a 17th century sword fight , and an escape from a building using knotted sheets , to be captured when a Google car equipped with cameras was sent down Sampsonia Way .
The artists wanted to explore the boundaries between virtual and real worlds .

A few weeks ago ( “ Nasa Scientist : Cap & Trade Not Sufficient , ” Jan 1st ) we posted an item featuring the thoughts of climate scientist James Hansen criticizing elements of Obama ’s likely climate change strategy .
Now , in another Observer piece , he gives the administration a mere four years to take action concerning this problem , four years which are likely to be best with a whole host of other catastrophes vying for his attention and , potentially , increasingly limited political , financial and other means :
President ‘has four years to save Earth ’
US must take the lead to avert eco-disaster
Read the full interview with James Hansen here
Robin McKie in New York
The Observer , Sunday 18 January 2009
Barack Obama has only four years to save the world .
That is the stark assessment of Nasa scientist and leading climate expert Jim Hansen who last week warned only urgent action by the new president could halt the devastating climate change that now threatens Earth .
Crucially , that action will have to be taken within Obama ’s first administration , he added .
Soaring carbon emissions are already causing ice - cap melting and threaten to trigger global flooding , widespread species loss and major disruptions of weather patterns in the near future .
“ We can not afford to put off change any longer , ” said Hansen .
“ We have to get on a new path within this new administration .
We have only four years left for Obama to set an example to the rest of the world .
America must take the lead . ”
Hansen said current carbon levels in the atmosphere were already too high to prevent runaway greenhouse warming .
Yet the levels are still rising despite all the efforts of politicians and scientists

In June of 2008 , astronomers announced the finding of one of the smallest exoplanets yet around a normal star other than the Sun .
The planet – believed to be a rocky exo-world — was found through a microlensing event , and was estimated to be 3.3 times the size of Earth , orbiting a brown dwarf star .
But new analysis suggests the star may be larger than first thought , making the planet smaller than the original estimates .
Astronomers say the exoplanet , called MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192 - L b could weigh just 1.4 Earths – less than half the original estimate .
Observations over the next few months should be able to test the prediction .
Most known “ exoplanets ” are huge gas giants , hundreds of times Earth ’s mass , and are discovered by detecting the wobble they induce in their parent stars .
But researchers found the planet and star using the gravitational microlensing technique .
This is where two stars line up perfectly from our point of view here on Earth .
As the two stars begin to line up , the foreground star acts as a lens to magnify and distort the light from the more distant star .
By watching how this brightening happens , astronomers can learn a tremendous amount about the nature of both the foreground and background star .
In this case , there was an additional gravitational distortion from the planet orbiting the foreground star MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192L , which astronomers were able to tease out in their data .
However , analyzing these events takes time , because there are so many variables to take into account , including the sizes of planet and star , their separation , and the distance from Earth .
Initially , the team believed that this host star was a brown dwarf – an object too small to sustain nuclear fusion , as normal stars do .
That suggested MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192 - L b weighed 3.3 Earths .
But more recent observations suggest the parent star is actually heavier than first thought – a type of star called a red dwarf , team member Jean - Philippe Beaulieu of the Paris Astrophysical Institute reported last week at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in London .
That suggests the planet weighs just 1.4 Earths .
In size terms , that makes it a near twin of our own planet , closer in mass than any known planet except Venus .
“ The result is important because this is the lowest - mass planet yet detected , and is extremely close to the mass of the Earth , ” said Scott Gaudi of Ohio State University in Columbus .
“ Obviously , finding a true Earth - mass planet is one of the biggest goals of searches for exoplanets .
We are very close to that goal now . ”
The team will attempt to get more data on the parent star in April or May using the Very Large Telescope in northern Chile .
If their analysis is confirmed , it is an unclear whether the tiny planet could host any life .
Because its host is a very dim red dwarf , the planet is likely to be frozen – even though it orbits at about the same distance as Venus from our Sun .
However , if the planet boasts a thick , insulating hydrogen atmosphere , it could sustain a habitable surface temperature , capable of supporting life of some kind .

BBC News , Gaza City
People have been forced to cook over fires because of gas shortages Parts of Gaza are unscathed .
Parts are rubble .
For those parts , much of the emphasis this week has been about how to get aid into the territory .
Where , for example , do you raise the hundreds of millions , probably billions of dollars needed to rebuild it after the war ?
Who handles it ?
Where do you channel it ?
But in the meantime , how are the people of Gaza going about rebuilding their homes and their businesses ?
The muezzin at the Salaam mosque , east of Jabalya , was not waiting .
You normally hear the call to prayer , when it has been tinnily amplified through a loudspeaker .
But for these midday prayers , the muezzin was only audible to those close by .
He had a beautiful voice , the notes held long , the quarter - tones gently wavering .
He stood , eyes closed , on the roof of his mosque , which was now just a couple of metres above the ground , on a pile of rubble .
Prayers are now held on that large , jagged slab of concrete .
Deep privations
Across the street , are the remains of the Qadr family house .
It is now just an ugly heap of dust - strewn grey masonry , the only splash of colour a torn sheet and a cracked bathroom tile .
Now , up a steep path to the top of the rubble , there is a corrugated iron shack .
It is a few metres square , with sheets for walls .
" My family - my children , my grandchildren and my brothers ' family - we number 80 , " the head of the family , Qadr Mohammed Qadr told me .
He is a tall , 70 - year - old man , sitting next to the small iron shack .
" Now , 20 of us sleep here , each night . "
His home was , he said , destroyed on 14 January .
He returned as soon as the Israeli troops withdrew .
The muezzin's call to prayer does not travel far
The privations are deep , he said , his citrus orchards have been destroyed , but he needed to return , because " this is my land . "
He had to be where four members of his family had died .
Mr Qadr received a daily supply of water .
And the UN provides a one - off payment of about $ 150 for a family which has been made homeless .
But complete rebuilding - that will take years .
The UN relief agency said that it is years behind schedule on previous reconstruction projects , because of Israeli border closures .
And it is not just houses that need to be rebuilt .
Fights for gas A further short walk across the churned land , is a filling station for propane gas canisters .
It used to be enclosed .
Now it has one - and - a - half walls .
The pipeline was destroyed .
A pump has been punched with heavy machine gun fire .
It is a place that thousands of families rely on for their cooking gas .
As we arrived , fights were breaking out .
After an early morning bomb explosion , in which an Israeli soldier had died , the Israeli authorities had closed the border crossing points .
The gas supply had run out .
Customers vent their fury at the owner - a man so tired and fed up that he did not want to give us his name , and who at one point told the assembled disgruntled customers that it would have been better if the Israelis had completed the job and laid waste to the entire area .
Prayers are held near the ruins of the mosque
The owner and his workers had only just finished repairing the station so that it was operational .
One of the workers , 29 - year - old Mohammed Jarada , watched the melees from what little shade the station forecourt now provided .
Mr Jarada said he was the only breadwinner for his own family of 12 , and despite being an employee at the gas station , his family were cooking on firewood .
The Israeli authorities said that they had closed the crossing points because of the attack on their soldiers .
Who did he blame ?
Mohammed 's eyes fixed on the middle distance : " In this state of chaos , in this state of anarchy , " he said , " I can't blame anybody .
Everyone is blaming everybody else in the Gaza Strip . "
The customers drifted off , without their canisters .
Around them , the sound of reconstruction continued , the jarring pound of metal posts being hammered into the ground , the rhythmic scrape of mortar being smeared over breeze blocks .
One of the two men building the wall shone a rueful smile in our direction .
" Until the next time , " he said .
There is a resilience and a resignation about people in Gaza .
Yes , the rebuilding has begun .
Until , that is , the next cataclysm hits .

Sounds great for hippies and Web 2.0 types , but what big - name artist would actually commit this sort of career suicide ?
Nine Inch Nails , for one , and Trent Reznor & Co. produced the bestselling MP3 album of 2008 at Amazon.com , even though the music could be had for free .
Ghosts I - IV offered four albums of instrumental music , but Reznor bypassed the normal distribution channels and released the music himself .
Ghosts I was offered as a free download and was even thrown up ( legally ) on The Pirate Bay for anyone to grab , but the entire set of albums was offered under a Creative Commons license .
That license allowed free sharing and remixing of the entire work .
Though fans could grab the music free of charge , Reznor racked up huge amounts of cash by offering limited edition sets with extras like Blu-ray discs and deluxe packaging ; this was widely praised as a way to profit from scarcity while simply giving away the stuff that 's easily copied ( i.e. , the digital bits that make up the music ) .
But Reznor actually made a ton of cash from even those basic digital bits .
Forget about the deluxe artwork and the high - priced , limited - edition extras ; Reznor actually sold more copies of the basic Ghosts I - IV albums through Amazon 's MP3 store than did any other act in 2008 .
He beat out Coldplay , Death Cab for Cutie , Vampire Weekend , Beck , and hundreds of others , and he did it without a label and by giving the music away .
This is exactly the sort of success story that Creative Commons likes to highlight ( " See , it 's not just for hippies and anarchists — it 's for actual business use , too ! " ) , and the group did so Monday with a blog entry that attempts to answer the question of how Reznor succeeded .
" So why would fans bother buying files that were identical to the ones on the file sharing networks ? " asks Fred Benenson of Creative Commons , and he has an answer .
" One explanation is the convenience and ease - of - use of NIN and Amazon 's MP3 stores .
But another is that fans understood that purchasing MP3s would directly support the music and career of a musician they liked .
The next time someone tries to convince you that releasing music under CC will cannibalize digital sales , remember that Ghosts I - IV broke that rule , and point them here . "
Assuming the answer is correct — fans will directly support work that matters to them — a few additional questions arise .
Certainly , a Creative Commons license does n't mean penury for all musicians , but Reznor had the incredible advantage of a large fan base before taking over music production and distribution .
Is the model of " do it all yourself , control all rights , release the music freely " really a feasible one without getting some name recognition first ?
Second , would CC licensing work for labels ?
That is , could an indie label release all its music for free sharing and still see good financial results ?
The feeling of directly supporting an artist would be lost , though there 's always the convenience and ease - of - use argument for downloading from a site like Amazon for those who have more money than time .
Question and answer
I put both questions to Benenson .
Regarding the first one , he notes , " Sometimes people say that Reznor has an advantage over independent musicians because he 's previously benefited from marketing and traditional record label support .
What is n't taken into consideration is that Reznor , through splitting his royalties and earnings over the years , has actually paid for that marketing and then some . "
Given the ease of digital distribution today , artists are in a better position to be " mini- labels " of their own , hiring marketers and tour managers themselves , as needed , rather than signing away control and huge chunks of revenue .
As to the second question about traditional labels adopting CC licenses , Berenson says it 's not just possible but already happening .
" There are many labels that use Creative Commons licenses .
Magnatune is an example of one that uses CC licenses exclusively — you can download everything the label has released for free .
They make a significant amount of their income by licensing that music commercially and splitting the revenues with artists .
I have about a dozen other labels if you 'd like a list . "
But what about that feeling of direct connection to the artist that buyers get when the artist gets to keep all the cash you pay for their work ?
" While a lot of NIN 's success with Ghosts can be attributed to fans interested in supporting Reznor digitally , " Benenson says , " I think this dynamic can work for labels too .
That is , if labels can properly message what they do as something that helps artists and new talent ( rather than exploiting them ) , then I think fans will act supportively .
" There 's an opportunity to add value to the once - cut - and - dry music transaction where it has never existed before — consumers love feeling that they are contributing to something good , and if a label can transparently represent itself ( and perhaps more importantly , distance itself from the behavior of the majors ) as well as offer new value to its community , then I think the same affect as Reznor 's Ghosts offer can be achieved . "
Licensing music for free and noncommercial distribution might not take over the world in 2009 — no other act in Amazon 's list did so , though Radiohead ( # 11 ) did .
Still , it 's encouraging to see examples of artists making a living without having to adopt a confrontational approach to fans .
Under Reznor 's model , everyone wins ... well , except for the major labels , which a decade ago would have raked in much of the profit from his work .
It has come to light that German automaker Volkswagen has sued one of its Lamborghini dealerships , Lamborghini of Orange County .
Last November the former “ worlds largest Lamborghini dealer ” closed its doors for good .
The closing came rather abrubptly according to some reports , and the reason has remained a mystery until court documents were released showing that VW was indeed suing the dealership .
In the suit Volkswagen accuses the dealership of stealing $ 12 million dollars from the company .
The dealership ’s owners , the Keuylian family , apparently sold 54 cars at ridiculously low prices over a period of 8 days before closing their dealership .
The family then ran off with the money without paying off its creditors , VW Credit .
Other parties have now stepped forward with their own lawsuits , also alleging that the Keuylian ’s owe them money .
If Volkswagen can’t find them , they are stuck with a bill in the tune of around $ 12 million .
Then again this is one of the world ’s largest auto manufactures .
I doubt they will get very far before they are caught and prosecuted .
Hopefully they ’ve kept a couple of Lamborghini getaway cars with them !

There is an " unprecedented increase " in measles cases in England and Wales , experts report .
Data from the Health Protection Agency showed there were 1,217 cases of measles from January to November 2008 , the highest figure for over a decade .
And 75 % of the 115 cases diagnosed in November were outside the traditional hotspot of London - in the north west , west midlands and south east .
The HPA's Dr Mary Ramsay said the rise was due to " relatively low " MMR uptake .
We are concerned we may see measles epidemics take hold
Dr Mary Ramsay
The number of measles cases in November 2008 was the same as was seen in the whole of 1996 .
And even before numbers for December have been recorded , the figures show there were more measles cases in 2008 than in any of the previous 12 years .
Despite the recent surge of cases outside London , over half of the cases last year were in the capital .
As well as outbreaks in nurseries , primary and secondary schools , there have been outbreaks in traveller communities in the west midlands and south east .
The HPA says too few children are receiving both doses of the combined measles , mumps and rubella jab .
Sixty per cent of cases were seen in children aged under 15 .
' Not fully protected '
Earlier this week the UK was named as one of the worst countries in Europe for measles , with case levels dashing global hopes of eradicating the disease by 2010 .
A Lancet study said that in 2006 - 7 most of the 12,000 cases in Europe were found in the UK and four other nations .
Dr Mary Ramsay , an immunisation expert at the HPA , said : " We are still experiencing an unprecedented increase in measles cases across the England and Wales .
" This continued rise is due to relatively low MMR vaccine uptake over the past decade and there are now a large number of children who are not fully protected with MMR .
" This means that measles , which is highly infectious , is spreading easily among these unvaccinated children . "
She added : " The HPA is concerned that we may see measles epidemics take hold .
" We again are urging parents to get their children vaccinated .
Although MMR coverage is starting to improve , we cannot stress enough that measles is serious and in some cases it can be fatal .
Delaying immunisation puts children at risk . "
Dr Ramsay said around eight out of 10 children were now receiving one dose of MMR by their second birthday .
But she added : " We should n't forget that the children who were n't vaccinated many years ago are at real risk . "
Serious illness A Department of Health spokesman said an MMR catch - up programme , which began last August , aimed to help local primary care trusts to identify children who had not been given the jab .
In Scotland , the number of children receiving at least one dose of the MMR jab by the age of five has reached the target of 95 % for the first time in December .
Northern Ireland saw just four cases of measles last year .
Although most children recover from measles , it can be a serious illness .
One in 10 cases requires hospital treatment and it can lead to pneumonia , brain damage and even death .

Around three quarters of the way through the 1970s , I made regular trips to the North West of England to see my then - girlfriend at Liverpool University .
Occasionally we would visit Manchester , which could ( and still can ) boast a range of old - established family brewers superior to anywhere else in Britain .
Supported by a copy of the local Camra guide , I ’d try to fit in beers in places owned by as many of these small operators as I could in a single trip .
It meant visiting pubs for their proximity to each other , rather than the quality of the establishment / the beer .
This is not always a good idea .
One day I found a place listed in the city centre that served the beers of a brewer from much further out that I had n’t then tried , and told the willing Kathy R we had to visit it .
The outside looked as if the brewery estates department had last paid it any attention at least 20 years earlier : undeterred , we went in , got beers at the bar , sat down , and realised that the walls were covered in porn : not even the polite , airbrushed Penthouse / Playboy sort , but pages torn from magazines at the “ readers ’ wives ” end of the spectrum .
Unsurprisingly , my girlfriend was the only female customer in the place , and every one of the customers looked like their only income was from acting as a copper ’s nark .
There was probably a stripper on later .
We did n’t wait to find out .
I might be alone here , but I find naked women too distracting when I ’m drinking beer .
Still , the experience gave me a marker : “ roughest pub I ’ve ever been in ” .
I ’ve found myself in a few actual strippers ’ pubs , and I ’ve been in pubs where fights have exploded , though these generally looked perfectly respectable before it all kicked off .
There was a bar in Glasgow where a table started brawling among themselves at 5.30 in the afternoon , for example : wonderful , I thought , someone ’s putting on the Glasgow pub experience for us without us having to stay out late and drink too much ourselves .
The barman was given a fist in the face for going over and trying to calm it down , and I saw him later being given the classic folk - remedy of a raw steak applied to his blackening eye .
Doubtless , this being Glasgow , the steak was later recycled onto someone ’s plate : well - done , I hope .
The only other place I ’ve seen bar staff assaulted was in a pub in the back streets of Weymouth , normally a quiet seaside town with the nearest whiff of danger being the prison a couple of miles down the coast on Portland Bill .
This time the barman had his shirt ripped off his back .
As his attacker was carried out of the pub , the barman turned and glared at us : perhaps he felt we should have been more than spectators .
Or at least paid for our entertainment by offering to replace his shirt .
Rough pubs do n’t have to be a bad experience , of course .
Around the same time as my visit to the Manchester porn pub , I used to travel out to a little rural beerhouse called the Goose , in the hamlet of Moor Green , part of the lost East Hertfordshire landscape of fields , woods and farms that seems 300 miles , rather than 30 miles , from London , and 50 years in the past .
The Goose , an isolated building of indeterminate age , had been selling beer for more than a century but was still about as close to being a private house as it could be while performing the functions of premises with a magistrates ’ on - licence .
The pub sign was as rough as the pub : a painted sheet - metal goose , neck outstretched , perched on a 10ft wooden post .
There was no bar : the beer , brewed down the road by McMullen ’s of Hertford , appeared through a hatch in the wall of one of the two rooms open to the public .
The furniture was junk - shop , the gents was outside , and open to the sky : a luminous green fungus grew on the black walls of the urinals , looking as if it was about to release its spores and conquer the planet .
The Goose was utterly basic and utterly marvellous , and the local Camra branch loved it , sticking it in the Good Beer Guide and travelling out regularly by the minibus - load to take on , and lose to , the cloth - capped locals at darts and dominoes .
Even with Camra ’s help , though , the Goose could only have been doing minimal business , and it closed around 1979 .
Now Paul Moody , a music journalist , and Robin Turner , who works in the music business , have produced The Rough Pub Guide a celebration of 50 British boozers from Glasgow to Cornwall all 180 degrees round the circle from chalkboard menus and four different house whites .
Inevitably this is a list to argue about endlessly over pints down your own local rough boozer , both about pubs that have been left out and pubs that have been included .
The Lewes Arms , for example , number 6 on Moody and Turner ’s list , gave Greene King a black eye in the row over stocking Harvey ’s beer and it ’s a great pub , but I do n’t think it ’s “ rough ” in any way .
And what is the Green Man , the extremely expensive bar in the basement of Harrods , doing in a list of “ rough ” pubs ?
But it ’s still good to see the “ rough pub ” experience being hymned .
Yes , the toilets probably whiff a bit , and the beer is n’t that great , but there ’s something about being in a basic boozer at 3.30 in the afternoon with the racing on the telly high up the wall and only a Polish barmaid , a half - eaten packet of salt ’n ’vinegar and five or six other sad , silent losers for company that is as British as Trooping the Colour or the Last Night of the Proms …
Happy New Year !

The elder daughter of Pakistan 's assassinated former Prime Minister , Benazir Bhutto , has written a rap song expressing grief over her death .
The song by Bakhtawar Bhutto , 18 , comes a year after the assassination and is entitled " I would take the pain away " .
It pays tribute to her mother 's " crazy courage " and describes her as " the epitome of benevolence " .
It has been played regularly on state - run television and has been posted on the video - sharing website YouTube .
' Weeping ' " My mother was murdered .
I do n't even comprehend .
Was it worth dying for ?
I 'm walking through screened doors , " Bakhtawar sings in English .
You had beauty and intelligence , everything you did was relevant
Bakhtawar Bhutto's lyrics in " I would take the pain away "
Obituary : Benazir Bhutto Life in pictures : Benazir Bhutto
" No comfort or ease .
I 'm begging you please , God bless the deceased , " she laments in the song .
Praising her mother 's " beauty and intelligence " , the song says that the " whole world is weeping " over the murder .
" Shot in the back of your ear , so young in 54th year , murdered with three kids left behind , a hopeless nation without you , you are in all their hearts , " it says .
The teenager , a student at Edinburgh University , then repeats the chorus line " I would take the pain away " .
A video to accompany the song shows footage and photographs of her smiling mother while election campaigning shortly before her death in Rawalpindi in December 2007 and of public grieving after her death .
Ms Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack on her convoy - blamed on Islamic militants - as it travelled through the city 's Liaquat Bagh park .
She had just finished addressing an election rally .
Information Minister Sherry Rehman - who for several years was an aide to Ms Bhutto - told the Reuters news agency that Bakhtawar wrote the lyrics and music while studying in Edinburgh .
" It 's a tribute of a grieving daughter to her iconic and loving mother , " she said .
Ms Rehman said that while music was a hobby for Bakhtawar , she had no plan to pursue it as a career .
The song has had mixed reviews in the British press .
" While her dirge - like rap is unlikely to secure her a Grammy , the seemingly heartfelt tribute might win her some fans , " The Independent newspaper says .
The Guardian says that she uses the song to " pour out her anguish " .
Ms Bhutto's widower and Bakhtawar 's father , Asif Ali Zardari , became president of Pakistan in September .
Their son , Bilawal , 20 , studies at Oxford University in the UK and another daughter , Aseefa , 14 , also studies abroad .

Grand Prix auto racing is the pinnacle of motorsports .
Nowhere are the cars so technologically advanced or success so dependent upon talent , bravery and money .
Lots and lots of money .
Hundreds of millions of dollars flow into the hands of some of the best engineers and designers this side of the aerospace industry , then runs head - on into the FIA .
The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile are the Draconians who think up rules even Melvin Belli could n’t get around and enforce them with such zeal a Catholic school nun would shake her head at the injustice .
So here we stand at the cusp of a Formula 1 season that has seen some huge changes in the rules .
What happens when the clever and the quick run into the convoluted and unjust , and what does it mean for the cars we 'll see on the grid ?
First , a quick - and - dirty rundown of the biggest changes for 2009 .
If you want more , get all the detail you can handle by downloading the FIA 's F1 regs here .
First up , KERS .
Kinetic energy recovery systems capture some of the energy generated during braking and stores it - either electronically in a battery or capacitor or mechanically in a flywheel - for use at the driver 's discretion .
Often called " push to pass , " the driver could opt to use the added power to accelerate out of a corner or on a straight to pass another car .
KERS is part of FIA boss Max Mosley 's campaign to make F1 technology more relevant to road cars .
But it 's proven such a bear to develop that teams have the option of running it this year .
It will be mandatory next year .
Or not .
The FIA keeps waffling on that .
The problem is KERS is bulky , hard to package in the tight confines of an F1 chassis and so far works about as well as Windows Vista .
When BMW first tested it in public , it shocked a mechanic hard enough to knock him on his ass .
Ferrari says the technology 's proven more expensive than expected , and it remains to be seen how many teams run it this year .
This year also sees significant changes to the tires , which arguably are the most important component of any car .
This year we say hello to slicks - again - and goodbye to grooved rubber .
The FIA banned slicks in 1998 but brought them back this year to improve safety .
Slick tires put more rubber on the road , which increases grip , which makes it easier to slow down should things go pear - shaped .
It also makes it easer to put down power making for better acceleration and , potentially , more frequent passing .
But the biggest changes have been to aerodynamics .
Gone are all the bits and bobs tacked on to the cars in an effort to increase downforce .
By the end of last season , the cars had so many winglets , exhaust stacks and other baubles they looked like something that might wash up on the beach .
They 're all gone this year , as are the barge boards .
What 's left is significantly smaller , starting with the rear wings .
They 're a hell of a lot narrower , and , frankly , look ridiculously out of proportion .
At the other end of the car , the front wings are bigger and deeper , yet simpler .
When the rules were announced , everyone feared the resulting cars would be ugly .
Turns out they were wrong , based upon the three teams we were able to get photos from .
Look , for example , at the McLaren MP4 - 24 above , the car Lewis Hamilton will use to defend his title .
Although that dinky rear wing throws the balance off , the car 's overall shape is quite pleasing .
The clean , flowing lines of the sidepods are gorgeous , and the entire body appears to be shrunk - wrapped over the components underneath .
The same is true of the Renault R29 shown below .
Renault has the distinction of having a " shark fin " trailing from the air intake .
The fin , like the slick sidepods , is all about smoothing the airflow to the rear wing .
Smaller wings generate less downforce , which as a general rule is a bad thing , so the aero engineers do everything they can to maximize what they 've got by making airflow to the wing as smooth as possible .
Note the simplicity of the front wing of the McLaren .
Not nearly as complex as in the past .
That same simplicity can also be seen on the BMW F1.09 shown below .
Somewhere under the BMW 's bodywork is the kinetic energy recovery system .
BMW seems to have worked out the bugs and plans to run the system this year at it makes a run for the championship .
We 've gotta say the naysayers were wrong .
Oh sure , the rear wings are absurdly small , but we like the leaner , cleaner look of the '09 cars .
Bottom line ?
They 're pretty freakin' hot .
More photos that , like all others , are courtesy of the respective teams .
What can i say , only a( nother ) cat video , what goes on in a cat 's mindhad to be expained by a better catpsycologist than I am .
Quitting was not an option anyways .
WASHINGTON
In the past week , I ’ve twice been close enough to Dick Cheney to kick him in the shins .
I did n’t .
It ’s probably a federal crime of some sort .
But a girl can fantasize .
I did , however , assume the Stay - away - from - me - you ’ve - got - cooties stance that Jimmy Carter used when posing with Bill Clinton at the presidents ’ powwow in the Oval .
The first time was Tuesday , when Cheney left the ceremony where he gave the oath of office to senators .
The senators seemed thrilled , especially Joe Biden , who was getting sworn in for just two weeks and was excitedly showing off a family Bible the size of a Buick .
But I thought it gave the ceremony a satirical edge to have the lawless
Vice presiding over lawmakers swearing to support and defend the Constitution that he soiled and defiled  right in the heart of the legislative branch he worked to diminish .
The second time I crossed paths was Thursday night , at a glitzy party at Cafe Milano for Brit Hume , stepping down as a Fox anchor .
It required extreme defensive maneuvers  much zigging and zagging  to avoid Cheney , Wolfie and Rummy , all three holding court and blissfully unrepentant about the chaos they ’ve unleashed on the world .
“ My conscience is clear , ” Rummy volunteered to Bob Woodward , talking about how he ’s interviewing people for his memoir .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama ’s choice for attorney general broke with the Bush administration to call waterboarding “ torture ” and vowed to fight financial fraud at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday .
Eric Holder also addressed a major criticism by Republicans and acknowledged that he had erred when , as a deputy attorney general , he supporting a pardon by former President Bill Clinton for a fugitive financier , Marc Rich .
He pledged that the Guantanamo prison for foreign terrorism suspects , opened after the September 11 attacks and denounced internationally by human rights groups , would be closed but said it would take longer than some hope .
Republicans had been expected to make Holder ’s confirmation one of the most contentious of any of Obama ’s nominations , partly because of the Rich pardon issue .
But the 57 - year - old Holder , who would be the first African - American U.S. attorney general , appeared almost certain to win approval in the Democrat - controlled Senate .
With Obama to be sworn in as president on Tuesday , Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy urged Holder ’s quick confirmation in view of the attorney general ’s key role in national security and prosecution of financial crimes .
“ The responsibilities of the attorney general of the United States are too important to have this appointment delayed by partisan bickering , ” Leahy , a Democrat , said .
Holder said in his opening statement that the Justice Department , “ must wage an aggressive effort against financial fraud and market manipulation .
As taxpayers are asked to rescue large segments of our economy , they have a right to demand accountability for wrongdoing . ”
He also pledged tough enforcement of antitrust laws .
Holder said he would fight terrorism “ with every available tool , ” as well as protect public safety and civil rights .
“ WATERBOARDING IS TORTURE ”
Questioned by Leahy about waterboarding , Holder said , “ I agree with you , Mr. Chairman , that waterboarding is torture . ”
President George W. Bush insists that his administration has not tortured people , but the CIA has acknowledged using waterboarding , which is widely condemned internationally , in at least three cases of interrogating terrorism suspects .
CIA officials said the agency acted within the law , using Justice Department advice .
Bush ’s current attorney general , Michael Mukasey , riled Democrats and some fellow Republicans when he repeatedly refused to answer whether he considered waterboarding to be torture during his 2007 confirmation hearing .
Holder said he would ensure that interrogations were within international treaty obligations and effective .
Holder ’s comments signalled that Obama ’s Justice Department would not tolerate waterboarding .
Yet it remained unclear if Holder would seek to prosecute past instances .
He said the Guantanamo prison “ will be closed , ” but there were difficulties in deciding what to do with inmates who cannot be tried for crimes but are known to be dangerous , and it could take time to come up with a system .
“ It will be seen as fair , ” he said .
Leahy and Republicans questioned Holder about the Rich pardon , which some critics have said showed he may be subject to political calculations as attorney general .
“ I will be a better attorney general , having the Marc Rich experience , ” Holder said .
He acknowledged was unaware at the time of elements of Rich ’s full record .
The committee ’s ranking Republican , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , noted that unlike many other presidential appointments , “ the attorney general has an independent duty to the people . ”
The comments put Holder and the incoming Obama administration on notice that Republicans would be watchful .
Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , a Bush appointee , resigned in 2007 amid charges he had allowed the department to become politicized .
“ I will be an independent attorney general , I will be the people ’s lawyer , ” Holder said .
Specter also said the Justice Department should review its policy of fines for financial crimes .
“ When contrasted with the fraud , it ’s insufficient , ” he said .

Economic Snapshot for January 14 , 2009
Downtime : Workers forced to settle for fewer hours
By Ross Eisenbrey with research assistance by Kathryn Edwards
The number of involuntary part - time workers has nearly doubled just in the past year , mostly driven by full - time workers accepting cutbacks in hours .
In December , an additional 715,000 workers were classified as “ involuntary part time ” — either their full - time job was reduced below 35 hours a week or they had to settle for a part - time job because they could n’t find a full - time one .
That brings the total number of involuntary part - time workers to over 8 million .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , of the two types of involuntary part - timers almost 90 % of the increase during the past year was the result of employers reducing worker hours , a clear indication of the economy ’s rapid deterioration .
If these workers see their hours restored , it will be a sign of the economy ’s recovery .
About once a week since Barack Obama was elected president , The Birmingham News has run some sort of piece about the importance of continuing prosecutions initiated by Alice Martin , U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama .
The most recent entreaty came from columnist John Archibald , who virtually got on his knees and begged Obama ( or someone close to him ) to make sure that Martin 's handiwork proceeds into 2009 and beyond .
Archibald and his colleagues , in their pieces about Alabama justice in the Age of Obama , have conveniently neglected a key point :
There is a downside to having ethically challenged federal prosecutors , such as Martin and fellow Bush appointee Leura Canary ( Middle District of Alabama ) .
Both Martin and Canary have been accused of abusing their power for political purposes , and news reports indicate that both are under investigation by multiple federal agencies .
These investigations probably have been whitewashes under the Bush Justice Department .
But a number of sources indicate they could get serious when Obama appointees take over .
Archibald & Co. probably do not want to consider this question , but we will raise it here at Legal Schnauzer :
What if the charges against Martin and Canary are true ?
In fact , what if investigations reveal that the truth about Martin and Canary is even worse than some of their critics allege ?
What if Martin and Canary wind up facing professional sanctions , such as disbarment ?
What if Martin and Canary are found to have participated in criminal conspiracies ?
The Birmingham News seems desperate to see Martin 's prosecutions proceed against certain high - profile Democrats .
These defendants include Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford and codefendants William Blount and Al LaPierre ; Langford associate John Katapodis ; Alabama Representative Sue Schmitz ; Alabama Senator E.B. McClain ; and more .
The News appears to have a particularly strong bloodlust for Langford .
As for Canary , she is leading an effort to prosecute Montgomery insurance executive John Goff in a case that seems driven by the concerns / fears / desires of folks associated with Governor Bob Riley .
The Goff prosecution started only after Goff had filed a lawsuit claiming that Riley and others had conspired to ruin one of his businesses .
What are some possible downsides of these cases moving forward ?
For simplicity 's sake , let 's consider the Langford case in Birmingham and the Goff case in Montgomery .
Langford , a black Democrat , was arrested in early December on corruption - related charges .
It 's hard to say how strong the government 's case is against Langford .
But given Martin 's history of bringing questionable cases against Democrats and minorities , a reasonable person might wonder if political motivations are present .
Scott Horton , Columbia University law professor and legal - affairs contributor for Harper 's magazine , has called Martin one of the most corrupt and crooked public officials in the country .
Goff , a former Riley supporter , has been charged with fraud and embezzlement based on a set of facts that appeared to have already been settled in an administrative - law case .
The indictment of Goff seems to be payback for a lawsuit he brought against Gov. Riley .
Let 's assume the government has moderately strong cases against Langford and Goff .
And let 's assume that both are found guilty in federal trials .
What happens if subsequent investigations show that the prosecutors who initiated both cases were corrupt , that they targeted subjects for political reasons , that they violated professional standards and perhaps criminal laws ?
Does that not give Langford and Goff overwhelming grounds for appeal ?
Could n't that mean that any convictions would be overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct ?
Could taxpayer dollars spent on the two trials be wasted because the prosecutors were found to have acted corruptly ?
Regular readers know that I am not an attorney .
And I do n't pretend to be an expert on federal criminal procedure .
But when Obama appointees are in place in the Justice Department , it seems they will need to ask themselves this question :
Should we move forward with cases in Alabama , and elsewhere , that might have already been tainted by prosecutorial misconduct ?
Put another way :
Should we run the risk of wasting millions of taxpayer dollars trying to get convictions on cases that are likely to be overturned on appeal ?
John Archibald and The Birmingham News crowd do n't want to acknowledge it , but these are the kinds of hard questions the corrupt Bush Justice Department is leaving behind .
EU military space policy could lead to expensive ' Star Wars ' arms drive , say experts
Space policy is a ' priority ' for French President Nicolas Sarkozy
The European Union is pursuing a secretive military space policy which could lead to a costly ' Star Wars ' arms drive , a report warned yesterday .
It accused Brussels of using the European Space Agency to develop technologies - including a multimillion - pound EU Satellite Centre in Spain - for use by military as well as civilian authorities .
The Transnational Institute , a Dutch think - tank , said : ' EU - financed communication and spy satellites are slowly becoming reality and in the long term the inclusion of space - based missile defence and other more offensive uses of space are real options for an increasingly ambitious EU military space policy . '
Next week , ministers from all ESA member states will meet in The Hague to implement a new European space policy which identifies military ' security ' as a priority .
A driving force behind the switch in policy is President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , which holds the European presidency until December 31 .
In July , he said the space agenda was one of his priorities .
The think - tank report also said French ambitions for the militarisation of space have caused rows with Britain - particularly over Galileo , the much - delayed European global positioning system .
The proposed European Galileo satellite now appears highly militarised
Galileo would be vital in any European deployment of the sort of GPS - guided artillery now being used by the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Report author Frank Slijper , an economist and arms trade specialist , wrote : ' While Galileo is generally presented as a genuinely civilian programme , it now appears highly militarised .
' The public denial of these important capabilities shows how much Brussels and many European capitals are afraid to tell the public that Galileo is to become an extremely important tool in future warfare by European military forces . '
Several high profile Twitter accounts were recently hijacked :
An 18 - year - old hacker with a history of celebrity pranks has admitted to Monday 's hijacking of multiple high - profile Twitter accounts , including President - Elect Barack Obama's , and the official feed for Fox News .
The hacker , who goes by the handle GMZ , told Threat Level on Tuesday he gained entry to Twitter 's administrative control panel by pointing an automated password - guesser at a popular user 's account .
The user turned out to be a member of Twitter 's support staff , who'd chosen the weak password " happiness . "
Cracking the site was easy , because Twitter allowed an unlimited number of rapid - fire log - in attempts .
" I feel it 's another case of administrators not putting forth effort toward one of the most obvious and overused security flaws , " he wrote in an IM interview .
" I 'm sure they find it difficult to admit it . "
If you 're a moderator or administrator it is especially negligent to have such an easily guessed password .
But the real issue here is the way Twitter allowed unlimited , as - fast - as - possible login attempts .
Given the average user 's password choices -- as documented by Bruce Schneier 's analysis of 34,000 actual MySpace passwords captured from a phishing attack in late 2006 -- this is a pretty scary scenario .
Based on this data , the average MySpace user has an 8 character alphanumeric password .
Which is n't great , but does n't sound too bad .
That is , until you find out that 28 percent of those alphanumerics were all lowercase with a single final digit -- and two - thirds of the time that final digit was 1 !
Yes , brute force attacks are still for dummies .
Even the typically terrible MySpace password -- eight character all lowercase , ending in 1 , would require around 8 billion login attempts :
26 x 26 x 26 x 26 x 26 x 26 x 26 x 1 = 8,031,810,176
At one attempt per second , that would take more than 250 years .
Per user !
But a dictionary attack , like the one used in the Twitter hack ?
Well , that 's another story .
The entire Oxford English Dictionary contains around 171,000 words .
As you might imagine , the average person only uses a tiny fraction of those words , by some estimates somewhere between 10 and 40 thousand .
At one attempt per second , we could try every word in the Oxford English Dictionary in slightly less than two days .
Clearly , the last thing you want to do is give attackers carte blanche to run unlimited login attempts .
All it takes is one user with a weak password to provide attackers a toehold in your system .
In Twitter 's case , the attackers really hit the jackpot : the user with the weakest password happened to be a member of the Twitter administrative staff .
Limiting the number of login attempts per user is security 101 .
If you do n't do this , you 're practically setting out a welcome mat for anyone to launch a dictionary attack on your site , an attack that gets statistically more effective every day the more users you attract .
In some systems , your account can get locked out if you try and fail to log in a certain number of times in a row .
This can lead to denial of service attacks , however , and is generally discouraged .
It 's more typical for each failed login attempt to take longer and longer , like so :
1st failed login no delay 2nd failed login 2 sec delay 3rd failed login 4 sec delay 4th failed login 8 sec delay 5th failed login 16 sec delay
And so on .
Alternately , you could display a CAPTCHA after the fourth attempt .
There are endless variations of this technique , but the net effect is the same : attackers can only try a handful of passwords each day .
A brute force attack is out of the question , and a broad dictionary attack becomes impractical , at least in any kind of human time .
It 's tempting to blame Twitter here , but honestly , I 'm not sure they 're alone .
I forget my passwords a lot .
I 've made at least five or six attempts to guess my password on multiple websites and I can't recall ever experiencing any sort of calculated delay or account lockouts .
I 'm reasonably sure the big commercial sites have this mostly figured out .
But since every rinky - dink website on the planet demands that I create unique credentials especially for them , any of them could be vulnerable .
You better hope they 're all smart enough to throttle failed logins -- and that you 're careful to use unique credentials on every single website you visit .
Maybe this was less of a problem in the bad old days of modems , as there were severe physical limits on how fast data could be transmitted to a website , and how quickly that website could respond .
But today , we have the one - two punch of naive websites running on blazing fast hardware , and users with speedy broadband connections .
Under these conditions , I could see attackers regularly achieving up to two password attempts per second .
If you thought of dictionary attacks as mostly a desktop phenomenon , perhaps it 's time to revisit that assumption .
As Twitter illustrates , the web now offers ripe conditions for dictionary attacks .
I urge you to test your website , or any websites you use -- and make sure they all have some form of failed login throttling in place .

It does n’t take much to go from " bad " to " really bad " when government gets involved .
This is especially true when those in power have the philosophy that , " If it ’s broken , government can fix it . "
Unfortunately , far too often government tries to force itself into problem situations with good intentions that have disastrous consequences .
Because many times these consequences are n’t immediate , government officials and the voters who elect them to office do n’t learn from these mistakes .
At one of my favorite blogs for economics , Greg Mankiw , an economics professor at Harvard , has posted this graph of government revenue as a percent of GDP :
Mankiw makes note of the exponential growth of government from 1929 to 1945 .
" It is easy to understand why the size of government grew so much during this period :
It was responding to the crises of the Great Depression and , especially , World War II , " says Mankiw .
" But what is noteworthy is that while these crises were transitory , the increase in the scope of government was permanent . "
The problem Mankiw highlights is that while our economic problems come and go , government " fixes " have a nasty habit of hanging around :
" This historical episode is one reason why advocates of limited government are rightly worried about the fiscal stimulus package that the incoming administration is going to propose .
Rahm Emanuel , the new White House chief of staff , is reported to have said , ‘ You do n’t ever want to let a crisis go to waste :
It ’s an opportunity to do important things that you would otherwise avoid . ’
It is not entirely clear what he meant by this .
But one interpretation is that he is going to use a temporary crisis as an excuse to engineer a permanent increase in the size of government . "
Government programs are like your crazy uncle who always overstays his holiday visit .
Except , imagine this uncle is constantly drunk , acts without much thought , and wrecks everything he touches .
Yet , we keep inviting him back , year after year .
In his concluding remarks , Mankiw asks : " Five or ten years from now , when the economy is presumably at some normal level of employment and growth , what will the federal budget look like , as evaluated by deficit and tax revenue as a share of GDP ? "
I hate to find out the answer to that .
The problem is not one of being pragmatic , but one of philosophy .
The relationship between government intervention and the ensuing disastrous consquences is about as predictable as the Law of Gravity .
You drop a rock , and it falls .
Government intervenes , and the economy suffers .
But as far as philosophy , Democrats have never had any problem to getting involved in economic affairs , and Republicans appear to be heading full - steam in that direction .
During his 2008 presidential campaign , Sen. John McCain never once expressed a genuine opposition to keeping the government out of the economy .
He only opposed it when it was obvious that it was n’t going to work .
When it looked like government had a chance to fix the financial industry , he called off his campaign to run to Washington to help ensure government acted hastily .
Sarah Palin still has n’t figured out if the bailouts are a good idea .
The problem we face when we try to look at each individual situation from a pragmatic point - of - view is that it is easy to become persuaded by the propaganda or swept up in the hysteria surrounding these crises .
After all , if there is one thing government is good at , it ’s making a mountain out of a molehill .
However , a philosophical opposition will at least throw the brakes on any government plan to get involved in the economy .
If we really have any desire for economic prosperity in the future , it is crucial that we not only become pragmatically opposed to government intervention in the market , but also philosophically opposed to such practices .

For a medium that lets us chainsaw faces off , punch presidents in their plums and slaughter endangered species , it 's amazing how sensitive some of us get when developers do things we do n't agree with .
Certainly there 's been many decisions to get us overly worked up about , whether it 's Killzone 2's ' target footage ' or Shigsy shedding that last bit of lingering dignity by playing Wii Music like a diminutive Japanese John Williams .
That ’s why we ’ve taken a retrospective look at some of the industry ’s biggest controversies from the last decade and tell you why they were n’t such a big deal after all .
Why it caused such a stink
Coming off the back of two fairly dark 3D adventures in Ocarina of Time and Majora ’s Mask , Wind Waker ’s whimsical cartoon looks were a thematic and tonal sea change from what had come before .
Nintendo also had fans clamouring for a realistic Zelda a year prior to Link 's cel - shaded adventure being revealed , with the footage they showed at the 2000 Space World event depicting a Twilight Princess - esque Link squaring off against Ganondorf .
Above : Making fanboys mess their pants since Space World 2000
Journalists and gamers alike worried the new art direction was a sign that Nintendo were trying to dumb down Zelda by making it more accessible to all ages – talk about a dark omen of things to come .
Miyamoto even had to defend the game before its release , saying people should n’t judge it on graphics until they ’d played it at 2002 ’s E3 .
Why it really was n’t a big deal
Despite wags dubbing the game ‘ Celda ’ , the disarming art style merely gave an already timeless series an image that was even more durable .
Wind Waker was classic Zelda at its heart and fears the game had been dumbed - down were wide of the mark .
Granted , the sailing was a bit boring .
But the charming characters and setting , combined with Zelda ’s trademark ingenious dungeon design , ensured the Gamecube ’s first foray into the world of form - fitting elf tunics would be remembered as one of the best entries in the series .

Why it caused such a stink
Skewering Hitler ’s finest with a bayonet .
Fine .
But killing some little alien bug things in the house of God ?
Now that really is crossing a line .
Enter Resistance : Fall of Man ’s brief fight through Manchester Cathedral and one spectacularly brassed off Church of England .
Not only did they take issue with all the alien blasting , but they were n’t too pleased Sony had recreated a near photo realistic depiction of the interior of the building without their permission .
The Dean of the Cathedral branded it " virtual desecration " and called the Japanese giant irresponsible for basing a section of the game in a city that has struggled with gun violence over recent years .
Above :
The Cathedral ’s newest parishioners did n’t take too kindly to the holy water
The British press then jumped on the misinformed bandwagon , with the Times Online proclaiming : ' The new PlayStation 3 game , which has sold more than one million copies , sees a virtual shoot - out between rival gunmen with hundreds killed during a battle inside the cathedral . '
Officials from the Cathedral consulted their holy lawyers and urged Sony to pledge some of the profits from the game to charities concerned with gun crime .
Why it really was n’t a big deal
Defense Secretary Robert Gates suggested on Tuesday that he was open to allowing the media to photograph the flag - draped coffins of fallen soldiers as their bodies and remains are returned to the United States .
" If the needs of the families can be met and the privacy concerns can be addressed , the more honor we can accord these fallen heroes , the better , " Mr. Gates told reporters .
He said he was ordering a review of the military policy that bars photographers from taking pictures of the return of the coffins , most of which are coming from Iraq and Afghanistan and go through Dover Air Force Base in Delaware .
He also set a " short deadline " for a decision .
The military has said the policy is meant to protect the privacy of the families of the dead soldiers and maintain dignity .
But skeptics , who include some families as well as opponents of the war in Iraq , say that the bodies in the returning coffins are not publicly identified , so privacy is not an issue , and that barring photographers is a political maneuver meant to sanitize the war .
The policy was put into place in 1991 during the first Gulf war and was renewed by the Bush administration as recently as a year ago when , Mr. Gates said , he raised the possibility of changing it .
He said he was told -- he did not say by whom -- that allowing photographers would put undue pressure on families to go to Dover themselves and that in some cases that would be a hardship .
Now that the competitive scrap between Nvidia and Intel is officially out in the open , Intel has decided to unashamedly dish the dirt on Nvidia ’s Ion platform .has seen a document that Intel is sending out called " Nvidia Ion Competitive Positioning Guide , " which details what Intel sees as the shortcomings of Nvidia ’s pint sized PC platform .
The first point that Intel makes about Ion is that the chipset is nothing new , saying that it ’s " rather a SKU of the existing MCP79M / MCP7A chipset family ( branded in part as GeForce 9400 M , GeForce 9400 , GeForce 9300 , GeForce 9100M G or GeForce 8200M G. "
Intel points out that " despite Nvidia ’s continued execution and power problems with this chipset , Nvidia is partnering the same chipset with an Intel Atom processor and creating hype around what it calls the ' Ion Platform ' .
" A major problem here , according to Intel , is that Nvidia is " attempting to re-use an integrated graphics chipset designed for the notebook and desktop system price points into the netbook and nettop system price points .
This in turn leads to higher costs as well as high power consumption , " says the company .
Intel also claims that Nvidia has overstated the amount of interest in Ion from PC builders , saying that " Nvidia claims that many OEMs are exploring the Ion , but as of this writing , no customer has publicly disclosed plans to design Ion - based products . "
The document also quotes a number of tech sites who have detailed Nvidia ’s chipset manufacturing issues , as well as those who have criticised the Ion ’s power consumption and performance .
As well as this , Intel has also taken Nvidia ’s claims about the Ion ’s benefits over Intel ’s own Atom platforms .
In response to Nvidia ’s claims about HD video decoding , Intel says that " Intel offers full Hi-Def video decode with HW acceleration with the off - roadmap Mobile Intel GN40 Express Chipset . "
The company also refers to an article on the Tech Report , saying that " Preliminary press reviews indicate Nvidia ’s Ion HD playback may not be as good as Nvidia claims .
" Intel also claims that its own Atom platform will have longer battery life than an Ion - based system , quoting a comparative TDP of 8W against Ion ’s 15.5W .
Finally , to combat Nvidia ’s claims that the Ion has superior video transcoding and gaming abilities , Intel simply says that " neither gaming nor video transcoding are relevant to netbook and nettop users .
"
In closing , Intel says : " Do n’t buy the hype around Nvidia Ion — it offers no advantages that an Intel platform cannot provide relevant to the Netbook and Nettop market segments . "
The company also claims that the forthcoming introduction of its new netbook and nettop platforms at the end of this year will mean that " the window of opportunity for Ion is very short .
"
Of course , you could also argue that Intel ’s current Atom chipset is derived from its ageing 945 chipset , which makes the first argument a little redundant .
However , Intel is clearly feeling threatened by Nvidia ’s Ion platform if it feels the need to produce propaganda such as this .
Is there a need for HD transcoding and gaming features on netbooks and nettops , or is Intel right to dismiss these features ?
Let us know your thoughts about Intel ’s claims in the forum

Black Friday Consumer Technology U.S. Retail Sales Experience First - Ever Decline
Changing Retail Landscape Heavily Influences Sales
Port Washington , NY , December 9 , 2008 – U.S. consumer technology * brick and mortar sales experienced the first - ever decline during the week of Black Friday .
Revenue was down more than 8 percent from November 23 through November 29 , 2008 compared to the same time period last year , according to NPD ’s weekly tracking service **.
This , however , did n’t come unexpectedly .
The consumer technology retail landscape underwent some major changes , for example , with Tweeter shutting its doors and Circuit City filing for bankruptcy .
Discounting was generally considered to be much lower this year , aside from Black Friday doorbuster deals on TVs .
There was also a greater emphasis on e-commerce and less exciting product selection which played into weaker sales .
There were some bright spots for the industry .
Notebook PC unit growth increased almost 19 percent and revenue was up 8 percent .
LCD TVs above 30 ” grew 18 percent in units and 9 percent in dollars .
There were several other categories which saw unit growth , such as GPS , plasma TVs , and digital picture frames , but saw declines in revenue due to aggressive declines in average selling prices versus last year which did not generate sufficient unit demand .
“ While a weakening economy and overall changes to the consumer technology industry had an impact on Black Friday sales , what we saw is most likely not a one - time reaction to circumstances , but rather the beginning of a change in the overall concept of Black Friday , ” said Stephen Baker , vice president of industry analysis at NPD .
“ This year there were no blowout sales to attract consumers .
Instead of being a kick - off to the holiday season , the deals mimicked a typical weekend sale , not what consumers have been used to in prior years .
As consumers ’ shopping options grow , Black Friday may become less of a barometer for the holiday shopping season and more of a showcase of retailers ’ holiday intentions . ”
Consumer Technology Black Friday Year - Over - Year Revenue and Growth 2005 2006 2007 2008 $ 1.87 billion 2.09 billion $ 2.21 billion $ 2.03 billion 15.4 % 11.8 % 6.1 % - 8.4 % Source : The NPD Group / Weekly Tracking Service
* Consumer Technology sales include IT , imaging , audio , video , and consumables .
** NPD ’s weekly POS information is derived from a subset panel of retailers that also contribute to NPD ’s projected monthly POS panel .

Georgia ’s President Mikheil Saakashvili is involved in high level negotiations with members of the United States government on the construction of American military bases in the South Caucasian country , according to a representative of a Georgian opposition party .
Nestan Kirtadze , of the Georgian Labour Party , said last week that President Saakashvili is offering Washington thousands of hectares of land rent free on which to build military bases .
Mrs Kirtadze appealed to American planners and policy - makers not to turn Georgia into a theatre for confrontation between the two superpowers – a reference to US - Russia rivalry in the former Soviet republic .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The accusation made by Mrs Kirtadze will fuel suspicions in the Kremlin that the US is intent on encircling Russia .
It will also provide an opportunity for Russian hawks to argue to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that the Russian army should have toppled the government of President Saakashivili during the war in South Ossetia last year , and that something still needs to be done about the staunchly pro-Western Georgian leader .
Discussions concerning American bases in Georgia will also bring to the surface again the possibility of Washington launching pre-emptive air strikes against Iran .
Last year Russia ’s envoy to Nato , Dmitri Rogozin , argued that the US wants to use the strategically - placed Caucasus country as a base for military operations against the Islamic republic .
Focus will soon shift to incoming US President Barack Obama regarding Washington ’s stance on Georgia and Iran .
He has repeatedly called for accession to Nato for Ukraine and Georgia , referring to Russia as a “ 21st century superpower ” behaving like a “ 20th century dictatorship ” .
When Russian tanks were on the outskirts of Tbilisi last year , vice president - elect Joseph Biden was the first US politician to visit Georgia and express support for the country ’s leadership .
On the subject of Iran , Mr Obama has given mixed messages about what approach the US should adopt .
In 2004 he appeared to imply that he would support military action against Iran as a last resort but during last year ’s American presidential campaign he said that while no option was “ off the table ” an Obama administration would employ “ tough , direct presidential diplomacy ” with Tehran as the best means “ to make progress ” .

De Jesus had five children , 11 grandchildren , 16 great - grandchildren and six great - great - grandchildren .
She had no need for a mobility scooter — instead she lived on her farm and moved with a walking frame , declining nursing care .
However , due to sight and hearing problems , she could not easiliy recognize her family , including daughter Madalena , 84 , with whom she lived .
She never went to school , and could not write , but one of her children said of her that she never " fell ill , nor took any medication . "
She became the world 's oldest person after the November 26 death of American Edna Parker , who was 115 years and 220 days old .
Her position as the world 's oldest person has now been taken by American Gertrude Baines , 114 .

Over the moon :
The lunar spectacle that was bigger and brighter than ever ( even though most of us missed it )
If the shortening days were getting you down , last night 's amazing full moon was sure to raise the spirits .
It appeared 14 per cent bigger than usual and a stunning 30 per cent brighter thanks to a rare , natural coincidence .
But Star gazers in most of Britain had to work to catch a glimpse of the spectacular phenomenon , though , because of cloud cover .
A jet takes off from Dallas - Fort Worth International Airport as the enlarged full moon rises in the background
Each month the moon orbits the Earth and last night it skimmed by at its closest distance for the last 15 years .
The moon passed a mere 356,613 km away from us - 28,000 km closer than normal .
The 15 - year spectacular occurred as the moon 's perigee - the closest point that it passes Earth - coincided with the full moon .
The Met Office 's Andy Hobson had warned : ' There 's a good chance that people will miss it as most of the country has a band of rain over it . '
' There 's a chance they could see it , most likely in the north of Scotland . '
He said the early birds had the best chances of catching the moon at its best .
' The sky clears up in the West , in Wales , the South West of England and in Ireland . '

Most parts were too cloudy

If bad weather did cloud your view , moongazers will have to wait for another eight years - until November 14 , 2016 - for the next close encounter .
The closeness of the moon last night also had an effect on tides , dragging the high - water mark up another 2in .
Thanks to its increased proximity , it exerted an even greater pull than the usual full moon .
But the Environment Agency said that it was not expecting the unusual tides to cause any significant problems around the British coastline .

' The risk of tidal flooding is still low , ' a spokesman said .
' But there are 31 flood watches in place .
This is to do with rain rather than any lunar effects . '
A total of 15 watches were in place in the north - west of England , nine in the Midlands , and seven in the Thames area .
With the approach of the winter solstice on December 21 , combined with the current tilt of the Earth , the moon climbed to its highest point in the night 's sky for the entire year .
Phenomenon :
The moon rises behind bride Kailey Wilson in Alberta , Canada

And the phenomenon coincided with the annual Geminid meteor shower which begins last night and continues for two days .
The ' shooting stars ' appear from the constellation Gemini but can be seen all over the sky - although stargazers are recommended to look away because of the brightness of the moon .
It is probably the extinct hulk of a comet 's nucleus which released the Geminids meteoroids during its active phase some 4,000 or more years ago .
The Geminids ' splendour , though , might have been slightly dimmed by the huge , bright moon .

He 'll have a lot too be proud of and he can start by his mother and father being very proud of him ... and we always will be .
Wallace :
You said there earlier there are some things he could fairly be criticized for .
Would you like to tell me any of those ?
Bush : " No .

Microsoft Marketing Strategy : Why Bill Was Better Than Steve
Microsoft
This article will not beat about the bush , mentioning what Steve Ballmer Does n’t have that Bill Gates had in terms of marketing but rather a bitter truth about the difference between their marketing strategies .
Two persons can neither be same nor think in exactly the same way .
Thus there is going to be a difference between the two persons .
The computer industry focused on hardware in the early 1970s .
This was the era when the software was given less importance and the PC software did not exist at all .
It was Bill Gates and Paul Allen who had a vision of making the software reign supreme to make the personal computers an all purpose machine .
In fact Bill Gates and Paul Allen wanted to build software industry when it never existed and by 1990 not only did the software industry exist but Microsoft became the undisputed leader of the software revolution .
The margin of profit in the software industry was huge in comparison to that of hardware .
Moreover the competition in the software industry was not as intense as that in the hardware industry .
Microsoft grew to be valued over $ 7 billion with the gross income going over $ 1 billion annually .
The personal worth of Bill Gates was more than $ 2 billion but this sky rocketed to $ 7 billion in 1992 making him the richest person in the USA .
The profits of the company stood at $ 7.79 billion in 1999 while its work force was more than 31,000 .
The growth slowed down in the year 2000 .
This was because of anti-trust proceedings and heavy spending on the Research and Development .
It was in this year of 2000 that Steve Ballmer came into limelight by being appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft .
Steve Ballmer joined the Microsoft in 1980 .
Bill Gates hired him as the first business manager at Microsoft .
He has headed nearly all the Microsoft division including operating systems developments , operation , support and sales .
He was made the president of the company in 1998 but promoted to CEO in 2000 .
There are basically two views about the comparison of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer .
With reference to marketing some say that Bill Gates was better while some say that Steve Ballmer is better .
Some even go to the extent of saying that Steve Ballmer has always played a second fiddle to Bill Gates and that is why he is the current CEO of Microsoft .
What either one lacks depends on one ’s own perception .
Some say that the marketing style of Bill Gates was of persuasion and analysis style .
On the contrary the marketing style of Steve Ballmer has been of the arrogant and crazy style .
This view is correct to some extent because Steve Ballmer has been very aggressive at taking over Yahoo .
Microsoft headed by Bill Gates has been known to practice the principle of being genuine , effective and powerful by the strategy of “ embracing and extending . ”
All through those years Microsoft was known to be Humble but dangerous .
On the other hand there are some who do not line the aggressive taking over strategy of Steve Ballmer .
Steve Ballmer strictly believes and sticks to the discipline of organizational management .
Bill Gates has given a free rein to Steve Blamer to handle the Microsoft in what ever manner Steve Ballmer wants .
Steve Ballmer has the right to handle the sales , finance , marketing products and the strategic planning as he wants .
With Steve Ballmer as the captain of the Microsoft ship , a new era has begun .
Microsoft is undergoing reconstruction .
While Bill Gates was a visionary founder , Steve Ballmer is proving himself to be a perfect leader .
He is aiming at a long lasting company .
The new mission of Microsoft as announced by Steve Ballmer focuses on enabling people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential .
This mission and its scope are far beyond the realms of what Bill Gates has thought .
This is the first time that Microsoft does not just harp about technology .
This mission is about overall marketing aimed at improving the relationships with the customers and others in the industry .
Steve Ballmer wants the employees of Microsoft to act on these principles and this mission .
Steve Ballmer seems to have struck the heart of marketing by targeting to bridge the gap between the sales and product development divisions of the company .
Ballmer has broken from the traditional practices of Microsoft by empowering the second tier of executives to run their businesses with less of supervision .
Earlier during the reign of Bill Gates each and every important decision was being taken by either Bill Gates himself or Steve Ballmer .
He has ordered the sales force , engineers , and the mangers to improve the quality of the services and products to get rid of the frustration of corporate customers .
Ballmer is bringing drastic changes in the way decision is taken .
The employees now have to provide feedback to Microsoft though reporting that includes grading of the supervisors , ranking and filing the employers and even the accounting system for managers .
This helps in weighing trade offs and quantifying the contributions of each employee in the organization .
This also helps in taking decisions faster .
Now the corporate values are a part of the annual performance review of every employee .
Ballmer has put a lot of stress on regain the trust of the industry and customers .
According to him the integrity , honesty and respect must be exhibited through partners , customers and the overall industry .
The basic difference between Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates is exhibited by the former being obsessive about understanding each and every detail of the business such as all the details of sales , costs and marketing and each and every factor affecting it .
Ballmer wants his employees to be accountable and respectful to each other as well as outsiders .
One thing that is not liked by people is Ballmer ’s tendency to get rid of people who he thinks do not fit in the organization .
Some of the employees find him liberating but for some a tough boss .
Ballmer has made the factor of customer trust and customer complains the prime concern in the company , which in a long run is good .

Kirsten Brydum pedaled away from the Howlin ’
Wolf club into the darkness of another American city that she did n’t know very well .
It was 1:30 a.m .
She rode a black cruiser bicycle with a basket on the back , borrowed from friends of friends .
In nearly every city she had visited on her 2 - month - road trip , it seemed someone was willing to lend her an old bike .
The Rebirth Brass Band was on the bill that night .
Brydum , 25 , had danced for a while outside the club in her flip - flops .
She thought that the bouncer would eventually let her in for free , and that suited her in more ways than one .
She believed , passionately , that people would one day reject a basic mechanism of free - market societies : the exchange of goods and services for money .
She arrived in New Orleans in late September with a rail pass , a little red notebook and a head full of ideas about the oppressive forces of capitalism and government , and how they might be replaced with something better .
The road trip was partly a rite of passage in the grand tradition of Jack Kerouac -- an adventure to mark her recent graduation from college in San Francisco .
But she also hoped to report on the small , scattered outposts where fellow radicals had established alternatives to mainstream culture .

It would all end in New Orleans , four miles from the Howlin ’ Wolf , in a forlorn and out - of - the - way block in the 9th Ward .
More than three years after Hurricane Katrina , its homes remained battered and abandoned , its lots choked with debris and roof - high weeds .
To many Americans , this kind of New Orleans neighborhood has come to symbolize a near - criminal lack of government presence .
Brydum might have seen the block as the kind of place where an autonomous , post - capitalist movement might flourish .
But it is unclear if she saw it at all .

She had some cash saved from waiting tables ; her mom helped with some of the travel expenses .
Brydum and an old boyfriend drew up the list of places she would visit : alternative health centers , collectivist punk communes , anarchist bookstores and “ guerrilla gardens ” planted by activists on land they do not own .
Her plan was to document on a website what she found , allowing radicals to share ideas and strengthen tiny institutions that she believed would “ prefigure a world without capitalism . ”
On July 30 , she flew to New York City , where she met her boyfriend , John Viola .
In an e-mail to friends and family , she rhapsodized about their four days of “ romance and resistance . ”
Viola , a Bay Area attorney , met Brydum when he agreed to take on her 2004 criminal case .
She and a few dozen others had been arrested at a San Francisco biotechnology and anti-globalization protest .
By the time he got involved , the activists had been jailed for a couple of days , and the stress was beginning to show .

“ And there was Kirsten , just super rock solid , ” recalled Viola , 38 .
“ Like a lot of people , I just immediately fell for her . ”
She was small and fine - boned , with long hair and brown eyes .
After he won her release , they would see each other at the same parties , the same protests .
In March , they met at an impromptu procession through the streets of the Mission District that had started at the Anarchist Cafe , on Potrero Avenue .
“ I was in the back with Kirsten , and people in cars kept coming up to us and saying , ‘ What ’s the procession for ? ’ ” Viola recalled .
“ It ’s for fun , ” Brydum would tell them , smiling .

She grew up middle class in Van Nuys -- sweet - tempered , well - liked , a good student .
But from an early age , she questioned accepted wisdom .
At her Catholic elementary school , she challenged the religious dogma ; her ideas , she later joked , got her branded “ a third - grade heretic . ”
At Birmingham High School , she gravitated toward the punk - rock kids , the black - clad , the ravers and the seekers .
At the now - defunct New College of California , where she earned her bachelor ’s degree , she immersed herself in contrarian thinkers , particularly the anarchists : Emma Goldman , imprisoned by U.S. authorities for opposing the draft in 1917 ; David Graeber , the anthropologist who studied the egalitarian communities of northwest Madagascar ; and Hakim Bey , a scholar who extolled history ’s “ pirate utopias , ” which operated beyond the grasp of governments .
Central to her thinking : “ She did n’t believe that we lived in a world of scarcity , ” Viola said .
“ That scarcity was a myth that was used to keep people divided .
And so if resources and goods are taken care of and shared equitably , then there ’s enough for everybody . ”

In San Francisco , she put the idea into practice .
She helped found a series of fine - dining events .
Patrons were not required to pay .
In Dolores Park , she cofounded a “ Really Really Free Market , ” where people gathered to give things away .
“ Because there is enough for everyone , ” the slogan read .
“ Because sharing is more fulfilling than owning . ”
She was a utopian , Viola said , but not naive .
He had seen her street smarts .
Still , as she prepared to leave New York and set out on her own , he was concerned .
“ She was very aware of the risks , ” he recalled .
“ She said , ‘ If anything should happen to me on the trip , if I should ever be killed on the trip , I accept that . ’ ”

The e-mail messages home traced her path .
From New York , she rode the train to Philadelphia .
There , she wrote , she met up with “ a small activist scene living in the cracks of a neglected and impoverished neighborhood .
. . .
We borrowed bikes and rode all over town , visited the urban farm , danced at a benefit for Critical Resistance ” -- a group that advocates the eradication of prisons -- “ cruised a free store / vegan potluck barbeque / folk show in the basement . ”
In Providence , R.I. , she stayed in a friend ’s apartment without electricity , noting , on her trips around town , the “ gorgeous empty mills that seem to be opening up for more creative endeavors as the condo wave recedes . ”
In Boston , she networked at a regional anarchists ’ meeting .
In Buffalo , she met up with a friend who calls herself Hannah Potassium .
The pair rode bikes everywhere .

“ She showed me the greener side of the Rustbelt city : rivers , lakes and gardens , ” Brydum wrote .
“ We found a well - organized housing co-op with beautiful interiors and were invited to come back for dinner .
At midnight , I hopped on a Greyhound to Detroit not knowing where to go or what to do when I arrive .
. . . “
She was shocked by Detroit ’s vast landscape of blight .
The broken city seemed to support her ideas about the folly of capitalism .
But she was also troubled that people had to live there .
“ Sure , there ’s some romanticizing of a place like this : a post - industrial workless wonderland free for the taking , ripe with opportunities to create a pirate utopia , ” she wrote .
“ But in reality , the scene was sad .
Some people do still live in Detroit , and the few that I met from the activist scene were bitter and burned out .
It ’s hard to create the world you wish to see when there are no resources , few comrades to inspire , and no spare energy . ”
By early September , she was in St. Paul , Minn. , for the Republican National Convention , among the thousands of activists who protested President Bush , the Iraq war , and the neglect of the needy , chanting : “ Stop the war on the poor ! ”

More cities followed : St. Louis ; Kansas City , Mo. ; Madison , Wis. , and Chicago .
She found a ride from the Midwest to North Carolina on Craigs - list .
But the driver changed plans abruptly and left her in downtown Indianapolis .
She eventually hooked up with another stranger who drove her .
Then it was on to New Orleans , on Amtrak ’s Crescent line .
“ I do n’t really know what to expect , ” she wrote . " . . .
The sun is setting on the bayou - licked lands and I am truly fortunate .
I have rounded this beautiful Southeast corner on the Crescent line today and from now on I am westward bound . ”

She rolled into town with a reservation of sorts at a punk - rock group house in the 9th Ward .
They were friends of friends , white kids in a black neighborhood .
Some dumpster - dived for food .
Some were artists and musicians , and some hopped trains .
Some had volunteered to help rebuild the city .
Julia Milan , a 22 - year - old resident of the house , remembers the impression Brydum made when she came in from the Amtrak station .
She wore a pink sundress with a pink ribbon around her waist .
“ She was so cute , ” Milan said , but not meek .
“ She looked very driven . ”
Brydum had talked to her friends about making sense of New Orleans , and looking for radicals working for solutions amid the post - Katrina ruins .
Since the storm , the city -- long a magnet for escapists and hipsters -- had also been attracting a new kind of itinerant idealist .
Advertisement
Some came to work for nonprofits or public schools .
Others aligned themselves with activist groups like Common Ground Relief , a nonprofit that set up shop in the Lower 9th Ward , gutting houses , starting community gardens and helping organize residents left homeless .
Many of the newcomers arrived with scant knowledge of the charming but insular city , which , by some measures , is plagued with the nation ’s highest crime rate .
“ We give them overly cautious warnings , ” said Caitlin Reilly , Common Ground ’s volunteer coordinator .
“ We say , ‘ You ’re probably going to be fine , but you should be aware there ’s very high crime , and a high murder rate . ’ ”
But Common Ground was apparently not on Brydum ’s list .

After the brass band show at the Howlin ’
Wolf her second night in town , Viola said , Brydum disappeared .
Her laptop , duffel bag and phone remained at the punk - rock house , and the phone kept ringing .
“ We were kind of worried , because she did n’t seem like a party kid , ” Milan said .
“ The second day , we started to get scared . ”
Her body had been found by a church group gutting houses in the 9th Ward ; it was lying unidentified in the morgue .
Brydum had been shot four times in the face .
New Orleans police detectives began their search for a killer , but have thus far had no luck .
Advertisement
When the news reached the Bay Area , some of her fellow activists wondered if there had been a conspiracy .
Some suspected the CIA .
“ Kirsten ’s death looks more like a hit job rather than a random act of murder , ” someone called SF Activist commented on one blog , one of a number of similar comments .
“ New Orleans is still a militarized zone and it ’s quite possible she was targeted by hired guns . ”
New Orleanians tended to respond to such comments with a weary disbelief .
“ Hired guns ? ! ” a respondent named Sterno wrote after an essay on xavierthoughts.blogspot.com .
“ Every murder here in New Orleans looks like a ‘ hit job ’ , mainly because our criminals are professionals . ”
Advertisement
Viola , the boyfriend , flew to New Orleans to meet with homicide detectives .
He held meetings with anti-violence activists and a few young radicals .
With his encouragement , they established a system that provides escorts to anyone who feels uncomfortable biking alone at night .
Brydum ’s mother , Mamie Page , always respected Kirsten ’s ideas and ideals , even when she did n’t share them .
In an e-mail message , she said her younger daughter told her that Kirsten “ would have been more about forgiveness than punishment for this crime , and focusing more on the issue of violence against women and rehabilitating the criminal . ”
“ I ca n’t get my brain around that one , ” said Page , a paralegal living in Portland , Ore .
“ For obvious reasons . ”

Other family members noted , with a disgusted irony , that the killer may have been covering up a robbery .
Brydum ’s bag and bicycle were not found at the scene .
“ It ’s kind of pathetic , ” said Brydum ’s aunt , Catherine Page - Evans , of Woodland Hills .
“ Of course , she would have given it to them . ”

The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most powerful interest groups in Washington -- one that has rarely shied away from wielding its influence with Congress and the FDA .
But are the industry 's lobbying efforts always good for business ?
+ Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ( CDER )
The CDER is the division of the FDA responsible for review and approval of new drugs , and for monitoring the safety of new drugs once they 're on the market .
Its Web site offers a brief history of the CDER .
Under the terms of PDUFA , the drug industry agreed to help finance the approval process -- through " user fees " accompanying each new drug application -- in exchange for an FDA promise to speed up its deliberations .
Widely considered one of the most significant pieces of legislation in FDA history , it would effect a remarkable transformation :
In 1992 , it had been taking the FDA an average of 30 months to approve a new drug .
By 1996 , the agency had cut the time nearly in half , to 16 months , prompting outgoing commissioner David Kessler to announce ( accurately ) that " the U.S. is now a world leader in drug review . "
Probably the single most important shift in the FDA of the last decade has been the change in how the agency approves new drugs -- or , more precisely , how quickly it approves new drugs .
In the late 1980s , the pressure to speed up drug approvals was rising .
And it was n't just the drug makers complaining .
It was doctors and patients who were agitating , too , over everything from why the FDA had n't approved the chicken pox vaccine ( even though European nations had approved its use for years ) to why it was n't moving faster on potentially life - saving AIDS treatments -- a grievance that famously led to mass protests outside FDA headquarters in Rockville , Maryland .
These public displays of disaffection , combined with behind - the - scenes lobbying by pharmaceutical manufacturers and their trade groups , finally produced the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ( PDUFA ) of 1992 .
It 's worth keeping that in mind when looking at some of the more recent battles pitting the drug industry against its regulators .
Although drug company executives and representatives speak in genial tones when they talk about the FDA publicly , they have also lobbied to make the agency more docile and business - friendly .
Because the pharmaceutical industry is one of Washington 's most powerful interest groups , many of these efforts have succeeded .
But given the history of pharmaceuticals in America , it 's fair to ask whether , in the long run , these successes will help the drug industry or hurt it -- by undermining the outside watchdog that guarantees the credibility essential to its financial survival .
As we all now know , none of these dreadful consequences ever materialized .
On the contrary , as Philip Hilts recounts in his sweeping history of the Food and Drug Administration , Protecting America 's Health ( 2003 ) , the American pharmaceutical industry not only survived the efforts at regulation during the 20th century , it actually thrived as a result of them .
Every time the government demanded something more of the drug industry -- every time it raised its standards for safety or efficacy -- the industry responded by making better products that enjoyed more consumer confidence , which ultimately meant not just better medicines for patients but bigger profits for the drug companies .
" The regulations and the government shepherding of the drug business did what the free market failed for at least sixty years to do , " Hilts wrote of the 1938 law , although he might well have been writing about any one of the major drug safety acts during the last century .
" It weeded out the brutal , the stupid , and the needless that prevented the pharmaceutical industry from becoming a great engine of discovery and sales . "
The relationship between drug manufacturers and those who would regulate them had not improved much by the 1930s , when Congress was on the verge of passing the first law requiring drug makers to demonstrate that their products were safe before selling them .
The bill , industry groups wrote in a letter , " will put thousands of men and women out of work .
It will close dozens of manufacturing plants and hundreds of stores . …
It will help none . "
And in the 1960s , when Congress was about to pass a law requiring drug companies to demonstrate that drugs were not merely safe but were effective as well , the pharmaceutical industry once again warned of dire consequences -- specifically , that drug prices would rise , innovation would slow , and millions would lose their jobs .
In 1906 , when Congress was about to pass the first federal law to protect food and drug safety , a trade group representing companies that made medicines ( or what passed for them back then ) warned darkly : " Such a law would practically destroy the sale of proprietary remedies in the United States . "
As the new US administration prepares to take office amid grave financial and international crises , it may seem counterintuitive to argue that the very unsettled nature of the international system generates a unique opportunity for creative diplomacy .
That opportunity involves a seeming contradiction .
On one level , the financial collapse represents a major blow to the standing of the United States .
While American political judgments have often proved controversial , the American prescription for a world financial order has generally been unchallenged .
Now disillusionment with the United States ' management of it is widespread .
At the same time , the magnitude of the debacle makes it impossible for the rest of the world to shelter any longer behind American predominance or American failings .
Every country will have to reassess its own contribution to the prevailing crisis .
Each will seek to make itself independent , to the greatest possible degree , of the conditions that produced the collapse ; at the same time , each will be obliged to face the reality that its dilemmas can be mastered only by common action .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Even the most affluent countries will confront shrinking resources .
Each will have to redefine its national priorities .
An international order will emerge if a system of compatible priorities comes into being .
It will fragment disastrously if the various priorities cannot be reconciled .
The nadir of the international financial system coincides with simultaneous political crises around the globe .
Never have so many transformations occurred at the same time in so many different parts of the world and been made accessible via instantaneous communication .
The alternative to a new international order is chaos .
The financial and political crises are , in fact , closely related partly because , during the period of economic exuberance , a gap had opened up between the economic and the political organisation of the world .
The economic world has been globalised .
Its institutions have a global reach and have operated by maxims that assumed a self - regulating global market .
The financial collapse exposed the mirage .
It made evident the absence of global institutions to cushion the shock and to reverse the trend .
Inevitably , when the affected publics turned to their political institutions , these were driven principally by domestic politics , not considerations of world order .
Every major country has attempted to solve its immediate problems essentially on its own and to defer common action to a later , less crisis - driven point .
So - called rescue packages have emerged on a piecemeal national basis , generally by substituting seemingly unlimited governmental credit for the domestic credit that produced the debacle in the first place , so far without achieving more than stemming incipient panic .
International order will not come about either in the political or economic field until there emerge general rules toward which countries can orient themselves .
In the end , the political and economic systems can be harmonised in only one of two ways : by creating an international political regulatory system with the same reach as that of the economic world ; or by shrinking the economic units to a size manageable by existing political structures , which is likely to lead to a new mercantilism , perhaps of regional units .
A new Bretton Woods kind of global agreement is by far the preferable outcome .
America 's role in this enterprise will be decisive .
Paradoxically , American influence will be great in proportion to the modesty in our conduct ; we need to modify the righteousness that has characterised too many American attitudes , especially since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
That event and the subsequent period of nearly uninterrupted global growth induced too many to equate world order with the acceptance of American designs , including our domestic preferences .
The result was a certain inherent unilateralism – the standard complaint of European critics – or else an insistent kind of consultation by which nations were invited to prove their fitness to enter the international system by conforming to American prescriptions .
Not since the inauguration of president John F Kennedy half a century ago has a new administration come into office with such a reservoir of expectations .
It is unprecedented that all the principal actors on the world stage are avowing their desire to undertake the transformations imposed on them by the world crisis in collaboration with the United States .
The extraordinary impact of the President - elect on the imagination of humanity is an important element in shaping a new world order .
But it defines an opportunity , not a policy .
The ultimate challenge is to shape the common concern of most countries and all major ones regarding the economic crisis , together with a common fear of jihadist terrorism , into a strategy reinforced by the realisation that the new issues like proliferation , energy and climate change permit no national or regional solution .
The new administration could make no worse mistake than to rest on its initial popularity .
The role of China in a new world order is crucial .
A relationship that started on both sides as essentially a strategic design to constrain a common adversary has evolved over the decades into a pillar of the international system .
China made possible the American consumption splurge by buying American debt ; America helped the modernisation of the Chinese economy by opening its markets to Chinese goods .
Each side of the Pacific needs the cooperation of the other in addressing the consequences of the financial crisis .
Now that the global financial collapse has devastated Chinese export markets , China is emphasising infrastructure development and domestic consumption .
It will not be easy to shift gears rapidly , and the Chinese growth rate may fall temporarily below the 7.5 per cent that Chinese experts define as the line that challenges political stability .
What kind of global economic order arises will depend importantly on how China and America deal with each other over the next few years .
A frustrated China may take another look at an exclusive regional Asian structure , for which the nucleus already exists in the ASEAN - plus - three concept .
At the same time , if protectionism grows in America or if China comes to be seen as a long - term adversary , a self - fulfilling prophecy may blight the prospects of global order .
Such a return to mercantilism and 19th - century diplomacy would divide the world into competing regional units with dangerous long - term consequences .
The Sino - American relationship needs to be taken to a new level .
This generation of leaders has the opportunity to shape relations into a design for a common destiny , much as was done with trans -Atlantic relations in the postwar period – except that the challenges now are more political and economic than military .
The complexity of the emerging world requires from America a more historical approach than the insistence that every problem has a final solution expressible in programmes with specific time limits not infrequently geared to our political process .
We must learn to operate within the attainable and be prepared to pursue ultimate ends by the accumulation of nuance .
An international order can be permanent only if its participants have a share not only in building but also in securing it .
In this manner , America and its potential partners have a unique opportunity to transform a moment of crisis into a vision of hope .

iTulip.com " Ka-Poom Theory " Chart as originally posted February 1999
iTulip.com Ka-Poom Prediction
National currencies are primarily valued by the relative economic strength among trading partners with floating currencies , except for the U.S. dollar .
A major component of dollar strength is the unique demand for dollars due to the dollar 's reserve currency status .
Dollar demand and thus price is supported by all nations trading with the U.S. and among each other as all need dollars for international exchange , especially for oil .
If dollar reserve currency status declines , either gradually via euro diversification or suddenly due to an event that causes a loss in confidence in the future purchasing power of the dollar , dollar demand and value declines in kind .
U.S. interest rates are low mostly due to demand for U.S. debt , denominated in dollars , from foreign central banks of nations , especially Asian , that seek to keep U.S. consumers borrowing at low interest rates to purchase their exports using strong dollars ; Asian " vendor financing " .
Ka : A random exogenous event ( e.g. , a stock market crash predicted in 1999 for year 2000 and recession predicted for 2001 ) intensifies disinflation created by Asian vendor financing , causing the Fed to shift from bubble fighting to anti-deflation polices .
Fed responds with an excessive cheap money policy , targeting short term rates below the inflation rate .
The Fed keeps interest rates too low for too long , creating a new asset bubble .
But in what ?
We did not know in 1999 .
The answer : real estate .
Poom : A random or not so random exogenous event that has not yet happened ( the stock market crash we predicted for 2000 did not have the impact we expected ) exposes the true level of risk to lenders that is inherent in this unbalanced system , causing lenders to lose confidence in the future purchasing power of the dollar and seek alternative reserve assets .
Interest rates and inflation rise rapidly as dollar demand and value falls , import prices rise , and the Fed moves to raise rates to stem the tide or dollar repatriation .
The first foreign central banks to move will be those with the least exposure to losses in national income from sales of exports to the U.S. or depreciation in the value of the dollars they are holding as reserve assets ( e.g. , France ) .
Not surprisingly , the Fed disagrees : " To sum up , this analysis suggests that there is more to solving the conundrum of the recent low long - term interest rates than pointing to the behavior of official foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities .
Indeed , there is little solid evidence suggesting a persistent relationship between the two .
Furthermore , the structure of the Treasury market does not support the projection of a rapid rate hike in the event that foreign central banks retreat from the U.S. Treasury market . "
The Long-term Interest Rate Conundrum : Not Unraveled Yet ?
The assertion of no persistent relationship exists between low interest rates and foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities contradicts the fact that Central Bank reserve diversification spooks currency traders , and will drive the dollar down , which is in fact finally causing U.S. inflation and interest rates to rise .
The Fed continues to raise rates , but not to fight inflation caused by economic overheating .
The Fed needs to demonstrate anti-inflation vigilance to foreign lenders so they will continue to fuel the foreign capital addicted U.S. speculative financial system , but raises rates at the risk of throwing the real economy into recession .
Unfortunately , it ’s a lose - lose proposition .
Eventually the hikes , either too many or too few -- the Fed never gets it right -- will produce either a enough recession or inflation to spook foreign investors and start the Poom ball rolling .
The mechanism of Ka-Poom Theory proposed in 1999 appears happening , albeit later than we predicted , and slowly versus suddenly .
At least so far .
The resulting inflation is an event 25 years in the making , and will be historic in its extent .

A study last year may lend some credence to the legend .
In “ Praying for Recession : The Business Cycle and Protestant Religiosity in the United States , ” David Beckworth , an assistant professor of economics at Texas State University , looked at long - established trend lines showing the growth of evangelical congregations and the decline of mainline churches and found a more telling detail : During each recession cycle between 1968 and 2004 , the rate of growth in evangelical churches jumped by 50 percent .
By comparison , mainline Protestant churches continued their decline during recessions , though a bit more slowly .
The little - noticed study began receiving attention from some preachers in September , when the stock market began its free fall .
With the swelling attendance they were seeing , and a sense that worldwide calamities come along only once in an evangelist ’s lifetime , the study has encouraged some to think big .
“ I found it very exciting , and I called up that fellow to tell him so , ” said the Rev. Don MacKintosh , a Seventh Day Adventist televangelist in California who contacted Dr. Beckworth a few weeks ago after hearing word of his paper from another preacher .
“ We need to leverage this moment , because every Christian revival in this country ’s history has come off a period of rampant greed and fear .
That ’s what we ’re in today  the time of fear and greed . ”
Frank O’Neill , 54 , a manager who lost his job at Morgan Stanley this year , said the “ humbling experience ” of unemployment made him cast about for a more personal relationship with God than he was able to find in the Catholicism of his youth .
In joining the Shelter Rock Church on Long Island , he said , he found a deeper sense of “ God ’s authority over everything  I feel him walking with me . ”
The sense of historic moment is underscored especially for evangelicals in New York who celebrated the 150th anniversary last year of the Fulton Street Prayer Revival , one of the major religious resurgences in America .
Also known as the Businessmen ’s Revival , it started during the Panic of 1857 with a noon prayer meeting among traders and financiers in Manhattan ’s financial district .
Over the next few years , it led to tens of thousands of conversions in the United States , and inspired the volunteerism movement behind the founding of the Salvation Army , said the Rev. McKenzie Pier , president of the New York City Leadership Center , an evangelical pastors ’ group that marked the anniversary with a three - day conference at the Hilton New York .
“ The conditions of the Businessmen ’s Revival bear great similarities to what ’s going on today , ” he said .
“ People are losing a lot of money . ”
Excessive use of consoles may cause physical problems A new skin disorder caused by use of games consoles has been identified by skin specialists .
The condition , dubbed PlayStation palmar hidradenitis , is described in the British Journal of Dermatology .
Researchers outline the case of a 12 - year - old girl who attended a Swiss hospital with intensely painful sores on the palms of her hands .
The girl , who had been using a games console regularly , recovered fully after 10 days of abstinence .
If you 're worried about soreness on your hands when playing a games console , it might be sensible to give your hands a break from time to time
Nina Goad
British Association of Dermatologists Doctors who examined her at the Geneva University Hospital concluded she had a condition known as ' idiopathic eccrine hidradenitis ' , a skin disorder that generally causes red , sore lumps on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet .
The condition has been previously found on the soles of the feet in children taking part in heavy physical activity , such as jogging .
It is thought to be linked to intense sweating .
Unusual symptoms
For the disorder to only affect the hands is very unusual .
The patient had not participated in any sport or physical exercise recently , and could not recall any recent trauma involving her hands .
However , her parents did say that she had recently started to play a video game on a PlayStation console for several hours a day , and had continued to play even after developing the sores .
The doctors suspect that the problem was caused by tight and continuous grasping of the console 's hand - grips , and repeated pushing of the buttons , alongside sweating caused by the tension of the game .
The researchers said cases of addiction to using games consoles had been recorded , but the symptoms had initially been thought to be psychological .
However , some physical symptoms , such as acute tendonitis , dubbed Wiitis , had begun to emerge .
They said ' PlayStation palmar hidradenitis ' could now be added to the list .
Nina Goad , of the British Association of Dermatologists said : " This is an interesting discovery and one that the researchers are keen to share with other dermatologists , should they be confronted with similar , unexplained symptoms in a patient .
" If you 're worried about soreness on your hands when playing a games console , it might be sensible to give your hands a break from time to time , and do n't play excessively if your hands are prone to sweating . "
A spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd , manufacturers of PlayStation , said : " We firmly believe that video gaming is a legitimate entertainment pastime like watching movies , listening to music , or reading books .
" As with any leisure pursuit there are possible consequences of not following common sense , health advice and guidelines , as can be found within our instruction manuals .
" PlayStation was launched in 1995 and has sold hundreds of millions of consoles over the last 13 years .
" We do not wish to belittle this research and will study the findings with interest .
This is the first time we have ever heard of a complaint of this nature . "

( Adds Ben-Eliezer , Israeli foreign ministry comments )
MADRID , Jan 29 ( Reuters ) - Spain 's High Court will launch a war crimes investigation into seven Israelis , including a former defence minister , over a 2002 attack that killed 14 civilians and a Hamas commander in the Gaza Strip , court papers said .
Spanish law allows the prosecution of foreigners for such crimes as genocide , crimes against humanity and torture committed anywhere in the world .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak called the Gaza legal case " delusional " on Thursday .
The Gaza - based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights is bringing the case against then - Defence Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and six military men , most of whom are now retired from active duty , involved in the decision to drop a one - tonne bomb from an F - 16 plane onto a housing block on July 22 , 2002 .
The blast killed Hamas commander Salah Shehada , but the organisation said it was bringing the case on behalf of only the families of 14 civilians killed , nine of whom were children , and 96 injured .
" If Israel would like to be a civilised nation it will have to accept the rule of law , and the rule of law is not served with a 1,000 - kg bomb , " the Palestinian Centre 's lawyer Gonzalo Boye said .
" I do not justify the actions of Hamas .
I think both parties are guilty .
The only people that are innocent are the civilian victims .
We have excluded from our criminal case that person from Hamas who was the target of the Israeli army . "
Spanish Judge Fernando Andreu 's investigation , which is expected to last several years , was brought after Israel declined to reply to a question from the court last August as to whether the seven would be tried at home .
After hearing the news Ben-Eliezer said the decision was " outrageous " , adding that " terror organisations are using the courts of free nations under the guise of democracy in order to fight those who fight against terrorism . "
He added that Shehada was a " mass murderer responsible for the death of 100 Israelis ... he sent tens of suicide bombers out onto the streets . "
In Tel Aviv , Barak said in a statement he " objected strongly " to the " delusional announcement " by Spain and would vehemently defend the charges .
" UPSIDE - DOWN WORLD "
" Anybody calling the liquidation of a terrorist a ' crime against humanity ' is living in an upside - down world .
All senior personnel in the military establishment acted appropriately , in the name of the state of Israel , through their commitment to ensure the security of Israeli citizens , " Barak said .
The Israeli foreign ministry said its legal department would act as swiftly as possible to cancel the Spanish legal move and would defend all the accused who acted on Israel 's behalf .
A statement said Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni had spoken to her Spanish counterpart Miguel Angel Moratinos on the matter .
Spanish court papers said the bombing killed 15 people , the majority of them children and babies , and injured 150 .
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at the time hailed the air strike as a great success .
Washington described it as heavy - handed and the European Union accused Israel of hurting the chances of a deal to end suicide bombings in Israel .
Boye said the offensive which Israel launched in Gaza on Dec. 27 and killed more than 1,300 Palestinians as Israel sought to end Palestinian rocket attacks , could result in more Spanish prosecutions .
" We may have more work to do .
Israel has demonstrated in recent weeks that it has no respect for human life if they are not ( Israeli ) lives , " he said .
International calls to investigate Israel over alleged war crimes during the latest Gaza conflict have prompted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to promise military personnel state protection from foreign prosecution .

Israeli media reports said the military had been advising its top brass to think twice about visiting Europe .
In 1998 , a Spanish judge nearly succeeded in extraditing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from Britain on charges of political killings and torture in Chile .

Suspicion mounts about ' burrowing ' Bush appointees Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday February 10 , 2009
Print This Email This Some liberals are beginning to suspect Bush loyalists in career government positions are doing their best to try to deflate and hinder President Obama 's agenda .
When the New York Times published a story on a former Guantanamo detainee who allegedly joined Al Qaeda in Yemen after his release , the timing struck Huffington Post reporter Sam Stein as " suspicious . "
The paper published its report just one day after President Obama ordered the prison closed .
Stein wonders whether President Bush 's political appointees at the Pentagon -- some of whom , the Associated Press reports , have become embedded in career jobs -- leaked information to the Times " as a way of sending a signal to the new president . "
Thursday , Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) wrote Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , asking him to " immediately review the circumstances behind the conversion of these positions and the hiring of any former Bush administration appointees as career or temporary officials within the Office of Detainee Affairs . "
" Allegations of improper ' burrowing ' of political appointees to career positions are very troubling to me , " wrote Sen. Feinstein .
" This is especially disconcerting within the Office of Detainee Affairs due to the nature of the policy recommendations that office provides regarding Guantanamo . "
According to a spokesman , " defense officials concluded that none ' burrowed ' into the system  or improperly transferred from political to career jobs , " the AP reported .
" This is obviously going to be a problem , which was basically brought on by deciding to keep Gates , " Larry Korb , a former Reagan official , told Stein .
" I do n't blame Gates .
He asked him to stay and wants his own people ...
I think it is going to make it more difficult and I think it was no accident that the day after [ Obama ] put out this executive order , the front page story on the New York Times was about this released detainee . "
The Times article focused on Said Ali al Shihri ( read his military docket here ) .
He is " suspected of involvement in a deadly bombing of the United States Embassy in Yemens capital , Sana , in September , " reporter Robert Worth wrote .
" He was released to Saudi Arabia in 2007 and passed through a Saudi rehabilitation program for former jihadists before resurfacing with Al Qaeda in Yemen . "
" The lesson here is : Whoever receives former Guantánamo detainees needs to keep a close eye on them , " a defense official told the International Herald Tribune .
Yet , when exploring possible reasons for his release , " documents say he claimed that he traveled to Iran ' to purchase carpets for his store ' in Saudi Arabia , " reported the Times .
" They also say that he denied knowledge of any terrorists or terrorist activities , and that he 'related that if released , he would like to return to Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , wherein he would reunite with his family . ' "
On Jan. 13 , the Defense Intelligence Agency -- part of the Department of Defense -- released a report on terrorism recidivism which states 61 former Gitmo prisoners have " returned to the fight . "
The claim was later blasted as " propaganda " by MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann .
" ... All of which are seriously undercut by the DoD statement that ' they do not track ' former detainees , " said Seton Hall Law Professor Mark Denbeaux on the Jan. 22 episode of Countdown .
Stein is not the only media figure openly wondering whether Bush loyalists still in government would attempt to " send a signal , " " undermine " or even " sabotage " President Obama .
When the Los Angeles Times reported that President Obama had preserved the use of renditions -- the secret capture , transportation and detention of suspected terrorists to foreign prisons in countries that cooperate with the U.S. -- for the CIA 's anti-terror toolbox , many liberals were outraged .
However , some charged that the paper was " punked " by former CIA officials .
MSNBC 's Rachael Maddow wondered aloud if " Bush loyalists " who remain in government are trying to " undermine " President Obama .
Maddow 's guest , Scott Horton , a contributing editor with Harpers magazine , agreed with her line of questioning , and even went so far as to say , " I think we may see sabotage as well . "
" These stories are regularly sourced to unnamed current or former CIA officials and have largely run in right - wing media outlets , " Horton opined in Harpers .
" However , now we see that even the Los Angeles Times can be taken for a ride . "
Norway says the new law targets the clients and not the prostitutes
A new law has come into force in Norway making the purchase of sex illegal .
Norwegian citizens caught paying for prostitutes at home or abroad could face a hefty fine or a six - month prison sentence , authorities say .
The prison sentence could be extended to three years in cases of child prostitution .
The Norwegian authorities say they want to stamp out sex tourism and street prostitution by targeting clients rather than prostitutes .
" We think buying sex is unacceptable because it favours human trafficking and forced prostitution , " deputy Justice Minister Astri Aas -Hansen was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
Wire - tapping
The tough new measures go further than similar ones introduced by other Nordic countries such as Sweden and Finland .
Norwegian police have been authorised to use wire - tapping devices to gather evidence .
There has already been a visible decrease in women working on the streets of central Oslo , local media report .
Prostitutes will be offered access to free education and health treatment for those with alcohol or drugs problems .
The government had already launched a publicity campaign before the law came into force .
Critics of the new regulations say prostitution will simply be driven underground and will be more difficult to control .
The rest of his career may never have matched The Prisoner , but in that one iconic show he opened television up to new possibilties
He was definitely not a number , but nor was he really a free man .
To older readers , Patrick McGoohan , who has died aged 80 in Los Angeles after a short illness , was king of the British TV airwaves , initially as secret agent Danger Man – one of the first British TV productions to break America ( largely thanks to the popularity of James Bond ) .
He also had a few big - screen roles , in movies like Escape From Alactraz , Braveheart and David Cronenberg 's Scanners .
But McGoohan 's finest moment , for which he deserves to be remembered as long as people are watching moving images on little boxes , was undoubtedly the Prisoner – the psychedelically experimental late - 1960s series whose influence is still tangible , but whose vision was far too radical for its time .
Without the Prisoner , we 'd never have had cryptic , mindbending TV series like Twin Peaks or Lost .
It 's the Citizen Kane of British TV – a programme that changed the landscape , and quite possibly destroyed its creator .
Like Orson Welles with Kane , McGoohan was given the whole train set to play with on the Prisoner , and boy did he play with it .
The title sequence was the only solid ground – we knew McGoohan had resigned , then been drugged and brought to " The Village " .
The rest was questions rather than answers – Where is " Number 6 " ?
What 's his real name ?
Why DID he resign ?
What was he resigning from ?
Who Is Number One ?
What ARE those white blobs bouncing along the beach ?
But more than that , The Prisoner did audacious things with the very format of television .
Like shooting one entire episode as a western – complete with atrocious " American " accents .
Or substituting McGoohan with a different actor for an entire episode ( the pretext was something to do with mind transferrence – in fact McGoohan was away shooting Ice Station Zebra ) .
Or simply having a ball with spy movie conventions .
My favourite bit is the episode The Girl Who Was Death , when McGoohan sips his pint in the pub to see the word " YOU " at the bottom of his glass .
He sips a bit more to reveal the words " HAVE JUST " , before draining the pint to read the last lines : " BEEN POISONED " .
How does he get out of this predicament ?
By drinking everything else in the bar until he throws up .
Genius !
Or madness , from the point of view of ITV producer Lew Grade , who famously pulled the plug from McGoohan 's train set halfway through , necessitating a botched together final episode and one of the most surreal and least conclusive series conclusions of all time ( what was that bit with all the jukeboxes playing " All You Need Is Love " about ? ) .
What might have happened had McGoohan been making The Prisoner today ?
Funnily enough , we 'll get a chance to find out .
There 's a new version of the series due to screen on ITV later this year , starring James " Jesus " Caviezel as Number 6 , and hopefully drawing out the series ' prescient Guantanomo Bay parallels – did Cheney and Rumsfeld grow up watching the original , I wonder ?
McGoohan never quite reached the heights of The Prisoner again , but he leaves behind a distinguished legacy , an iconic outfit , a devoted fan club , and a colourful tourist destination .
There 's really only one way to say goodbye to McGoohan :
Be seeing you .
在麗江的柔軟時光，計畫用一天的時間騎著自行車由麗江最主要的大研古鎮騎到最古老原始的白沙古鎮，然後繞到束河古鎮，把這兩個也是很知名的古鎮都走一回，一般而言，遊客最多的地方是大研古鎮，商業氣息最濃，開發的規模也最大，而束河次之，但因為有50元的門票，雖然可以繞過逃票，還是阻擋了許多人前往...
大研古鎮一直都是遊客不斷，然而到了束河大約少了七成，而到了白沙，真正去看過白沙壁畫的，可能就小貓兩三隻，甚至連我到售票處想買票都找不到人，只好直接進去看了...
然而，雖然帶著地圖，還是走錯路了，出了大研古鎮，經過一個我認為是麗江風景最漂亮的水壩，之後提前轉了彎，居然先騎到了束河去，或許是假期的最後一天，束河非常的冷清，我們到的時間已經中午時分，仍然沒有多少遊客，我們走過了四方街，過了一座石橋，發現束河古鎮變成更為古老了，而在經過了九鼎龍潭之後，我們經過了一處林蔭大道，名為薔薇大道，而後進入了束白公路，這條公路上一望無際，而且前不見古人，後不見來者，只有遠方的玉龍雪山陪伴我們...
再一次，我們又騎錯了路，多繞了一段路，幾乎多走了一兩公里，才抵達白沙壁畫，白沙壁畫是明朝的古文物，或許稍嫌沒有看頭，但這裡應該是當地人們的真實居住部落，部落的規模不大，建築非常古老，彷彿就是到了古裝劇中的場景一般，相較於大研以及束河，或許白沙真實了一點，實際記錄了老麗江人的生活，而娓娓的述說著一段歷史故事...
有機會到麗江的話，一定要去束河以及白沙，從麗江騎自行車到白沙大約一個半小時可以到，大部份路是上坡，而延我上述的路線可以到束河的後門，可以避開束河古鎮的大門收費亭，很悠閒的一條旅遊路線，怕曬黑的要做好防曬工作，非常值得...
享受真正遠離塵囂的感覺 ...

In one of the largest environmental disasters in years , a retaining wall in eastern Tennessee failed yesterday releasing 500 million gallons of water mixed with fly ash ( the material left over from the combustion of coal ) , covering up to 400 acres up to 6 feet deep , flowing into the tributaries of the Tennessee river , and ultimately the Chattanooga water supply .
Fly or coal ash contains a number of toxic substances including mercury , arsenic and lead , causing a whole host of health issues including cancer and various neurological problems .
To give a sense of scale , the Exxon Valdez poured 11 million gallons into the ocean off the coast of Alaska in 1989 , and the largest spill on record , the Gulf War oil spill in 1991 , poured between 250 - 450 million gallons into the Persian Gulf .
A video of the aftermath below .
For such an extraordinary event , there has been little or no national press coverage , and only minimal coverage in local newspapers and blogs .
It appears the media would prefer to cover Obama ’s vacation in Hawaii or the ongoing Illinois governor ’s scandal .
I guess environmental disasters just are n’t sexy enough .
Or about as sexy as years of coal de-regulation that may have contributed to this event .

A rare voice in Saudi Arabia expressing a pro-Israel view says that Arabs have wasted time and money trying to destroy the Jewish State .
A Saudi Arabia columnist , in a rare expression of a pro-Israel view , wrote in the London - based Arabic - language daily newspaper Al - Sharq Al - Awsat that Arabs have wasted time and money trying to destroy the Jewish State .
Mash 'al Al - Sudairi's column , translated by The Middle East Media Research Institute ( MEMRI ) , stated that although the " Jewish ' occupation of a part of Palestine constitutes great oppression , ' " the Arabs have a history of self - inflicted blows " resulting from opposition to the re-establishment of the Jewish State of Israel .
" When , in the early 1930s , we were offered 80 percent of Palestine , while the Jews were offered 20 percent , we rejected the offer .
In the late 1940s , we were offered 49 percent of Palestine , and the Jews 51 percent , and we rejected that [ offer ] , " al - Sudairi wrote .
He criticized the Arab world for exhausting all of its resources over the issue of " Palestine " and wasting money and time .
I am positive , [ and am willing ] to bet and even to swear by Allah , that if only 10 percent of the money that the Arab countries invested in arming their forces during the futile fighting [ with Israel ] had been invested in what was left of Palestine and its people , the West Bank and Gaza would now be enjoying a living standard higher than that of Singapore , " he added .
Sudairi also commented on Iran 's occupation of three Persian Gulf islands .
" With all the turmoil over the Palestinian issue , we have completely forgotten that other Arab countries have been robbed of parts of their territories , in broad daylight , and we never uttered a word of protest , " the Saudi columnist noted .

Belly fat may be a better indicator for the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes including premature death , according to a new study of about 360,000 Europeans .
The study led by Tobias Pischon , MD , MPH and colleagues at the Department of Epidemiology , German Institute of Human Nutrition showed that people with the most belly fat were almost twice as likely to die prematurely as people with the least amount .
The study was reported their study in the Nov. 12 , 2008 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine .
For the study , Pischon and team followed 359,387 European men and women for nearly 10 years .
During the follow - up , 14,723 of the participants died .
They were able to associate waist circumference and waist - to - hip measurements with high risk of early death even after overweight and obesity as measured by BMI were adjusted .
They found men and women who had largest waists were twice as likely to die prematurely as those who had the smallest waists .
Specifically , for each 2 - inch increase in waist circumference , the death risk was increased by 17 percent in men and 13 percent in women .
It has been known for long that people with excess weight around their middles have a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes .
Recent research also has linked belly fat to a variety of other disease such as cancers , diabetes and age - related brain diseases .
One study published in the Nov 2008 issue of Public Health Nutrition found that a large waist circumference and high ratio of waist to height were associated with high risk of type 2 diabetes in Chinese adults .
For the study , He Y and colleagues from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing , China looked at data for 50,905 adults age 18 to 79 enrolled in the 2002 China National Nutrition and health Survey .
In the study , body mass index greater than 24 kg / m2 was considered high BMI and waist circumference greater than 85 cm in men and 80 cm in women were considered high waist circumference .
The researchers found high IMI , waist circumference and waist - to - height ratio ( WTHR ) were all associated with glucose intolerance abnormalities with those with highest prevalence found in those with high WTHR .
The risk was increased 2.85 times men with high WTHR and 3.10 times in women with larger waists .
They concluded that among the Chinese adult population , measures of abdominal obesity are better predictors of prevalence of glucose tolerance abnormalities than BMI .

Saved by the Bell : Class of 1993
It ’s hard to imagine but Saved by the Bell aired its first episode 20 years ago .
The series lasted for 4 years as fans followed the exploits of several students and their principal at Bayside High School .
The show starred Mark - Paul Gosselaar , Mario Lopez , Dustin Diamond , Lark Voorhies , Elizabeth Berkley and Tiffani Thiessen .
The show launched the careers of several of its cast mates , but many were typecast into their Saved by the Bell roles for years afterwards .
All that remains these days are re-runs , so let ’s take a look at what everyone is up to 20 years later .
Mark - Paul Gosselaar
Then : Zack Morris , Bayside
High ’s resident heartthrob , cool guy , rich kid , and trouble maker , was behind every scheme and shenanigan of the show ’s four - season run .
Through girl drama , detention and even an imaginary band called Zack Attack , Zack was the kind of friend you could always call on … if you had a giant cell phone , of course .
Now : After Saved by the Bell , Mark - Paul went on to the less successful spin- off Saved by the Bell : The College Years before moving on to several more TV dramas .
Really – do Gunaxin readers care ?
Let ’s face the facts .
Pretty boy Zack Morris typecasted Mark - Paul as a smartass and could never be taken seriously again .
Still – for his four year stint on Saved by the Bell , he is set for life as long as the re-runs keep airing .
Mario Lopez
Then : Albert Clifford or better known as A.C. Slater was the kind - hearted wrestling / football jock who challenged Zack for Bayside High ’s alpha male status .
His dimples , muscles and gentle heart made the Bayside High girls swoon every time he opened his mouth , regardless if he had a curly mullet .
He spent his time at Bayside High jockeying for Kelly ’s love , but eventually settles for getting lovin ’ from his mama , Jessie Spano .
Now : Dimples is emcee’ing shows like MTV’s America ’s Best Dance Crew , TLC ’s Miss America pageant , and ABC ’s Dancing With the Stars .
Dustin Diamond
Then : Screech Powers was the naive and nerdy valedictorian with squeaking voice , curly hair and clashing fluorescent - hued wardrobe to match .
Screech was Zack ’s confidant and eternal servant .
One of the running gags was Screech ’s fruitless attempts to woo Lisa .
His romantic feelings for her were never returned and often rejected with insults and jokes , but he kept at it and eventually went to his senior prom with Lisa in hand .
Now : Ahhh now Dustin is a real winner .
Not only was he seen as a complete loser during all four years on the show , shockingly , he is still seen as a complete loser 20 years later .
In 2006 , a sex - tape entitled Screeched , aka Saved by the Smell , was released by Red Light District , which features Dustin with two women in which he manages to give one of them a Dirty Sanchez .
Nice job Dustin- ya loser !
Lark Voorhies
Then : Lisa Turtle , the original gossip girl had the scoop on who was dating whom , the latest fashion trends and where the party was ( if The Max was closed ) .
Sandwiched between Screech ’s unrequited love and Zack ’s infatuation with Kelly , Lisa was unfortunately relegated to the role of asexual fashionista .
Now :
Once engaged to comic Martin Lawrence , Voorhies ended an eight - year marriage in 2004 and told OK !
magazine in 2007 that she now spends her time writing screenplays .
In traditional racist Gunaxin style , we do not include a gallery of Lark Voorhies .
Just kidding – Lark is hot , but a search of the internet finds no good pictures of her .
Elizabeth Berkley
Then : Jessica or better known as Jessie Spano was the hyperactive bookworm who was always involved in melodramatic teen obstacles , from feminist battles with her man hunk A.C. Slater to her constant worries about maintaining her straight A ’s streak .
Like Lisa and Screech , Jessie is Zack ’s childhood friend .
Now :
Has been in several episodes of CSI Miami and has hosted reality dance show “ Step It Up and Dance . ”
Tiffani Thiessen
Then : Lastly is Kelly KaPOWski .
Head cheerleader , captain of all the sports teams and object of Zack Morris ’ affections , every girl wanted to be Kelly and every guy wanted to be with her .
She had a thing for older men , but eventually settled down with Zack , marrying him in ‘ Saved By the Bell : Wedding in Las Vegas . ’
Considered the most popular girl in school , Kelly was also known as one of its nicest and most squeaky clean .
Now : Tiffani - Amber Thiessen had a brief stint on Beverly Hills 90210 before doing some lesser roles and deciding to focus on motherhood with her husband and actor Brady Smith .
Booo !!!!!!!!
Beef farmers given £ 66 m boost as US market reopens in ' historic ' post - Brexit move

Mr Obama 's father was born in Kenya An appeal claiming Barack Obama is too British to become president of the United States has been rejected by the US Supreme Court .
The lawsuit claimed he should be disqualified because , it claimed , he acquired the same British citizenship that his father had when he was born .
This meant he was not a " natural - born " US citizen , as the US constitution requires , it alleged .
Mr Obama 's birth certificate shows he was born in Hawaii .
The issue was addressed by Mr Obama 's aides during his presidential campaign , when they posted online his birth certificate - which was verified by Hawaiian officials .
This lawsuit , brought by retired New Jersey lawyer Leo Donofrio , gained a high profile because it was distributed by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to other justices for discussion .
It conceded that Mr Obama was born in Hawaii - but contended that he still held foreign citizenship at birth .
It read : " Since Barack Obama 's father was a citizen of Kenya , and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom at the time of Senator Obama 's birth , then Senator Obama was a British citizen ' at birth ' , just like the framers of the Constitution , and therefore , even if he were to produce an original birth certificate proving he were born on US soil , he still would n't be eligible to be president . "
Kenya was part of British East Africa until it received its independence in 1963 .
A decision not to grant a writ of certiorari - the legal term for the declaration that the justices will hear the case - means that a lower court ruling that dismissed the lawsuit can stand .

Travel YTD through November 2008 also fell by - 3.7 % compared to 2007 .
The thirteen consecutive monthly declines ( November 2007 through November 2008 ) in miles driven compared to the same month in the previous year represents one of the most significant adjustments to driving behavior in American history .
On a moving 12 - month total basis , traffic volume in November fell to 2,894 billion miles , the lowest level in almost five years - since January of 2004 ( see chart above ) , and this measure of traffic volume fell in every month of 2008 .

By Laura Miller
Justice minister Jack Straw has reintroduced government plans for closed door inquests , held without a jury , in cases involving aspects of national security .
The plans will form part of the coroner and justice bill .
The reintroduction led Liberal Democrat shadow justice secretary , David Howarth to call for an immediate halt to the plans .
" It is high time that the government let go of these dangerous proposals , " he said .
" Many of us had hoped that ministers had seen sense after the plans were dropped from the counter terrorism bill . "
If the government succeeds with the controversial measure it could mean future cases like the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes would not be made public .
Such a lack of transparency is unacceptable , said Mr Howarth .
" Inquests allow the government to be held to account for deaths at the hands of the state .
Holding them in secret , with coroners hand - picked by the government , would be another blow to our civil liberties , "
The move is expected to draw strong criticism and parliamentary opposition .
The joint human rights committee has labelled the proposal " an astonishing provision " , and has pointed to contradictions with the European convention on human rights , which states adequate and effective investigation must be provided where a person has been killed by force by a state agent .
Ministers in favour of the plans argue they are necessary so inquests can be held in cases which involve material that should n't be made public in the interests of national security .
Virus authors reportedly planted malicious code on Paris Hilton 's website late last week .
Following the attack , surfers visiting the ParisHilton.com site were prompted to install an " update " via a dialogue box .
Whether they accepted this update or decided to " cancel " it , a download of a malicious executable was initiated , according to internet reports .
The attack was reportedly used to serve up the Trojan - Spy .
Zbot .
YETH
Trojan , a rootkit trojan designed to steal online banking information and to allow the download of other malicious code .
The assault was detected by web security firm ScanSafe on 9 January but cleansed by Tuesday morning , according to net security firm Sophos , hours after news of the assault broke .
The type of attack thrown against ParisHilton.com is similar to a recent attack on MLB.com , the Major League Baseball website , and the self - explanatory sexy - celeb - photos.com .
Each of these assaults was much more in your face than traditional drive - by download attacks , but they also stemmed from the same underlying cause - website vulnerabilities left open to abuse by hackers .
Over the years the hapless Hilton has become a serial victim of various computer hacking and security attacks .
Four years ago the notable heiress and airhead was unfortunate enough to suffer from a hack against her T - Mobile account which resulted in the leak of messages , contact details and photos .
Last March another hacker gained access to private pictures after breaking into her Facebook account .
And just days ago , messages from a faked Linked In profile ostensibly maintained by Ms Hilton pointed to malicious downloads . ®
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
For many gamers Atari is a blast from the past or just a logo on retro T - shirts but the company that dates back 36 years is looking to reclaim a stake of the videogame landscape .
A screenshot shows " The Witcher : Rise of the White Wolf " in this handout photo .
REUTERS / Atari / Handout
Atari Inc. , founded by Nolan Bushnell , launched the first truly successful videogame “ Pong ” in 1972 but has struggled in recent years with lackluster games like “ Jenga World Tour ” and “ Godzilla Unleashed . ”
But a change in ownership this year aims to reinvigorate the company .
French game publisher Infogrames had owned a majority stake in Atari since 2000 but acquired the rest of Atari this year and has assumed its name .
New Atari President Phil Harrison , who helped build Sony Worldwide Studios into a leading game development factory , said it ’s now up to the game maker to build the products and services that do the well - known Atari brand justice .
“ Having a cool logo and a brand that ’s known throughout the world is great , but unless it stands for something and actually resonates with our players by delivering great value , fun gameplay , and entertainment , it does n’t mean anything , ” he said .
Analysts said Atari had an interesting but checkered past which could makes some consumers -- and investors -- wary of its bid to get back on top of the game .
“ The Atari name will always mean ‘ old school cool ’ to gamers , but the brand may need some rehab to regain respect , ” said Billy Pidgeon , videogame analyst at IDC .
Atari used London ’s 02 Arena to showcase 14 games heading to stores in 2009 , most of which will ship in the first six months .

MOVIES TO MMO GAMES
For the more hardcore gamers , Atari will bring developer CD Projekt RED ’s “ The Witcher : Rise of the White Wolf , ” a fantasy role - playing game , to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in autumn 2009 .
Atari will also handle retail distribution of CCP Games ’ “ EVE Online , ” which gets a global release March 10 .
The company is also reviving the arcade boxing game “ Ready 2 Rumble Revolution ” on Wii next year .
Having worked with Hollywood on games like Shiny Entertainment ’s “ Enter the Matrix ” and Atari Los Angeles ’ “ Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , ” the company also plans to use a pair of established movie brands to widen its audience .
“ Ghostbusters : The Videogame ” ships in June as the Sony Pictures film marks its 25th anniversary and plays like an interactive third film in the franchise with the cast involved .
Atari is bringing a virtual Vin Diesel to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in the spring in “ Chronicles of Riddick : Assault on Dark Athena , ” a shooter that further explores the back story of Riddick from the films “ Pitch Black ” and “ Chronicles of Riddick . ”
Just this week , Atari acquired California - based Cryptic Studios for $ 28 million ( plus the potential for another $ 20 million in bonus payments ) , a developer that produces massively multiplayer online ( MMO ) games .
Harrison said he believes the future of gaming is online .
Atari will publish Cryptic ’s three upcoming games in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 with the first out the gate the comic book heroes and villains of “ Champions Online , ” followed by “ Star Trek Online ” in 2010 and an unannounced MMO game for 2011 .
With its early slate now set , and new internal game development under way at its new London studio and its established Eden Studio in Lyon , France , Atari ’s management now has to deliver on its promise of better quality games .
“ I think Phil Harrison and Paulina Bozek ( head of Atari ’s London Studio ) will be instrumental in building a mass market library , which will help the publisher compete in today ’s market , ” said Pidgeon .
In the middle of Salar de Uyuni , a huge salt deposit in southwestern part of the Bolivia , is located a hotel made entirely of salt .
It is n’t surprising actually , rather very natural , since salt is the only available material in the region .
Hotel de Sal Playa was built in 1993 by a salt artisan who saw an opportunity to make some moolah out of the tourists looking for places to stay while visiting the nearby mine , which is one of the world 's largest of its kind .
The hotel walls are made of salt blocks stuck together with a cement - like substance made of salt and water .
During rainy seasons , the walls are strengthened with new blocks , while the owners ask the guests to avoid licking the walls to prevent deterioration .
All the furniture ( including beds ) toilets , lighting , and billiard table are made of the salt blocks .
The lodge has 15 bedrooms , a dining room , a living room and a bar .
Police have arrested a man accused of breaking into a string of north Queensland adult shops and having sex with blow - up dolls .
The 23 - year - old Manunda man , whose name has been withheld , was charged yesterday with breaking into businesses in Cairns 's CBD , including the Laneway Adult Shop off Spence Street three times in the past month .
He also allegedly smashed his way through the roof into the Sapphire Tapas Bar on Lake Street .
The owner of the Laneway Adult Shop told The Cairns Post after the first break - in the thief had stolen five dolls and had sex with one of them .
Some of the New Deal ’s programs were quickly discarded , but the New Deal survived .
It lives on to this day .
Every American president who followed FDR has strengthened the New Deal , and every new president will continue to do so .
Once we spell out the basic premises of the New Deal , we can see why this is and why matters will not change without deep changes in thinking .
The New Deal fastened the U.S. economy in the chains of government control .
Free markets were phased out .
This was and is a work - in - progress occupying many years .
Liberty remains in name only , as a remnant of past aspirations , primarily located in the gratifications of a circumscribed personal freedom .
New ideas and political changes such as progressivism consciously forged the chains of government power for the half - century preceding the New Deal , as did the enlarged government role in World War I .
In the decades following the New Deal , one government after another , accepting the New Deal ’s innovations , enlarged and secured the manacles institutionally .
No realm of American life was left untouched — legally , economically , politically , educationally , socially , and religiously .
Liberty and free markets became empty ideals next to the reality of the unique American fascism .
The throttling of the American ideal of liberty was a bi-partisan work of mainstream Democrats and Republicans alike , with token resistance put up by their less powerful and influential splinter groups , wings , and movements .
The two parties monopolistically collaborated to build the structure of centralized government control that we live under today .
We now look back on 125 years of a bull market in fascism .
The transformation of American life by and into fascism is ongoing .
The end stage is the extinction of the person ’s decision rights over his life , and his liberty , and his personal pursuit of his own happiness ; with that personal control being replaced by the collective and total control of nameless others .
The premises of the New Deal control the ground and direction of American social , economic , and political life .
These premises are now identifiable , although only with the passage of time :
Centralization .
The view that all of the economic activity within U.S. borders , that is , the abstraction that many of us call the economy , is actually a real and single entity ; that this whole can be and should be subject to the planning and control of centralized national officials .
Collectivization .
The view that the life of each person is largely determined by the collective of other persons ( and by collective forces beyond his control that induce insecurities ) ; and that the powers of the collective others should be controlled by nationally elected officials so as to enhance the life , progress , happiness , and welfare of each person ; that the same officials should create arrangements to reduce the various insecurities of life .
Market failure .
The view that people in markets , left to themselves , are incapable of sustaining their own investment and employment ; leading to the view that government officials need to be the watchdogs , regulators , and controllers over people making exchanges in markets .
Insufficiency of social institutions .
The view that persons cannot count on other persons , families , churches , clubs , insurers , companies , associations etc. to meet their own needs ; leading to the view that national officials acting with the powers of government are essential for meeting people ’s needs .
Symbiosis of big institutions and big government .
The view that government controls the economy by supporting and controlling big business , big labor , big agriculture , big media , big defense companies , big banks , and so on ; the view that individuals , small business , independent proprietors , and small institutions of all kinds , are minor .
The President as personification of Democracy .
The view that national institutions speak for all the people ( as opposed to federalism ) ; the view that presidential leadership supercedes national - state government relations ; the view of Democracy as a collective government personified by the President , as opposed to democracy viewed as self - government .
Inflation is good for the economy .
The view that persons should not control what money is , but that government officials should ; the view that a growing economy requires depreciation of the currency and that a declining level of prices of goods and services is to be avoided .
Rejection of limited government .
The view that the powers of the national government are virtually unlimited , or limited only by expediency ; that the national government controls the persons and wealth of all of its citizens .
To put these premises into practice required a much more powerful government , which is what we have .
But the government can not use its powers without a degree of popular acceptance .
A number of elements have contributed to that acceptance , such as the government ’s exploitation of patriotism , its use of foreign enemies , and its ability to be heard and set the agenda .
A very important element was the supine acceptance of government power by influential organizations of religion .
Religion shapes the meaning and direction of many people ’s lives .
The support of religion for big government provides government with a broad foundation of acceptance that it could not gain if it were on its own .
Religion ties in with social norms .
To each person , government offered social " guarantees . "
The social safety net appealed to wide swaths of the American people ( and to many other peoples ) .
They believe in government guarantees because they bring certain satisfactions of norms that they hold .
Taking care of the elderly is a social ( and religious ) norm .
So is taking care of the ill .
People believe that children should be educated , another norm .
The government promises and commitments , however shaky they are or ill - performed , satisfy these desires to meet the norms of good behavior .
People feel good thinking this has been done , and they even feel good paying the taxes when they think they are satisfying their moral obligations .
They do n’t think about the hidden costs and bad incentives of something like Social Security .
Why should they ?
All they hear is one side of the story , and the story not only is plausible but it satisfies their norms .
The question then becomes :
Why did churches and religious bodies support the collective , centralized , brutal , unjust , and impersonal use of raw government power instead of maintaining traditional methods of meeting norms personally and in justice ?
America will not experience a revival or redirection toward liberty and free markets until Americans reject — fully , firmly , and consciously — the premises of the New Deal , for it was the New Deal that codified and institutionalized the American rejection of liberty and its exchange for collectivism and fascism .
Before that can happen on any large scale , the alternative of liberty has to have broad appeal as an alternative to government supported by religion and made into a quasi-religious institution .
But liberty ’s appeal will not bloom in isolation of deeper philosophical and / or religious underpinnings .
Liberty in and of itself does not provide enough meaning to most people .
It provides a foundation for self - realization , but self - realization for what end ?
For what purpose ?
Liberty by itself provides no transcending purpose .
That is why agnostic or purely logical and rationalistic libertarianism , even with an appealing moral code of non-aggression , excites only limited interest in the general population .
Its social theory is circumscribed .
People want more than individualism .
Liberty cannot defeat the New Deal and big government without a religious revival that eschews the current connections between religion and government and replaces misguided religious beliefs with beliefs that are more compatible , even though they may not be completely so , with liberty , and incompatible with the power and injustice offered by New Dealism in government .

Frank Rich : GOP attempts to link Obama to Blagojevich ' wo n't work ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday December 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Although Republicans have been doing their best to implicate President - elect Barack Obama in the scandal involving Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich 's attempt to sell Obama 's former Senate seat to the highest bidder , New York Times columnist Frank Rich believes Obama has nothing to worry about .
In an appearance Wednesday on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show , Rich began by suggesting that the extravagantly obscene transcripts of Blagojevich 's conversations are " going to be the gift that keeps on giving , I think , for quite a while ... but the attempts to link Obama to it are almost as laughable as the transcripts themselves . "
" Republicans , for obvious reasons , they want to tie Blagojevich to Obama like an anchor , " Maddow noted .
" Right , but it wo n't work , " Rich replied confidently .
He suggested that the Republicans are " just trying to change the subject " now that 79 % of Americans tell pollsters they wo n't miss George Bush 's when he 's gone and even Joe the Plumber is saying he was appalled and embarrassed by John McCain .
" Do you think this is sort of a non-partisan accountability moment ? "
Maddow asked .
" Nobody is standing up and saying , ' This is a witchhunt , Blagojevich ought to be left alone here . ' "
" I think it is a good sign , " Rich agreed .
" And by the way , the same thing happened with the last Illinois governor , George Ryan , who was a Republican .
Again , it was a bipartisan feeling that he should go , and in fact he 's now in jail . "
" I 've been thinking about it in broader terms , " Maddow continued .
" To me it feels like a heck of a contrast to see someone get nailed so publicly for this type of corruption while the giant swindle that was the Iraq war is still an applause line for this president . "
" I completely agree with you , " Rich replied .
" Accountability and the lack of it has been an enormous issue of this entire decade , not just in the Iraq War but on Wall Street .
...
Compared to the things people have not been held accountable for , what [ Blagojevich ] is accused of is relatively minor . "

Sarah Connor Chronicles Fodder
Review : Sarah Connor Chronicles - ' Brothers of Nablus '
Now things are really getting weird .
The question of whether or not Skynet is at war with itself was all but confirmed in this week 's opening scene .
Not convinced ?
Watch it again .
Why else would Cromartie kill Robo Ellison and say something like " SkyNet does not believe in you like I do " to the real Ellison ?
It looks like Cromartie has gone rogue , which is an odd notion for a Terminator that has n't been reprogrammed by John Connor .
The scene brought up more questions than answers , but I think one thing is clear : SkyNet is n't the efficient , well - run machine we all thought it was .
If I were SkyNet , I 'd side with Cromartie and leave Robo Ellison hanging on the rack .
Dude 's a bona fide badass ( as long as there are no kiddie pools around ) who'll stop at nothing to find and kill John .
He was even willing to spend an afternoon with Jody ( Leah Pipes ) -- the only character more annoying than Riley ( Leven Rambin ) -- in order to locate the Connor home .
Who else clapped when he knocked her outta the car ?
Garret Dillahunt is such a joy to watch in this role .
He plays it cool and quirky , like Robert Patrick in " T2 . "
Also , like Patrick , he 's sure to become a fan favorite in this series .
Back to Ellison ...
Why do the Terminators have so much faith in this guy ?
It seems like every big bad -- Skynet , Weaver and Cromartie -- is interested in James Ellison .
We watched as Cromartie and Weaver stuck their necks out to protect him , but to what end ?
He might be the one to unwittingly lead Cromartie to the Connors , but something tells me there 's a lot more to his destiny .
Weaver , who 's getting more manipulative with every episode , seemed just as confused as to why SkyNet would send an Ellison doppleganger into the past .
Still , she sprung him out of jail and likened his struggle to that of Job -- something Ellison , a man of faith , was sure to respond to .
Are we seeing the start of Ellison 's eventual turn to the dark side ?
Job was n't the only biblical name mentioned here .
Sarah brought up the story of the Brothers of Nablus ( Genesis 34 ) at episode 's end .
Cameron explained that the brothers plundered Shechem 's village after he raped their sister , Dinah .
The consequences of his evil deed were severe for him and his entire village .
The same can be said for the film geek losers who robbed the Connor house and for Moishe , the diamond fence .
I 'm not sure if that 's the conclusion the show runners wanted us to draw , but it feels right .
If you mess with the Connors , you 're gonna get burned -- or dead if Cameron has anything to say about it .
So how long will it be until Jesse ( Stephanie Chaves - Jacobson ) winds up dead ?
I 'm not a big fan of Chaves - Jacobson 's performance here , and I would n't mind seeing her story wrapped up quickly .
Also , why is she half - naked every time we see her ?
I do n't mind the ladies showing some skin every now and then , but it almost seems like Jesse is only supposed to be eye candy , which is disappointing .
Also , I do n't like the idea of Derek keeping her a secret from the Connors .
I foresee Derek being put in a situation where he 'll have to take Jesse 's life .
She 's dangerous and is obviously up to something shady .
Why else would she be taking surveillance pics of Derek and hanging out with creeps like Moishe ?
Is she working for SkyNet too ?
C'mon Derek , strangle her already .
And who else wanted to strangle John in this episode ?
He 's back to being John Baum -- whiny , wimpy and Riley - obsessed .
I still like the character , but when is he going to realize that the Baum name is a secret identity , not a license to act like an irresponsible teen ?
Still , this was one of the best and most intense episodes of the season .
With five great episodes in a row , and a full season promise from Fox , it 's a good time to be a Terminator fan .
Questions :
- Cromartie knows the Connors new identity and was shown interrogating robber number four .
Will we be seeing another Cameron - Cromartie showdown soon ?
- Cameron 's cold - hearted killer moments are still surprising and disturbing .
What will she do when she finds out Sarah let that kid go at the bowling alley ?
- I 'm sure most of us want the budding John - Riley romance to end .
But , should it end with a " Let 's be friends " talk or in a hail of machine gun fire aimed at Riley 's chest ?
( Too harsh ? )
- Sarah 's voiceovers were gone .
Hooray !
Do you feel the same way ?
- Why did they add a liquid Terminator to the show if they do n't have the budget for it ?
Weaver 's quick - cut transformation was pretty lame .
The newly elected president of the Maldives wants to build a contingency fund to buy land elsewhere so that the island country can literally move to higher ground to escape rising sea levels .
But what of the rest of the island ’s biodiversity ?
According to Jo Mulongoy , chief scientist for the Convention on Biological Diversity ’s secretariat in Montreal , the island ecosystems will never be reconstructed if they ’re swamped – powerful motivation for capping greenhouse gas emissions and blunting climate change .
Overall , however , Mulongoy is more hopeful .
Partly because governments are moving to act on biodiversity ( says the scientific diplomat ) .
But also because the power of information technology is informing smarter decision making and thus making it easier to do the right thing and preserve biodiversity ( at least on higher ground ) .
The Congolese microbiologist needs to look no further than his homeland , where satellite imagery is helping the government protect its equatorial forests from over - harvesting by refugees displaced by years of civil war .
For more , in his own words , see my Q&A with Mulongoy that posted to Earthzine on Friday .

Health care groups paid Daschle $ 220 K
Tom Daschle , tapped to be President Obama 's health czar , was paid more than $ 200,000 by the health - care industry in the past two years , according to documents obtained by Politico .
The former Senate majority leader , who gave speeches to firms and groups with a vested - interest in the administration 's upcoming health reform , collected the checks as part of a $ 5 million windfall after he lost reelection to his South Dakota seat .

This weekend , Daschle 's nomination to be secretary of Health and Human Services became embroiled in controversy over the last - minute revelation that he had only recently paid long - overdue taxes .
Daschle made nearly $ 5.3 million in the last two years , records released Friday show , including $ 220,000 he received for giving speeches , many of them to outfits that stand to gain or lose millions of dollars from the work he would do once confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services .
For instance , the Health Industry Distributors Association plunked down $ 14,000 to land the former Senate Democratic leader in March 2008 .
The association , which represents medical products distributors , boasts on its website that Daschle met with it after he was nominated to discuss “ the impact an Obama administration will have on the industry . ”
This week , the group began openly lobbying him , sending him a letter urging him to rescind a rule requiring competitive bidding of Medicare contracts .
Another organization , America ’s Health Insurance Plans , paid $ 20,000 for a Daschle speaking appearance in February 2007 .
It represents health insurance companies , which under Obama ’s plan would be barred from denying coverage on the basis of health or age .
There was a $ 12,000 talk to GE Healthcare in August , a $ 20,000 lecture in January to Premier , Inc. , a health care consulting firm , and a pair of $ 18,000 speeches this year to different hospital systems , among other paid appearances before health care groups .
The speaking fees were detailed in a financial disclosure statement released Friday , which showed that Daschle pulled down a total of more than $ 500,000 from the speaking circuit in the last two years , and $ 5.3 million in overall income .
That includes more than $ 2 million in consulting fees from InterMedia Advisors , a private equity firm .
Daschle , who represented South Dakota in the Senate for three terms , initially failed to pay taxes on the free use of a car and driver that had been provided to him by InterMedia ’s founder , high - rolling Democratic donor Leo Hindery Jr. , according to the New York Times .
It reported that Daschle this month paid more than $ 100,000 in back taxes and filed amended tax returns .
Daschle reported $ 182,520.26 of “ company provided transportation ” on the disclosure form , which also indicates he owns a stake in the company worth between $ 200,000 and $ 500,000 , as well as a “ 5 % limited partner profit sharing interest . ”
But he reported that only about half of his interest is vested , and he indicates that “ upon confirmation , I will divest all my vested shares and unvested shares and relinquish any benefit to which I may otherwise be entitled . ”
Daschle reported that he has been a consultant and chair of the company ’s advisory board since January 2005 , the same month he left the Senate after being upset in his reelection bid by Republican John Thune .
He also became an adviser to the law and lobbying firm Alston & Bird , which paid him $ 2.1 million in wages last year and also provided him a 401k and profit sharing plan worth between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000 , according to the report .
In his three years at the firm , it ’s earned more than $ 16 million lobbying on behalf of some of the health care industry ’s most powerful interests before the department he ’s in line to lead .
Though Daschle himself did not register to lobby for the firm , he has advised the firm ’s clients on health care issues , according to the firm ’s website .
His disclosure indicates he provided “ policy advice ” to such clients as United Health , AT&T and the politically connected consulting shop Glover Park Group .
After leaving the Senate , Daschle also landed a host of lucrative board spots , including with the energy giant BP Corporation , which paid him $ 250,000 in fees , developer CB Richard Ellis , which paid $ 121,000 , and ethanol processor Mascoma Corporation , which paid him $ 75,000 , according to the disclosure .
It shows that Daschle has hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks and options from CB Richard Ellis and Mascoma , though he indicated he forfeited his unvested stock options and wrote that “ if confirmed , I will divest my vested stock options with CB Richard Ellis . ”
He reported owning homes worth as much as $ 250,000 each in Aberdeen , S.D. , and Altus , Okla . , with his wife , a high - powered lobbyist for Baker , Donelson , Bearman , Caldwell & Berkowitz .
Daschle was n’t required to disclose her income , but did report that her retirement plans through the firm were worth more than $ 260,000 .

Subsea cables are often damaged by ship 's anchors and seismic activity Internet and phone communications between Europe , the Middle East , and Asia have been seriously disrupted after submarine cables were severed .
It is thought the FLAG FEA , SMW4 , and SMW3 lines , near the Alexandria cable station in Egypt , have all been cut .
A fault was also reported on the GO submarine cable 130 km off Sicily .
Experts warned that it may be days before the fault is fixed and said the knock on effect could have serious repercussions on regional economies .
For this to happen twice in one year , on the same cable , is a serious cause for concern .
Jonathan Wright , Interoute Jonathan Wright - director of wholesale products at Interoute which manages part of the optical fibre network - told the BBC that the effects of the break would be felt for many days .
" This will grind economies to a halt for a short space of time , " he said " If you look at , say , local financial markets who trade with European and US markets , the speed at which they get live data will be compromised . "
" If you think how quickly trades can be placed , if they are suffering from bad latency times , then by the time a trade is placed , the market may well have moved on . "
The cause of the break is as yet unknown , although some seismic activity was reported near Malta shortly before the cut was detected .
A second subsea cable to Malta is currently being laid
In a statement released in relation to one of the breaks , France Telecom said : " The causes of the cut , which is located in the Mediterranean between Sicily and Tunisia , on sections linking Sicily to Egypt , remain unclear . "
The French firm said it was sending a ship out to fix the line between Italy and Egypt , although it could take until 31 December to fully repair the line .
The main damage is to the four submarine cables running across the Mediterranean and through the Suez Canal .
It is thought that 65 % of traffic to India was down , while services to Singapore , Malaysia , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Taiwan and Pakistan have also been severely affected .
Earlier this year , the same line was damaged in the same area - off the Egyptian coast - although only two lines were snapped then .
" We 've lost three out of four lines .
If the fourth cable breaks , we 're looking at a total blackout in the Middle East , " said Mr Wright .
" These three circuits account for 90 % of the traffic and we 're going to see more international phone calls dropping and a huge degradation in the quality of local internet , " he added .
" Normally you would expect to see one major break per cable per year .
With four you should have an insurance policy .
For this to happen twice in one year , on the same cable , is a serious cause for concern . "
A selection of your comments on this story : Over weekend 13th to 16th December had considerable delays and time - outs reaching my email server in Germany and various homepages in Switzerland and the UK .
I suspected that a breakdown somewhere was at fault but was surprised to be unable to get any info from Google etc .
You can check your ADSL speed easily but finding the speed of a connection from one continent to another seems to be lacking .
John Russell , Toowoomba , Queensland , Australia I began downloading something this afternoon but late this evening it suddenly became six or seven times slower .
I now know why .
Max , Wallasey , UK I teach English at a high school in Sisaket .
The last few days our connections have been very , very slow .
Yesterday , when I was trying to teach some students how to use Limewire to download movies and songs , the connection seemed to be nearly non-existent .
We thought that maybe the wire to our building had been damaged .
Les Blane , Sisaket , Thailand I work at a call centre .
We are unable to make calls as the latency is too high which only ends up in dropping of every call that we dial and the internet speed has been downgraded like anything .
I hope this gets fixed by Sunday ( December 21 ) , otherwise we will be in total blackout and will suffer in great loss of business in this high time .
Adeel Awan , Karachi , Pakistan Yesterday 's cuts in Malta were a big hassle to all GO subscribers .
One here seems to all of a sudden realise how dependent we all are on internet .
At least alternative measures have been taken in Malta by GO in conjunction with another internet service provider which was not affected , and therefore today almost all Malta is back to normal - albeit with slower connections .
George Bugeja , Zebbug , Malta Internet is very slow .
I could not connect to any sites except by using a socks server I installed on one of my servers located in USA .
I wonder why they do not use separated cables with separated routes ?
Why are the four main cables located with each other ?
It is just like putting all eggs in the same basket .
Walaa Waguih , Alexandria , Egypt Currently staying in Brazil - cannot access virginmedia.com - don´t know if this has anything to do with the above .
Roger Francomb , Sao Paulo
One of my favourite sites was unavailable earlier .
It 's back up , but from conversations there are still others who cannot access the site , some in the same country as the site 's servers .
Michael Harvey , Framingham , Massachusetts , United States
I had trouble with the net from earlier today which I thought had something to do with the local SP .
The link gets disconnected frequently and even when you are connected it is terribly slow .

Venus is glowing in infrared !
At least at night , anyway .
The Venus Express spacecraft has observed an eerie glow in the night - time atmosphere of Venus .
This infrared glow comes from nitric oxide and is showing scientists that the atmosphere of Earth ’s nearest neighbor is a temperamental place of high winds and turbulence .
Since this glow is infrared , we ca n’t see it with our eyes but lucky for us , the ESA ’s spacecraft is equipped with the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer ( VIRTIS ) instrument , which can see these wavelengths .
A glow like this has never been detected in the atmospheres of Earth or Mars , even though nitric oxide molecules are present .
So just why is Venus glowing , and what is this glow telling us ?
“ The nightglow can give us a lot of information , ” says Antonio García Muñoz , who was at the Australian National University when the research was carried out ; he is now located at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias , Tenerife , Spain .
“ It can provide details about the temperature , wind direction , composition and chemistry of an atmosphere . ”
VIRTIS has made two clear - cut detections of the so - called nightglow for nitric oxide at Venus .
This is the first time such infrared detections have been made for any planet and provide a new insight into Venus ’s atmosphere
The nightglow is ultimately caused by the Sun ’s ultraviolet light , which streams into a planet ’s atmosphere and breaks the molecules up into atoms and other simpler molecules .
The free atoms may recombine again and , in specific cases , the resulting molecule is endowed with some extra energy that is subsequently lost in the form of light .
On the day - side of the planet , any atoms that do find their way back together are outshone by the sunlight falling into the atmosphere .
But on the night - side , where atoms are transported by a vigorous diurnal circulation , the glow can be seen with appropriate instruments , such as VIRTIS .
It also highlights a new mystery .
“ These results show that there could be at least twice as much hydrogen in the upper atmosphere of Venus than we thought , ” says Delva .
The detected hydrogen ions could exist in atmospheric regions high above the surface of the planet ; but the source of these regions is unknown .
The nightglow on Venus has been seen at infrared wavelengths before , betraying oxygen molecules and the hydroxyl radical , but this is the first detection of nitric oxide at those wavelengths .
It offers data about the atmosphere of Venus that lies above the cloud tops at around 70 km .
The oxygen and hydroxyl emissions come from 90 - 100 km , whereas the nitric oxide comes from 110 - 120 km altitude .
Yet , even VIRTIS cannot see the nitric oxide nightglow all the time because it is often just too faint .
“ Luckily for us , Venus has a temperamental atmosphere , ” says García Muñoz , “ Packets of oxygen and nitrogen atoms are blown around . ”
Sometimes these become dense enough to boost the brightness of the nightglow , making it visible to VIRTIS .
Venus Express can observe the three nightglow emissions simultaneously , and this gives rise to a mystery .
The nightglows from the different molecules do not necessarily happen together .
“ Perhaps when we have more observations , we will understand the correlation between them , ” says García Muñoz .
In order to do that , the VIRTIS team plans to continue monitoring the planet , building up a database of this fascinating phenomenon .

This brief Inauguration anecdote from Chris Bodenner writing at The Daily Dish stood out to me :
It ’s just one anecdote , but : I stood with mostly African - Americans during the speech and the only time I ever heard booing of Obama , from many directions , was his shout - out to “ non-believers . ”
Are we non-believers ( * gasp * ) not liked by everyone ?!
If it ’s true , though , that ’s pretty amazing .
Not in a good way , either .
On arguably the most historic day in American history for black people , they actually went against Barack Obama — when he dared to include atheists among other Americans .
Among our many goals , we need to work on changing that perception of atheists in the African - American community over the next few years .

Two co-defendants have pleaded guilty to reduced charges and agreed to testify in the O.J. Simpson armed robbery and kidnapping case in Las Vegas .
Walter Alexander and Charles Cashmore were both in court today in Las Vegas .
In return for their testimony against OJ Simpson , Clark County District Attorney David Roger agreed to drop charges including kidnapping , armed robbery , assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy against both men .
These two upstanding individuals remain free pending sentencing .
This is more bad news for O.J. Simpson , who Alexander says " wanted guns " at the meeting with the memorabilia dealers he is accused of robbing .
It 's looking worse and worse by the day for the Juice .
Hopefully , lady friend and fellow criminal Christie Prody has been there to offer moral support .

Researchers at the Institute for Psychology of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Institute for Logic , Language and Computation of the University of Amsterdam demonstrated that two to three day old babies can detect the beat in music .
This phenomenon - termed ‘ beat induction ’ - is likely to have contributed to music ’s origin .
It enables such actions as clapping , making music together and dancing to a rhythm .
Beat induction is also considered to be uniquely human .
Even our closest evolutionary relatives , such as the chimpanzee and bonobo , do not synchronise their behaviour to rhythmic sounds .
The findings , which have just been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , challenge some earlier assumptions that beat induction is learned in the first few months of life , for example by parents rocking the infant .
Instead , the results of this collaborative European study demonstrate that beat perception is either innate or learned in the womb , as the auditory system is at least partly functional as of approximately three month before birth .
It should be noted that the auditory capabilities underlying beat induction are also necessary for bootstrapping communication by sounds , allowing infants to adapt to the rhythm of the caretaker ’s speech and to find out when to respond to it or to interject their own vocalisation .
Therefore , although these results are compatible with the notion of the genetic origin of music in humans , they do not provide the final answer in this longstanding debate .
Research method
Since it is not feasible to observe behavioural reactions in newborns , the researchers used scalp electrodes to measure electrical brain signals .
The babies wore self - adhesive ear - couplers ( see photo ) through which a simple , regular rock rhythm was delivered , consisting of hi-hat , snare , and bass drum .
Several variants of the basic rhythm were constructed by omitting strokes on non-significant positions of the rhythm ( i.e. ' non-syncopated ' in music theoretical terms ) .
These variants were played to the infants , with a ' deviant ' segment , missing the downbeat ( i.e. ' syncopated ' ) , occasionally interspersed .
Shortly after each deviant segment began , the babies ' brains produced an electrical response indicating that they had expected to hear the downbeat but had not .
This research was conducted within the EmCAP ( Emergent Cognition through Active Perception ) collaborative project funded by the European Commission ’s 6th Framework Programme for ‘ Information Society Technologies ’ .

Over on the 37signals blog , DHH writes Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding .
His argument is basically that if you continually delay fixing your data storage and retrieval layer , Moore 's Law will be there to save our ass -- over and over again .
Bzzzt .
Wrong answer .
Depending on future improvements to fix your own bad planning is a risky way to build an on - line service -- especially one you expect to grow and charge money for .
It 's easy to forget history in this industry ( as Paul pointed out in the comments on that post ) .
There was a point a few years ago when people still believed the clock speed of CPUs would be doubling roughly every 18 months for half the cost .
Putting aside that Moore 's Law is really about transistor density and not raw speed , we all ended up taking a funny little detour anyway .
Until recently , the sweet spot ( in terms of cost and power use ) was probably a dual CPU , dual core server with 16 or 32 GB of RAM .
But soon that 'll be dual quads with 32 or 64GB of RAM .
And then it 'll be quad eight core CPUs with 128 GB or whatever .
But notice that nowadays we 're not all running 6.4GHz CPUs in our servers .
Instead we 're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds .
Those two are definitely not equivalent .
A funny thing happens as you add cores and CPUs .
You begin to find that the underlying software does n't always ... get this ... scale .
That 's right .
Software designed in a primarily single or dual CPU world starts to show its age and performance limitation in a world where you have 8 , 16 , or 32 cores per server ( and more if you 're running one of those crazy Sun boxes ) .
You see , David is talking specifically about MySQL ( and probably InnoDB ) , which is currently being patched by outside developers precisely because it has multi-core issues .
Its locking is expensive and not granular enough to utilize all those cores .
It 's expensive in terms of memory use too .
And there are assumptions built into the I/O subsystem that do n't scale well in today 's world of fast multi-disk RAID units , SSDs , and SANs .
People are hitting these issues in the real world and it's definitely becoming a serious bottleneck .
See Also : The New MySQL Landscape .
Moore 's Law is no silver bullet here .
A fundamental change has occurred in the hardware platform and now we 're all playing catch - up in one way or another .
I 'll discuss this a bit in my upcoming MySQL Conference Talk too .
The world is not nearly as clear or simple as DHH is suggesting .
Perhaps they can get by with constantly postponing the work of sharding their database , but that does n't mean you should follow their lead .

Burris : ' Is it racism that is taking place ? '
They are not shy about playing the race card in Illinois .
Twenty - four hours ago the Senate was promising to reject any appointee of Blagojevich , who is white .
He reached , in the most direct way available , for the race card ; and it 's immediately in play .
“ It is a fact there are no African - Americans in the United States Senate , " Burris said Wednesday on NBC's " Today , " reiterating a statement first made Tuesday by U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush ( D - Ill ) .
" Is it racism that is taking place ?
That 's a question that someone may raise . "
ALSO : A proposed solution : I 've always thought David Paterson 's best move was to appoint himself to the Senate .
He 's a career legislator , gifted more as a communicator and coalition - builder than an executive , and has postponed the hardest decisions of his governorship to the year leading up to his 2010 election bid .
He 's also presiding over a chaotic scrap for Clinton 's Senate seat .
Now , he could solve his problems and ease concern for diversity in the Senate in one fell swoop .
And with the press in its maximal outrage mode over Caroline Kennedy 's presumption , his move might be seen as delightful , rather than gross , chutzpah .
As interface designers , we want our work to look good and also to make sense .
Every element on the screen should please the eye , and at the same time interfaces are n’t merely art objects .
They have work to do .
Interfaces need to provide information and clearly indicate the possible courses of action .
These two factors — sex appeal and function , prettiness and clarity , decoration and meaning — they often co-exist when the designer is skillful .
But still there is a potential for conflicts between how we want a design to look and how that design is understood by our customers .
I recently ran into one of these questions of decoration versus meaning on GitHub .
Global navigation on GitHub
After you log in to GitHub , the global navigation appears at the right - hand side of the header .
The navigation block is wrapped and held together by a rounded rectangle .
Look at the rounded rectangle that holds this nav block together .
There is a grey border around the outside and the whole block has a light blue background .
The border and background are decorative .
They stylize the block and add visual interest .
To help you see that these elements are decorative , I made a quick comparison with the original on top and a new version below with no border or background :
Both versions are pleasing to the eye , and the functionality appears to be unchanged between them .
You might say the difference between the two is merely aesthetic or personal and leave it at that .
However there is more to the story .
The decision to wrap the links with a containing element goes beyond style .
The decorative container actually changes the meaning of the links and , as we will see , it causes a problem for GitHub .
To see why , first we need to take a look at how containing elements affect the way customers interpret a design .
Containers affect the meaning of the elements they contain
When you place a link inside a container , you suggest a relationship between the container and the link .
Technically speaking the container “ scopes ” the link .
For a familiar example , think of the edit links you often see in web applications :
The two edit links above are scoped by their containers .
The viewer expects the top edit link to edit Michael Bluth because the link appears in the same box as Michael ’s name .
The edit links are the same .
It ’s the containers that make the difference .
So how does this apply to GitHub ’s navigation ?
The issue is with the “ repositories : all ” link .
GitHub hosts thousands of public repositories that anyone can browse , and each user may also have their own repositories .
That ’s where we hit an ambiguity in the design of their navigation .
GitHub ’s decoration implies a scope on the repositories link
When the global navigation block is wrapped in a border , the “ all ” link appears to be scoped by the current user .
If you clicked the link , you would expect to see repositories that belong to that user only .
Compare that to the version without a border .
Here it ’s not so clear whether the “ all ” link would take you to Michael ’s repositories or the master list of all users ’ repositories .
Not just decoration : confusing behavior on GitHub
At first the border of GitHub ’s navigation looked like it was only a question of decoration or style .
Now we ’ve seen that aesthetic decisions can also influence how viewers understand a design .
In GitHub ’s case , the expectation created by the scoped repositories link does n’t match up with the behavior .
When you click the “ all ” repositories link , you do not actually see the repositories for the current user .
Instead you are taken to the master list of public repositories for all users .
It turns out that if you want to see just the repos for the current user , you need to click the user ’s name beside the avatar .
Tricky !
Redesigns that take scope into account
How could we tweak GitHub ’s design to remove the confusion ?
One option is to remove the container and reorder the elements so there is no implication at all that the repository links are scoped by the current user :
This redesign uses visual principles to make a meaningful difference in the way the block is interpreted .
By moving the avatar to the right side and removing the border , there is no longer an urge to assume the repository links relate to the current user .
Another possibility is to keep the decorative container from the original and use copywriting to overpower the suggested scope :
The second redesign uses two links — ” all ” and “ mine ” — to differentiate between the master list of all repositories and the list of repositories belonging only to the current user .
Whether visual principles or words are used , both redesigns remove the ambiguity around the “ all ” link and set clear expectations .
GitHub is a wonderful service and I know I ’m picking hairs here .
At the same time , UI is a game of subtlety .
The eyes and brain are sensitive and incredible faculties .
As designers we should be very aware that sometimes when we design for the eyes we can also forget to design for the brain .
I hope these examples help you to become more sensitive to the fine line between decorative elements and elements that change the meaning of your interfaces .
Scientists have long known that interrupting the 24 - hour circadian rhythm plays havoc with the lives and health of medical , military and airline personnel , factory employees and travelers .
A new paper by University of Notre Dame biologist Giles Duffield and a team of researchers that appears in this month ’s edition of the journal Current Biology sheds new light on circadian timing systems and focuses on a key gene that seems to regulate the response of the circadian clock to light signals .
“ Circadian rhythms are important and exciting because they pervade many aspects of biochemistry , physiology and behavior , either subtly or overtly , ” Duffield said .
“ For example , the human sleep - wake cycle is a very obvious rhythm and tightly gated to the night , while perhaps less obvious is that virtually all hormones oscillate with a 24 - hour rhythm and up to 10 percent of genes in each cell are rhythmically controlled . ”
An estimated 16 percent of the U.S. working population is involved in rotational shift work , and a significant population is affected by jet lag and related sleep - wake disorders .
The impact of the large shifts in the body ’s internal clock that these individuals experience can be profound , contributing to increased accident rates , medical errors and the development of particular illnesses .
“ Both the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979 and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 occurred late at night or early in the morning , ” Duffield said .
“ Most truck accidents occur around 2 a.m .
Incidents of cancer and cardiovascular disease are elevated in trans -Atlantic airline staff and in shift workers . ”
The master circadian clock in the human resides within the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamic brain and receives direct input from the retina ( eye ) through which the clock can be reset or synchronized on a daily basis to the prevailing light - dark cycle .
This provides both time of day and also time of year information to the brain and body .
Things can go wrong with the internal clocks when either the clock system or its light input pathway is disrupted .

Using DNA microarray techniques , Duffield and the other researchers identified an important gene called the “ Inhibitor of DNA - binding 2 ” ( Id2 ) and found that the gene is rhythmically expressed in various tissues including the suprachiasmatic nucleus .
“ In the last few years , my laboratory has focused on a family of transcription factor genes expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus , liver and heart , ” Duffield said .
“ In conjunction with colleagues at Dartmouth Medical School and Norris Cotton Cancer Center , we produced a knockout mouse that does not express the Id2 gene and is thus null for the functional Id2 protein .
By exposing these mice to a time - zone change in their light - dark cycle , we were able to examine the effect of artificial jet lag .
We altered the light - dark conditions for these mice to produce an effect that was the equivalent of a person flying from Athens to Los Angeles , a 10 - hour delay of their cycle .
“ We discovered that the knockout mice took only one or two days to recover from jet lag , while unaltered mice required four or five days to fully adjust .
It ’s like we removed the hand brake on their molecular machinery . ”
The experimental results have important implications for understanding the development and functioning of the circadian clock in the brain and peripheral tissues such as the liver and heart .
“ Eight years ago , researchers realized that even if you destroy the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus or examine peripheral organs in isolation , there are still working clock systems in many other tissues of the body , ” Duffield said .
advertisement
It turns out that many of the cells throughout our bodies have an intrinsic circadian clock mechanism and that jet lag and shift work can produce internal asynchrony between each of our tissue - specific clocks .
Our brains , on a daily basis , generate the hormonal and neuronal signals that influence the cellular clocks in the peripheral tissues .
If this communication line is disrupted , the liver , for example , ends up on one time zone , and the brain on another .
These peripheral clocks in the body ’s organ systems cannot themselves receive information directly .
To know what time of day it is in relation to the external environment , these tissues depend on signals originating in the suprachiasmatic nucleus : every day the brain sends signals that inform the peripheral cells to adjust the phase of their rhythms , like the pin of a wrist watch being moved a little bit forward or backward .
If we could somehow tinker with this system in the adult human , it might be possible to reduce the effects of jet - lag and shift work by rapidly adjusting our internal clock .
Duffield and the team of researchers may have uncovered an important target for such remedies by identifying the Id2 gene , which appears to in some way regulate the magnitude of response of the circadian clock to light signals .
The work was supported by the Royal Society , the Wellcome Trust , the Theodora B. Betz Foundation , the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and Notre Dame .
The CSIRO is developing solar cells that can be printed out by the metre , like banknotes .
Scientists say the cells would be printed onto large areas of flexible light plastic using technology already developed by CSIRO for the latest banknote production .
The cost of current solar cell technology remains an obstacle for domestic households .
The CSIRO 's Gerry Wilson says once the printable cells reach the market in about five years , the cells will probably be much more efficient .
" The print trials that we were conducting today , those printers typically run at 200 metres a minute , which is 100 kilometres per day .
" If you were printing a solar cell that had only 10 per cent efficiency say , then we calculate that over five months , you'd be able to print enough plastic solar cells to generate a gigawatt of power . "
The CSIRO says the technology could end up being used within the windows of houses .
Dr Wilson says printing solar cells heralds an electronic revolution .
" You could obviously put them on the roof or any other solid frontage like walls and things like that , " he said .
" But because we can lay down these polymer films with different thicknesses you could make them transparent or semi- transparent so even windows or architectural features like that could all be used . "
He also says the technology could even , in principle , be used on water .
" These plastic films that we 're making now also float you do n't necessarily have to be constrained on putting them on land , " he said .
" When you consider the amount of water we lose through evaporation on dams , would n't it be smart to put a whole heap of films on top of your dam . "

GOP appears in deep trouble in California CALIFORNIA
As registration sinks in state , fewer areas safely Republican

With their registrations sinking and their political clout withering , California Republicans have come out of the November election in danger of slipping into political irrelevance across much of the state .
" There 's been a broad repudiation of traditional conservative Republicans in California , " said Tony Quinn , a former GOP analyst and co-editor of the California Target Book , which focuses on political contests in the state .
" There are almost no areas in the state that can be considered safely Republican anymore . "
Since 2004 , Republican registration has dropped by more than 317,000 in the state , while Democrats have picked up 563,000 new voters .
Five previously GOP counties , including San Joaquin , Stanislaus and San Bernardino , now have more Democrats than Republicans .
Things are n't any better in the Legislature , where Democrats hold commanding majorities in both the Assembly and state Senate .
The Democrats picked up three seats in the Assembly last month , including the last partisan post held by a Republican in the nine - county Bay Area .
And with Democrats moving to eliminate the two - thirds majority requirement for passage of a state budget , the GOP could lose the last bit of real power it holds in the Legislature .
Ron Nehring , chairman of the state Republican Party , does n't paint nearly as grim a picture for California Republicans , especially in the wake of the pasting the party took across the nation in the Nov. 4 election .
" In a year where all the externals favored the Democrats in California , they came away with little to show for it , " Nehring said .
" They won a net three seats in the Assembly , but did n't pick up anything in the state Senate or Congress . "
In addition , Democrat Barack Obama 's sweep in the presidential race cost Republicans big across the West .
The GOP lost House seats in Arizona , New Mexico , Nevada , Colorado and Idaho , along with Senate seats in New Mexico , Colorado and Oregon .
" Just holding the line was a real accomplishment this year , " said Steve Frank , a Republican consultant who runs the conservative California Political News and Views blog .
Republicans , however , had to hold that line in places where there should n't have been a battle .
Nehring , for example , pointed to the GOP success in electing state Sen .
Tom McClintock to a Northern California congressional seat and in fighting back a strong challenge to Rep. Ken Calvert , R- Corona ( Riverside County ) .
But McClintock , one of the state 's best - known Republicans , beat Democrat Charlie Brown by only about 1,800 votes in the strongly conservative Fourth Congressional District , where the GOP has a 14 percentage point registration advantage .
Eked - out victory
Calvert , an eight - term incumbent who won with 60 percent of the vote in 2006 , barely eked out a 6,000 - vote victory this time .
Obama 's 61 to 37 percent victory over Republican John McCain in California - along with the Democrat 's 72 percent support among voters aged 18 to 34 - added to the party 's worries about the future .
In 2010 , Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger will step down as governor , Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer will be up for re-election and the entire slate of constitutional offices will be on the ballot , along with the usual mix of legislative and congressional seats .
A Democratic sweep would be a disaster for Republicans , and party leaders know it .
" The party has a lot of rebuilding to do , " said state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner , a likely candidate for governor in 2010 .
" The Republican brand has been tarnished across the country , and we have no one to blame but ourselves for not standing true to our ideals , like accountability and keeping spending under control . "
The biggest advantage for Republicans in the next election is that the Democrats - and the voters - wo n't have George W. Bush to kick around anymore .
" Everything about Bush and ( Vice President Dick ) Cheney turned off residents of California , not just Democrats but also independent voters , " Quinn said .
The growing Democratic strength in California is going to force Republicans to look for different types of candidates , he added .
" Individual Republicans can win if they can self - finance ( their campaigns ) , be socially libertarian and fiscally conservative , " Quinn said .
" That means they can't be hostile to gays and need to be at least moderately pro-choice . "
While plenty of Republicans wo n't be so fast to write off strong conservative candidates , Poizner , former eBay CEO Meg Whitman and former San Jose Rep .
Tom Campbell , the three names most mentioned for the GOP governor 's primary in 2010 , all are Northern California residents from the party 's moderate wing .
Poizner and Whitman both are former Silicon Valley business people wealthy enough to pay for their campaigns .
Structural changes
Structural changes also are needed to bring the party back into serious contention in California , said Nehring , the GOP party chief .
" We need to pay more attention to local races , putting aside the quaint notion of ' nonpartisan ' offices , " he said .
" There 's no such thing as a nonpartisan office in California .
Every office is an opportunity to put Republican ideas into action . "
Poizner wants to see the party improve its grassroots efforts and focus on a message of rebuilding California 's economy through job growth , innovation and entrepreneurship , an agenda he believes has an appeal beyond Republicans .
" There 's no question Republicans have hurt themselves , " he said .
" If we continue on the same path , we will become a one - party state . "

Helping women to make informed choices
Welcome we are here to help
This Site is dedicated to all the women that were told they had a choice ,
but never had it explained to them that there is more than one .
As not quite everybody 's favourite bluestocking correctly ( what else ? ) informed Paxo in Monday 's University Challenge , when reversed the name of the 44th President is the Latin for " I will love " .
That 's " amabo " for you ignorami out there , future first person singular of " amo " .
The question doubtless obsessing the bunker - dwellers at No 10 today is whether Mr Obama will indeed love Gordon Brown when he takes his splendiferous " Mundum Servabo " tour ( " I shall save the world " ; as hurriedly amended from the original " Mundum Servavi " , " I have saved the world " ) to Washington next week .
The answer , as Gail Trimble would be the first to state , is that Mr Obama will certainly love Gordon Brown , or at least pretend to .
A thousand flashbulbs will record the handshake , arm - clasping and beamish grins – the one so engagingly natural , the other suggesting an obsolete robot with trapped wind – when the two meet .
All the usual cobblers about the special relationship , or " special partnership " as we must now learn to call it , will be trotted out .
The Prez will shower on Gordon the warmth due him for pledging more British troops for Afghanistan , and may even be a touch faux deferential towards the older man , something he always does beautifully .
Love will be all around , and Gordon will feel it in his fingers , not to mention his toes .
So much for the starter for 10 .
It 's the bonus questions that look tricky .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Will all the love do anything to save our self - styled Saviour from the electoral Armageddon towards which he is headed ?
What can Gordon possibly tell the joint session of Congress a week today about how to rescue the global economy , when he still has n't told us diddly ?
And even if he does have a miracle up his sleeve , will his audience take a blind bit of notice , or is this another of those charades designed solely to keep a pliant client kingdom sweet ?
Even Gail might struggle with that lot , but before I make a wild stab at answering them myself , a brief lurch into the bleeding obvious .
Arranging this visit at all is a major triumph for a man who could use one of those .
God alone knows what frenzied sycophancy was unleashed on the West Wing to secure it , but to beat Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy in the race to pay homage to is quite an achievement .
Admittedly the Japanese PM Mr Aso ( and who knew the Mind Your Language scriptwriters had progressed to naming international statesmen ? ) was the first current leader to kiss the ring .
But there is no shame in being outsprinted to Washington by the world 's second largest economy , with something to teach us about a 15 - year depression barely leavened an iota by flooding the banks with the free money ( Buzzzz .
" Corpus Christi , Trimble " " Quantitative easing ? " )
As for that speech to both houses of Congress , he may not be the first person from Downing Street to get the gig , but it is a singular honour whether or not it helps secure him a future .
Besides , what a nice change to be able to address two houses without having to hear Jacqui Smith plap out her odiously legalistic defence .
So all in all , a rousing hats off to the old boy for this victory .
Having said all that , I 'd bet our unhappily non-tracker mortgage it proves entirely Pyrrhic in domestic political terms .
However passionate our crush on Obama , there is no guarantee that his stardust will rub off on Gordon .
More likely is the reverse ... that the photogenic contrast between Yesterday 's Man and The Master of Tomorrow will echo the one between Obama and John McCain during the presidential debates , and makes our lad look more fatigued , sallow , waxen and cadaverous than ever .
Meanwhile , apart from the ritualistic compliments he will pay and professions of deathless loyalty he will pledge , it 's hard to imagine what he could tell Congress that wo n't sound absurd and vainglorious on this side of the ocean .
" Mr President , Madam Speaker , members of Congress , here in Washington , of all places , I can not tell a lie , " he might intone .
" I reserve those for my people back home , whom I keep reminding that thanks to me Britain is uniquely well placed to withstand the global downturn .
In all truth , then , I 'd like to congratulate the President on his commitment to halving the US deficit .
I 'm taking a marginally different approach myself , by doubling ours every five minutes , but hey , what 's a tiny difference of opinion between special partners ?
The fact , my friends , is that Britain is done for .
Utterly , utterly ruined .
Heeeeeeellllppp !
Even if he has a more nuanced script , the timing is awful .
He will be posing before the planet as its top ranked proponent of fiscal responsibility just as Rip Van Winkle Britain awakes to the realisation that his recklessness at the Treasury has deepened the slump , and made the apocalypse of which we all live in mortal terror that much more likely .
If he is n't careful , he could look delusional at best , and a great fat hypocrite at worst .
And even if he is , all the clapping and cheering will ring dangerously hollow in British ears .
So we must n't be fooled by all the grandeur and imperial flummery , let alone the mandatory standing ovations .
Tony Blair had about 372 of those , when he so presciently reassured Congress that history would judge the Iraq escapade a just and noble cause .
The next day David Kelly killed himself .
Let 's wish Gordon well as he packs his suitcase , and without sarcasm .
The dreadful news of yesterday reminds us that he too has endured the ultimate tragedy , and born it with magnificent dignity , and that there is much to admire .
No one should begrudge him the morale boost that this jolly will bring .
But I 'd guess it will be wretchedly short - lived , and that all the sonorous swanking on the grandest stage will backfire .
You can hardly fail to see why Mr Brown Goes To Washington looks like a masterstroke in Downing Street and beyond .
But as someone who knew Latin almost as well as Gail Trimble so very nearly put it , beware the ideas of March .
They can look extremely daft in April .
Or even in March .
In Searching for the Wrong - Eyed Jesus , Jim White 's documentary on Southern folk music , storytelling , and religion , banjoist Lee Sexton describes the traditional music of his native Kentucky hills as " the old lonesome sound . "
" These old hills are kind of sad looking , " Sexton says .
" You get to feeling down and out , looking at these old hills , sitting on your front porch , and you get to playing these old tunes and it helps you .
It builds your morale up a little bit . "
The old tunes that Sexton was talking about are the ones that have been with us for hundreds of years : hymns and gospels , murder ballads , protest songs , African - American spirituals , old bluegrass and country standards .
Whether you hear them on albums by Dylan or Springsteen , or in films like O Brother , Where Art Thou ? or Cold Mountain , they are songs that get reworked again and again , that cut to the heart and soul of the American story .
In his memoirs , Alan Lomax recalls the days on the Lower East Side of New York when Lead Belly and a young Woody Guthrie would stay up all night trading off on such songs , coming home after a show and playing for hours : " They had their whole , fresh , powerful , pure folk repertory intact : living , vibrant , and with the impact of a country mule ready to kick a hole into the future . "
In keeping with this tradition , we at Splice Today present to you our first annual mix of original recordings of traditional folk music .
Many thanks to all the bands involved , as well as to Nick Sjostrom at Clean Cuts Music & Audio for his production assistance and Samantha Strand for her beautiful cover art .

Roman Polanski Asks Court to Dismiss 30 Year Old Child Sex Case
Academy Award winning Polish - French director and filmmakerhas been living in self - imposed exile in France since fleeing the U.S. in 1978 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13 year old girl in Los Angeles .
His legal team is in the process of filing a new brief asking that the case be dismissed .
The filmmaker is the widower of actress Sharon Tate , who was murdered in 1968 by Charles Manson in Los Angeles .
She was eight months pregnant with their first child , a son .
His legal trouble started in 1977 when he hired a young female model to do a photo shoot .
He gave her Quaaludes and champagne and had sex with her in a hot tub .
Polanski , 75 , was indicted on 6 felony counts and pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor .
He was locked up for a 42 day psychological evaluation and fled the country prior to sentencing .
It is likely his sentence would have been for 16 months to three years in prison .
Polanski has continued to direct , including the 2002 Holocaust film The Pianist , which won him the Best Director Academy Award .
Other major successes include Rosemary 's Baby and Chinatown .
New efforts to wipe out the charges against him come after an HBO documentary , Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired premiered in June 2008 .
The show featured several of the principals in the case , including retired Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson , Polanski 's original prosecutor , who said that if he had been in Polanski 's shoes he also would have fled the country .
The documentary portrayed the late Superior Court Judge Laurence J. Rittenband as a publicity hound who held news conferences and extrajudicial meetings about the case .
He was advised by former Deputy District Attorney David Wells , who recommended that Polanski be sent away for diagnostic study , which was illegal .
Wells also reportedly schemed to inflame the judge by showing him photos of Polanski in Germany with girls at an Oktoberfest party , in an apparent misrepresentation .
The kicker is that Wells was n't even assigned to the case .
Sandi Gibbons , a spokesperson for Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley , indicates that they have not yet been served with the new motion and have only heard about it through the media .
The female victim in the case is now 43 years old and remains steadfast in her desire that the charges be dropped .

To grind , wait for some hip - hop or house music to play , then look around the dance floor for some partners you want to grind with .
Once you find the right person , move close enough to start dancing .
When you want to start grinding , the guy should stand behind the girl as they begin moving their hips in a circular motion .
As you find your rhythm , the guy can put his hands on the girl ’s hips as the girl bends her knees and gets lower down , keeping her booty in the air .
If you want to grind in a group instead of with one partner , keep your eyes on the people around you so you can adjust to their movements .
Whether grinding with one person or in a group , check in with those around you to make sure they 're leaning in to the experience .
If they seem uncomfortable or you are n't sure if they want to grind , ask if it 's ok before going any further .
To learn how to grind while facing your partner , keep reading !
( CNN ) --
A former Utah policeman is a suspect in at least three of Monday 's four rush - hour shootings near Dallas , Texas , including one of two fatal attacks , police said Tuesday .
CNN affiliate KSL in Salt Lake City , Utah , provided this file photo of the Dallas suspect , Brian Smith .
The suspect , Brian Smith , tried to commit suicide after the Monday - evening shootings and was in a hospital in serious condition , Dallas police detective Lt. Craig Miller said .
Police used ballistic tests to link Smith , a Utah state police officer for 12 years , to the shootings in which one driver was killed , one was injured by shattered glass and one escaped uninjured , Dallas police detective Lt. Craig Miller said .
Miller said it is unclear if Smith was involved in the other fatal shooting , which was the first attack of the evening .
Four motorists were attacked along a three - mile stretch near and on the LBJ Freeway , about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas , on Monday evening , police said .
The first attack , which happened in Garland , Texas , about 5:41 p.m. , killed Jorge Lopez .
Garland police said Lopez , 20 , was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car , killing him .
A few minutes after the Garland shooting and two miles away on LBJ Freeway , a gunman fired at two tractor - trailers .
Do n't Miss WFAA : Read local coverage of the shootings
While one driver escaped injuries , William Scott Miller , 42 , of Frankfort , Kentucky , was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck , police said .
" He was going to be traveling home , " Craig Miller said .
" He was about to park his rig .
He was going to get on a plane to fly to be with his wife and children for the Christmas season and then come back to this location . "
Miller called the truck driver a hero , saying he was able to control his rig before he died -- preventing other motorists from being hurt .
The fourth attack came a mile west on LBJ Freeway when gunfire shattered the windshield of another tractor - trailer .
The bullets missed the driver , but flying glass caused minor cuts , police said .
Miller said video from the Garland shooting is available , and specialists were trying to enhance it to bring out details .
Businesses along the other routes also may have video that will help police , he said .
A friend of Lopez 's said he was " a straight - up good guy , never had problems with anybody , never started anything with anybody . "
" So that 's why this seems so out of the blue , " Lopez 's friend said .
All About Dallas
This article gathers information about the origins of 9/11 conspiracy theories .
There might have been rumours of various theories not mentioned here , but I have documented the most influential pieces of early 9/11 conspiracy theories .
September 11 , 2001 : First speculations of an inside job and controlled demolition .
Controlled demolition was speculated by David Rostcheck ( see here ) .
Inside job and all the usual conspiracy roar was bullhorned by Alex Jones ( his September 11 show on torrent here ) .
Alex Jones is not mentioned here as an originator of any particular claim , since he parrots everything he hears and claims conspiracy around every corner .
September 13 , 2001 : The author of the website serendipity .li , Peter Meyer , released his first controlled demolition article , THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING .
September 15 , 2001 : The first NORAD stand - down implication was published by the editor of the Emperor 's New Clothes website , Jared Israel .
He wrote an article called : CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE OR TREASON ? , which was later followed by many other articles on that site , concentrating on the same theme .
His earlier works include this one from July 29 , 2000 .
In the article he claims that the 1995 Srebrenica massacre was a hoax and Serbs were the actual victims .
September 17 , 2001 : The mention of Operation Northwoods is archived possibly for the first time here ( although Alex Jones already mentioned this on September 11 , 2001 among his other usual paranoia ) .
Later Northwoods is also mentioned by Carol A. Valentine on October 6 , 2001 on her article .
October 6 , 2001 : Numerous conspiracy claims see the daylight in this article by Carol A. Valentine called : OPERATION 911 : NO SUICIDE PILOTS .
The conspiracy claims raised by this article include :
Remote controlled planes
No hijackers involved
Downplaying of Hani Hanjour 's piloting skills
Global Hawk at Pentagon
Passports found almost intact are fake
Flight 93 was shot down
‘ Arabs with boxcutters ’
8 mile debris area at Shanksville
Atta 's luggage findings are fake
And she also states the infamous “ WHO WRITES THIS STUFF ” –line , later used by Dylan Avery on Loose Change
I wonder , if Dylan knew who he was quoting .
Carol A. Valentine ’s web page introduces us to topics , like
The American Coup d’Etat and the War for Jewish Supremacy
Imperium Judacum
The Great Holocaust Irony
Etc. etc .
Carol A. Valentine denies holocaust and provides links to dozens of sites promoting these stories .
Her site is very anti-semitic .
October 12 , 2001 : The first lengthy analysis about no arabs on the passenger lists , which also further sparked the remote controlled planes –theories .
The article was called : THE PERPLEXING PUZZLE OF THE PUBLISHED PASSENGER LISTS , published by Gary North .
This detail was first noticed September 28 , 2001 by < AFJS@webtv.net > on alt.culture.alaska .
He first mentions this on September 22 , 2001 , but on 28th he gives actual links to prove his point .
Carol Valentine also catches this post by AFJS and mentions it in her article on October 6 , 2001 .
October 15 , 2001 : The theory that a released 9/11 - related Bin Laden video is fake is written by Carol A. Valentine in an article called : THE TALIBAN HOME VIDEO .
October 21 , 2001 : First serious truther analysis of the WTC collapse .
Article called : MUSLIMS SUSPEND THE LAWS OF PHYSICS , by Jim McMichael .
Topics of this article include :
jet fuel ca n’t melt steel
black smoke indicates a died down fire , either low on temperature or starved for oxygen
falling into own footprint
the tops of the towers should have toppled over
everything has to fail simultaneously
first time in the history of tall city buildings
pulverized concrete
the core should have been left standing
design loads , the towers should have been able to support the weight
This article was quickly mirrored in numerous sites .
This article by Jim McMichael has had a tremendous effect on the 9/11 conspiracy theories .
The article was discovered in January , 2002 by a young Australian guitarist , Gerard Holmgren ( see January 2002 ) .
Eric Hufschmid ( author of Painful Questions , video : Painful Deceptions ) started questioning the official story after being pointed to this article ( see Mid - 2002 ) .
Jeff King in turn cites Eric Hufschmid ( see September 16 , 2002 ) .
Jim Hoffman ( creator of WTC7.net , 911 Research .
WTC7.net , and 911 Review.com ) started questioning the official story after reading this article on March , 2003 .
David Ray Griffin in turn cited Eric Hufschmid , Jeff King , Peter Meyer , and Jim Hoffman about controlled demolition in " New Pearl Harbor " early 2004 .
Steven Jones started questioning the official collapse story in 2005 , after being introduced to Jim Hoffman ’s work .
And so on .
At the end of his article , Jim McMichael links to three articles , all written by Carol A. Valentine .
These two might have had some early links , since Carol A. Valentine links to some 30 articles related to 9/11 on her website .
Only two of these linked articles are written by some other author than herself , one being this article by Jim McMichael .
The beginning of 2002 : WTC 7 demolition , by Rosalee Grable of www.thewebfairy.com , a site that was publishing information which pointed out that the towers fell due to controlled demolitions .
One of the things that led Rosalee to this conclusion was that , after poring over single - frame video ' captures ' for hours on end , she noticed the WTC7 ' squibs ' .
Gerard Holmgren was introduced to Rosalee Grable via her website .
Gerard Holmgren , Rosalee Grable and a man called Scott Loughrey soon joined forces , nowadays promoting the no planes hit the WTC - theories .
January 20 , 2002 : An early and extensive summary of conspiracy theories with multiple links emerges , courtesy of MalcontentX , titled : September 11 : Unanswered Questions .
March , 2002 : Australian guitarist Gerard Holmgren , inspired by the article ‘ Muslims Suspend the Laws of Physics ’ by Jim McMichael , ran the collapse times through some very basic ' physics '
( The Law of Falling Bodies which resulted from the works of Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton ) , and came to the conclusion that those Towers did , indeed , drop at free - fall speeds , and that could only result from controlled demolitions .
Gerard Holmgren found Jeff King in early 2002 , gave Jeff the ' falling bodies ' insight , and Jeff was supposedly the first to publish that insight .
March 8 , 2002 : A book titled L’Effroyable imposture ( 9/11 : The Big Lie ) is released by Thierry Meyssan and extraordinary amount of conspiracy theories see the daylight .
This book also popularized the 9/11 conspiracy theories .
The book has been translated to 28 languages .
He lists his sources here .
Meyssan did not travel himself from Paris to Washington but used correspondents to interview the eyewitnesses .
Claims of this book include :
9/11 was a US government false flag operation
no plane hit the Pentagon
remote controlled planes and controlled demolition at WTC
9/11 used as a pretext of war in Afghanistan
Osama Bin Laden a fabrication of US intelligence
no film footage of the Pentagon explosion exists
eyewitness testimonies of the Pentagon crash are suspicious , contradictory or flatly incredible
photos offer no evidence of the debris typical of an airplane crash
the area of destruction to the Pentagon is impossibly small given the size and span of the craft
Sources :
L’Effroyable imposture
http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901020520-237165,00.html
He launched the book on one of France 's trashiest talk shows , and he followed up with a string of controversy - churning TV appearances that further piqued public curiosity .
This book went on top of the weekly French sales charts in the spring of 2002 and sold a total of 164 100 copies in France , and over half a million copies internationally in the year 2002 .
The success of this book was one key element in encouraging and inspiring other conspiracy theorists .
For example Eric Hufschmid has admitted this inspiration .
Meyssan also published a website called “ Hunt The Boeing ” around the time of the release of his book .
In this book Meyssan presented the idea of no plane at the Pentagon .
Three months later , in June 2002 , he released another book titled " Le Pentagate " ( The Pentagate ) , in which he for the first time presented the theory , that a missile hit the Pentagon .
US government response to the contents of this book :
http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jun/28-581634.html
March 10 , 2002 : An article called FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLE PLANES is released .
The author is supposedly a person using the alias " Snake Plissken " , who was a Carol A. Valentine reader and provided her with this theory , released on Carol 's website .
This is the first article , that suggests plane swaps .
According to this scenario , all four " hijacked " aircraft were switched to remote controlled commuter jets filled with incendiaries / explosives or a cruise missile ( POD theory started here ? ) .
The original planes landed at a single airport or air base , transferring their passengers to a single aircraft , the one that crashed in Pennsylvania .
Meanwhile , remotely controlled aircraft of various types carried out the actual attacks .
Other suggestions of this article :
Voice simulation used to fake the phone calls
" Mom , this is Mark Bingham . " - line is fake
Well trained American soldiers would kill thousands of innocent American civilians to achieve a bigger objective .
If they would n't they were not trained well .
The low passenger count on each flight is suspicious
Mid – 2002 : “ PAINFUL QUESTIONS ” by Eric Hufschmid is released .
Eric Hufschmid started questioning the official story on January 18 , 2002 .
He read the article “ Muslims Suspend The Laws Of Physics ” by Jim McMichael .
He credits an internet personality called Geeman for pointing this article out to him .
“ On the 18th of January I was looking through some of Geeman 's links and I came across an article that seemed familiar .
This article suggested that explosives were used to destroy the towers .
The explosives did not seem to be the familiar aspect of this site , however .
Rather , the remarks about pancakes and Muslim magicians seemed familiar .
It was that article by Jim McMichael with the title “ Muslims Suspend The Laws Of Physics ” .
Now , in mid-January , I understood what he was complaining about , although I still had not figured out what the pancakes had to do with the collapse . ”
http://www.erichufschmid.net/PainfulQuestionsPurpose.html
He went on and did further research , eventually writing the book “ Painful Questions ” released in Mid – 2002 and later releasing the video Painful Deceptions .
In this book he includes many rare WTC photos to prove his case of an inside job and controlled demolition , asks why no video of flight 77 crash has been released , why so few people know about WTC 7 and its collapse and why seismic stations did n’t pick up the crash of flight 77 .
This book was one source used by Jeff King in his controlled demolition analysis , referenced by David Ray Griffin in his book " The New Pearl Harbor " as well as Andreas von Bulow ( a retired Defense Minister of Germany ) in his book “ Die CIA und der 11 .
September ” ( The CIA and September 11 ) .
September 16 , 2002 : Jeff King ( PlaguePuppy ) was the one who took apart the aspects of the demolition for a more detailed examination .
He talked much about pyroclastic flows .
http://www.plaguepuppy.net/public_html/physics/
http://www.plaguepuppy.net/public_html/collapse%20update/
He also did a lot to pioneer the recognition that it was n't just conventional explosives .
http://st12.startlogic.com/~xenonpup/spire/The%20Strange%20Collapse%20of%20the%20Spire.htm
http://st12.startlogic.com/~xenonpup/dust%20trails/
“ As difficult as it may be to accept the possibility of a controlled demolition with conventional explosives , we are faced here with the additional difficulty of a process that seems to defy the laws of physics .
But perhaps what we are seeing instead is a technology based on aspects of physics not generally known , but that exist as proven science for those privy to the world of black technology .
Given the tremendous funding for advanced weapons programs it is not unreasonable to think that whole new areas of physics may have been developed and exploited for weapons technology in the past few decades . ”
Note :
It is difficult to trace , where the Mini-Nuke and Thermite theories originated , but both are already mentioned in multiple posts written in 2002 .
( CNN ) -- Marjorye
Heeney knew something was wrong when she saw a bulging cloud of black dust darken the sky .
Drought - like conditions dried this Kern River bed last year near Bakersfield , California .
She then heard an eerie , train - like whistle as fierce winds rattled her front door and windows .
When she looked outside , hordes of grasshoppers and crows swarmed over her father 's barren farm .
After the storm broke , her father walked outside and muttered curses as he scanned the horizon for rain clouds .
" I can remember my dad just watching the sky so closely , " Heeney says .
" A sprinkle would excite him so much . "
That 's how Heeney , now 83 , describes growing up on an Oklahoma farm during the Dust Bowl storms in the 1930s .
For much of that decade , " black blizzards " -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged much of the nation .
Now a new generation of Americans is again anxiously looking to the sky .
Drought has returned to the United States , and some warn that more tough days are ahead .
The value of water is starting to become apparent in America .
Over the past three years a drought has affected large swaths of the country , and conflicts over water usage may become commonplace in the future , climatologists say .
" Our focus is oil , but the critical need for water is going to make water the most significant natural resource that we 're going to have to worry about in the future , " says Larry Fillmer , executive director of the Natural Resources Management & Development Institute at Auburn University in Alabama .
At least 36 states expect to face water shortages within the next five years , according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office .
According to the National Drought Mitigation Center , several regions in particular have been hit hard : the Southeast , Southwest and the West .
Texas , Georgia and South Carolina have suffered the worst droughts this year , the agency said .
Yet most people do n't need scientists to tell them there 's a water shortage .
Plenty of cities have implemented water bans while state squabbles over water usage are common in some regions .
What may surprise people , though , are the causes for the recent drought .
It 's not global warming , some climatologists say .
The droughts are caused by rapid population growth and unwise agricultural choices .
John R. Christy , a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville , says the last three years have been drier than usual in many parts of the United States , but overall there 's been no shortage of rainfall .
He says the U.S. mainland experienced worse droughts in the 12th and 16th centuries .
" The demand for water has gone up , " Christy says .
" The demand has skyrocketed in places like California and New Mexico because they 've tried to grow crops in deserts . "
Even drought conditions in the Southeast can't be blamed on a shortage of rainfall , Christy says .
The region 's water delivery systems can't keep pace with the growth , he says .
" The rain is still falling , but you 're out of water because the storage facilities are not big enough , " Christy says .
There 's also a public perception that ordinary people are wasting more water , but that 's not true , says Mark Svoboda , a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center .
" Per capita use of water is down because we 're learning to be more efficient , " Svoboda says .
Water shortages do n't have to remain a fact of modern life , drought experts say .
Many offer the same solutions : Build better water delivery systems to accommodate population growth , develop more efficient uses of irrigation , and shift agriculture from the West to the East where it 's easier and cheaper to water crops .
Svoboda believes a change in attitude is even more vital than changing habits .
" We take water for granted , " he says .
" We think it 's a cheap commodity that 's always going to be there . "
Heeney , the Dust Bowl survivor , does n't appear to need that lesson .
She remembers how precious water was in the 1930s when people fetched water in buckets .
And when the rains finally ended the Dust Bowl , she vividly remembers her joyous father driving his family out into his fields just to watch the water settle into the soil .
Heeney , who now lives in Topeka , Kansas , gets upset when she sees people throw away bottled water or use too much water to wash their cars .
" We do n't value water and we 're going to regret it , " Heeney says .
" We forget .
We 're as dumb as we can be and we do n't learn . "

A Stephen King fan has published an 80 - page version of the book which novelist Jack Torrance obsessively writes during King 's The Shining , where his descent into madness is revealed when his wife discovers that his work consists of just one phrase , endlessly repeated .
Torrance , played by Jack Nicholson in terrifying form in Stanley Kubrick 's 1980 film , is a frustrated writer who goes with his wife and son to spend the winter in the isolated Overlook Hotel in an attempt to get the novel he has always wanted to write started .
But the hotel 's grisly past and unquiet ghosts have their way with him , and his wife Wendy eventually finds that the manuscript he has been working on actually only contains the phrase " All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy " , typed over and over again .
Now New York artist Phil Buehler , who describes himself as " a big fan of Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King " , has self - published a book credited to Torrance , repeating the phrase throughout but formatting each page differently , using the words to create different shapes from zigzags to spirals .
" The idea has probably been marinating for years , because I loved the movie and the Stephen King book , " said Buehler .
" I 'd just finished my own obsessive art project [ and ] it was an idea I had over the Christmas holidays . "
He said he decided to stick to type and formatting that could have been created on a typewriter , with the first ten pages duplicating shots of Torrance 's work from the film .
" I thought 'if he continues to get crazier , what would those pages look like ? ' " he said .
" I hit writer 's block about 60 pages in , and I had to get to 80 - that went on for about a week . "
His fiancée , who had neither read the book nor seen the film , became a little concerned about his actions .
" I finally showed her the movie , and she realised I was n't really losing it , " said Buehler .
He 's included a spoof review from the blog OverThinking It.com on the book 's back jacket , which compares it to " the best of Beckett " in its " lack of forward momentum " , and considers the struggles of the author , " heroically pitting himself against the Sisyphusean sentence " .
" It 's that metatextual struggle of Man vs. Typewriter that gives this book its spellbinding power , " the review says .
" Some will dismiss it as simplistic ; that 's like dismissing a Pollack canvas as mere splatters of paint . "
So far , Buehler says that around 1,000 people have viewed the book , for sale on Blurb.com for $ 8.95 in paperback , or $ 22.95 in hardback , and he 's sold " a few " copies , with sales now starting to pick up steam .
" A few people have asked me to sign it - they 're looking it as a piece of art rather than a funny thing to give to a Kubrick fan , " he said .
" If you 're not a Kubrick or King fan , you might not even get it . "
Feb. 20 , 2009  -- A 9 - year - old Arizona boy made up his own mind to plead guilty to a single charge of negligent homicide , the boy 's attorney , Ron Wood , said in an interview with ABC's " Good Morning America " today .
The boy had originally entered a plea of not guilty on charges of double homicide for allegedly shooting his father and another man , but the deal allowed him to plead guilty to one count of negligent murder of the other man .
The boy 's mother was reportedly against the deal and claimed her son was not old enough to understand the agreement .
" He has to make the decision of how he wants to proceed , " Wood told " GMA . "
" As long as we 're going to continue to prosecute children , they 're going to have to make that decision .
...
That 's what my young client wanted to do . "
According to Wood , Arizona Superior Court Judge Michael Roca determined that the boy was competent to make the decision and his plea was accepted .
The prosecutors decided to drop the charge against the boy for killing his father so he would have a " chance at a normal life , " Apache County Attorney Michael Whiting told The Associated Press Thursday .
" How is he going to deal with ' I pleaded guilty to killing my dad ? ' "
Whiting said .
The plea deal allows the boy to undergo psychiatric evaluation with the possibility that he could avoid incarceration .
In the deal with state prosecutors , two charges of premeditated murder in the death of the two men were dropped in exchange for the admission that the boy shot and killed his father 's friend .
In return , Whiting wants the boy to undergo extensive mental evaluation and treatment .
The plea agreement says any detention will be at the discretion of the court .
The boy will also undergo diagnostic evaluations and mental health examinations at 12 , 15 and 17 years old .
The reviews are intended partly to determine whether the boy will pose a continuing danger to others .
" There has to be a determination made that there will not be any future danger , " the boy 's other defense attorney , Benjamin Brewer , told " GMA . "
Brewer said the boy would receive education , but if and when he joins other children in a classroom has yet to be determined .
9 - Year - Old Upbeat in Plea Hearing
The boy appeared Thursday morning in Apache County Superior Court in St. Johns , Ariz. , wearing jeans , a short - sleeve button - down shirt and hiking boots .
Observers in the courtroom described his mood as upbeat as he took a seat next to his mother .
The young shooting suspect had previously pleaded not guilty to the murder charges stemming from the Nov. 5 deaths of his father , Vincent Romero , 29 , and Timothy Romans , 39 .
The boy could still potentially serve time in a county incarceration facility .
" It 's a compromise .
No one is really pleased , " Brewer told The Associated Press after the hearing .
Whiting said he " had a hard time believing " that the guardian was n't aware of the plea deal , and the judge accepted the plea despite the mother 's concerns .
Police said the boy , who was 8 at the time , used a . 22 - caliber rifle to shoot the two men .
He patiently reloaded the weapon and fired multiple times after they returned home from work .
The boy , whose name has not been released because of his age , confessed during an hour - long interrogation video released by the Arizona 's Prosecutor 's Office .
In the video , he admitted to the shooting after about 40 minutes of questioning but said it was because his father was already " suffering . "
" I went upstairs and then I saw my dad and then I got the gun and then I fired it at my dad , " the boy said calmly .
" He was on the ground and then I reloaded it . "
When police asked whether he shot his father because he was mad at him , the boy offered a noncommittal " hmm " but said he was in trouble " most of the time " at home , mostly for lying .
The police interrogation was conducted without legal counsel present , causing some juvenile defenders to suspect police coercion , which the police have denied .
Police Interviewed the Boy Thinking He Was a Witness
Police said they interviewed the boy because they initially believed he was a witness to the murders , not a suspect .
" I think as the interview progresses there are clearly points where they should have stopped it and gotten him an attorney , " Meridith Sopher , supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society , told " Good Morning America " upon seeing the tape when it was released in December .
The deal may also have been struck because of questions regarding the capacity of a child that young to understand his actions .
" [ Kids ] are really not as blameworthy , " Marcia Levick , director of the Juvenile Law Center at University of Pennsylvania Law School , told " GMA . "
" Certainly , their capacity to form that criminal intent and to hold them responsible in the way we blame adults , it does n't take hold ... until the teen years .
I do n't think we can make assumptions on whether he was premeditating .
He's 8 .
The question is n't whether we try him as an adult .
The question is whether we hold him responsible in the juvenile justice system , " she said .

MORE than a month has passed since an Iraqi television reporter threw his shoes at US President George Bush during a Baghdad news conference and called the outgoing US leader a dog .
The journalist , Muntather al - Zaidi , 29 , who was immediately arrested , has been allowed only two visitors since then and none since December 21 , according to those close to him .
His family and his lawyer say that they do not know where he is being held and that they are gravely concerned about his wellbeing because they have not been allowed to speak with him by telephone .
On Thursday , Dhiyaa al - Saadi , Zaidi 's lawyer , said he had recently seen medical records that were part of Zaidi 's court file , which he said added credence to the journalist 's claim that he had been beaten and tortured after his arrest by the security detail of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki on December 14 .
Mr Saadi said two medical reports conducted by government physicians within a week of Zaidi 's arrest described bruising that covered the reporter 's face and body , but was especially severe on his legs and arms ; a missing tooth ; a gash on the bridge of his nose ; and what appeared to be a burn mark on his ear .
The question " What do women want ? " famously perplexed the world 's most preeminent psychoanalyst .
I 'm not surprised Sigmund Freud could n't figure out a good answer .
After all , he may have been one of the great geniuses of modern times , but he was also a man .
Still , at least Freud wanted to know .
Which makes me wonder what a one - night stand might have been like for him .
There he'd be with some fleshy paramour , both of them on the couch , both exposed .
" Is that what you want ? " he 'd ask , a look of anxious concern on his face as he probed her .
Afterwards , he 'd pick up his cigar from where it had been idling in the ash tray , get back into his chair , cross his ankle over his knee , and say , " Zo ... now zat 's done , tell me about zis fixation on your father . "
But like I said , at least Freud was curious .
At least he was concerned .
Men these days could care less about what a woman wants , or so the evidence suggests .
Researchers from Stanford and Indiana University recently found that heterosexual undergraduate women have orgasms only half as often as the men they 're hooking up with , and only a third of the time during a first sexual session .
The study – which will be published later this year in the book Families as They Really Are – also found that men receive oral sex about 80 % of the time in first - time hookups , while women get that lucky less than half the time .
And so , the researchers hypothesise that the lack of sexual reciprocity could be a key reason for the so - called orgasm gap , as the Daily Beast recently reported .
And they call this news ?
To some extent , at first glance , it seems to be the same old story : Men are selfish pigs .
And yet that seems like a vast oversimplification .
The study does not ask the question " What the hell is wrong with dudes ? " as much as " Why do n't women demand that they get their fair share of satisfaction ? "
That 's the only way they 're going to get it during a one - night stand , after all .
As Michael Kimmel , who spoke to 400 men aged 16 to 26 before writing his book Guyland : The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men , told The Beast : " Men do n't pull their weight ... because no one makes them . "
I took an informal poll of a few females I know – none of whom seemed terribly surprised by the findings – and found there were a plethora of explanations .
Many a college woman has gone through with coitus on a first hook - up just to bring the whole encounter to an end .
She may have started out drunk on a cocktail of Chardonnay and giddiness , and in sobering up a little , began to realise she was n't enjoying it all that much .
On top of it , the guy was likely cajoling her – or pressuring her ; letting him in to do some jack - hammering seemed like the easiest way to resolve the situation .
In a situation like that , she would n't feel too comfortable giving the protuberant young turk a quick lesson about the finer points of clitoral stimulation .
Others may feel like they " owe " it to the guys ; that they 've gone so far down the path – or up the flagpole – that there 's no backing out at that point .
Similarly , some do it because they want to be liked .
I 'm not saying any of these are good reasons – just that they 're possibilities .
Another possibility : the woman might think that the only chance she has of getting any catharsis from a limited lover is through the actual act of fornication .
The whole thing could also be a power trip for her , in which case not getting herself too worked up is preferable so she can stay in control .
Another statistic seems to carry a stronger implication that men are lazy self - absorbed lovers : even in longer - term relationships , women have roughly 60 - 80 % fewer orgasms than men , depending on which study you look at .
But here again , I think it would be facile to say that the imbalance is a result of men sucking – or , as it were , men not sucking enough – because the female orgasm is a relatively complicated achievement .
The male climax , on the other hand , is a fairly simple matter for the standard college - aged male .
Often , a woman does n't need to do very much more than let a guy in her trap door for the whole thing to , er , come off successfully .
For a female to enjoy the analogous pleasure , however , requires physical self - knowledge on her part ; she also needs to be capable of and confident about communicating her desires , as well as having them met .
And when you consider that only 60 % of the college women in a 2007 Stanford survey said they masturbated to the point of climax ( as opposed to 97 % of men ) — or similarly that Dr Elisabeth Lloyd , author of The Case of the Female Orgasm : Bias in the Science of Evolution , concluded a third of women never have orgasm during intercourse – it seems clear that many females do n't know themselves how to achieve an orgasm .
And it seems unfair to expect a man to bring a woman to her peak if she can't do it herself .
So women , my best advice to you is : know what it is you want , sexually – a vibrator works about as well as a divining rod if you need help figuring it out – and then ask for it .
There 's nothing wrong with desiring sexual satisfaction , or asking for it .
And before having sex again with someone just because you feel like you " owe " it to him , ask yourself if you do n't owe yourself just as much .
Three men who allegedly staged an inside - job San Jose bank robbery after watching the movie " Ocean 's Eleven " will be in court today .
Brian Tirao Deguzman and Allen Tam Vu , both 25 , and Armando Anaya Mendez , 22 , were arrested Wednesday evening for allegedly stealing $ 100,000 from the Wells Fargo branch inside the Safeway store at 3202 Story Road .
Deguzman is the branch manager and Mendez is an employee .
Police said Vu played the role of the robber and was escorted into the back of the bank and given the money by the others .
The suspects said they hatched the robbery plan after watching " Ocean 's Eleven , " in which Danny Ocean , portrayed by George Clooney , and his cohorts , including those played by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon , devise a plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos at the same time .
All three suspects are being held in lieu of $ 1 million at Santa Clara County Jail and are scheduled to appear today in Superior Court .
The holdup is at least the fourth such case in Northern California in which current or former bank employees have been implicated .
In July , a Union Bank employee took $ 15,000 from his vault , put it in his teller drawer and had a friend " rob " him , federal prosecutors said .
Similar " inside job " bank robberies occurred at a San Francisco credit union on Aug. 6 and at a Salinas bank on July 5 in which current or former tellers were implicated and charged in federal court , authorities said .
When the Israeli attack came on the Prep C girls school in the Jabaliya camp at 3.45 pm on Tuesday , Mr Ging said about 350 Palestinians were inside , using the school as a shelter .
" The reason they were in the school is because the Israelis had told them to go there , " he said .
" They were doing exactly as they had been told . "
To ensure there was no confusion about the school 's location , Mr Ging said the United Nations gave specific GPS co-ordinates to Israeli Defence Forces commanders .
But after receiving reports that mortar shells had been fired at Israeli units from within the school grounds , the commanders decided to strike back .
" They shot back to save their own lives , " said Israeli Defence Forces spokesman Ilan Tal .
Three tanks shells exploded just outside the school grounds , causing pandemonium inside .
" As you can imagine , this was a very distressing attack , " Mr Ging said .
" It has killed 40 people , and some of those who were injured may yet die .
" Now we need to know how this happened .
A full , transparent and independent inquiry has to be held to determine exactly how this occurred . "
The Israeli Defence Forces maintained that mortars had been fired from the school .
In a statement released by spokesman Captain Benjamin Rutland , it said it had incontrovertible evidence to support its version of events .
" This is not the first time that Hamas has fired mortars and rockets from schools , in such a way deliberately using civilians as human shields in their acts of terror against Israel , " the statement said . "
Brigadier - General Avi Benayahu said the Israeli Defence Forces had established that Hamas terror operatives were among the dead at the school , and had proof of a mortar battery cell that had been firing in the area .
" Hamas operatives Imad Abu Askhar and Hassan Abu Askhar were among terrorists that were identified to be killed , " he said .
The attack on the school has caused widespread shock across Israel , intensifying pressure on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to reach a ceasefire .
After 13 days of bombardment of Gaza from the air , land and sea , which has claimed more than 660 lives , the past few days of fighting have been among the bloodiest in the history of the Israel - Palestinian conflict .
Five Israeli soldiers lost their lives on Wednesday , four from friendly fire , bringing to 10 the number of Israelis who have been killed .
Just before midnight on Tuesday , three Gazans were killed when Israeli forces attacked another UN school in Gaza City .
Earlier that day , a shell hit a house in the Beach refugee camp , killing at least seven members of one family .
Shelling of houses in the Bureij refugee camp left at least five dead and 16 injured .
WASHINGTON ( December 4 , 2008 ) – Millions of Americans have been left in the dark about hazardous pollutants being released into their communities , according to a new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) .
The new report provides a comprehensive look at the Bush Administration ’s systemic cutting of health and environmental programs that monitor toxins across America .
“ The Bush administration has turned off the tap on data and monitoring , depriving scientists , agencies , and Americans of information crucial to ensuring public health protections , ” said Miriam Rotkin - Ellman , research scientist at NRDC .
“ Immediate action is needed by the next administration to restore , strengthen and fund these crucial monitoring programs . ”
The report , Deepest Cuts : Repairing Health Monitoring Programs Slashed Under the Bush Administration , evaluates the current state of federal environmental and health monitoring programs at the end of the Bush Administration in five key areas – air quality , water quality , food safety , toxic substance and human health .
The report demonstrates that during the eight years of the Bush Administration , the federal government has quietly eliminated or crippled more than a dozen essential monitoring programs .
Budget cuts , restructuring , program termination , and removal of industry reporting requirements have been steadily undermining or eliminating the information that alerts us to problems in our air , water , food , and communities .
Programs that directly track human health have also been slashed , creating information gaps about infectious disease outbreaks , chemical exposures in people , and chronic disease .
Some of the worst examples of the program cuts include :
Hundreds of communities near lead polluters will not have air quality testing , and the lead monitoring network has been cut by half over the past decade , hampering the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to enforce the new air standard for lead .
The Bush Administration has proposed to eliminate requirements that “ factory farms ” and similar facilities report the air pollution from animal waste .
This proposal may be finalized before January , even though many such facilities pollute the air more than large industrial factories .
Budget cuts at the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) will devastate two programs that test groundwater and surface water for pesticides , heavy metals , pharmaceuticals , hormone disruptors , and other toxic chemicals .
The already tight budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) program that tracks food - related illness was cut by more than $ 2 million , at a time when some foodborne illness outbreaks have been increasing .
The report provides specific recommendations for the government to restore these programs that are critical for setting strong public health protections .
The cost of reinstating these programs would total approximately $ 133 million .
According to NRDC experts , these costs could be offset by identifying and preventing pollution and disease problems before they cost our health care system and taxpayers many more millions of dollars .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
With sales down and banks reluctant to extend loans without hefty collateral guarantees , many small businesses are strapped for operating capital .
Both the House and Senate versions of the economic recovery bill address this pressing issue , but their proposed solutions are wildly different .
The House stimulus plan , passed two weeks ago , focuses on increasing the guarantees that the Small Business Administration makes to banks that issue small business loans .
It authorizes the SBA to directly invest in the secondary market that banks tap to sell off bundles of their small - business loans , and it includes a provision for a new direct lending and loan refinancing authority within the SBA .
Of the House bill 's $ 820 billion estimated cost , $ 440 million is earmarked for these small business initiatives .
The Senate , on the other hand , wants to leave the SBA 's loan guarantees alone and instead temporarily eliminate the fees the SBA charges for its guarantees .
It sets aside $ 615 million to cover the dropped fees .
The SBA 's small microloans program is also a focus of the Senate bill , which passed on Tuesday .
The Senate allocates $ 6 million in new funding for the program - plus an additional $ 24 million for marketing , management and technical assistance to lenders who make those microloans .
All totaled , the Senate 's proposed direct stimulus spending on small business initiatives adds up to $ 730 million , out of the bill 's estimated $ 838 billion cost .
The Senate and House bills will now move to reconciliation , where both sides will attempt to hammer out a compromise bill .
Congressional officials and President Barack Obama have said they want to pass a final bill into law this week .
There 's no question that the ongoing recession has severely curtailed entrepreneurs ' access to bank loans and credit lines , which is the key problem both bills try to address .
The SBA 's flagship 7 ( a ) program , which insures against default up to 85 % of the value of qualifying loans of less than $ 150,000 ( and up to 75 % of loans above $ 150,000 ) , backed 57 % fewer loans in its most recent quarter than it did a year ago .
Business owners say banks are freezing credit lines and refusing to make loans .
Bank officers counter that they can't extend loans that are unlikely to be repaid .
With sales down , many businesses are struggling to make ends meet - and the value of assets typically used as loan collateral , such as real estate , has also declined .
Businesses with tight cash flows and little collateral are unable to meet banks ' ever - tightening lending standards .
Opening the bank vaults
The House bill would increase the SBA 's loan guarantees to 95 % , a move officials hope will motivate banks to increase their lending .
But Senate representatives are uncomfortable with that approach : " 85 % is already backed .
If we up it to 95 % , banks may get comfortable and issue more bad loans , " said Scott Schneider , communications director for the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship .
" We 'll have to look into it further . "
The Senate 's proposal is to slash the fees that it believes makes SBA - backed loans cost - prohibitive for banks ( and for loan applicants , who absorb some of those costs ) .
But the House does n't think that will work :
Owners can't benefit from loans if the banks wo n't take the risk of making then , which the House does n't foresee happening without increased guarantees .
Another problem at the bank level is reduced SBA expertise :
As loan volumes decline , many banks have laid off their small business loan specialists .
Temecula Valley Bank , previously one of the most active lenders , recently shut down its SBA lending .
The House bill seeks to assemble within the SBA a team of specialists who can field loan applications for banks - and if bank lenders can't be found for qualified borrowers , the House bill would authorize the SBA to , as a last resort , make the loans directly .
The Senate questions the SBA 's ability to execute on that plan .
" The issue is that the SBA infrastructure is n't there , " Schneider said .
" We 'd have to make sure that if that 's a road we pursue , there would be more people in the SBA who work with loans rather than guarantees .
That does n't exist right now . "
The SBA does already have one direct - lending facility in place :
Its disaster loan program , which funded $ 953.7 million in loans last year .
( In comparison , the SBA 's loan guarantee programs backed a loan volume of $ 18.2 billion . )
The program traditionally assists victims of natural disasters like hurricanes and floods , but after the Sept. 11 attacks , it was used to fund loans to victims suffering economic damage .
In November , Senators John Kerry and Charles Schumer wrote to the SBA 's acting administrator , asking why the SBA has n't tapped the $ 6 billion it has available for emergency loans .
The SBA , which is currently waiting for a new administrator to be confirmed by the Senate , says its hands are tied until someone officially declares the recession an emergency .
" The SBA does n't have the authority to declare an economic emergency , " said Mike Stamler , director of the SBA press office .
" After 9/11 , there was physical damage declared in NYC and the surrounding area , and in Arlington and the surrounding area .
The SBA was able to broaden the rules to allow it to find businesses around the country that had been damaged by that physical disaster .
But here , there 's nothing physical we can pinpoint .
If the President told us to do it , we'd have to , but it would still take a major scrum of lawyers to decide whether we could do it and how we could do it . "
Regarding the rest of the proposals the House and Senate have put on the table , the SBA is taking a wait - and - see approach .
What emerges from this week 's reconciliation may look very different that what 's currently in Congress ' two competing bills .
" You do n't give farm animals names if they 're just going to get slaughtered .
Likewise , we 're taking the same philosophy with these provisions , " Stamler said .
" We currently do n't have administrative leadership in place to jump out and talk about a moving target . "

The much - beleaguered Mars Science Laboratory -- an ambitious and expensive rover / lander whose main purpose is to assess whether Mars can or ever could have supported microbial life -- will be delayed by two years .
It was set to launch in the fall of 2009 , but it will be 2011 at least before it goes to Mars .
The MSL has been a source of a lot of woe .
It has been plagued with cost overruns , timeline slips , and technical difficulties .
That last bit is not surprising ; the technology on this mission is extremely sophisticated and some of it is cutting - edge .
Technical problems lead to both timeline problems as well as cost overruns , so these are all related .
Also , the rover is huge : it 's the size of a golf cart ( for comparison , the rovers Spirit and opportunity are about the size of a kid's red wagon ) , meaning landing it is extremely tricky .
Charles Elachi , director of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , likened it to a Cassini - class mission , and it has to actually land on another planet .
The mission lifetime is supposed to be two years ( compare that to the nominal 90 day planned lifetime for the current rovers ) , and the chemistry lab it carries to test the Martian environment is very sophisticated .
The lifetime cost of MSL is a little under $ 2 billion .
This delay will add roughly $ 400 million to the lifetime cost , bringing the cost to about $ 2.2 - 2.3 billion .
This will hurt other missions , of course , since NASA has a finite budget .
Money will have to be shuffled , but " no cancellations are expected " ( the cuts across the board will have to be spread over the next couple of years ) .
This money will go to storing the mission hardware and further testing of all the equipment .
To be fair , most of the hardware is well on its way to being complete .
Mike Griffin , NASA Administrator ( aka the Big Cheese ) stated that the main problem causing the delay is a problem in the rover 's actuator motors .
NASA might be able to meet the initial launch date , but they want to be sure that such a big and expensive mission will operate as flawlessly as possible .
There were quite a few technical difficulties that were n't life - threatening , but still caused many delays .
The delays are n't too bad in and of themselves , but the Universe forces the much longer delay .
Mars and Earth both orbit the Sun , and the favorable launch positions of the two planets only occur roughly every 26 months .
Each launch window lasts a few weeks , but if that 's missed , it takes two years before the next window opens .
That 's why MSL wo n't launch until 2011 .
Griffin said that this mission is second only to manned missions , so they 're taking it very seriously .
It 's too bad this has happened , and I hope the impact on other missions wo n't make them feel the hurt too badly .
Sometimes I like to compare things like this to Hubble : it was over budget , took too long , and when it launched it had a terrible flaw that severely limited its usefulness ... and now , no one talks about any of that at all , we talk more about the impact Hubble has had on the public 's awareness of astronomy ( in positive terms ) .
I suspect in a decade we 'll be saying the same sort of things about MSL .
That does n't diminish the impact or the trouble NASA is feeling from MSL 's problems , but it 's sometimes good to keep these things in perspective .

Exposing the dark side of cloud computing , Salesforce.com suffered an outage that locked more than 900,000 subscribers out of crucial applications and data needed to transact business with customers .
Salesforce , the 800 - pound gorilla in the software - as - a - service jungle , was unreachable for the better part of an hour , beginning around noon California time .
Customers who tried to access their accounts alternately were unable to reach the site at all or received an error message when trying to log in .
Even the company 's highly touted public health dashboard was also out of commission .
That prompted a flurry of tweets on Twitter from customers wondering if they were the only ones unable to reach the site .
Salesforce has long vaunted the speed and availability of its service as reasons businesses should dump their in - house customer relationship management applications and instead rely on its online infrastructure .
Indeed , for those selling shoes or coffee , it can make a lot of sense to turn to someone else for IT support so you can focus on your core strengths .
But the outage , which Salesforce has yet to explain , also shows what can happen when close to a million subscribers depend on a single entity to handle some of the most important data in their company .
Sure , plenty of organizations suffer hour - long outages , but they 're generally spread out .
Not so in this case , when a single disruption suddenly paralyzes a small fraction of the world 's economy .
Can anyone say putting all our eggs in one basket ?
Real world sales forces are generally useless without real - time access to CRM apps .
If cloud computing catches on the way Salesforce , Amazon , and the other cheerleaders say it will , this dark side is only likely to get worse . ®
How ’d Cramer do it ?
He ran the numbers .
Something you ’d assume the SEC could also do .
That 80 % return Madoff claimed for the period between early 2000 until October 2008 ?
Turns out the number was closer to – 2.66 % , at least according to Cramer ’s research .
All the SEC had to do was check the performance of the options Madoff said he was trading to figure this out .
Cramer did it …
That ’s why he does n’t want anyone believing the SEC ’s claims that it had no way of knowing just how fraudulent Madoff appears to have been .
Despite letters to the SEC’s Boston office about the alleged Ponzi scheme , there was still no in - depth look at the strategies Madoff was using to make those “ big ” returns .
The feeder funds that invested with Madoff were just as bad .
These “ funds of funds ” could have figured out what was going on but never bothered to try .
In fact , one such fund , Tremont , went so far as to put their complacency into writing .
Check out this pull - quote from a document the firm sent to clients : “ … in addition , information supplied by the investment advisor may be inaccurate or even fraudulent .
The co-managers are entitled to rely on such information ( provided they do so in good faith ) and are not required to undertake any due diligence to confirm the accuracy thereof . ”
So Tremont ’s clients shelled out big bucks to have their money managed by people who did n’t think it was their job to responsibly manage their clients ’ money .
Make sense ?
Hence Cramer ’s outrage .
The SEC has no excuse for its complete and total miss of Madoff ’s allegedly fraudulent behavior , and these feeder funds , while they might deny it , are responsible for their clients ’ losses .
Questions for Cramer ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Job openings have plummeted and layoffs have accelerated rapidly during a downward trend in employment that continues to spiral , according to a government report released Tuesday .
December 2008 saw 2.7 million job openings , down 35 % from July 2007 , the starting point of the downward trend , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey .
The report also showed that layoffs in December were up 58 % from a year earlier , and the percentage of workers quitting jobs dropped to only 40 % of total separations in December .
That 's a record - low number : a sign that people are nervous about changing jobs in the current labor market .
Job openings rate :
The report included a job openings rate , an indicator that compares the nation 's job openings to the total number of jobs plus the number of openings .
In December it fell to 1.9 % , the first time it has been below the 2 % mark since the report began in 2000 .
That 's a sharp decline from the opening rate of 2.8 % the previous year .
The retail trade sector was particularly hard - hit , as job openings fell to 305,000 in December from 386,000 in November .
Education and health services openings fell to 553,000 , down from 604,000 the previous month .
Hiring rate : New hires were down 900,000 , or 19 % , from the previous year .
The report said no industry or region experienced a significant change in the hires rate in December , as the grim economic outlook continues to weigh on the job market .
Journalists get bylines , photographers get photo credits , and artists get to sign their paintings .
But designers rarely get public credit for their work -- they 're just vendors providing a service for a client .
No signature , no credit , no copyright , no royalties .
All of which can lead to confusion and conflict down the road .
Consider , for example , the Major League Baseball logo .
It 's a masterpiece of modern brand design , it 's more iconic and visible than ever , and it turns 40 years old next year ( an unusually long life span in the logo world , where designs are constantly getting overhauled or at least tweaked ) , yet its designer has never been publicly acknowledged .
The Wall Street Journal took a step toward changing that situation two weeks ago , when it ran an article identifying Jerry Dior , a 76 - year - old retired graphic designer , as the man behind the logo .
Or at least that 's what he claims -- he does n't have any records or paperwork to prove it , and MLB officials have declined to confirm his connection to the logo .
But the article cited several of Dior 's former colleagues at Sandgren & Murtha , the marketing firm where he worked in the late 1960s , including longtime brand designer Alan Siegel , who said , " I ran the project and I saw him design it .
I swear on a stack of Bibles that Jerry Dior designed the damn thing . "
Just one problem :
The article neglected to mention that there 's another person who 's taken credit for the MLB logo over the years .
That would be James Sherman , an artist best known for illustrating the " Legion of Super - Heroes " comic book in the 1970s , although he 's also done a lot of logo design work .
For years he 's included the MLB logo in his design portfolio , and there 's been at least one published interview in which he 's claimed authorship of the mark .
The Journal article had already made the case for Dior , so I decided to track down Sherman and hear his side of the story .
Much like Dior , he said he had no proof to back up his claim , but he recalled lots of details from the project .
" I submitted a number of sketches , based on outlines of Yogi Berra , Ted Williams , and Mickey Mantle , and then they came back to me with a sketch they liked , " he said .
" It was n't exactly the same as what I had submitted , but it was close enough to mine that I just assumed the art director at the time was making his own modification , which happens most of the time anyway . "
He said he'd been paid " about a hundred grand " for the design and did n't mind that he'd never received public credit , since that 's how it usually goes for graphic designers .
Then I asked an innocuous question that changed everything :
Major League Baseball
The Major League Baseball logo is one of the most famous images in sports .
Uni Watch : Just out of curiosity , how old are you ?
James Sherman : Sixty .
UW : Wow , so you were just 20 years old when you designed the logo .
JS : No , I had to be at least 30 .
UW : But the logo was designed in 1968 .
It had to be , because it debuted in the 1969 season .
It was worn on every major league uniform that year .
JS : Really ?
Then I did n't do it .
I could n't have .
Are you sure about this ?
To show Sherman what I meant , I e-mailed him a few images from 1969 , including the cover of the Mets ' yearbook ( note the MLB logo at lower - right ) and photos showing players wearing the logo on their sleeves or elsewhere .
He called me back a few minutes later .
" That 's not my logo , and I was totally unaware that it existed , " he said .
" The logo I created was very similar , but I designed it in the early 1980s .
All I can say is that I was so sports - unaware that I did n't know about the earlier logo .
I feel like a total idiot now that I did n't know about it .
I 'm flabbergasted . "
He 's not the only one .
Although there are still some gaps in the story , this is apparently what happened :
In the early 1980s , Sherman was hired to create a logo for the American League .
He submitted something very similar to the silhouetted batter , which he had n't seen before ( it had a much lower profile back then , and Sherman was n't a particularly big sports fan ) .
As the MLB logo has become more and more prominent in recent years , he 's proudly taken credit for it , not realizing that it was actually designed by someone else more than a decade earlier .
All of which raises a new mystery : What happened to the logo Sherman designed ?
Was it really so similar to the familiar MLB mark ?
If so , why would MLB pay him a hundred grand -- or even a hundred cents -- for a design so similar to something they already had ?
Those questions are still unanswered , although an MLB spokesman is checking to see if there are any records of Sherman 's work .
Meanwhile , Sherman is doing his best to set the record straight .
He 's updated his portfolio and is trying to correct any published accounts that tie him to the MLB logo .
He 's also sought out Dior ( " We had a pleasant , quite amiable conversation " ) , who says he has no hard feelings .
But of course none of this proves that Dior designed the logo -- it simply means Sherman did n't design it .
You'd think the MLB folks could resolve all of this just by looking in a file or something , but apparently it is n't that simple .
In the Wall Street Journal article , MLB spokesman Matt Bourne said MLB was " researching the history of the silhouetted batter in connection with its 40th anniversary " -- a maddeningly unsatisfying response , especially for an industry as history - and records - obsessed as baseball .
Like , seriously , how much " researching " do you need to do for something like this ?
It 's not as though 1968 is ancient history .
But when I followed up with Bourne earlier this week , he went further : " We know Sandgren & Murtha was the company that created the silhouetted batter , and we know Mr. Dior was a designer for that company .
What 's harder to ascertain , and what we 're in the process of researching , is whether Mr. Dior is the person who created the design . "
That last bit sounds almost like a formality , given that several of Dior 's Sandgren & Murtha colleagues already vouched for him in the Journal article .
And when I contacted Dior myself , he produced a letter of support from his former project manager .
Personally , I 'm convinced : Jerry Dior is the guy who created the logo .
Dior does n't want money or additional compensation for the logo -- it was a standard work - for - hire job , and MLB does n't owe him anything .
But after seeing his design become an internationally recognized icon , he'd like to be acknowledged as its creator .
Here 's an interview I conducted with him a few days ago , in which he dispelled some myths and shared some surprising details regarding one of the sports world 's most perfectly realized designs :
Uni Watch : Prior to getting the baseball logo assignment , what sort of work did you specialize in ?
Jerry Dior : I was a graphic designer and illustrator .
UW : What sorts of clients did you typically have ?
JD : It was mostly packaging for Kellogg 's , Nabisco , some pharmaceutical companies .
Stuff like that .
UW : How did you come to get the Major League Baseball logo assignment ?
[+]
Enlarge Jerry Dior Here 's Jerry Dior , posing next to the logo he created .
JD : It just came into the marketing office I was working at , Sandgren & Murtha , and I was asked to work on it .
UW : So it was basically just another client .
JD : Yes .
UW : Were you already a big baseball fan at the time ?
JD : Oh , yeah .
Well , I 'd been a Brooklyn Dodgers fan .
Then when they left , I kind of stopped following it .
And then the Mets came along and I picked up on them , although I was never as enthusiastic about them .
But I always loved baseball .
Now I 'm a Yankees fan .
UW : What sort of thought process did you go through at the outset of the project ?
Did you know right away that you 'd use a silhouetted image ?
JD : No , it just came about .
UW : Did you know from the start that you wanted to show a human figure , instead of just type or other graphics ?
JD : No , I just went through some magazines and tried to figure out some ideas .
I really do n't know how the process worked -- I just did it , y'know ?
It was fast .
I think I spent just an afternoon on it .
UW [ incredulous ] :
The whole thing took one afternoon ?
JD : Yeah .
UW : Did you do any developmental designs or sketches along the way ?
JD : I did a few , yeah , but I can't remember what they were .
I know I did a few versions on the same sheet we presented -- different colors and things like that .
I think I started with blue and green , and then I switched to red , white , and blue because it was the national pastime .
UW : Did you also design the type that appeared underneath the logo ?
JD : In Helvetica , right .
But really , I never thought much about any of it until I saw the Mets wearing the logo as a sleeve patch in the 1969 World Series .
UW : But every team had worn that patch through the entire 1969 season .
Had n't you noticed that before the World Series ?
JD : I did , yeah , but I did n't really think much about it until the World Series .
You have to remember , baseball was n't televised as much back then as it is now .
UW : Did Major League Baseball accept the logo pretty much as you designed it , or did they ask you to make adjustments ?
JD : Nope , no adjustments .
I cleaned it up and that was it .
UW : What do you mean " cleaned it up " ?
JD : You tighten it up so it can be reproduced .
What I had originally created was just a Magic Marker sketch .
UW [ incredulous again ] :
The original version that you created in one afternoon , and that was presented to Major League Baseball , was rendered in Magic Marker ?
JD : Right .
UW : Do you have any sketches or files from the project ?
JD : No , I do n't .
UW : One of the neatest things about the logo is that the batter can be viewed as being either right - handed or left - handed , depending on the viewer 's perspective .
Was that intentional ?
JD : That was the idea -- he could [ be ] right or left , white or black , anything .
UW : Several people over the years have speculated that the silhouetted batter is Harmon Killebrew .
JD : No , that 's not the case .
It 's not any specific person .
UW : But you must have based the silhouette on a photograph , did n't you ?
JD : I did a couple of variations based on photographs I had .
It was sort of composite of what I had in front of me .
UW : Do you recall who the players were in those photographs ?
JD : No , no way .
Again , I never really thought much about it -- I just did it .
UW : The logo is now 40 years old , yet it actually has a much higher presence today than it did back when it debuted , especially in the merchandising realm .
Does the design 's durability surprise you ?
JD : Yes it does , it does .
Originally it was just supposed to be for Major League Baseball 's 100th anniversary -- a one - year thing .
So I did it and just forgot about it .
But then it started popping up in lots of places .
UW : More places now than ever .
JD : Yes , I know .
I get kind of a thrill out of that .
UW : Do you think it looks dated ?
JD : No .
I 'm not being arrogant or anything , but I really think it 's held up .
In my field , when you do a package design or something like that , they usually update it after a couple of years .
But this has stayed exactly the way I did it .
UW : If you could go back and make any adjustments to the logo , is there anything you 'd change ?
JD : Maybe a few tweaks .
UW : Such as ?
JD : I do n't know .
Sometimes I think the bat is too thick .
And maybe the letters " MLB " should have been part of it .
The NBA , the NFL , the NHL , those initials are all very prominent , but people do n't say , " MLB . "
So maybe I should have done that .
But I never thought about that when I created the design .
UW : Anything else ?
JD : A lot of people make the nose pointy , but it should not be pointy .
It 's not a pointy nose -- it 's more like a Dick Tracy nose , squared off .
UW : So when you sometimes see it rendered with a point , does that bother you ?
JD : Yeah .
Little things like that .
UW : Major League Baseball routinely changes the colors on the logo depending on the context in which it appears .
JD : Right , I just noticed this year that they made it red and green for the World Series .
UW : Right , but for quite a few years now they 've adjusted it depending on which team is wearing it .
On the back of an Oakland A's cap , for example , the logo is green and yellow , to match the A's colors .
JD : Really ?
I had n't seen that .
UW : What do you think of that ?
JD : It 's fine .
It still comes across even if you change the colors .
UW : In a typical baseball game , the logo appears on every player 's jersey , every player 's cap , the umpires ' jerseys and caps , the bases , the dugout jackets , the catchers ' gear , and probably a few others places I 'm forgetting .
Do you think it 's too much ?
JD : No .
It 's not overkill , I do n't think so .
UW : Because that 's just good branding ?
JD : Yeah .
Well , maybe it's a little outlandish , a little overkill , but I do n't mind it .
UW : So many other sports leagues have copied your approach for their logos .
What do you think of that ?
JD : I think it 's great .
Like they say , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .
I started something , and I did n't even realize it !
UW : So you do n't resent it , like they 're stealing your ideas or anything ?
JD : Not at all .
They 're not stealing it -- they 're carrying on the idea .
I feel good about it .
UW : Does it bother you that Major League Baseball has n't officially acknowledged you as the logo 's designer ?
JD : A little bit .
UW : Have you been in touch with them ?
JD : Yes .
I first contacted them about seven years ago .
I was trying to get a plaque or something like that in the Hall of Fame , but they said they could n't do that .
And that 's OK .
I think they know I 'm the designer but they do n't want to say so because they think I 'd want some kind of money .
Someone even told me that Killebrew had looked into getting some money , because of that rumor about the logo being based on him .
But like I said , it is n't based on him .
UW : And do you want money ?
JD : No .
I do n't want any money , I do n't want any royalties or anything like that .
I just want recognition .
I would like to get maybe a season ticket for the Mets for my son .
And if they want to give me a season ticket for the Yankees , I 'll take that .
UW : Have you hired an attorney ?
JD : No , and I never will .
My wife and I have talked with Major League Baseball , and we 're still talking , but that 's all .
UW : It 's interesting that designers generally do n't receive credit or acknowledgment in our society .
All those cereal packages and other designs you 've done -- your name is n't on any of them .
How do you feel about that ?
JD : That 's just the nature of the game .
I take it for what it is .
If I win an award , that 's public , but otherwise it 's private .
UW : And in this case , you 'd like something a little more public ?
JD : Yes , I really would .
Every now and then I tell someone the story about the logo , and their eyes go gaga , and I say to myself , " Hmm , do they really believe me or not ? "
I want some sort of foothold or something , so I can prove that I really did this .
UW : In the grand scheme of your career , where do you think the baseball logo stacks up ?
JD : Number one .
UW : Because it 's the most famous , or do you really think it 's the best thing you ever did ?
JD : Because of its longevity .
It holds up today as well as it did back then .
I truly feel it 's part of baseball .
So I added a little something to the game , and I 'm very proud of that .
He 's got a right to feel proud -- it 's a sensational design .
And the more you learn about people like Dior and Sherman -- extremely talented creative professionals , most of whose work is done anonymously -- the more ridiculous it seems that designers do n't have higher public profiles .
Here 's hoping this is one case where the designer finally gets the recognition he deserves .
Paul Lukas still remembers how his eight - year - old mind was totally blown when he realized the silhouetted batter could be either right - handed or left - handed .

Report on CBS ’s “ 60 Minutes ”
Ground zero : the impact of the DHL shutdown on Wilmington , Ohio
By Hiram Lee
27 January 2009
In a segment entitled " The Winter of Our Hardship , " Sunday night 's broadcast of " 60 Minutes " on CBS featured a report on Wilmington , Ohio , the small town devastated by the shutting down of its largest employer , international shipping company DHL Express .
In the midst of the economic crash of 2008 , DHL began losing $ 6 million per day in the United States .
As a result , the shipping company began closing down its domestic operations in November .
While the carrier plans to continue shipping parcels to and from the US , it will no longer offer ground or air services within the country .
DHL is currently in talks with UPS , hoping to set up a contract under which that company would handle DHL 's domestic air shipments .
The DHL hub in Wilmington — in southwestern Ohio — was located in the Wilmington Airpark , the nation 's largest privately owned airport , 2,200 acres in size and former home to the Clinton County Air Force Base .
DHL purchased the Airpark for just over $ 1 billion in 2003 .
The facility employed 8,000 workers ; Wilmington has a population of 12,000 .
" 60 Minutes " correspondent Scott Pelley introduced the segment by pointing out that the experience of the Wilmington DHL workers was " part of the news this past week that new claims for unemployment benefits are the highest in 26 years . "
He added , " Since the economic crash of ‘ 08 , taxpayers have committed to more than a trillion dollars in various bailouts of Wall Street , but not much of that is reaching families in crisis . "
Among those profiled in the Wilmington report was Mike O'Machearley .
His son was killed in the skies over Fallujah on November 2 , 2003 , when his helicopter was shot down .
Sixteen others died in the attack .
Following this incident O'Machearley got a job driving a DHL bus at the Airpark .
Previously employed on a machining line in an auto - parts factory , O'Machearley obsessed over the loss of his son all day long at work .
The new job with DHL , O'Machearley said , " meant that I could see different people and talk to people and kind of become human . "
Laid off from the job that meant so much to him , O'Machearley is now attempting to turn his hobby of making engraved hunting knives into a business , hoping to sell his work to collectors .
His prospects are fairly grim .
O'Machearley tells " 60 Minutes , " " We 're going to have no electricity Tuesday nights !
We 're going to light the oil lamps and play checkers . "
He considers Wilmington to be " ground zero " in the current economic collapse .
Geri Lynn
Thomas , whose hours were cut in half at DHL , has been stockpiling food since the DHL crisis struck the town .
She buys an extra item of food when she can and saves it for the even more difficult times yet to come when she is inevitably laid off herself .
Through tears , Mrs. Thomas tells
Pelley she had to pull her son out of college early .
" He did n't go the fall and winter sessions this year , " she says , " we do n't have the money . "
" It was my dream , " she adds , " for my kids to have better than I had and now they 're not going to . "
During the " 60 Minutes " broadcast , Wilmington 's mayor , David Raizk , made several dire predictions .
Raizk estimated that 1 in 5 businesses in the small town could fail due to the DHL shutdown .
Raizk also warned that a local hospital could be in danger of closing its doors : " Eight million dollars ' worth of revenue for our local hospital was derived from the insurance [ of workers ] .
Now if you take away that $ 8 million , plus how much charity care is going to increase because people do n't have insurance , and you could put the hospital out of business . "
The only organization currently expanding in Wilmington is the Sugar Tree Ministry 's soup kitchen .
Kitchen operators have been so overwhelmed by the need for food they have been forced to remodel their facility , making room for up to 200 more seats .
This doubles the kitchen 's previous capacity , a startling indicator of distress .
According to the " 60 Minutes " report , US Senator Sherrod Brown , a Democrat , is calling for $ 100 million in federal aid , not only for Wilmington , but for " distressed communities all around the country . "
Even if that were to come to pass , the amount is pitifully inadequate in relation to the dimensions of the crisis .
CBS reports that an economic task force set up by Mayor Raizk has declared " the projected economic impact of the job losses [ for Wilmington alone ] will exceed $ 400 million annually . "
Not for nothing does Scott Pelley describe Wilmington as going through the " trauma of [ Hurricane ] Katrina without the physical damage . "
Meanwhile an emergency $ 500 million federal loan has been organized to revive Ohio 's state unemployment benefit fund , which went bankrupt last week .
There is also a $ 4 million program in place to provide workers with training in computer skills , but there are no jobs in place to hire the newly skilled workers .
The Wilmington situation shows that while the sky's the limit for the financial elite responsible for the crisis , paltry sums are provided for its victims .
The news report of the struggles faced by Wilmington residents comes within a week of Barack Obama 's inaugural address in which he placed blame for the economic crisis on the shoulders of working people .
Calling for further " sacrifices " from the working class , the speech found support and appreciation in the mainstream media ; in fact , the " 60 Minutes " report takes its title from a phrase in Obama 's speech .
The conditions faced by Wilmington , Ohio's DHL workers , documented in the " 60 Minutes " segment , refute the libelous claims made against working people by Obama and his defenders .
Factoring in the ripple effect of the DHL shutdown on other Wilmington businesses , analysts estimate that 10,000 jobs altogether will be wiped out there .
In a town with a population of just 12,000 , damage of this kind threatens to turn Wilmington into a Midwestern ghost town .
Its residents have no more sacrifices left to offer .

The little blue house rests on a few pieces of wood and concrete block .
The exterior walls , ravaged by dry rot , bend to the touch .
At some point , someone jabbed a kitchen knife into the siding .

Sneak preview of " The Race For a New Game Machine " book
David Shippy designed " the brains " of the PlayStation 3's Cell processor .
In a new book entitled " The Race For a New Game Machine " , he and his co-worker Mickie Phipps document what went into building it , and the subsequent derailment of the project , which , evidently , saw IBM ( with which Sony was a partner for the project ) making the processing chips for a certain two other rival game consoles .
Toshiba was the other partner in the plan ; together they intended to spend $ 400 million over five years in designing the microprocessor , discounting costs for the production facilities themselves .
And something interesting happened : Microsoft approached IBM to make the chip for the then - unnamed Xbox 360 .
IBM's Adam Bennett showed Microsoft the specs for the still - in - development Cell ( generally a no - no ) , and Microsoft , liking what they saw , contracted their own chip , to be built around Sony 's core .
Toshiba , IBM and Sony agreed from the beginning they would eventually sell the processor to other clients at some point , but to show it off and sell parts of it to a rival company , while still in development no less , seems bizarre , to say the least .
As the Wall Street Journal puts it : " The result was that Sony 's R&D money was spent creating a component for Microsoft to use against it . "
It gets more absurd : IBM employees hiding their work from Sony and Toshiba engineers in cubicles next to them ; the Xbox chip being tested a few floors above the Cell design teams ; Microsoft , due to a problem with a first chip run and being smart enough to order backups from a third party in advance , ending up getting their chips six weeks before Sony .
The desingers state " Both Sony and Microsoft were extremely successful at achieving their goals , " but the Journal 's Jonathan V. Last writes while they " set the standard for technical virtuosity " ( overdoing it , maybe ? ) , Nintendo's Wii ( the least technically powerful ) is the leading console in sales by far .
Indeed , PS3 sales are down 19 % from this time last year , while sales doubled for the Wii , and rose 8 % for the Xbox 360 .
" The lesson , " says Last , " lost on Mr. Shippy and Ms. Phipps , is that technical supremacy divorced from sound strategic vision is no virtue .
It can even end up in disaster . "
Now just to figure out how they managed to get this thing published ...

NEW YORK , Jan. 7 ( UPI ) --
A hot dog vendor who paid $ 362 , 201 for the food - vending rights for a New York corner says the prime position is worth every penny .
First - time vendor Pasang Sherpa said when the Metropolitan Museum of Art auctioned off the sales rights to two of its corners , he decided to pay an additional $ 81,701 to sell his hot dogs near its north - side entrance , the New York Post said Wednesday .

The cost increase , which represents thousands of hot dogs in Sherpa 's world , was acceptable for the vendor despite only being 100 feet away from the site 's south entrance .
" That ( north ) side is more busy , " Sherpa said of his new sales locale at the tourism site that more than 5 million people visit each year .
The 50 - year - old former jewelry salesman outbid his competitors by $ 65,000 a year to obtain the sales spot , but now faces troubles at the coveted spot .
The Post said the health department has failed to certify one of Sherpa 's two hot dog carts and despite its eventual allure , his costly corner is currently mired in construction .
For example , I tend to remember the sitter in his portrait of the ebony worker Herman Doomer ( 1640 ) as a young man , though he ’s not .
With his smiling eyes and wide - brimmed hat , he has a youthful look , but he was in his mid to late 40s when the likeness was painted .
In later portraits Rembrandt seems to age his sitters prematurely .
But in this one , done when his life and career were still flying high , no .
Image Smug and seductive :  The Toilet of Bathsheba ( 1643 ) is Rembrandts take on a story of betrayal .
Credit ...
The Metropolitan Museum of Art
Seeing the picture called “ The Toilet of Bathsheba ” ( 1643 ) also took me by surprise , maybe because a later Bathsheba picture , the one in the Louvre dated 1654 , stays so firmly in mind .
Both related to the same biblical story : a beautiful young wife is preparing for a liaison with her lover , King David , which will lead to the death of the husband she is betraying .
In the Louvre painting the nude woman is lost in sad reverie , as if already filled with regret for what she is about do .
The mood of the Met picture is almost the opposite .
Here , while getting a pedicure and a comb - out , she fondles one of her breasts and gives us a smug , seductive glance .
The waiting David is faintly visible in a distant tower .
The peacock of pride broods in a corner of her room .
Some people consider Rembrandt a sentimentalist , but he can be as tough as nails , as he is in this picture .
By the time he painted it , fortune had already delivered some shocks : his wife , Saskia , had died a year earlier , and he was immersed in a protracted fight with her family over the inheritance she had left for their son Titus .
Still , his career was solid and his life was afloat .
Then it was n’t .
In 1649 his servant and lover Geertge Dircx sued him for the equivalent of palimony .
His new mistress , also a servant , Hendrickje Stoffels , testified on his behalf , and Dircx was jailed , but the whole business was badly destabilizing .
He was borrowing large chunks of cash to pay off extravagant loans , and brokering iffy art deals .

Canada 's highly touted do - not - call list is having the opposite effect , leading to more telemarketer calls , says the Consumers ' Association of Canada .
" It 's a travesty , " president Bruce Cran said Friday .
" Here we have all these people thinking they were getting rid of incoming phone calls .
Anyone who is registered should suspect their phone number is being broadcast to the four winds . "
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission launched the registry in September to great fanfare , promising that those who registered would see a drop in unwanted calls soliciting goods and service .
Millions of Canadians have registered their names , home phone numbers and in some cases their cellphone numbers .
The problem , said Cran , is that the CRTC sells the registry list online .
" In Toronto , you can get 600,000 names for $ 50 , " he said .
Telemarketers are required to subscribe to the list , paying an annual fee that depends on how often they chose to download updates .
Those who violate the list by calling registrants may be fined up to $ 15,000 per call .
Chilliwack , B.C. , real estate consultant Jim Stocco said he suspects the " avalanche of calls " he and his wife have been fielding lately is a result of having registered with the do - not - call list .
Before registering , Stocco had managed to bring unwanted phone solicitations down to about one a week by calling back telemarketers and asking them to take his phone number off their list .
" This do - not - call registry has made things worse .
We now get five or six calls a day , " he said .
" We both work at home and have clients across North America so we will answer calls .
It has been a major irritant . "
Stocco said when he tries to call telemarketers back to ask that his number be taken off their list , he gets a voice mailbox that does not accept messages .
Glenn Thibeault , NDP critic for consumer protection , wrote to the federal privacy commissioner Jennifer Stoddart on Jan. 16 urging her to investigate .
" When the service is not only ineffective but assists in worsening the problem , Canadians have a right to be concerned , " he said .
A spokesperson for the commissioner said Friday that she was aware of the problem before being contacted by Thibeault .
" We are concerned as well , " said Heather Ormerod .
" We are in contact with the CRTC and trying to gather relevant information to see how to proceed . "
There may be a new president , but in DEA - land , it ’s still business as usual — at least for the time being .
On Thursday , just two days after President Barack Obama was sworn into office , DEA officials raided the office of a California medical marijuana provider , as well as two medical grow houses in Colorado .
Is this behavior the final gasp of a dying regime , or an unfortunate harbinger of things to come ?
That could be up to you .
Several marijuana law reform groups , including Americans for Safe Access and MPP — as well as national media outlets — are urging concerned citizens to contact the new administration in opposition to the DEA ’s actions .
Call or e-mail the White House and tell Obama ’s staff that our new President must honor his campaign pledge not to use Justice Department resources to circumvent state medical marijuana laws .
In the coming months , President Obama and his team will be appointing new DEA administrators .
Congress will also be holding additional hearings regarding Obama ’s pick for U.S. Attorney General , Eric Holder .
Let ’s make it clear to the President , now , that the DEA ’s behavior is unacceptable and must not continue under an Obama administration .
Let ’s make yesterday ’s raids the last acts of a morally and fiscally bankrupt federal policy .
Act now .

Stage and film star Claire Bloom and author Philip Roth took no prisoners when their 17 - year relationship ended in a firestorm .
When one of the partners in a marriage is a man who ’s been called “ a gleeful misogynist ” –- in a complimentary article , no less –- it comes as no surprise when their union is torn asunder .
Claire Bloom and Philip Roth became a couple in 1976 .
She was not only a classically trained actress , but her beauty rivaled that of fellow English - woman Elizabeth Taylor ( who she actually beat to Richard Burton , with whom she had an affair ) .
He , of course is the American novelist whose career ebbed and flowed , until , after bypass surgery in 1989 , he devoted his whole being to writing and has been on a tear ever since .
Why re-visit their marriage over a decade later ?
How about as a case study in why two people of opposite temperaments should n’t pair off ?
Or as a cautionary tale about airing your dirty laundry in public ?
In truth , its fascination lies in the incongruity of artists behaving like tabloid trash .
I first became curious about them while working on an article about writers and their lovers or spouses .
The sticking point in those relationships has always been , aside from insufficient remuneration for the writer ’s work , the amount of time he or she devotes to his labors .
During my research , I came across this quote from Philip Roth , when he was interviewed by New Yorker editor David Remnick :
“ Usually I write all day , but if I want to go back to the studio in the evening , after dinner , I do n’t have to sit in the living room because someone else has been alone all day . ”
Roth must have been referring to the days when he was married to Ms. Bloom , especially when they were in residence at his country home .
They did n’t marry until 1989 ; in 1993 he served her with divorce papers .
Then I learned that their relationship occupied a central place in her memoir , Leaving a Doll ’s House ( Little , Brown and Co. , 1996 ) .
Thus , if you care to assign blame for who turned their relationship into a public vendetta , it was Ms. Bloom .
But , as Time reviewer Elizabeth Gleick wrote about Bloom ’s book , it “ is hard not to wonder what will happen when Roth turns his novelist ’s eye to this same material .
Claire Bloom has good reason to shudder at the prospect . ”
Drawing First Blood
Why , one wonders , did she strike the first blow when the odds were she ’d be subject to fierce retaliation ?
Perhaps she was seeing a therapist who encouraged her to write the book as a way of standing up for herself with someone to whom she felt subservient .
Ms. Bloom wrote of Roth , “ that I was intimidated : Philip always gained the upper hand in any argument , and with his razor - sharp wit could easily say something amusing and cutting . ”
Also Ms. Bloom likely needed the money .
After all —
“ The better to get the whole ugly business over ” — she ’d brought the divorce proceedings to a premature close .
“ After a relatively brief period of negotiation , ” she wrote , “ and much against my lawyer ’s strong advice , I settled with Philip for the sum of $ 100,000 . ”
Though she was a star , she was still prone to the vagaries of casting and suffered dry spells during which she generated no income .
Nor did Ms. Bloom reveal anything , um , icky , about the “ gleeful misogynist ” — no sexual quirks , not to mention shortcomings .
Their main bone of contention was Ms. Bloom ’s daughter by her first husband , actor Rod Steiger .
“ Above all else , ” she wrote , “ both for him and for me — the subject of my relationship with Anna became an eternal battlefield . ”
She admits that : “ I clung to Anna in ways that were extremely unsuitable , especially as she grew older ; this made Philip feel as though he was an intruder in our closed circle . ”
But “ I had n’t recognized how deep his prejudice ran . … I was caught in the middle .
…
Placing Philip ’s needs over Anna ’s meant hanging on to an important relationship at the price of my daughter ’s trust in her mother ’s protection . ”
After an operation on his knee went awry , Roth sank into a depression and spent time at a psychiatric hospital .
The reader may fault Ms. Bloom for holding Roth responsible for his odd behavior while ill .
But there was no ignoring the extent of the cruelty to which he subjected her , especially when it turned out he ’d met someone else and was trying to drive her away .
To wit :
“ Philip demanded the return of everything he had provided for me during our years together .
His [ itemized to a fare - thee - well ] list included … $ 28,500 per annum he had given me over twelve years … $ 150 per hour for the “ five or six hundred hours ” he had sent going over scripts with me … and ‘ a little something ’ for adapting The Cherry Orchard and writing a play about the writer Jean Rhys . ”
Roth , whose publishing contracts may be the largest a writer of serious fiction has ever received , saved the best for last : “ … for refusing to honor my prenuptial agreement , he levied a fine of sixty - two billion dollars –- a billion dollars for every year of my life . ”
Ms. Bloom ’s response : “ At first , the element of mockery I was doubtless intended to read into these messages was entirely lost on me . ”
Why would that be ?
Oh , because it was n’t funny .
Blood Feud
In 1999 , Roth wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Review of Books : “ Over the past three years I have become accustomed to finding Miss Bloom ’s characterization of me taken at face value . ”
But by then he had already sought revenge to set the record straight by means of a novel published in 1998 called I Married a Communist ( Houghton Mifflin ) .
The title refers not to the book ’s plot but to another book that plays a part in Roth ’s book — one chronicling the failed marriage of its author , a character named Eve Frame , in a spirit similar to which Claire Bloom wrote Leaving a Doll ’s House .
In his novel , Roth makes no bones about the problem the protagonist , Eve ’s husband Ira Ringold , experiences with her daughter by a previous marriage .
Ringold is not the author ’s alter ego ; as in some of Roth ’s other books the task falls to Nathan Zuckerman .
To make it more confusing , Zuckerman sub - contracts much of the narrating work to Ringold ’s now aged brother , Murray .
Ira Ringold is an outsized ( in physique as well as character ) radio star after World War II , known as Iron Rinn , with Communist sympathies .
Murray describes domestic life at Ira and Eve ’s Manhattan apartment :
“ Eve would be in the living room doing her needlepoint and listening to Sylphid plucking away and Ira ’d be upstairs writing to O’Day [ Ira ’s Communist mentor ] .
And when the harp [ in real life , Anna Steiger is an opera singer ] went silent and he went downstairs to find Eve , she would n’t be there .
She ’d be up in Sylphid ’s room . …
The two of them in bed , under the covers , listening to Cosi Fan Tutte . ”
Eve becomes pregnant with Ira ’s child .
But he ’s unable to talk her out of an abortion , which , he comes to realize , “ was n’t Eve ’s decision –- it was Sylphid ’s . …
What he hears Sylphid saying to her mother is , ‘ If you ever , ever try that again , I ’ll strangle the little idiot in its crib ! ' ”
Then Ira rents a well - appointed apartment for Sylphid :
“ That night [ Eve ] gathered her courage and went upstairs bearing the drawing she ’d made , the floor plan of the new apartment . …
It took no time at all , of course , for Sylphid to register her objection and for Ira to be racing up the stairs to Sylphid ’s room . …
But no Mozart this time . …
What he saw was Eve on her back screaming and crying , and Sylphid in her pajamas sitting astride her , also screaming , also crying , her strong harpist ’s hands pinning Eve ’s shoulders to the bed [ with ]
Sylphid , screaming , ‘ Ca n’t you stand up to anyone ?
Wo n’t you once stand up for your own daughter against him ?
Wo n’t you be a mother , ever ?
Ever ? ”
Leave us not forget the anti-Semitism ( the self - hating kind — Claire Bloom was born Jewish ) Roth ascribes to Eve as she lashes out at her sister - in - law , Murray ’s wife : “ ‘ You !
What are you staring at , you hideous , twisted little Jew ! ' ”
If you think this is pretty over - the - top for a supposed world - class novelist , you ’re not the only one .
It ’s as if Roth is so intent on seeking revenge against Ms. Bloom that he fails to notice that his writing has sunk to the level of melodrama .
Worse , he describes a scene in which Eve seeks out Ira , who ’s left her .
She prostates herself before him , throws her arms around his legs , and begs him to come back .
In her book , Ms. Bloom admits that she swallowed her pride in her attempts to keep Roth from leaving .
But , Roth portrays
Eve ’s craven imploring not as a cry for help at some level , but as an assault on Ringold .
That ’s judgmentalism from the most imperious and frigid of heights .
Worst of all , he equates Ms. Bloom ’s writing about their marriage with Eve Frame outing Rinn ’s communism ( which may be a metaphor for the single - mindedness with which Roth pursues writing ) .
No Grist Too Coarse for the Mill
One can hear the objection :
All ’s fair in love and fiction .
Is n’t all life fair game for fiction , no matter who gets hurt ?
Perhaps , but in life as well as art a balanced portrait aligns fiction more closely with the truth .
While I Married a Communist is a wild ride of a book , the character of Eve Frame is a caricature that has no place in a novel by an important writer .
Furthermore , while Roth ’s reputation may have suffered harm from Leaving a Doll ’s House , there ’s no way it ruined him like Ira was when Eve outed him as a communist during the McCarthy era .
Today Roth enjoys accolades as America ’s greatest living novelist .
After the divorce , Ms. Bloom , who ’s played in everything from Shakespeare to a Charlie Chaplin movie to Ibsen to a Woody Allen movie , accepted a role in the soap opera As the World Turns to pay her bills .
In the end , the revenge Philip Roth sought with I Married a Communist boomeranged on him .
Its author comes off as petty , narcissistic , and vicious — unbecoming traits that could work to keep this perennial Nobel - Prize - for - literature candidate perennial .
In response to my recent column on patients trusting doctors too much , several readers wrote in about the difficulty of finding or sifting through information on doctors and diseases .
Many asked for suggestions , so a couple of weeks ago I contacted several nationally respected leaders in family medicine , pediatrics , internal medicine , oncology , surgery and anesthesia and asked them to share their advice on researching doctors and diseases .
Many of the doctors I spoke to or exchanged e-mail with made commonsense suggestions that were not unexpected .
They urged patients to find out which doctors their closest friends really like , to ask a prospective doctor questions like how much experience he or she has with a specific condition or operation , and to make sure that as a patient you feel part of a shared decision - making process and comfortable saying how you feel , or that you do n’t understand or that you respectfully disagree .
But many of the physicians also shared links to valuable Web sites , several of which I was unfamiliar with .
All the sites are free to the public and accessible to anyone with an Internet connection .
When I looked at these sites while writing this column , I became really excited as a patient about the amount of information available .
For example , one site from the Department of Health and Human Services called Hospital Compare ( www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) allows you to select three hospitals within a 25 - mile radius of your home .
It also lets you compare a wide variety of quality indicators , like the percentage of heart failure patients who were given discharge instructions , the percentage of surgery patients given prophylactic antibiotics at the right time , or the percentage of hospitalized patients who felt that doctors or nurses “ always ” communicated well ( the differences among hospitals surprised me ) .
And according to several of the doctors I spoke with , the amount of information available to patients will only increase in the future .
Doctors treating an elderly Chinese woman for stomach ache were stunned when they found that she had been carrying an unborn child for 60 years .
Ninety - two - year - old Huang Yijun , of Huangjiaotan , revealed that her child had died in the womb way back in 1948 , and that she did not have it removed because doctors would charge 100 pounds for the job .
" It was a huge sum at the time - more than the whole family earned in several years so I did nothing and ignored it , ” The Sun quoted her as saying .
The secret surfaced after Huang hurt her stomach , and went to hospital for a scan .
Dr Liu Anbin , at Qingshen hospital , said : " I could n’t believe my eyes when I discovered she had a baby in her belly .
I ’ve been a doctor for more than 40 years and it ’s the first time I have seen something like this . "
The doctors are presently carrying out further tests to determine whether Huang would require an operation to remove the baby .
Consultant Xu Xianming , director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology department at the hospital , said : " Normally a dead foetus would decay .
It ’s very rare that Huang can be so healthy . "
( CNN ) -- Thandi Zulu was single , pregnant and staying at a women 's shelter in Houston , Texas , when she received a mysterious letter one day .
Single mom Thandi Zulu says she was duped by a work - at - home scam .
more photos »
A company told Zulu that she could make big money working at home in a data - entry job .
No résumé or experience was needed .
All she had to do was pay a $ 200 fee .
You probably know what happened next .
Zulu called the company , gave them her checking account number and then tried to stop herself because she realized that she was doing something stupid .
" The moment I did it , I said ' Damn , this is a scam , ' " Zulu said of her 2001 nightmare .
" I put them on hold , and then I tried to call them back , but nobody was home . "
Financial guru Bernard Madoff is grabbing headlines because he is accused of swindling wealthy clients out of $ 50 billion in a massive Ponzi scheme .
But work - at - home scammers are also plundering the paltry savings of ordinary people like Zulu every day .
Work - at - home - scams are on the rise , consumer watchdog groups say .
Scammers are busier than ever because tough economic times are making people more desperate to make money , says Christine Durst , CEO of Staffcentrix , a company specializing in home - based careers that sifts through home - based job leads every day .
iReport.com :
Do you have a business at home ?
Tell us
Durst says people are searching more for home - based jobs to save money on gas , clothing and child care .
Seniors are also looking to supplement their dwindling retirement income .
Durst says Staffcentrix researchers screen about 5,000 home jobs leads every week , and there is a " 54 - to - 1 scam ratio . "
" This means that for every 55 [ work - at - home ] leads we investigate , only one passes our legitimacy standards , " she said .
Work - at - home scammers have traditionally used letters , television commercials and magazine advertisements .
But the Internet is becoming their favorite hunting ground , says Karen Hobbs , an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission , the federal agency responsible for consumer protection .
" The Internet is a boon for this industry , because it 's a very cheap method for reaching consumers across the U.S. and the world , " Hobbs said .
Catching work - at - home scammers is difficult because they use online facades and fake identities , and they constantly change names and mailing addresses , Hobbs says .
Those who are caught , though , can face serious time .
One work - at - home scammer was sentenced to 22 months in federal prison last year and ordered to pay $ 293,619 in restitution , Hobbs says .
But many scammers often act as if they 're too clever to get caught , Durst says .
" We have over the years engaged in e-mails with them , and frankly , they 're quite cocky , " Durst said .
" It 's a craft for them .
They really pride themselves on understanding the human psyche . "
Be wary of " palm trees , beaches and bikinis "
A consumer 's best defense against these clever predators is to develop their own guile , Durst says .
First , they should learn how to spot the warning signs of a work - at - home scammer .
Any advertisement that contains the phrase " work at home " is immediately suspect , because working at home is not a job title , Durst says .
Scammers use that phrase to bait their victims .
Other warning signs :
You 're required to pay a fee for additional information , promises of " unbelievable pay ! " and claims that no experience is necessary or résumé is needed .
Durst also says to watch out for " palm trees , mansions , beaches and bikinis . "
" If the ad you 're looking at features palm trees , a mansion and a Ferrari , it 's probably a scam .
Successful scammers often bag their prey by dangling enticing things in front of them , much like kidnappers do : ' If you get into my car , I 'll give you this candy bar , ' " Durst said .
There are other rules people should follow as well :
Never forward any money to an " employer , " never give personal information like a Social Security or bank account number over the Internet and never agree to cash checks for a percentage under any circumstances , consumer watchdog experts say .
Those who think they 've been scammed can still get help .
They can contact the FTC ( http://www.ftc.gov/), the Better Business Bureau or the attorney general 's office in their state .
Why do people still fall for them ?
Despite the publicity generated by work - at - home scammers , why do so many people still fall for the scams ?
Some consumer watchdog groups say it 's too simplistic to say that people are gullible .
For example , many of the people who say they lost money in Madoff 's alleged Ponzi scheme were celebrity actors , writers , wealthy people -- people with abundant smarts .
See some of the celebrities »
Hobbs , from the FTC , says work - at - home scams appeal to that can - do spirit in Americans .
" Americans have an entrepreneurial sprit , " she said .
" Many people will want to work independently , and they 're looking for those opportunities , especially in hard times . "
Durst , the CEO of Staffcentrix , cites another reason .
" It 's desperation , " she said .
" It 's the same reason people play the lottery : They think today could be their lucky day . "
Zulu , the single mom , subscribes to Durst 's theory .
" I did n't pay attention , " she said .
" When you 're desperate and you 're looking for something , you just go ahead .
I was pregnant , and I did n't have a job .
I wanted to work at home . "
Zulu says she finally found a legitimate job .
She moved to Laurel , Mississippi , and now sells medical and dental plans through a company called Ameriplan USA .
She even calls people and tells them that they can sell Ameriplan from their own homes .
But sometimes she runs into an unexpected problem .
" They do n't believe me , " she said .
" People think we 're scammers . "

One of Mr. Paterson ’s preferences had been to select a woman to replace Mrs. Clinton .
The governor continued to deliberate and discuss the matter with his advisers  despite earlier reports that he had settled on Ms. Gillibrand  until he made his decision , according to the person who talked to him .
He then called Ms. Gillibrand , who had earlier in the evening been told to come to Albany to await an announcement , to let her know she was his pick .
If Mr. Paterson was hoping to quiet the tumult over the selection process by picking Ms. Gillibrand , there were indications that he may not get his wish .
Ms. Gillibrand , who has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association , is controversial among some of the party ’s more liberal leaders downstate .
Representative Carolyn McCarthy , a Long Island Democrat and ardent gun control activist , said Thursday that if Ms. Gillibrand got the job , she was prepared to run against her in a primary in 2010 .
Ms. McCarthy was elected to Congress after her husband was killed in a gunman ’s rampage on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993 .
Ms. Gillibrand ’s selection was a careful political calculation by the governor , who will run for his second term as governor in 2010 , when Ms. Gillibrand will also be on the ballot .
The choice reflects Mr. Paterson ’s thinking that his selection should be someone who can help him attract key demographics  in Ms. Gillibrand ’s case upstate New Yorkers and women .

Advertisement A woman has been found guilty of manslaughter after a shopper was killed following a row over queue jumping .
Antonette Richardson called boyfriend Tony Virasami to Sainsbury 's in Merton , south London , but he punched the wrong man , who suffered a fatal brain injury .
Virasami , 38 , admitted the manslaughter of Kevin Tripp , 57 .
Richardson , 37 , had denied the charge .
Mr Tripp 's family said the pair had shown no remorse at Southwark Crown Court and could never be forgiven .
One of the last images my Rianna and I have of Kev is in the hospital ... bruised , yellow and so very , very cold
Josie James , Mr Tripp 's partner Richardson , of Sedgehill Road , Catford , had been accused of pushing in front of shopper Adam Prendergast , as she went to buy a packet of cigarettes .
She phoned Virasami who was waiting in a car nearby , and when he came into the store she pointed out Mr Prendergast .
However , Virasami mistook Mr Tripp for the person who shouted at his girlfriend , and punched him , the court heard .
The jury saw CCTV footage of the unprovoked attack in June 2008 , with the last shot capturing the fatally injured man 's feet at the bottom of the frame .
Michael Worsley QC , prosecuting , said Virasami landed " the most almighty blow " on the victim , causing him to fall over and bang his head hard on the floor .
Richardson , who is a grandmother , told the court she was shocked and disgusted when her boyfriend hit the wrong person .
' So angry ' Mr Tripp , from Colliers Wood in south - west London - an ME sufferer who had a five - year - old daughter - died shortly afterwards in hospital .
In a statement Mr Tripp 's partner Josie James said : " That he was able to be such a strong and supportive partner , father and brother despite being affected by ME is testament to his character .
" One of the last images my Rianna and I have of Kev is in the hospital on apparatus to keep him alive , bruised , yellow and so very , very cold .
Both Richardson and Virasami had previous convictions " I had to explain to our five - year - old daughter ...
She talks about daddy having all the wires in him . "
In a statement Mr Tripp 's sisters Gillian , Laurel and Joan and brother Derek said he was a " wonderful brother " .
" We do not understand how someone would get so angry over something like queue jumping that they can hit someone and cause their death .
" That neither has shown signs of remorse in court , even smiling at us during a previous hearing , makes it even harder to deal with and means we can never forgive them . "
The jury took more than seven hours to deliver the 11 - 1 majority verdict .
Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC said : " This is a serious case .
Bail will be refused . "
At the time of the attack Virasami was on bail , tagged and under curfew for shoplifting , while Richardson has previous convictions for deception and handling stolen goods , the court heard .
Both will be sentenced at a later date .

The body of a Somali pirate who drowned after receiving a huge ransom has washed ashore with $ 153,000 ( £ 100,000 ) in cash , while a spokesman for another group of pirates promised to soon free a Ukrainian arms ship .
Five pirates drowned on Friday when their small boat capsized after they received a reported $ 3 m ransom for releasing a Saudi oil tanker .
Local resident Omar Abdi Hassan said one of the bodies had been found on a beach near the coastal town of Harardhere and relatives were searching for the other four .
" One of them was discovered and they are still looking for the other ones .
He had $ 153,000 in a plastic bag in his pocket , " he said .
The US navy released photos of a parachute dropping a package on to the deck of the Sirius Star , and said the package was likely to be the ransom delivery .
Graeme Gibbon Brooks , managing director of the British company Dryad Maritime Intelligence Service , said the incident was unlikely to deter attacks .
" The loss or potential loss of the ransom means the pirates will be all the more keen to get the next ransom in , " he said .
" There are people lining up to be pirates . "
The Sirius Star had been held near the Ukrainian cargo ship MV Faina , which was loaded with 33 Soviet - designed battle tanks and crates of small arms .
The same day the Sirius Star was released , the family members of the Faina crew appealed for help , saying they were not kept informed about the negotiations or the state of their loved ones ' health .
But a pirate spokesman said today that the 20 crew members on the MV Faina were doing well .
" The cargo is still there unharmed and the crew is healthy , " Sugule Ali said .
" Once the negotiations end in mutual understanding , the ship , its crew and the cargo as well will be released . "
There have been several false alarms about the release of the MV Faina since it was seized in September .
Ali said the pirates were still negotiating with the ship 's owners .
" Nothing has changed from our previous demand of $ 20 m ransom for the release of the ship , but as negotiations continue we are likely to reduce the amount , " he said .
He declined to give further details .
American warships have been closely monitoring the Faina amid fears that some of the weapons on board could be taken onshore and fall into the hands of Islamic insurgents .
The shaky Somali government is battling insurgents that the US state department says are linked to al - Qaida .
But the situation is complicated by clan militias and rivalries within the Islamist movement .
Somalia has not had a functioning government since 1991 and its lawless coastline is a haven for pirates , who attacked 111 ships in the Gulf of Aden and kidnapped 42 of them last year alone .
An international flotilla including US warships has been patrolling the area .
The flotilla has stopped many attacks , but the area is too vast to keep all ships safe .
Back in February 2007 , medi - pot advocates were feeling optimistic that access to research - grade pot for use in Food and Drug Administration - approved studies might soon be opening up – and for good reason .
That month , Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner ruled in favor of allowing University of Massachusetts - Amherst professor Lyle Craker to begin growing a new crop of pot that would be available for research into the medicinal value of marijuana , with the ultimate goal of developing an FDA - approved medi-pot .
Craker initially applied to the Drug Enforce­ment Administration for permission to grow the test crop in 2001 .
After three years of bureauczratic delays , the agency concluded in 2004 that Craker 's request should be denied .
Craker , backed by the Multidisci­plin­ary Assoc­i­ation for Psychedelic Studies ( a research outfit that aims to develop government - approved prescription drugs from controlled substances such as LSD , MDMA or Ecstasy , and pot ) , appealed that decision , which was heard by Bittner during nine days of testimony spread out over two months in 2005 .
A year and a half later , Bittner weighed in , agreeing that Craker should be granted permission to grow .
That pleased medi - pot advocates but was n't the end of the story .
Bittner 's findings were nonbinding , so it would ultimately fall to DEA administrators to decide whether to accept her conclusions .
On Jan. 7 , Michele Leonhart , a DEA dep­uty administrator , finally weighed in on the matter , rejected Bittner 's conclusions , and again denied Craker 's application .
Craker said the DEA decision was a " disappointment , " but , " I do n't think we need to be surprised " by it .
In a 118 - page rejection letter , Leonhart concludes that Craker 's bid to grow research pot is " precluded under Federal law , " because , among other related reasons , he was unable to demonstrate to the agency that an additional source of research marijuana was actually needed to meet demand .
( Read the DEA 's rejection letter with this story below . )
Indeed , since 1968 , the University of Mississippi has held the only contract to grow pot for government - approved purposes – including providing pot for remaining participants of a federal medi- pot study group and for research approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( part of the National Institutes of Health ) , which actually doles out the dope to researchers .
The arrangement means the dope is essentially under constant control of the feds , which is what is called for under the United Nations ' Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs , to which the U.S. is a party .
Moreover , Leonhart writes in her opinion that no one much has complained about the quantity or quality of the Ole Miss dope and notes that as of 2005 , the university had under its control some 1,055 kilograms ( 2,326 pounds ) of the stuff in storage .
In fact , she writes , there 's so much in reserve that they have n't actually had to cultivate any new dope since 1997 .
" For the reasons indicated above , I have determined that [ Craker 's ] proposed registration [ to grow ] is inconsistent with United States obligations under the Single Convention and with the public interest , " Leonhart concluded .
While the DEA may not see a need to grow additional pot for research , Crak­er , head of the UMass Medicinal Plant Program ; Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies founder and President Rick Doblin ; at least 47 members of Congress ( including Massachusetts Sens. John Kerry and Ted Kennedy ) ; and a broad swath of public health organizations – including the Lymphoma Foun­dation of America , the National Assoc­ia­tion for Public Health Policy , the Multiple Scler­osis Foundation , and the California Med­ical Assoc­iation – disagree .
Despite what the DEA thinks , the product provided by the University of Missis­sippi is inconsistent in quality , and the manner by which the government determines who will get pot for research is confounding .
" We believe that marijuana should be treated like any other potential therapeutic medicine , with researchers having the ability to obtain it and test it , within federally - approved scientific research protocols , " Dr. Jack Lewin , former CEO of the California Medical Association , wrote in a 2005 letter of support for Craker .
" To date , it has generally not been treated that way , causing significant problems in the research into marijuana as a potential medicine .
It is in the public interest to allow the scientific process to determine whether marijuana should be available as a medicine for sick patients who may need it , and DEA licensing of appropriate and qualified researchers is crucial to facilitate that process . "
Craker finds the entire process frustrating .
On one hand , the government remains skeptical about medical marijuana until solid research can prove otherwise , yet it continues putting up roadblocks to prevent progress on that front .
" If there is no medical benefit [ from marijuana ] , then it would be to [ the government 's ] advantage to have it tested , " Craker told the Chronicle .
Allen Hopper , the litigation director for the ACLU 's Drug Law Reform Project , which is representing Craker , said the attorneys are still reviewing the DEA decision .
Whether they will now appeal the decision directly to the U.S. appeals court for the District of Columbia circuit or will seek additional review within the DEA has not been decided .
Hopper said that in her decision , Leonhart raises " evidence " never addressed in the hearings with Bittner , which may need to be addressed with the agency before moving the case to the federal court .
As frustrating as the entire experience has been , Craker vows not to give up : " The struggle is still in its beginning stages . "

( CNN ) --
When a new president strolls into the White House , there 's a kick in his step and a twinkle in his eyes .
This photo illustration projects what President - elect Barack Obama may look like in four years .
more photos »
But as the years go by , the high - stakes decisions , constant criticisms and the fluctuating public opinion chip away at the president .
His shoulders slump a little and his energy may seem sapped .
The president ages twice as fast while in office , according to a theory advanced by Dr. Michael Roizen , a chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic .
" The typical person who lives one year ages one year , " he said .
" The typical president ages two years for every year they are in office . "
Using public information , Roizen looked through medical records of previous presidents back to Theodore Roosevelt .
Assessing factors such as diet , blood pressure , physical activity and lifestyle habits , he calculated that the leader of the free world ages more quickly .
Roizen , who is the author of " RealAge : Are You as Young as You Can Be ? " has not assessed the " real age " of President - elect Barack Obama , who is 47 , because of lack of medical data .
" Barack Obama is a fairly young guy and does n't have great of a risk , " Roizen said .
" If he 's president for eight years , he ends up having the risk of disability or dying , like someone who is 16 years older . "
Former president Bill Clinton entered the office with a robust head of salt - and - pepper hair and a healthy habit of running .
After bitter partisan battles , the Monica Lewinsky scandal , and impeachment by the House , Clinton left office with wrinkles and powder - white hair .
" Chronic stress can produce lots of wear and tear on the body , " said James A. McCubbin , a Clemson University professor of psychology and senior associate dean of the College of Business and Behavioral Science .
" This is what we see in the changes in the appearance in the beginning and end of the presidency . "
Roizen points to the experience of Ronald Reagan .
" When Reagan came into office , he stood up absolutely straight .
He was joking and incredibly quick - witted about current events .
When he left office , he was hunched over .
The age signs on face was there .
His jokes were those of olden days rather than current events , " he said .

On Wednesday , Obama , President George W. Bush , and all three living former presidents -- Jimmy Carter , George Herbert Walker Bush , and Clinton -- are meeting in the Oval Office and then having lunch together at the White House .
After eight draining years in the Oval Office , an outgoing president like George W. Bush can reverse the tolls of stress by exercising and spending time with friends , Roizen says .
" Do as many healthy things as you can adopt , " Roizen suggested .
" The main thing he should do is finding what he wants to do with the rest of his life , which is tough for presidents to find something meaningful to do . "
During his second term , Bush dealt with a troubled war , a struggling economy , and sagging approval ratings .
But the avid runner , mountain biker and fisherman showed that his reflexes have n't slowed .
" I mean , did you see him dodge that shoe ? " said David Zinczenko , editor - in - chief of Men's Health magazine , referring to a December news conference in Iraq where an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at the president and Bush swiftly ducked the flying footwear .
Twice .
The incoming president is also no slacker .
Although accused by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of having skinny legs , Obama regularly frequents the gym and plays basketball .
The president - elect was on the cover of Men 's Health in November .
" This is not a broccoli - shunning , pork rind - eating , McDonald 's - popping guy .
I mean , this is someone who eats arugula and guacamole and Hawaiian pizza , " Zinczenko told CNN .

" If the worst that happens is that your hair goes a little gray , so be it . "
Many recent presidents have turned to sports to decompress .
Presidents have enjoyed mountain biking ( George W. Bush ) , golf ( Clinton , Gerald Ford , Dwight D. Eisenhower ) , tennis ( Ford , Carter , George H.W. Bush ) , jogging ( Clinton , Carter and both Bushes ) , swimming ( Ford ) , bowling ( Richard Nixon ) , horseshoes ( George H.W. Bush ) and horseback riding ( Reagan ) .

" The daily routine of a president is really grueling , " Ron Nessen , Ford 's press secretary , told CNN .
" It 's hard to get thinking time .
Ford talked about how when he was swimming laps , it gave him time to think about things . "
During the Democratic primaries , Obama worked out at the gym in the Cleveland Clinic the morning of his debate with then - rival Hilary Clinton .
Living up to his nickname " No Drama Obama , " the candidate was remarkably calm , considering a high - stakes debate was to take place that night , Roizen recalled .
" Maybe he will age better , because he handles stress better , " he said .
" The fact that he smokes means he still has inner stress . "
Retaining a close group of friends and confidants is an important way to reduce the isolation of the presidency , Roizen said .

Nine ways to treat your batteries right
Previously , I talked about the basic facts behind batteries .
Now , let 's talk about how to put them into practice ...
1 : Discharge Ni-Cad and Ni-MH batteries fairly far
NiMH and NiCad batteries both like to go through a normal charging cycle , so you do n't want to take 10 shots and then shove them back in the charger .
There 's some debate and religious ritual involved here and very little data .
It should be OK to just use them until they reach 1 volt per cell and then charge them again .
If you want to be sure , you can have your charger discharge them all the way down , but that also means that you are wearing out the battery without actually using it to power something , so it wo n't last as long .
2 : Do n't discharge all the way
All batteries are damaged if you charge them too low .
Be careful about trying to get one last shot of them -- the " low battery " light may not trigger until after you 've reached the point of damage .
With Lithium - Ion batteries , there 's absolutely no benefit in discharging them other than use .
Under no account should you try to discharge a battery all the way by leaving your device on .
Your battery may survive a few deep discharges , but every time damages the battery .
Eventually it just wo n't work .
Or if you discharge it too deep too quickly , it 'll just blow up .
3 : Keep batteries in sets if you need several
If your device takes 4 AA batteries , keep them in a set .
If you have one battery that has less capacity than the others , the weakest battery will get fried before the device stops working .
The easiest way to avoid this is to keep batteries of more or less the same capacity and charge properties in a set .
I usually write on the battery a letter with a marker , so I can track this .
4 : Use a good charger
There 's pretty much three grades of chargers for NiMH batteries .
The first category are the cheap overnight chargers .
Cheap chargers will " gang up " two batteries and charge all batteries with a " trickle " charge that wo n't damage the battery too much .
They may not accurately sense when a battery has been fully charged ( or not bother sensing it at all ) so if you put your batteries in one for a week or more , it 'll start damaging the cells .
In theory , they should be able to equalize the charge of a set of batteries , but in practice they do n't always do it properly .
The second category are the fast chargers that still " gang up " batteries into sets .
They will charge faster , but are n't always that great for the batteries .
They do n't always use the best parameters to detect if the battery has finished charging , so they can overcharge it .
In theory , they are supposed to drop into " trickle " charge mode and try to get the cells equalized , but that does n't always work right either .
I am not impressed with these chargers at all .
The third category are the good ones .
They charge each cell individually .
They can also discharge each of the batteries down to the safe minimum and then charge each battery up to the safe maximum .
They often times also have " test " modes to let you sort out a batch of unsorted batteries into sets and " refresh " modes that may or may not make your batteries abused by cheap chargers act better .
The thing is , I 've seen cheap chargers that are in the third category but cost less than a fancy name - brand charger in the second category .
Now , manufacturers really want to sell you the second category and have you think that they sold you the third category .
So they 'll put an indicator light on each slot , but they 'll still batch them .
The real thing is that your batteries will all finish charging at different times and that you can put them in a cell at a time .
There 's some noises made about fancy charger features that will zap your batteries in new and special ways , but I suspect the biggest advantage is just being able to charge batteries individually and to be able to charge all different sizes .
There was also some noises about super - fast chargers that would charge a set of batteries in 15 minutes or so .
The trick was to put a little chip inside of the battery that kills the charging when the battery is full .
The problem is that you can't take any random set of NiMH batteries and put them in a 15 minute charger and have it work , so I have n't seen much of them recently .
I 've been fairly happy with my BC - 900 .
5 : Keep Lithium - Ion Batteries topped off
Lithium batteries have basically no wear from charging and a fairly high risk of being damaged by being discharged all the way down , so just toss 'em in the charger after you are done shooting .
The biggest , best feature of Lithium - Ion batteries is that they like it when you do this .
6 : Keep Lithium - Ion batteries cool
The only thing you can do to make Lithium - Ion batteries last longer is to keep them cool .
In theory , one could get longer life out of them by storing them at a reduced charge in the fridge , but I 'm not sure how that is supposed to help , given that the battery still died over time .
But clearly not keeping them in hot places is a good idea .
7 : Do n't stock up on Lithium - Ion batteries
Since the clock - of - battery - life starts ticking when the battery is made and you can only change that so much , it is probably better to buy two batteries now , two batteries next year , and two batteries the year after than to buy six batteries now .
8 : Take the batteries out after you are done
This keeps biting me .
First , if you take the batteries out , you do n't need to worry about the power switch being left on .
Second , if you leave the batteries in the device and leave it alone for a while , it might leak the contents .
There 's a few ways this can happen , but it 's always nasty .
9 : Do n't short circuit a battery
It 's hard to do this with AA or AAA batteries because there 's a connection on each side .
But a battery can and will blow up if you do it .
LiIon batteries tend to have contact surfaces clustered on one end , so if you keep it in a pocket with your keys , you can have a minor blow - up .
Battery covers and cases are a good thing .
If for no other reason than making for a neat and clean camera bag .
A federal judge has agreed to a novel request : streaming parts of an upcoming file - sharing trial over the Internet .
Judge Nancy Gertner has granted the request of Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson and students to put the gavel - to - gavel footage on the Internet for any non-commercial use , over the RIAA 's objections .
But only on a one - time basis .
Joel Tenenbaum 's first strategy for dealing with an RIAA settlement letter was n't real helpful : he called them up and offered $ 500 instead of $ 3,500 .
His offer was rejected .
When the case actually went to court , Tenenbaum tried to settle again , this time for $ 5,000 , but by then the RIAA wanted $ 10,500 .
Tenenbaum 's next strategy has worked far better .
He attracted the attention of law professor Charles Nesson and the students in his CyberOne class .
The group has been a boil on the music industry 's smooth skin already , launching such media - worthy initiatives as a Twitter feed about the case and a brand - new website , and now agitating for online streaming of the entire trial .
Yesterday 's ruling does n't grant that ( yet , anyway ) , but the judge is clearly disposed towards making what happens in the court as public as possible , so long as it does n't interfere with jury anonymity or her courtroom proceedings .
To start , though , the judge has only allowed video at a January 22 hearing .
The RIAA objected to this , but the judge noted in her ruling that " their objections are curious .
At previous hearings and status conferences , the Plaintiffs have represented that they initiated these lawsuits not because they believe they will identify every person illegally downloading copyrighted material .
Rather , they believe that the lawsuits will deter the Defendants and the wider public from engaging in illegal file - sharing activities .
Their strategy effectively relies on the publicity resulting from this litigation . "
Nesson with students
Because the hearing will take place before jury selection in the case — which is scheduled to go to trial at the end of March — the RIAA countered that streaming the hearing could prejudice some jurors .
The judge called this " specious " and noted that there was already a system in place to " ferret out those jurors who have followed a case , whether it be through newspapers , television , or now , the Internet . "
Courtroom View Network will work with the court 's IT department to stream video footage from cameras already installed in the courtroom to the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard , which Nesson helped to found some years ago .
Berkman will cover all costs for the streaming and the video feed acquisition , and the footage will be placed on the web for all to watch .
The new owners of radio giant Clear Channel Communications will next week begin implementing a massive restructuring plan that seeks to cut $ 400 million in costs at the company , The Post has learned .
According to three sources with knowledge of the plan , the restructuring will include layoffs across the company ’s radio , outdoor advertising and international divisions as well as cuts to programming budgets and consolidation of back - office operations .
A precise headcount for the layoffs could not be obtained .
Clear Channel has about 30,000 employees worldwide .
The company is also likely to move toward a “ national programming ” model that would require less local - level staffing , despite being criticized in the past for a similar action using centralized disc jockeys that made it appear as though they were broadcasting from local stations .
Sources said an initial round of layoffs is expected to commence next Tuesday – not coincidentally the same day President - elect Barack Obama is to be sworn into office .
Clear Channel managers are hoping they can slip in the layoffs while the press is preoccupied with Inauguration Day festivities , sources said .
A Clear Channel spokeswoman declined to comment .
“ Clear Channel was built through a series of acquisitions that generally were n’t consolidated very well , ” said one source , alluding to the late ’90s buying spree that put more than 1,000 stations under the Clear Channel umbrella , making it the nation ’s largest radio company .
To be sure , Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners took a hard look at Clear Channel ’s expense base in the due diligence phase of their $ 17.9 billion acquisition , and identified hundreds of millions of dollars of costs that could be taken out of the company .
While they always planned to restructure the company , sources said that the soured economy forced them to expedite the timeframe for the cuts .
“ Nothing about our plans have changed except for the speed and timing of them , ” said the source .
“ There ’s no doubt we are in a horrible advertising environment , and we ca n’t just sit there and take it . ”
The numbers bear out that argument .
Radio ad spending fell almost 9 percent through the first three quarters of 2008 , the second worst - performing category after newspapers , according to ad- spending tracker TNS Media Intelligence .
Fourth - quarter ad - spending numbers have yet to be tabulated , but many are expecting a low - to mid - double - digit decline .
Congratulations go to Singapore for being the first nation to do something in this economic crisis that actually makes some sense : Singapore Cuts Government Salaries as Slump Deepens .
Singapore ’s government said it will cut the salaries of its top public workers and ministers as a “ sharp ” recession threatens to increase job losses and hurt lending this year .
The top government salaries will fall 12 percent to 20 percent in 2009 and “ may be subject to further adjustments given the volatility of the economy , ” Teo Chee Hean , the defense minister who ’s also in charge of the civil service , said in parliament today .
The reductions are deeper than the pay cuts the government said it was planning in November .
Singapore is scheduled to unveil more measures this week to help companies cope with the deepening global slump , which caused exports to contract in 2008 by the most in seven years .
The National Wages Council last week advised employers to freeze or cut pay rather than fire workers .
Little can be done to mitigate the current slowdown , which has spread to all parts of the economy , Trade Minister Lim Hng Kiang said in parliament today .
The nation is facing unprecedented conditions in this “ sharp ” recession , he said .

This is the second in a planned series of posts assessing the implications of the global financial crisis for the economic ideas and policies that have been dominant for the past few decades .
The large - scale privatisation of publicly - owned enterprises both in capitalist countries like the UK and Australia and in formerly communist countries after 1989 played a big role in promoting the kind of triumphalism that characterised much commentary about free - market capitalism in the 1990s and ( to a somewhat lesser extent ) in the years leading up to the crisis .
How well do arguments for privatisation stand up in the light of the financial crisis .
The case for privatisation had two main elements .
First , there was the fiscal argument for privatisation , namely , that governments could improve their financial position by selling government business enterprises .
This argument assumed that privately owned firms would have higher levels of operating efficiency , and therefore that the value of those firms would be increased by privatisation .
The second argument was a dynamic one , that the allocation of capital between alternative investments would be improved if governments were not involved in the process .
Both of these arguments have been fatally undermined by the collapse of the efficient markets hypothesis .
The fiscal case for privatisation must be assessed on a case by case basis .
It will always be true for example that if a public enterprise is operating at a loss , and can be sold off for a positive price with no strings attached , the government ’s fiscal position will benefit from privatisation .
Various early ventures in public ownership , such as the state butcher shops operated in Queensland in the 1920s ( apparently a response to concerns about thumbs on scales ) met this criterion , and there does n’t seem to be much interest in repeating this experiment .
However , for most recent privatisations in developed countries , the sale price has been less than any plausible estimate of the value of future earnings , discounted at the government bond rate .
The fiscal case for privatisation therefore rests on the claim , derived from the efficient markets hypothesis , that the correct discount rate to use is one based on the private sector cost of capital and therefore dominated by the expected rate of return to equity capital .
The choice of discount rate makes a difference because the rate of return to equity has historically been much higher than the rate of interest on government bonds , a gap that ca n’t be explained by standard economic arguments about risk premiums .
Although many explanations of this ‘ equity premium puzzle ’ have been offered , for present purposes they can be divided into two classes
( i ) those which assume that the EMH is true , and imply that the equity premium is a correct reflection of economic risk , independent of equity markets
( ii ) those in which the risk premium for equity reflects failures in equity markets that lead people to prefer holding bonds
In the light of the GFC and the events leading up to it , the case for explanations of type ( ii ) is overwhelmingly strong
The dynamic case for privatisation is based on the idea that the allocation of investment will be better undertaken by private firms than by government business enterprises .
This claim in turn relies on the assumption that the evaluation of risk and returns undertaken by investment banks , with the assistance of ratings agencies , and the availability of sophisticated markets for derivatives like CDOs will be far superior than anything that could be obtained by , for example , using engineering calculations of the need for investment in various kinds of infrastructure , and seeking to implement the resulting investment plans on a co-ordinated basis .
The GFC has shown that , for most of the past decade , market estimates of the relative riskiness and return of alternative investments have been entirely unrelated to related .
For infrastructure in particular , the decision processes of Byzantine creations like Macquarie and Babcock and Brown have determined the allocation of investment .
Unsurprisingly , the result has been a mess .
I ’ve been making this argument for some time , so I can anticipate the immediate response that , if the case for privatisation developed in the 1980s were invalid , it would be necessary to advocate public ownership of all enterprises .
I ’m never quite sure if those putting forward such arguments are as ignorant of marginal cost and benefit calculations as they appear to be , or whether it ’s simply meant as a debating trick .
But it should not be hard to see that , if the public sector has lower costs of capital , while the private sector has ( at least in a wide range of activities ) lower operating costs and greater responsiveness to consumer demand , the optimal economic structure will involve public ownership of some firms and private ownership of others , that is , a mixed economy .

NHS doctor Humayra Abedin , who says she has been held captive by her parents ahead of a forced marriage , is returning to the UK .
A Bangladesh court 's decision to order her release has been hailed as a " landmark " ruling by her lawyers .
Dr Abedin came to Britain in September 2002
But how significant is the case of the 33 - year - old trainee GP to the battle against forced marriages in Britain ?
For campaigners , the story of Dr Abedin 's alleged capture is disappointingly familiar .
She had travelled to Dhaka in August after hearing her mother was sick , but later sent messages to friends in the UK saying she was being held against her will and was being forced to marry .
The UK's Forced Marriage Unit dealt with more than 1,300 similar cases during the first three quarters of this year - an increase of 79 % on 2007 .
Most involved families from Pakistan , India and Bangladesh .
But campaigners and the government say forced marriage remains significantly under-reported and the problem is more widespread than the figures suggest .
In the most serious cases kidnapping and sexual , physical and mental abuse are involved .
In some instances victims have even been murdered .
What it does is emphasise for victims that there is relief there for them and they must come forward
Anne -Marie Hutchinson
Lawyer However , Dr Abedin 's solicitor , Anne-Marie Hutchinson , believes her client 's case has made a significant contribution to the fight against forced marriages in Britain for two reasons .
Firstly , because the judge in Bangladesh was prepared to go public and emphasise the " civil wrong " which had been done against her client , and secondly , because a British High Court order served under the new Forced Marriage Act was mentioned at the Dhaka hearing .
Although the UK injunction against Dr Abedin 's family had no " directing enforceability " in Bangladesh , " judicial note had been taken of its existence " , Ms Hutchinson says .
" What was heartening was to hear what was said in the Bangladesh court by the Supreme Court judge , who echoed what one would anticipate what a High Court judge would say here about the breach of human rights and the inappropriate actions of her parents , " she continues .
" What it does is emphasise for victims that there is relief there for them and they must come forward .
" ' Positive messages '
Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui , of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain , also believes the court order demanding Dr Abedin 's release is significant in tackling the culture behind forced marriages .
A special government unit tackles the issue of forced marriages Importantly , it is the first time the Forced Marriages Act - introduced in November - has been used in support of someone who is not a British national , he says .
" It will send out very positive messages to all young people who are taken for a variety of reasons to Pakistan , India and Bangladesh .
They have hope that they will be released even if they are not nationals of this country .
" It also sends a positive message to parents that they have limits to their rights .
Young people 's lives must dominate all other rights . "
Sophiya ( not her real name ) , who was taken by her family to Pakistan at the age of 20 and forced to marry , believes the outcome of the Dr Abedin 's case was " exactly what it should have been " .
But , she says , unlike Dr Abedin who had friends and colleagues to turn to , she , like many other women , was so " socially dependent " on her family she did not know where to turn .
National campaign ' needed '
It is these isolated women as well as those from poorer backgrounds that need to be reached , says Jasvinder Sanghera , of campaign group Karma Nirvana .
Although the latest ruling is welcome and she hopes it will encourage more victims to come forward , more still needs to be done to inform communities across the social divide .
" What we need to do is get information to victims and potential victims that this piece of legislation exists , " she says .
Forced marriage affects women from all backgrounds and all ages , she says , with most between the ages of 15 and 39 .
Ms Sanghera wants to see lessons on forced marriage legislation taught in schools and a national campaign launched on a similar scale to that used against drink driving .
She also wants the practice of forcing someone to marry to be made a specific criminal offence .
She adds : " These cases are on the increase in the UK .
Hundreds of people are currently at potential risk and many more are in these countries being held . "

Seattle and Minneapolis have vied as top reading hot spots for six years .
HOW METRO AREAS RANKED HOW METRO AREAS RANKED 1 .
Minneapolis and Seattle ( tie ) 3 .
Washington , D.C. 4 . St. Paul 5 . San Francisco 6 . Atlanta 7 . Denver 8 . Boston 9 . St. Louis 10 .
Cincinnati and Portland , Ore. ( tie ) Source : America 's Most Literate Cities , 2008 Minneapolis and Seattle are the USA 's most literate cities , according to an annual study examining the " culture and resources for reading " in the nation 's largest metro areas .
For the past six years , the two cities have traded the first and second spots in the rankings , which analyze six key indicators of literacy ( newspaper circulation , number of bookstores , library resources , periodical publishing resources , educational attainment and Internet resources ) against population rates for cities with populations of 250,000 or more .
The study does not look at reading test scores or how often people read , but what kinds of literary resources are available and used .
This is " one critical index of our nation 's well - being , " says study author Jack Miller , president of Central Connecticut State University in New Britain , Conn .
The findings come at a time when newspaper circulations across the USA are declining , and online newspaper reading is increasing .
Miller 's analysis suggests that , contrary to conventional wisdom , the availability of free online news is not to blame for the decline in newspapers ' print circulation — and that neither is the decline in bookstores across the country caused by the rise in online book buying .
Cities that ranked higher for having more bookstores also have a higher proportion of people buying books online , the analysis found , and cities with newspapers that have high per-capita circulation rates also have more people reading newspapers online .
Likewise , cities that ranked higher for having well - used libraries also have more booksellers .
" Cities that rank highly in one form of literate behavior are likely to rank highly in other forms and practices of literacy , " says Miller , noting that a literate society tends to practice many forms of literacy , not just one or another .
Preliminary results of a related study examining international literacy paint a less optimistic outlook for the USA .
It notes that in per-capita paid newspaper circulation , the USA ranks only 31st in the world , far behind other countries , including Aruba , Liechtenstein and Japan .
The literate cities study is available online at www.ccsu.edu/amlc08

I do n't care what anyone says .
I still like the Simpsons .
Sure , they may have been better a few seasons ago , but they are still worth 30 minutes of my time on a Sunday night .
To all you whiners who complain they are n't funny anymore , stop watching them .
And , if you think a clip Gizmodo 's posted will be lame , why watch it ?
While the Simpsons may seem old and outdated , it 's still better than a lot of the drek on TV today .
( reality TV needs to die a painful death )
Today ’s post is not really a post .
It is an attempt to create a workable Vim cheat - sheet .
I know that there hundreds vi/vim chat - sheets online , some better than other but naturally none of them is complete and includes all the commands that I care about .
By far the most popular sheet is probably this one which actually hangs over my desk .
It is a very good one and I use it all the time to remind myself certain key - strokes .
Still , it is not very comprehensive since you just can’t physically fit all the useful key - strokes in that format .
I decided to organize mine into sections rather typographical groupings .
The result is below .
Please note that I skipped the obvious stuff like ‘ hjkl ’ and some of the advanced stuff like marking , folding , and register operations .
That ’s because I do n’t really use these commands that often , and furthermore a lot of Vi emulators ( like the one in Komodo Edit ) do not support them .
Your mission , should you choose to accept it is to add your favorite commands and / or indispensable shortcuts which I have omitted .
And yes , I omitted a lot here .
There are just to many things to list – this is why I ’m relying on you guys !

Webアプリケーションおよびサーバの高負荷時の挙動を確認する方法の1つが、擬似的に負荷をかけてテストを行うことだ。ここでは、そうしたテストを実施するフリーソフトウェアをいくつか試し、それぞれがどんなタイプのサイトに適しているかを調べた。
負荷テスト用のツールはいろいろあるが、メンテナンスが行われていないもの、フリーでないもの、インストール手順が明確でないものを除くと、curl-loader、httperf、Siege、Tsung、Apache JMeterの5つが候補として残る。
JMeterについては、すで にDaniel Rubio氏が取り上げているので、ここでは詳しく説明しない。ただし、最後のまとめでほかのツールと共に簡単に触れている。
curl - loader
curl - loaderは 、「 Spirent のAvalancheやIXIAのIxLoadの代替として使える強力かつ柔軟なオープンソースのテストソリューションの提供」を目的としている。完成度と柔軟性の高いcURLライブラリを利用して、要求や認証、セッションの処理を行う。
curl - loaderのビルド方法は単純明快で、パッケージをダウンロードし、展開して、展開先のディレクトリでコードの make を行うだけだ。ただ、ip_secondary.cというファイルに「
#include < limits.h>
」という行を追加する必要があった。おそらく、最近のglibcヘッダファイルの変更が原因だろう。また、curl-loaderをコンパイルして実行するには、OpenSSLのライブラリとヘッダファイルのインストールも必要になる。
テストを始めるには設定が必要だ。curl-loaderの設定は2か所で行う。1つは、具体的なシナリオを決めるパラメータを記述する設定ファイルである。書式は簡単で、変数に値を代入する「
VAR=VALUE 」という形の式を1行ずつ並べる。非常にわかりやすいサンプルが、ソースツリーの「conf-examples」ディレクトリにいくつか用意されている。curl-loaderでは、複数のIPアドレスを使って、別々のクライアントから要求が来る状況を再現できる。そのため、
INTERFACE 、 CLIENTS_NUM_MAX 、 NETMASK 、 IP_ADDR_MIN 、 IP_ADDR_MAX
の各値を各自のネットワーク環境に合わせて調整する必要がある。同時接続可能な最大クライアント数は、指定するIPアドレスの範囲によって決まる。
も う1つの設定の場となるのが、curl-loaderを実行するコマンドラインインタフェースだ。必須となる「 -f 」引数には、テストに使うシナリオファイルの場所を指定する。その他の引数は、実施するテストの微調整に用いる。たとえば、curl-loaderのデフォルト設定では、要求の発行がシングルスレッドで行われる。システムリソースの節約とパフォーマンスの向上には悪くない設定だが、マルチコアCPUのマシンであれば「 -t 」オプションを使って、利用するコア数に応じてスレッドを追加するとよいだろう。
テストの結果は、サマリ情報が画面上で定期的に更新されるほか、詳細な情報がログファイルに記録される。拡張子が「.log」のファイルには発生したエラーの情報が、「.ctx」ファイルにはクライアント別の統計情報が、「.txt」ファイルには時系列の統計情報がそれぞれ書き込まれる。
Pythonで書かれた、curl-loaderの類似ツールとしてPylotがある。こちらはGUIを備え、設定ファイルがXML形式になる。
httperf
httperfは、Hewlett-Packard Laboratoriesが開発した、シングルスレッドで動作するコマンドラインの負荷テストツールだ。
httperfでは、設定のほとんどをコマンドライン引数で行う。設定ファイルは、セッションのシナリオを記述するための補助的な役割を担う。
以下は、接続数を5,000、各接続が発行を試みる要求数を50とした場合の実行例である。
httperf --server=localhost --uri=/ --num-conns=5000 --num-calls=50
最初の出力行には、コマンドラインで指定されずにデフォルト値が割り当てられた引数も含め、コマンドの引数群が次のような完全な形で表示される。
httperf -- client=0/1 --server=localhost -- port=80 --uri= / \ --send-buffer=4096 --recv-buffer=16384 \ --num-conns=5000 --num-calls=50
curl- loaderと違って、httperfは実施しているテストの経過表示の更新も、詳細なログの記録も行わない。テスト終了時に結果のサマリが表示されるだけである。デバッグ用のスイッチを使えば実行中のテストの内容を把握できるが、このスイッチを有効にするにはコンパイルをやり直す必要がある。
httperfで個人的に気に入っているのは、すべてのパラメータをコマンドラインから指定できる点だ。負荷テストの条件をその場でいろいろと変えながら試し、条件が決まったらそのパラメータをシェルスクリプトに記述すればよい。そうすれば、さまざまなテストを逐次的に、あるいは並行して実施するのも簡単だ。
ただし、コマンドライン引数の解釈の部分に詰めの甘さが見られる。たとえば、対象URIのサーバとパスの部分を別々に指定する必要はない。また、パスの部分の指定に「 --uri 」というオプションを使っているが、URIにはサーバ名が含まれることもあるので、このオプション名は適切とはいえない。
httperfと同じスタイルでもう少しシンプルなツールがよければ、http_loadを試すとよい。
Siege
ほとんどすべての設定をコマンドライン引数で行えるという点で、Siegeはhttperfに似ている。しかし、Siegeではマルチスレッド処理によって要求を送信するほか、低レベルのオプションがhttperfよりも少なく、URLのリストを対象としたテストを実施できる。また、各オプションにわかりやすい名前が付いているので、httperfより使いやすい。
デフォルトのパラメータ設定でSiegeを実行するには、単純に次のようにする。
siege localhost
ただしこれでは、リストにした複数のURLを対象として、実環境のユーザが引き起こすような不確定性の高い状況でのテストが可能なSiegeの特徴を活かしきれない。Siegeの作者は、URLの収集用にSproxyという支援ツールを提供している。このツールは、インストール後に次の形で実行する。
sproxy - v -o urls.txt
すると、実行したターミナルの画面に、収集されたすべてのURLが表示されると共に、それらのURLがurls.txtというファイルに書き込まれる。
ブラウザの設定でHTTPプロキシを 「 localhost:9001 」にしたうえで、サイトの閲覧を開始しよう。すると、Siegeで用いるURLの情報がSproxyによって記録される。
テスト用のURLが集まったら、次のようにして、テストの実行に移る。
siege -v -- internet --file=urls.txt
「 -- internet 」引数を指定すると、Siegeはurls.txt内のURLを（多くのインターネット利用者と同じように）ランダムに使用する。
Tsung
Tsungは 、URLが列挙されたファイルを用いるところはSiegeに似ているが、ユーザエージェントのランダムな切り替え、疑似的なセッションの生成、動的なデータのフィードバックなど、より高度な機能を備えている。また、Erlangのグリーンスレッド（Green Threads）の利用により、パフォーマンス的にも優れている。
しかし 、Tsungの利用は面倒だ。Siegeやcurl-loader、httperfと違い、コマンドラインからは実行できない。「~/.tsung/tsung.xml」というシナリオファイルを手作業で、あるいはレコーディングモードを使って作成する必要がある。このモードはSiegeのSproxyに似ており、次の手順で実行する。
「 tsung recorder 」 でTsungによるプロキシの記録を開始し、プロキシサーバを「localhost:8090」にして対象のURLを開く。
「~/.tsung」に新しく生成されたセッション記録を開き、シナリオの詳細事項を編集する。
編集結果を「~/.tsung/tsung.xml」として保存する。 「 tsung start 」でテストを開始する 。
一番難しいのは、手順2の設定ファイルの作成だ 。 Tsungの高度な機能を利用するには、どうしても設定ファイルの書式の理解が必要になる。
なお 、TsungではPostgreSQLやJabberのサーバに負荷をかけることもできる。
まとめ
ここで紹介したツールにはそれぞれ長所と短所がある。すべてに共通しているのは、詳しいドキュメントがあり、容易にインストールできて、動作が安定していることだ。
各自の環境に合ったツールを見つけるには、次の順で試すとよいだろう。まずはシンプルなSiegeを使ってみて、そのパフォーマンスと機能に満足できるか確かめる。それでだめなら、もう少し機能が豊富で高速なhttperfを試してみる。もっと複雑なシナリオ設定が必要であれば、最高の機能とパフォーマンスを備えたcurl-loaderやTsungに換えてみる。ただ、特にTsungのほうは慣れるのに時間がかかるだろう。
同じ用途のアプリケーションはほかにも数多くあるが、GUIベースのものはApache JMeterしかない。JMeterは機能面でも充実しており、コンテンツの前処理や後処理といった独自の機能も見られる。GUIアプリケーションがよければ、こちらを試すとよい。

OSLO , Jan 8 ( Reuters ) - Oslo police detained at least 27 people on Thursday after pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashed in one of the worst such outbursts in the Norwegian capital since the 1980s .
Shop windows in the city centre were shattered and police repeatedly used teargas to break up groups of activists demonstrating over Israel 's crackdown in the Gaza Strip .
The violence started when about 1,000 pro-Palestinian supporters showed up at a rally sponsored by Norway 's largest opposition party in support of Israel .
Television pictures showed they burned Israeli flags and threw projectiles at police clad in body armour who separated the two groups .
" This has nothing to do with the situation in Gaza , " Johan Fredriksen , chief of staff of the Oslo police , told the website of the daily Aftenposten .
" These people came to the protest with knives , bats and Molotov cocktails , " he said , speaking about the pro-Palestinian side .
" You have to go back to the early 1980s to find a similar situation in Norway , " Fredriksen said , adding that police were still concerned about security across the city .
Clashes also took place near the Israeli embassy .
Tabloid VG on its website said that Oslo was the site of a " street fight " with groups of men throwing rocks and bottles at police .
One police car was trashed and one officer injured .
Before the flare up , some 15,000 people walked through the city centre for a peaceful , torch - lit protest , police said .

Myron Rolle Chooses Oxford
I wish I 'd seen the Myron Rolle interview in which he expressed his desire to bring specialized medicine to underdeveloped countries as much as I 've seen the grainy footage of Adam " Pacman " Jones frequenting yet another strip club .
I wish Rolle 's 3.75 grade point average at Florida State was considered as scintillating as the recent rumblings about Terrell Owens , who reportedly might be on his way out of Dallas .
It 's not easy to accept the fact that a 75 - year - old grandmother in Elkhart , Ind. , probably would recognize Jones but would n't know Rolle -- the most important story in college football -- from a vacuum salesman .
I 'm as guilty as most columnists .
I 've written twice about O.J. , once about T.O. , and once about Brett Favre , giving selfish athletes a platform when Rolle has done something so extraordinary it 's worth 100 columns .
Even better , Rolle 's achievements have nothing to do with how fast the Florida State safety can backpedal , run the 40 - yard dash or tackle .
He is a rare breed , all right .
Rolle is a college player who can be called a " student - athlete " without it being an oxymoron .
He announced this week that he is delaying entering the NFL draft until 2010 so he can spend a year studying medical anthropology at Oxford University .
[+]
Enlarge Jim McIsaac / Getty Images Myron Rolle will be studying in England next year instead of playing in the NFL .
And that 's a great thing .
In November , Rolle won a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship , following in the footsteps of NBA legend Bill Bradley and former President Bill Clinton .
That alone was an exemplary achievement .
But then Rolle really outdid himself by stiff - arming the NFL , even after an advisory committee informed him he would be among the first 50 players chosen in the draft .
" It 's a great opportunity , " Rolle told ESPN.com .
" I 'm going to get the chance to study at Oxford and read some incredible books and be among scholars .
The whole culture in England is just very appealing .
It will make me a better person and a stronger advocate . "
Rolle passing up millions to study abroad is a much bigger deal than Tim Tebow winning a second national championship , Alabama returning to national prominence or even Utah 's undefeated season .
It would be one thing if Rolle were just a scrub , but he has started virtually every game since his freshman year and was the Seminoles ' third - leading tackler this season .
Despite having a legitimate pro future , Rolle did the right thing by not going to the NFL right away .
Like Tony Dungy , Rolle 's destiny is bigger than football .
The NFL might be the best sport in America , but at Oxford , Rolle will be among some of the greatest minds in the world .
" My family was very supportive , " Rolle said .
" They wanted me to go to Oxford because they taught me to always put education first .
It was the most important thing for me besides God and family .
Some of my teammates and frat brothers were like , ' Man , that 's a lot of money to pass up . '
I was definitely getting mixed input . "
Most college athletes are obsessed with getting to the pros , and many of them have proved they will do anything to get there , even if it 's something unethical .
Every day , we read about athletes who let their sport define them .
So it 's refreshing to know that Rolle 's dream is n't to plant his helmet in Tom Brady 's ribs .
His biggest dream is to open a free medical clinic in the Bahamas , where his parents and some of his siblings were born .
" Studying at Oxford is more than about the acclaim and the power , " Rolle said .
" It 's about the people you meet .
Yes , the NFL can give you financial stability , but I feel that 's just temporary . "
[+]
Enlarge G Fiume / Getty Images
Rolle is no slouch on the football field .
He 'll be a high draft choice , whenever he 's ready .
I only wish there 20 million more people like him .
I 'd rather read 1,000 more stories about Rolle than one more about whether Plaxico Burress should remain a Giant .
There was n't a Tebow run , a Sam Bradford pass , a Colt McCoy scramble or a Michael Crabtree catch this season as impressive as what Rolle has done in the classroom and for his community .
Rolle graduated from his New Jersey high school with a perfect 4.0 GPA , earned his bachelor 's degree at FSU in two and a half years and will have his master 's degree in public administration before he leaves for Oxford .
Rolle created a program called Our Way To Health for Seminole Indian children to help educate them about the importance of physical fitness .
He studied comparative politics and holistic medicine for six weeks in London , and was awarded a $ 4,000 grant for cancer research .
Rolle would rather be a neurosurgeon than a Pro Bowler .
He 'd rather work for the World Health Organization , the leading think tank in global health , than be the next Ed Reed .
His idol is Benjamin Carson , a doctor and director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins , not FSU alum Deion Sanders .
" Access to specialized doctors is n't great , " Rolle said .
" If an organization could channel the great doctors that are in the United States to other countries , it would be outstanding .
There are programs out there , but I see that need . "
It 's too bad our infatuation with talented athletes who are hopelessly immature and irresponsible prevents us from fully appreciating someone like Rolle and giving him the attention he deserves .
Unbelievably , Rolle once was criticized by FSU defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews , who complained that Rolle was spending too much time studying and not enough time preparing as a football player .
Sounds like a pretty smart guy .

Chilling game of hide and seek with a hungry polar bear
There are few things more enjoyable on a freezing day than a vigorous game of tag followed by a hearty meal .
Unless you 're supposed to be the main course , that is .
These pictures show how close one man came to being a polar bear 's dinner .
Mmmm , looks like dinner time :
The bear stands on its haunches and peers over the car roof at his prey , a surveyor returning to his vehicle in the Alaskan town of Barrow
The chase is on :
The man has his glove off , but not enough time to unlock his car door
The target , a surveyor , was returning to his car in the remote town of Barrow , Alaska , when he saw the great white beast .
With no time to unlock the door of his vehicle and climb inside , he tried to duck out of sight .
He 's coming to get you :
The hungry bear makes his move
Yikes :
The bear lumbers around the car as the man sprints for his life
But the hungry bear was not giving up , and a terrifying chase began .
First , the beast stood up on its furry haunches and eyed its prey .
Then it loped around the car , and even climbed over the bonnet to try to reach him .
Last resort :
The man , desperate for shelter , makes a break for a neighbouring truck
Phew :
He slips inside the unlocked truck , nursing more than 100 scratches
After a few laps of the car the bear almost caught up , managing to land a few heavy swipes on his prey .
The man eventually managed to take refuge in a neighbouring truck which was unlocked .
His back and head were covered in more than 100 deep scratches where the massive claws had managed to rip through his thick winter clothes and padded coat .
Barrow is the northernmost town of the United States , 340 miles north of the Arctic Circle .
Polar bears are frequently spotted around the area .
They are the world 's largest land predator , and are the only animals that actively hunt humans .
Adult bears grow up to 10ft tall and can weigh 95 stone .
They are predominantly carnivores , eating seals , fish , reindeer , seabirds and even whales and baby walruses .
Environmentalists have warned that there could be as few as 22,000 left in the wild , and that they face extinction because the ice they live on is melting .
The wildlife group Polar Bears International says only one person has been killed by a polar bear in the U.S. in the past 30 years .
In Canada eight have been killed and in Russia , 19 .
A spokesman said : ' In all instances in which a human was killed by a polar bear , the animal in question was undernourished or had been provoked . '
Wildlife groups have warned that increasing numbers of the giant bears have been spotted near towns and villages because they are trying to scavenge food .

NEW DELHI : Over three - fourths of terrorist attacks investigated in the UK had Al Qaeda and Pakistan links , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said during a whistlestop tour of India and Pakistan on Sunday .
His comment became the latest blow to Pakistan which is trying hard to distance itself from the Mumbai attacks .
( Watch )
After meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to express solidarity with India in the wake of the Mumbai attacks , Brown , in a damning indictment of Pakistan , said , " The group responsible for the attacks is LeT and they have a great deal to answer for . "
Brown later travelled to Islamabad and launched a $ 9 million counter - terrorism programme with Pakistan .
He also asked the two countries to give British investigators permission to question terror suspects in both countries .
In India , he asked for British investigators to be given access to arrested terrorist Ajmal Amir Kasab .
UK investigators have already been given a great degree of access to the investigations .
The request , sources said , was an acknowledgment of how close the issue of radical Islam and terrorism had come to British society .
" It 's important to recognise that wherever there is terrorism , it has to be fought , and where there is terrorism , it affects the stability and cohesion of countries , " Brown said .
He added , " No country should have to go through what India has had to go through as a result of the Mumbai outrages .
I 've said to Prime Minister Singh we will give every help that we can .
We will work together in tackling terrorism .
And we will work together on the issue of security . "
In Islamabad , Brown talked tough and told President Asif Ali Zardari that Pakistan should stop providing safe haven to terrorists and needed to undertake more action .
Pakistan 's isolation in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks is now almost complete , and the pressure on the cash - starved country is increasing every day .
Brown did not mince words even in Afghanistan where he made an unscheduled stop .
" There is a chain of terror that comes from the Pakistani and Afghan mountains right across to Europe and can end up very easily on the streets of Britain , " he said .
Brown 's visit to the region was intended as much to show solidarity as to address a growing security problem within British society itself -- the increasing radicalisation of British Muslims , many of whom have been accused of funding organisations like the LeT and JuD .
Brown and his party expect to be criticised by the Conservative party on this issue .
A few months ago , the UK government took the unprecedented step of publishing guidelines on combating Islamic extremism on university campuses .
The higher education minister , Bill Rammell , was quoted as saying , " There is evidence of serious , but not widespread , Islamist extremist activity in higher educational institutions . "
The trouble , say British media reports , is that many of those radicalised frequently travel to Pakistan and many even reportedly undergo jihadi training in Pakistan 's numerous camps .
Pakistan 's isolation is increasing pressure on the civilian government to act against the terror groups , but the underlying message is that Pakistan 's military - intelligence complex needs to be purged of its destructive ideologies and its instruments of terror .
Whether that can be effected by Pakistan 's fragile civilian government is uncertain .
Inflation is still above the target of 2 % Consumer price inflation dropped sharply in December to an annual rate of 3.1 % from November 's figure of 4.1 % .
The biggest factor was the cut in VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % , announced in the pre-Budget report on 24 November , the Office for National Statistics said .
But high food , gas and electricity prices prevented the rate from falling as fast as economists had predicted .
The headline Retail Prices Index ( RPI ) measure fell to 0.9 % from November 's 3 % rate , the biggest fall in 28 years .
RPI takes account of mortgage costs , which also declined following December 's cut in interest rates .
' Recession bites '
Falling petrol prices and discounting in shops before Christmas also helped reduce the rate of inflation .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The biggest discounts were in clothing and footwear , with prices down 10.3 % .
Transport costs also fell as a result of lower petrol and diesel prices , although air fares and coach fares were both up more than they had been in December 2007 .
BBC chief economics correspondent , Hugh Pym , said : " The VAT cut was the largest contributor to the fall in the inflation rate .
" This will be reversed at the end of this year when the VAT effect ' falls out ' of the inflation figures .
" The 3.1 % annual rate was a bit higher than analysts ' expectations , but the scale of the drop from 4.1 % should not underplayed .
Inflation is certainly heading lower as recession bites . "
Our correspondent added : " The plunge in the wider RPI rate , from 3 % to just 0.9 % was dramatic , reflecting the fall in mortgage rates .
RPI inflation could well be negative by the middle of this year . "
There have been so many bills due this month that our careful spending over Christmas has been blown out of the water .
Andrew Smyth , Belfast
The ' squeeze ' families
The CPI figure is still well above the government 's target rate of 2 % , but has dropped sharply from the peak of 5.2 % in September .
Many economists had expected it to fall even further in December , with a consensus of about 2.7 % .
Despite that , chief financial secretary to the Treasury , Stephen Timms , said : " The reduction in inflation is obviously welcome - a big reduction down to 3.1 % - reflecting in particular , as the Office for National Statistics has said this morning , the VAT cut before Christmas .
" Deflation risks
Food and energy prices are propping up inflation , with both still above their levels from this time last year .
But with oil prices so low , gas and electricity prices are expected to fall in the coming months as are food prices .
The falling rate of inflation has raised concerns about the prospect of deflation later this year .
" Inflation is most definitely yesterday 's story , " said Graeme Leach , chief economist at the Institute of Directors .
" Unless the huge stimulus from the VAT reduction , record low interest rates , a falling pound and the collapse in the oil price begin to take effect soon , the UK will be staring deflation in the face . "
Deflation is a problem because whatever stimulus measures are put in place , consumers may be put off making any purchases if they believe that prices will be lower in the future .
" The weakness of core inflation [ which strips out food and energy costs ] and the further downward pressure likely to result from the opening of a large amount of slack in the economy , points to a growing danger of a more fundamental and longer - lasting period of deflation further ahead , " said Jonathan Loynes , economist at Capital Economics .

Taking advantage of the shriveling stock market , PETA has been purchasing more and more shares in meaty companies , including popular chain establishments like Domino ’s Pizza , California Pizza Kitchen , and Sonics .
The surge in stock purchases comes shortly after PETA ’s call for donations not only to them , but to other animal rights organizations also hurting in the economy .
[ social_buttons ]
PETA has bought stock in meat companies for years .
They already had a large holding in Tyson Foods , one of the most notorious animal abusers in the meat industry , and recently purchased even more .
But what will PETA do once they own enough shares in these companies to be a deciding voice ?
Would we find vegan cheese options at Domino’s ?
Would they eliminate meat all together from the menus and perhaps risk running the chains out of business ?
Or perhaps they ’d make the age - old rumors come true by changing pepperoni and sausage to mostly soy or wheat protein ?
PETA first began engaging in shareholder activism in 2003 when they purchased 240 shares in Tyson Foods , enough to allow the organization to speak at shareholder meetings .
The meat industry has watched with a cautious eye ever since .
Factory farming is among the most environmentally disastrous industries , topping even the transportation industry in its impact on global warming .
While PETA pushes for animal rights , their actions also promote a healthier environment .
“ Our campaign has already paid dividends for animals , so we ’re forging ahead with it at any ‘ price , ' ” said PETA Vice President Bruce Friedrich .
“ During hard economic times , the most vulnerable members of society — including animals — still need protection from exploitation and abuse . ”

For her own good , Sarah Palin needs to go away .
To be clear :
As a liberal and as a commentator , I love it every time Palin pops up again .
She 's great copy and great fun ( not necessarily intentionally in either case ) .
But if she really does want a political future beyond hero - of - the - GOP base , she needs to take a timeout .
Palin was recently interviewed for a couple of right - wing documentaries and excerpts of the interview have been duly uploaded to YouTube ( I 've embedded the video at bottom ) .
She has a couple of highlights , including saying in one breath that she knew that things had gone badly during her Katie Couric interview ( but those darned spokesperson / power brokers forced her to do more ) and then in the next breath criticizing Couric for editing the interview to make her look bad .
Umm , guv , either you really did flop or you were falsely made to look like you flopped , but you can't have it both ways .
( Kind of like how you can either be on the road or at home , but you can't be both on the road and at home .
Oh wait . )
Similarly , she said that the darned media elite was mean to her because of class issues ( apparently journalism is the last bastion of the American upper class ) but then goes on to argue that had she ( in some through - the - looking - glass , bizarre universe ) been running on an Obama - Palin ticket , the media would have treated her better .
Apparently running on a Democratic ticket automatically puts you into the upper class .
( I mean , who better exemplifies Old World WASP - iness than Bill Clinton ?
Barack Obama , obviously , because what is more upper - crust American than the African - American guy ? )
( Oh hey — according to MSNBC , Palin is now complaining that her comments in the video are being taken out of context .
Of course . )
So yes , Sarah Palin is great fun .
But what she needs to do is go away for a while .
She needs to get out of the spotlight and be governor .
During her off hours , she should quietly summon policy experts to Juneau to help her bone up on matters of national importance .
Then in a year or two , she should re-emerge and wow the political intelligentsia that her natural political sizzle is now matched by a developed worldview and firm grasp of the issues .
Instead , she lingers in the spotlight , unwilling or unable to exit from the stage .
Sure , by decrying classism and the media , she continues to entrench herself in the conservative base 's political firmament , but she also reinforces her unfortunate mainstream image .

The document released in September of 2002 by the National Security Council entitled , “ The National Security Strategy ” , is considered one of the foremost written examples of the “ Bush Doctrine ” .
It is not the only example , and many of the policies were formed behind closed doors , but it is a good place to start .
All of the quotes are actual although some are not complete .
The document is filled with inconsistencies .
It seems the administration based its policies and actions on the worst elements of the statement such as “ preemptive self defense ” and ignored ideas that would have spread dignity and freedom throughout the world .
The hypocrisy is obvious in many of the quotes .
The distance between ideals and reality is vast .
There is more to be learned from the sound principles that were stated and ignored than those that were realized .
I add no further analyses , most all of us have personally experienced these last eight years , four of those years with a president appointed to office by the Courts .
I believe these years have been a travesty and mockery of freedoms not only for the country but for the entire world .
I leave you with the following quotes and your own thoughts on the matter .
I. Overview of America ’s International Strategy .

CHAMPAIGN , Ill. , Dec. 15 ( UPI ) -- A U.S. study found cognitive skills improved in adults in their 60s and 70s who were trained in playing a video game that rewards nation - building .
Study author Arthur Kramer University of Illinois said decades of research designed to improve specific cognitive skills such as short - term memory found that trainees can improve on the cognitive tasks in the lab -- but only under laboratory conditions .

" When you train somebody on a task they tend to improve in that task , whatever it is , but it usually does n't transfer much beyond that skill or beyond the particular situation in which they learned it , " Kramer said in a statement .
After testing several video games , the researchers selected " Rise of Nations , " which gives gamers points for building cities and accomplishing several tasks , stressing resource management and planning -- cognitive functions that decline most with age .
The study included 40 older adults , half receiving 23.5 hours of training in the video game , and half getting no training in the game .
The study , published in the journal Psychology & Aging , found the gamers became significantly better and faster at switching between tasks .
Working memory significantly improved and reasoning ability was enhanced -- compared to the comparison group .
However , the training had no effect on the gamers ' ability to recall a list of words , enumeration ability or being able to inhibit certain responses .
Israeli reservists were sent into action for the first time in the current Gaza conflict as the fighting continued yesterday and Palestinian deaths reportedly rose to 900 .
Israeli forces were , however , holding off from a surge into the heart of Gaza City , the so - called Phase 3 in the military operations , and there were fewer air strikes , 25 , compared with previous days , when they had averaged 60 to 70 .
Meanwhile there were reports of a split within the Israeli cabinet with claims that Tzipi Livni , the Foreign Minister , and Ehud Barak , the Defence Minister , were pressing for an early end to the offensive while Ehud Olmert , Prime Minister , wanted it to continue .
Mr Olmert , who resigned as head of the Kadima party in September following corruption allegations , is said to be planning to present his case to a cabinet forum where he enjoys support .
Ms Livni , the Kadima candidate in the elections on 10 February , has indicated publicly that she is strongly opposed to any peace agreement involving Hamas .
She is said to favour , instead , a unilateral halt to the offensive , in effect challenging Hamas to halt the rocket fire or face a renewed onslaught on Gaza .
Mr Barak , the Labour Party 's candidate in the election , on the other hand , is said to prefer a ceasefire indirectly agreed with Hamas through mediation by Egyptians and is said to have been privately critical that not enough was being done at peace talks in Cairo .
Ben Caspit , one of Israel 's leading newspaper commentators , reported " some sources " as claiming that Mr Olmert was seeking to prolong the war in order to postpone the elections .
However , his office has denied any such claims .
Caspit also suggested that a full victory over Hamas and possibly the rescue of Gilad Shalit , the Israeli soldier who was abducted in June 2006 by Hamas , might give Mr Olmert a " real historical achievement " .
But elections have only very exceptionally been postponed in Israeli .
While there was a delay during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 , there was none in the 2001 election , which took place as the intifada was nearing its peak .
Ms Livni declared yesterday that the military offensive had " restored Israel 's deterrence ...
Hamas now understands that when you fire on its citizens it responds by going wild – and this is a good thing . "
However , she was forced to defend herself against charges that she had failed in her duty as Foreign Minister by not stopping the UN resolution demanding a ceasefire .
" Anyone who has any understanding of what happens on the diplomatic field during any military operations knows that at some stage an agreement is reached similar to that one which was reached at the Security Council , " she said .
Mark Regev , Mr Olmert 's spokesman , claimed that Hamas 's military machine was taking " serious punishment " and Israel was " advancing towards the endgame " , although he refused to say when that would be .
In a sign of further tension within the Israeli establishment , Channel One television reported that a remark by General Yoav Galant , the head of the army 's southern command , had been selectively leaked by political sources to imply that he was unequivocally in favour of lengthening and escalating the offensive .
But his remark , that the military had a " once in a lifetime " opportunity to strike at Hamas , was accompanied by a warning that such an escalation could mean a year - long occupation of Gaza .
The Israeli military declined to comment .
Meanwhile , after meeting Hosni Mubarak , the Egyptian President , the Middle East Quartet 's envoy Tony Blair said elements were in place for a ceasefire agreement , but he added : " It 's going to have to be worked on very hard and it 's got to be credible . "
Israeli officials stated that a security zone was being carved out around Gaza to prevent rockets being fired into Israel and they said the number of such attacks had been drastically reduced by the military action .
Critics , however , point out that the number of rockets which came into Israel , around 12 , may be fewer than in the past few days , but it had been about the same number before the Israeli offensive .
Israeli commanders also did not rule out sending troops into Gaza City .
Major Avital Leibovich , the military spokeswoman , said troops were advancing into urban areas .
" Since the majority of the Hamas militants are pretty much in hiding in ... urban places , we operate in those areas , " she said .
' We are going wild , ' says Foreign Minister
The massive destruction in Gaza is no accident , writes Ben Lynfield .
Israel 's Foreign Minister , Tzipi Livni , said yesterday that Israel was deliberately " going wild " in its use of military force in order to restore its deterrence capability .
" We have proven to Hamas that we have changed the equation .
Israel is not a country upon which you fire missiles and it does not respond .
It is a country that when you fire on its citizens it responds by going wild – and this is a good thing . "
But some Israeli academic specialists on Hamas are questioning the assumption that the campaign against Hamas will actually bring quiet to southern Israel .
Shaul Mishal , a Tel Aviv University political scientist , voiced fears that Israel is actually creating an even more radical environment in Gaza .
" One result we might see is that the Hamas leadership is so shaken , other radical elements could get into their shoes and renew terrorist activities . "

The booming popularity of virtualization , cloud computing and other new technologies may prove too tempting for malware authors to resist -- and could prompt a wave of attacks in 2009 , according to security vendor AppRiver .
Businesses may be especially at risk because they 're looking to such technology to help them cut costs during the recession , Fred Touchette , senior security analyst at AppRiver , told InternetNews.com .
While these technologies will see strong growth this year , despite the grim outlook for overall IT spending , they also could mean better potential paydays for the hackers .
" The threat against virtualization will be a factor simply because more and more enterprises are going virtual , " Touchette said .
" I see viruses being able to crack into virtual machines and getting past their shells . "
Concerns about cybercrime 's growth peaked in recent months , following several recent , high - profile data breaches at large corporations or targeting public figures .
Worries about the trend led senior California Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , who is the incoming Senate Intelligence Committee chair , to re-introduce legislation on data breaches and protection of individual privacy last week .
These measures seek to ensure victims of security breaches are informed promptly when these breaches occur .
Meanwhile , malware authors are creating ever more sophisticated attacks , Touchette said .
Some viruses are already showing signs of being able to detect when they 're in virtualized environments , he added , but they then either refuse to run or remove themselves completely so they can not be tracked .
That 's because research analysts use virtual machines when they analyze viruses -- and the malware authors are aware of this , he said .
Likewise , as more enterprises begin moving into the cloud , they will also begin to encounter security vulnerabilities because it will be a new area for them , Touchette said .
The same may hold true for the proliferation of advanced smartphones , which make it simple for developers to create new applications that users can download to their devices .
Touchette said the Apple iPhone and Android - based devices may emerge as significant targets , given the popularity of the iPhone -- which is increasingly being adopted in the enterprise -- and the ease of developing on the Google - backed Android platform .
" The code is readily available so you can write your own applications , whether they are useful or malicious , " he said .
Site hackings to increase
While corporate databases have long been eyed by hackers seeking users ' personal information , career sites and social networking sites are also emerging as potential targets .
That 's not surprising , considering the vast amount of data they may contain about their members , Touchette said -- and the trend will accelerate in 2009 .
Already , hackers have begun targeting Facebook and LinkedIn to get that information .
And in the coming year , hackers will gun for more targets , Touchette predicted .
" I 've already seen people phishing accounts on Monster.com , and I think more attacks will be coming as more people go to job sites during the recession , " he said .
Hackers will also continue to compromise legitimate Web sites to deliver their attacks .
A survey conducted by messaging - and data - protection firm Websense found that more than 75 percent of Web sites containing malicious code are legitimate sites that have been infected .
Touchette expects this trend to continue .
" Malware authors are at a pretty high level of professionalism and , in certain areas , they 're pretty well organized , " he said .
Environment groups , coal industry at odds over a change by the EPA in the water pollution rules .
A coalition of environmental groups has gone to court seeking to overturn a Bush administration law which they say will make it easier for mining companies to dump waste into nearby streams .
The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , earlier this month , signed off on a change in a 1983 rule that prohibited such dumping within 100 feet of streams .
“ This administration chose its allegiance , that of protecting the economic interests of the coal industry over protecting our mountains , streams and watershed , ” Kathy Selvage of Southern Appalachian Mountain Stewards said in a press release .
If not overturned , the groups argue the repeal will allow coal mining industries to begin mountaintop mining and dumping mining waste into streams .
Earlier this month , Bank of America announced that they will cease their financing of mountaintop coal removal operations .
The move was in response to pressure placed on the bank by one of the most powerful environmental groups , the Natural Resources Defense Council .
Mountaintop coal removal accounts for about 10 % of U.S. coal production .
The suit contends that the agency did not consider other alternatives when it studied the environmental impact of its proposal .
It also alleges that the EPA went against its own studies showing damage from mountaintop removal in order to go through with the rule change .
“ The notion that coal mining companies can dump their wastes in streams without degrading them is a fantasy that the Bush administration is now trying to write into law , ” said Judith Petersen , executive director of Kentucky Waterways Alliance .
Political leaders in many of the states which mine for coal have been divided over the issue .
On the one hand , they do n’t want to upset the coal industry which provides for so many jobs and much revenue to the state coffers .
But at the same time , there are many environmental groups joining together to fight the change .
These groups are spread out over a number of states , including Kentucky , Tennessee and West Virginia .
Mining officials say that the new rule codifies existing practices and that there wo n’t be any noticeable change .
“ It does n’t change the water quality standards .
The clean water standards still have to be met , ” said Luke Popovich , vice president of external communications for the National Mining Association .
“ The irony is that there will be virtually no change in the practice of mining in this rule .
It ’s going to be no different than what it was in the Clinton era . ”
Last year , when creationist / exorcist Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal signed the creationist - enabling academic freedom bill into law , I said " Keep fighting , people .
Because I guarantee this victory for the bad guys in Louisiana will embolden them . "
Man , I hate being right all the time .
This past week , Louisiana 's Board of Elementary and Secondary Education adopted a policy that allows teachers to use outside materials to teach scientific theories deemed controversial .
What theories do you think those would be ?
Gravity ?
Boyle 's law ?
Quantum mechanics ?
Yeah , right .
This is an incredibly thinly veiled policy to let creationists use their own materials in the class , materials that would otherwise not be allowed due to that pesky First Amendment .
Creationists changed their tune to talk about Intelligent Design when they got caught violating the Constitution , and they got caught again at the Dover trial when an ID book was found to be a creationist book with a handful of word changes .
So they changed tactics again , now claiming that teachers need " academic freedom " to discuss controversial theories .
The thing is , evolution is n't controversial .
Not among real scientists , that is .
It 's a manufactured controversy , with reality on one side , and antiscience creationists making stuff up on the other .
The ultimate irony of all this is that the last thing the creationists want is academic freedom .
What they really want is for children to learn only their errant beliefs , and get no real science education .
I 've said it before , and I 'll no doubt have to say it again and again : if you live in Louisiana -- and really , just about every state is vulnerable to this -- make your voice heard .
The creationists rely heavily on people simply not knowing what they are up to .
The first step is to get aware , and the second is to do something .
Go do something .
Write letters , make phone calls .
Vote when the chance comes .
Because Louisiana has already taken steps over the cliff , and the only lifeline is an educated populace ... something the creationists fight to prevent .
Editor 's note : Tara Wall is deputy editor for The Washington Times .
Before joining the newspaper , she was a senior adviser for the Republican National Committee and was named a public affairs director in the Department of Health and Human Services by President Bush .
Read her columns here .
Tara Wall says President Bush will be remembered for keeping America safe .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In his final radio address as president - elect on the Sunday ahead of his inauguration , Barack Obama said President Bush " extended the hand of cooperation " to him throughout this period of transition .
It was a final act of civility , on Mr. Bush 's part .
It is a trait that is not surprising to those who know Bush ( or those paying some attention at least half of the time ) .
At least one Democrat has given him credit for it .
Unfortunately , that tone of civility has been lost on the Democratic leadership over the past eight years .
Civility aside , how others -- more importantly , history -- will judge the 43rd president of the United States , is the question that has followed Bush out the door .
Lucky for him , it wo n't just be up to Democrats to determine .
" I believe President Bush will be vindicated , " said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in an interview a couple of weeks ago .
She may be an ardent defender of Bush , but I believe she 's right .
She , like I , have a different vantage point than what has been routinely portrayed .
While sitting in the Oval Office with the 43rd president , for what was his last official week in office last Thursday , I got the sense that he feels he will be vindicated , too .
He wo n't say as much , directly , but indirectly points to what matters most in his eyes -- protecting the homeland .
" History will eventually see ... that not only was it necessary to take the steps I took , but [ they ] led to a better world , " the president told me .
On a personal level ( and for the sake of full disclosure ) , I must say that I have had the pleasure of working for and knowing Bush from his first campaign for president and throughout his presidency .
I started as a volunteer in 1999 , then worked as a spokeswoman during his second campaign and then as an appointee in his administration .
Not only have I counted it an honor and a privilege to serve the 43rd president , but I have always had a deep respect for him as a person of faith , his strident conviction in doing what was right for the country and his commitment to closing the disparities that exist between black and white Americans -- no matter the mistakes made and lessons learned .
Above all , it is his dignity and civility that stand out to me most .
Yet , for many conservatives ( not just liberals ) , Bush has failed on many fronts .
From the miscalculation of the insurgency in Iraq , to failed intelligence gathering and the issues of maintaining fiscal conservatism and delivering real immigration reform -- I can't tell you how many Republicans and conservatives I 've spoken to over this past year who have told me how " disappointed " they 've been with Bush .
A few among them voted for " change " as a result .
The legacy Bush leaves behind wo n't be everything he wanted ( particularly as it relates to popularity ) , but on many fronts , it will be better than that of his predecessor .
Bill Clinton may have been popular , but his moral failings brought shame on the office of the presidency and tainted the people 's house .
That will forever be a stain on Clinton 's legacy .
Not to mention , there was no such " civility " or " cooperation " when Clinton turned the keys over to Bush .
I prefer principle over popularity any day .
On the moral front , President Bush delivered .
On the social front , he delivered .
On the fiscal front he failed considerably .
Yet , on the national security front and on many domestic policies , he succeeded .
Depending on your vantage point , success may mean something wholly different .
The details will be debated for decades to come .
Among the many uncertainties , one thing is certain -- you can't judge history in the midst of it .
Declaring one " the worst " president while he 's still in office is an effort in rhetorical futility .
Historians know this all too well .
The best prediction one can make was summed up by presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin on " Meet the Press " last year : " If Iraq became the model democracy or even just a democracy , and in doing so changed the whole complexion of the Middle East , then obviously that would be the legacy that would justify what Bush did and what our troops did . "
And that 's exactly what Mr. Bush is banking on .
During my Oval Office interview with the president , I asked him to complete the sentence " President Bush was ... [ fill in the blank ] . "
He responded ( uncharacteristically in third person ) : " President Bush was the president at a time when our nation was attacked , he clearly saw the dangers , he pursued the enemy , he put tools in place so the professionals could better protect the people , and the homeland was not attacked . "
That is the legacy he wants .
Popular or not , he kept America safe .
And if nothing else , for that , he will be vindicated .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tara Wall .

Although we can’t confirm the news , it is nice to hear rumblings around town .
We ’re being told that Weinstein Co. has serious plans on shooting Robert Rodriguez ’s highly anticipated Machete later this year .
Starring Danny Trejo , Machete was introduced to us as a faux trailer in Dimension Films ’ GRINDHOUSE , which bombed at the box office back in April of ’07 .
In the trailer it was revealed that after being betrayed by the organization who hired him , an ex-Federale ( Trejo ) launches a brutal rampage of revenge against his former boss .
No word on if this would go theatrical or direct - to - DVD .
DECATUR , Ala . 
The prisoners in the Morgan County jail here were always hungry .
The sheriff , meanwhile , was getting a little richer .
Alabama law allowed it : the chief lawman could go light on prisoners ’ meals and pocket the leftover change .
And that is just what the sheriff , Greg Bartlett , did , to the tune of $ 212,000 over the last three years , despite a state food allowance of only $ 1.75 per prisoner per day .
In the view of a federal judge , who heard testimony from the hungry inmates , the sheriff was in “ blatant ” violation of past agreements that his prisoners be properly cared for .
“ There was undisputed evidence that most of the inmates had lost significant weight , ” the judge , U. W. Clemon of Federal District Court in Birmingham , said Thursday in an interview .
“ I could not ignore them . ”

New Dependency Browser for Squeak 22 October , 2008
Hernán Morales
Durand recently announced a new tool he has developed , which allows developers to review the dependencies between the classes within their applications .
His Dependency Browser includes an OmniBrowser interface ( as shown above ) allowing you to review and edit those dependencies .
Hernán is continuing to work on the tool , and is looking at extending the functionality , and the possibility of displaying the graph of the dependencies using tools such as GraphViz .
Anyone interested in this approach should also be aware of the MudPie and Moose projects .
In reviving plans to make inquests secret , Jack Straw proves yet again that he is one of the chief enemies of our free society .
Last year the proposal was dumped by Jacqui Smith because of the huge opposition to the idea that ministers could order press , relatives and the public from controversial hearings in a coroner 's court on the grounds that information is too sensitive for public consumption .
Floated in the counter - terrorism bill , it drew opposition from the joint committee on human rights and organisations such as the Coroners '
Society which said that ministers would abuse the rules to cover up inconvenient hearings .
You have only to recall the disgraceful conduct of the inquest into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by the police , the government 's acute embarrassment in cases when poorly equipped servicemen are killed on active service , or the deaths of Dr David Kelly and Princess Diana to know that the temptation to suppress public knowledge would be irresistible to Straw and the members of this shoddy , cynical authoritarian regime .
Coroners courts are not part of the state 's apparatus .
They belong to the people and it is the public 's right to know any evidence that is disclosed during the inquest into a death .
As usual the government raises the spectre of terrorism and the need for security to push its sinister agenda .
It says that phone taps and sensitive intelligence may become known in open court , and that secrecy would only be imposed in a small number of hearings .
We have heard this all before and we know about the process of function creep .
Once the law is on the statute book ministers and civil servants abuse them , and in the case of inquests there will be enormous pressure from the police to reduce the amount of embarrassing material heard in court .
One of the more unpleasant symptoms of the erosion or procedure and respect for rights in our society are the increasing number of people who are roughed up in police custody and by prison officers .
How long would it be before Straw 's law becomes the means of covering up deaths when things have got out of hand in the cells ?
Open inquests , like jury trial , are an inalienable right in a democracy .
This proposal should be opposed to the last and its author condemned .
The Guardian is the media partner for The Convention on Modern Liberty , taking place on Saturday February 28 2009 , which will debate these and other issues .

Oh no ...
I just admire these beautiful works from far and in the pages of magazine .
These are way out of my budget and I do n't have the space to do them justice .
I do like the Barcelona chair very much , however , the design has been so frequenty replicated .
Anway , I 'm sure such beautiful designs always make good photography subjects .
Do show us more photos !!!

David and Victoria Beckham : AC Milan Team Party Photos
Over the weekend the beautifuland her gorgeous husbandattended a party for the AC Milan team at the Harbour Hotel in Dubai .
At first glance David looked a little worse for wear until we realized that the other party - goers were dressed in similar fashion .
It is n't often that Mr. Beckham does n't present himself dressed to the nines .
Of course Victoria never misses a chance to be the belle of the ball , even during a simple day of shopping .
Becks is on loan to team AC Milan while his Los Angeles Galaxy team is on winter break .
The short term loan deal allows the 33 year old to compete in Europe .
Some speculate that he is trying to win a place on the England national team .
He said , " I do n't regret moving to L.A .
I love my team but this for me is a great experience .
I feel fortunate to have this great opportunity . "

This is the third and final part of an article on the sed one - liners .
This part will explain sed one - liners for selective deletion of certain lines and special applications of sed .
See part one for introduction of the series .
Similarly to Awk one - liners , sed one - liners are short and concise sed programs that span less than one terminal line .
They were written by Eric Pement and are floating around on the Internet as ' sed1 line.
txt ' file .
If you are intrigued by this article series , I suggest that you subscribe to my posts !
Update : Spanish translation of part three is available !
Eric 's sed one - liners are divided into several sections :
Grab my " sed cheat sheet " and a local copy of sed1 line .
txt file , and let the explanation begin !
Awesome news : I have written an e-book based on this article series .
Check it out :
5. Selective Deletion of Certain Lines
68 . Print all lines in the file except a section between two regular expressions .
sed '/ Iowa / , /Montana/d '
This one - liner continues where the previous left off .
One - liner # 67 used the range match " / start / , / finish / " to print lines between two regular expressions ( inclusive ) .
This one - liner , on the other hand , deletes lines between two regular expressions and prints all the lines outside this range .
Just to remind you , a range " / start / , / finish / " matches all lines starting from the first line that matches a regular expression " / start / " to the first line that matches a regular expression " / finish / " .
In this particular one - liner the " d " , delete , command is applied to these lines .
The delete command prevents the matching lines from ever seeing the light .
For example , suppose your input to this one - liner was :
Florida < strong > Iowa New York San Jose Montana</ strong >
Texas Fairbanks
Then after the sed program has finished running , the output is :
Florida Texas Fairbanks
We see this output because the lines from Iowa to Montana matched the " / Iowa / , / Montana / " range match ( i put the matched lines in bold ) and were deleted .
69 .
Delete duplicate , consecutive lines from a file ( emulates " uniq " ) .
sed '$ !N ; /^\(.*\)
\ 1$/!P ; D '
This one - liner acts as the " uniq " Unix utility .
So how does it work ?
First of all , for every line that is not the very last line of input , sed appends the next line to the pattern space by the " N " command .
The " N " command is restricted to all but the last line by " $ ! " restriction pattern .
The newly appended line is separated from the previous line by the "
" character .
Next , the pattern space is matched against " /^(.*)
\ 1$ / " regular expression .
This regular expression captures the previous line up to "
" character and saves it in the match group " \1 " .
Then it tests if the newly appended line is the same as the previous one .
If it is not , the " P " gets executed .
If it is , the " P " command does not get executed .
The " P " command prints everything in the pattern space up to the first "
" character .
Next the " D " command executes and deletes everything up to the first "
" char , leaving only the newly read line in pattern space .
It also forces the sed script to begin from the first command .
This way it loops over all lines , comparing two consecutive lines .
If they are equal , the first line gets deleted , and a new line gets appended to what 's left .
If they are not equal , the first one gets deleted , and deleted .
I think it 's hard to understand what is going on from this description .
I 'll illustrate it with an example .
Suppose this is the input :
foo foo foo bar bar baz
The first thing sed does is it reads the first line of input in pattern space .
The pattern space now contains " foo " .
Now the " N " command executed .
The pattern space now contains " foo
foo " .
Next the pattern space is tested against " /^(. )
\ 1$ / " regular expression .
This regular expression matches because " (. ) " is " foo " and " /^(. )
\ 1$ / " is " foo
foo " , exactly what we have in the pattern space .
As it matched , the " P " command does not get executed .
Now the " D " command executes , deleting the everything up to first "
" from pattern space .
The pattern space now contains just " foo " .
The " D " command forces sed to start from the first command .
Now the " N " is executed again , the pattern space now contains " foo
foo " again and the same thing happens , " P " does not get executed and " D " deletes the first " foo " , leaving the pattern space with just " foo " in it .
Now the " N " gets executed once again , this time " bar " gets appended to pattern space .
It contains " foo
bar " now .
The regular expression " /^(. )
\ 1$ / " does not match and " P " gets executed , printing " foo " .
After that " D " gets executed wiping " foo " from pattern space .
The pattern space now contains " bar " .
The commands restart and " N " gets executed , it appends the next " bar " to current pattern space .
Now it contains " bar
bar " .
Just like with " foo
foo " , nothing gets printed , and " D " deletes the first " bar " , leaving pattern space with " bar " .
The one - liner restarts its execution .
Now " N " reads in the final line " baz " .
The pattern space contains " bar
baz " which does not match the regular expression .
The " P " prints out the " bar " and " D " deletes " bar " .
Now " N " does not get executed because we are at the last line of input .
The " $ ! N " restricts " N " to all lines but last .
At this moment pattern space contains only the last " baz " , the regular expression does not match , so " baz " gets printed .
The " D " command executes , emptying the pattern space .
There is no more input and sed quits .
The output for this example is :
foo bar baz
I think this is one of the most detailed explanations I have written about a single one liner . :)
70 .
Delete duplicate , nonconsecutive lines from a file .
sed -n ' G ; s/
/&&/ ; /^\([ -~ ] *
\ ) .*
\ 1/d ; s/
// ; h ; P '
This is a very tricky one - liner .
It stores the unique lines in hold buffer and at each newly read line , tests if the new line already is in the hold buffer .
If it is , then the new line is purged .
If it 's not , then it 's saved in hold buffer for future tests and printed .
A more detailed description - at each line this one - liner appends the contents of hold buffer to pattern space with " G " command .
The appended string gets separated from the existing contents of pattern space by "
" character .
Next , a substitution is made to that substitutes the "
" character with two "
" . The substitute command " s /
/&& / " does that .
The " & " means the matched string .
As the matched string was "
" , then " && " is two copies of it "
" . Next , a test " / ^ ( [ -~ ]
) .
\ 1/ " is done to see if the contents of group capture group 1 is repeated .
The capture group 1 is all the characters from space " " to " ~ " ( which include all printable chars ) .
The " [ - ~ ] " matches that .
Replacing one "
" with two was the key idea here .
As " ( [ - ~ ]
) " is greedy ( matches as much as possible ) , the double newline makes sure that it matches as little text as possible .
If the test is successful , the current input line was already seen and " d " purges the whole pattern space and starts script execution from the beginning .
If the test was not successful , the doubled "
" gets replaced with a single "
" by " s /
// " command .
Then " h " copies the whole string to hold buffer , and " P " prints the new line .
71 . Delete all lines except duplicate consecutive lines ( emulates " uniq - d " ) .
sed '$ !N ; s/^\(.*\)
\ 1$/\1 / ; t ; D '
This sed one - liner prints only the duplicate lines .
This sed one - liner starts with reading in the next line from input with the " N " command .
As I already mentioned , the current line and the next get separated by "
" character after " N " executes .
This one - liner also restrics " N " to all lines but last with " $ ! " restriction .
Now a substitution " s /^(.*)
\ 1$ /\1 / " is tried .
Similarly to one - liner # 69 , this substitution replaces two repeating strings with one .
For example , a string " foo
foo " gets replaced with just " foo " .
Now , if this substitution was successful ( there was a repeated string ) , the " t " command takes the script to the end where the current pattern space gets printed automatically .
If the substitution was not successful , " D " executes , deleting the non-repeated string .
The cycle continues and this way only the duplicate lines get printed once .
Let 's take a look at an example .
Suppose the input is :
foo foo bar baz
This one - liner reads the first line and immediately executes the " N " command .
The pattern space now is " foo
foo " .
The substitution " s /^(.*)
\ 1$ /\1 / " is tried and it 's successful , because " foo " is repeated twice .
The pattern space now contains just a single " foo " .
As the substitution was successful , " t " command branches to the end of the script .
At this moment " foo " gets printed .
Now the cycle repeats .
Sed reads in " bar " , the " N " command appends " baz " to " bar " .
The pattern space now is " bar
baz " .
The substitution is tried , but it 's not successful , as " bar " is not repeated .
As the substitution failed , " t " does nothing and " D " executes , deleting " bar " from pattern space .
The pattern space is left with single " baz " .
Command " N " no longer executes as we reached end of file , substitution fails , " t " fails , and " D " deletes the " baz " .
The end result is :
foo
Just as we expected - only the duplicate line got printed .
72 . Delete the first 10 lines of a file .
sed ' 1,10d '
This one - liner restricts the " d " command to a range of lines by number .
The " 1,10 " means a range matching lines 1 to 10 inclusive .
On each of the lines the " d " command gets executed .
It deletes the current pattern space , and restarts the commands from beginning .
The default action for lines > 10 is to print the line .
73 .
Delete the last line of a file .
sed '$d '
This one - liner restricts the " d " command to the last line of file .
It 's done by specifying the special char " $ " as the line to match .
It matches only the last line .
The last line gets deleted , but the others get printed implicitly .
74 . Delete the last 2 lines of a file .
sed ' N ; $ !P ;$ !D;$d '
This one - liner always keeps two lines in the pattern space .
At the very last line , it just does not output these last two .
All the others before last two get output implicitly .
Let 's see how it does it .
As soon as sed reads the first line of input in pattern space , it executes the first command " N " .
It places the 2nd line of input in pattern space .
The next two commands " $ ! P " and " $ ! D " print the first part of pattern space up to newline character , and delete this part from pattern space .
They keep doing it until the very last line gets appended to pattern space by " N " command .
At this moment the last two lines are in pattern space and " $ d " executes , deleting them both .
That 's it .
Last two lines got deleted .
If there is just one line of data , then it outputs it .
75 . Delete the last 10 lines of a file .
sed -e :a -e ' $d ; N;2,10 ba ' -e ' P;D '
This is really straight forward one - liner .
It always keeps 10 lines in pattern - space , by appending each new input line with " N " , and deleting the 11th excessive line with " D " .
Once the end of file is reached , it " d " the whole pattern space , deleting the last 10 lines .
sed -n -e :a -e ' 1,10 !{P;N;D;};N;ba '
This is also a straight forward one - liner .
For the lines that are not 1 - 10 , it appends them to pattern space with " N " .
For lines > 10 , it prints the first line in pattern space with " P " , appends another line with " N " and deletes the printed line with " D " .
The " D " command causes sed to branch to the beginning of script !
The " N ; ba " at the end never , ever gets executed again for lines > 10 .
It keeps looping this way " P " , " N " , " D " , always keeping 10 lines in pattern space and printing line - 10 on each cycle .
The " N " command causes script to quit if it tries to read past end of file .
76 . Delete every 8th line .
gsed ' 0~8d '
This one - liner only works with GNU Sed only .
It uses a special address range match " first~step " that matches every step 'th line starting with the first .
In this one - liner first is 0 and step is 8 .
Zero is not a valid physical line number , so the very first line of input does not match .
The first line to match is 8th , then 16th , then 24th , etc .
Each line that matches is deleted by " d " command .
sed 'n ; n;n;n;n;n;n;d ; '
This is a portable version .
The " n " command prints the current pattern space , empties it , and reads in the next line .
It does so for every 7 lines , and 8th line gets deleted with " d " .
This process continues until all input has been processed .
77 . Delete lines that match regular expression pattern .
sed '/ pattern/d '
This one - liner executes the " d " command on all lines that match " / pattern / " .
The " d " command deletes the line and skips to the next line .
78 . Delete all blank lines in a file ( emulates " grep '. ' " .
sed '/ ^$ /d '
The regular expression " / ^$ / " in this one - liner tests if the beginning of line matches the end of the line .
Only the empty lines have this property and sed deletes them .
Another way to do the same is :
sed '/./!d'
This one - liner tests if the line matches at least one character .
The dot " . " in the regular expression matches any character .
An empty line does not have any characters and it does not match this regular expression .
Sed deletes all the lines that do not match this regular expression .
79 .
Delete all consecutive blank lines from a file ( emulates " cat - s " ) .
sed '/./,/^$/!d'
This one - liner leaves one blank line at the end of the file , if there are multiple blanks at the end .
Other than that , all consecutive blanks are stripped .
It uses an inverse range match " / start /,/ finish / ! " to " d " delete lines from first blank line , to first non-blank , non-inclusive .
sed '/ ^$/N;/
$ /D '
This one - liner leaves one blank line at the beginning and end of the file , if there are multiple blanks at both sides .
Other than that , all consecutive blanks are stripped .
The consecutive empty lines get appended in pattern space by " / ^$ / N " command .
The " /
$ / D " command matches and deletes blanks until only 1 is left .
At that moment it no longer matches , and the line is output .
80 . Delete all consecutive blank lines from a file except the first two .
sed '/ ^$/N;/
$ /N;//D'
In case of > 2 blank lines , this one - liner trims them down to two .
There is a catch to this one - liner .
Let me explain it first .
See the last command " //D " ?
It 's a shortcut for " / previous - match / D " .
In this case it 's shortcut for " /
$ / D " .
Alright , now the one - liner itself .
On every empty line , it appends the next to current pattern space with " / ^$ / N " command .
Next it tests if the line just read in was actually a blank line with "/
$ / " , if it is , it reads another line in with " N " .
At this moment it repeats the same test "/
$ / " .
If the line was a blank one again , it deletes the first blank line and restarts sed script from the beginning .
Notice that at all times only 2 consecutive blank lines are in pattern space .
This way any number of blank lines get deleted and only two are left .
81 . Delete all leading blank lines at the top of a file .
sed '/./,$ !d '
This one - liner inverts a match " match from the first non -blank line to end of file " .
It becomes " match from the beginning of file to last blank line " .
82 . Delete all trailing blank lines at the end of a file .
sed -e :a -e '/^
*$ /{$d ; N; ba ' -e '} '
This one - liner accumulates blank lines in pattern space until it either hits end or hits a non -blank line .
If it hits end , " $ d " deletes the whole pattern space ( which contained just the trailing blank lines ) and quits .
If however , it hits non -blank line , the whole pattern space gets printed implicitly and script continues as if nothing had happened .
This one is a portable version .
gsed -e :a -e '/^
*$/N;/
$ / ba '
This is the same script , except a shorter version , made to work with Gnu Sed .
83 . Delete the last line of each paragraph .
sed -n '/ ^$/{p;h;};/./{x;/./p;}'
This one - liner always keeps the previous line in hold buffer .
It 's accomplished by 2nd block of commands " /./{x;/./p;} " .
In this block , the pattern space ( 1 line ) gets exchanged with hold buffer ( 1 line ) by " x " command and if the hold buffer was not empty , it gets printed by " p " .
The next moment to note is what happens on the first empty line .
That is the line after the paragraph .
At this moment " / ^$ / {p; h ; } " gets executed , that prints the blank line ( but does not print the last line of paragraph ! ) , and puts the blank line in hold buffer .
Once a new paragraph is reached , the script executed just like it was the very first paragraph of the input .
6. Special Sed Applications
84 . Remove nroff overstrikes .
Nroff overstrikes are chars that are formatted to stand out in bold .
They are achieved like in old typewriters , where you would do backspace and hit the same key again .
In nroff it 's key CHAR , CTRL+H , CHAR .
This one - liner deletes the CHAR , CTRL+H , leaving just plain CHAR .
sed 's /.^H//g '
Press Ctrl+V and then Ctrl +H to insert ^H literally in sed one - liner .
It then uses the substitute command to delete any char " . " followed by CTRL+H " ^H " .
Another way to do the same is use a hex escape expression that works in most recent seds :
sed 's/.\x08//g'
Yet another way is to use " echo " and enable interpretation of backslashed characters :
sed 's /.' `echo -e " \b " ` '// g '
85 . Print Usenet / HTTP / Email message header .
gsed -r '/ ^\r ? $ /q '
Usenet , HTTP and Email headers are similar .
They are a bunch of text lines , separated from the body of the message with two new lines " \r
\r
" . Some implementations might even go with just "
" .
This one - liner quits on the first line that is either empty or contains " \r " .
In other words , it prints the message header and quits .
86 . Print Usenet / HTTP / Email message body .
sed ' 1,/ ^$ /d '
This one - liner uses a range match " 1,/^$ / " to delete lines starting from 1st , and ending with the first blank line ( inclusive ) .
As I explained in the previous one - liner # 78 above , " / ^$ / " matches empty lines .
All the lines before first blank line in a Usenet / Email message or a HTTP header are message headers .
They get deleted .
87 . Extract subject from an email message .
sed '/ ^Subject : */!d ; s///; q '
This one - liner deletes all lines that do not match " ^Subject : " .
Then it re-uses the match in " s/// " to delete " Subject : " part from the line , leaving just the real subject .
Please notice how " s/// " is equivalent to " s/ previous - match / / " , where " previous - match " is " ^Subject : * " in this one - liner .
88 . Extract sender information from an email message .
sed '/ ^From : */!d ; s///; q '
This one liner is equivalent to the previous one , except it prints sender information from email .
89 . Extract email address from a " Name Surname < email@domain.com > " string .
sed 's /.*< *//;s/ *>.*//;
This one - liner strips all symbols before < symbol ( and any whitespace after it ) , and stips all symbols after > symbol ( including whitespace before it ) .
That 's it .
What 's left is email@domain.com .
90 .
Add a leading angle bracket and space to each line ( quote an email message ) .
sed 's /^/> /'
This one - liner substitutes zero - width anchor " ^ " that matches beginning of line with " > " .
As it 's a zero - width anchor , the result is that " > " gets added to beginning of each line .
91 . Delete leading angle bracket from each line ( unquote an email message ) .
sed 's /^> //'
It does what it says , deletes two characters " > " and a space " " from the beginning of each line .
92 . Strip HTML tags .
sed -e :a -e 's /<[ ^>]*>//g;/</N;//ba'
Sed is not made for parsing HTML .
This is a very crude version of HTML tag eraser .
It starts by creating a branch label named " a " .
Then on each line it substitutes " < [ ^ > ] > " with nothing as many times as possible ( " g " flag for s/// command ) .
The " < [ ^ > ] > " expression means match match symbol " < " followed by any other symbols that are not " > " , and that ends with " > " .
This is a common pattern in regular expressions for non-greediness .
Next , the one - liner tests if there are any open tags left on the line , if there are " N " reads the next line of input to make it work across multiple lines . " // ba " finally branches to the beginning of the script ( it 's short for " / previous - expression / ba " which in this case is " / < / ba " ) .

Protests denounce Israeli assault on Gaza and Canadian government complicity
By Éric Marquis
13 January 2009
Demonstrations were held in cities across Canada last Saturday to denounce the Israeli state ’s onslaught against the subjugated Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip .
The demonstrators voiced their outrage at the horrors — death , hunger , deprivation , and the threat of disease — that Israel is inflicting on the people of Gaza and at the complicity of Washington and Canada ’s Conservative government .
More than 10,000 people took to the streets of some 15 Canadian cities , including several thousand respectively in Toronto , Montreal , and Ottawa and hundreds in other cities including Victoria , Vancouver , Calgary , Edmonton , Quebec City and Halifax .
Protesters in Toronto denounced Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his minority Conservative government for their support for the Israeli assault on Gaza
Sid Ryan , president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees ( CUPE ) , told the approximately 4,000 protesters who had rallied outside the Israeli consulate in Toronto that Israel has committed war crimes and atrocities in Gaza .
Ryan has been witch - hunted by the right - wing press for his trenchant criticisms of Israel .
Another speaker at the Toronto rally was a Holocaust survivor .
She said that while some survivors shout “ Never again for the Jews ! , ” the watchword ought to be “ Never again for humanity ! ”
Canadian Arab Federation representative Ali Mallah denounced remarks made by Conservative Environment Minister John Baird at a pro-Israel rally last Thursday .
“ John Baird was quoted as saying the resisters in Palestine are cowards , ” noted Mallah .
As many as 5,000 braved bitterly cold weather in Montreal last Saturday to condemn Israel 's assault on Gaza
In Montreal , as many as 5,000 marched in bitterly cold weather to condemn Israel ’s assault on Gaza and the unconditional support that has been given it by Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his government .
A popular placard and chant was “ Isräel terroriste ; Harper - Bush complices ” ( Israeli terrorist ; Harper - Bush accomplices ) .
The protestors in Montreal included workers and their families and students .
Many of them were Arab Canadians .
There were also supporters of several Jewish groups .
The demonstration was organized by the Coalition élargie pour la paix et la justice en Palestine ( The Enlarged Coalition of Peace and Justice in Palestine ) , a coalition dominated by Quebec ’s major union federations ( the QFL , CNTU and CSQ ) and which includes a large number of other groups including Québec solidaire , a self - avowed left - sovereignist , ( i.e. , pro-Quebec independence ) party .
While often denouncing in scathing terms US and Canadian government complicity in the Israeli attack on Gaza , the organizers of the Montreal protest , and those held elsewhere in Canada , advanced the perspective that imperialist war could be halted and the oppression of the Palestinian people overcome by placing pressure on the “ international community , ” by which they mean the US , the European Union and other great powers , the Arab bourgeois governments , and imperialist - dominated institutions like the UN .
In opposition to this perspective , supporters of the Socialist Equality Party ( Canada ) distributed statements from the World Socialist Web Site that explained that the only true ally of the Palestinian masses is the international working class and that the defeat of imperialism and Zionism requires the united mobilization of the working class of all countries , including Arab and Jewish workers , against capitalism .
Speaking to the Montreal protest , Confederation of National Trade Unions President Claudette Charbonneau urged the Canadian government to take advantage of Barack Obama ’s assumption of the US presidency to convince Washington to “ play a less partisan role and to contribute to a just , durable peace . ”
She added that Ottawa should not “ hide behind the old policies of the Bush administration . ”
Amir Khadir , the co-leader of Québec solidaire and since last month its first and only Member of the Quebec National Assembly , joined other speakers in calling on the great powers to press for a ceasefire .
Like Charbonneau , Khadir was scrupulous in equating the violence of the US - armed Israel Defence Forces and the actions of Hamas , condemning both equally .
Declared Khadir , “ The international community has responsibility to put an end to a conflict that is bruising the Palestinian people , but that is also holding the Israeli population hostage . ”
“ Harper and Obama and the rest of the international community must , ” continued Khadir , “ force Israel to sit down and negotiate with the Palestinians in good faith . ”
The reality is that the Harper Conservative government , the official opposition Liberals and the Canadian corporate media have all rallied behind Israel .
This has included opposing a ceasefire until Israel has obtained all its objectives in Gaza , laying all blame for the conflict and for the large number of civilians killed by Israeli air strikes and artillery barrages on Hamas , and otherwise apologizing for Israeli war crimes .
Last Thursday , the new Liberal leader , Michael Ignatieff , reiterated his and his party ’s support for the Israeli assault on Gaza , denouncing Hamas , which won Palestinian Authority elections in 2006 , as a “ terrorist organization ” and asserting Israel ’s right to kill scores of Palestinians daily until Hamas cedes to its demands .
That same day , Conservative ministers , including Baird and Peter Kent , the minister of state for foreign affairs , were out in force at pro-Israel rallies .
Canada , Kent told a rally organized by Zionist organizations in Toronto , is " unequivocal in supporting Israel 's right to defend itself " — that is , in upholding Israel ’s “ right ” to pummel Gaza and inflict massive civilian casualties .
As for Obama , his silence on the Israeli assault denotes consent , a consent that is entirely in keeping with declarations he made during the US election campaign .
Speaking before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , the principal pro-Israel lobby in Washington , the day after he clinched the Democratic Party presidential nomination , Obama vowed he would never negotiate with Hamas and other Islamic and nationalist groups that refuse to recognize the state of Israel .
“ Israel ’s security , ” Obama proclaimed , “ is sacrosanct .
It is non-negotiable . ”
Most of the demonstrators with whom SEP supporters spoke thought the protests would have little impact on Canadian and US state policy , but that it was important to voice their outrage at the crimes being visited upon the Palestinian people by the Israeli state with the support of Washington and Ottawa , with a view to promoting public awareness .
Mounim , a business administration student , said he had come to the protest , “ so as to stop the massacre in Gaza .
I have come so the population can learn the truth .
The media tell us nothing about this conflict that has persisted for years , and when they do it is simply to show pictures of people in the streets protesting .
“ All the governments of the world except that of [ Venezuelan President ] Chavez support Israel .
It is for that reason there is no action against Israel .
In any case , Israel wo n’t respect the demands of the United Nations . ”
For more on the Canadian government ’s and establishment ’s role in backing the Israeli state ’s assault on Gaza see : Canada ’s government and opposition trumpet Israel ’s “ right ” to wage endless war in Gaza .
I have just three wishes for the coming year .
The first is for the Israeli government to realise once and for all that the Middle East conflict cannot be solved by military means .
The second is for Hamas to realise that its interests are not served by violence , and Israel is here to stay .
And the third is for the world to acknowledge that this conflict is unlike any other in history .
It is uniquely intricate and sensitive - a conflict between two peoples who are both deeply convinced of their right to live on the same very small piece of land .
This is why neither diplomacy nor military action can resolve this conflict .
The developments of the last few days are extremely worrisome to me for reasons of humane and political natures .
While it is self - evident that Israel has the right to defend itself , that it cannot and should not tolerate missile attacks on its citizens , its army 's relentless and brutal bombardment of Gaza has raised a few important questions in my mind .
The first question is if Israel 's government has the right to make all Palestinians culpable for the actions of Hamas .
Is the entire population of Gaza to be held responsible for the sins of a terrorist organisation ?
We , the Jewish people , should know and feel even more acutely than other populations that the murder of innocent civilians is inhumane and unacceptable .
The Israeli military has very weakly argued that the Gaza Strip is so overpopulated it is impossible to avoid civilian deaths during operations .
The feebleness of this argument leads to my next questions : if civilian deaths are unavoidable , what is the purpose of the bombardment ?
What , if any , is the logic behind the violence , and what does Israel hope to achieve through it ?
If the aim is to destroy Hamas then the most important question to ask is whether this is attainable .
If not , then the whole attack is not only cruel , barbaric and reprehensible , it is senseless .
If , on the other hand , it really is possible to destroy Hamas through military operations , how does Israel envisage the reaction in Gaza once this has been accomplished ?
One and a half million Gaza residents will not suddenly go down on their knees in reverence for the power of the Israeli army .
We must not forget that before Hamas was elected by the Palestinians , it was encouraged by Israel as a tactic to weaken Yasser Arafat .
Israel 's recent history leads me to believe that if Hamas is bombed out of existence , another group will most certainly take its place , a group that would be more radical , more violent , and more full of hatred towards Israel .
Israel cannot afford a military defeat for fear of disappearing from the map , yet history has proved that every military victory has left Israel in a weaker political position because of the emergence of radical groups .
I do not underestimate the difficulty of the decisions the Israeli government must make every day , nor do I underestimate the importance of Israel 's security .
Nevertheless , I stand behind my conviction that the only truly viable plan for long - term security is to gain the acceptance of all our neighbours .
I wish for a return in the year 2009 of the famous intelligence always ascribed to the Jews .
I wish for a return of King Solomon 's wisdom to Israel 's decision - makers that they might use it to understand that Palestinians and Israelis have equal human rights .
Palestinian violence torments Israelis and does not serve the Palestinian cause ; Israeli retaliation is inhuman , immoral , and does not guarantee security .
The destinies of the two peoples are inextricably linked , obliging them to live side by side .
They have to decide if they want to make of this a blessing or a curse .

Posted in perl
A number of people I know through the Perl community have come together to form The Enlightened Perl Organization ( EPO ) .
The goal is to modernize Perl 5 and make it competitive with new developments in programming languages , given that it 's unknown when Christmas ( the delivery date for Perl 6 ) will arrive .
My take on this is that while other organizations focus on ongoing development of Perl 6 , EPO will seek to enhance Perl 5 and take it out of " maintenance mode . "
Enhancing Perl 5 will hopefully bring much needed modernization to the Perl 5 core that people can use sooner rather than later .
One of the most exciting developments in the Perl community , which addresses some of the core criticism of Perl 5 , is Moose , an object system that modernizes Perl 5 .
Unlike previous efforts efforts to enhance Perl 5's object system , this one seems to have gained a lot of traction with 136 current logins on the #moose IRC channel .
Moose is different enough that some have even claimed that it is not Perl ; however , this is clearly not the case as Moose and non-Moose objects and be freely intermingled within Perl projects .
For some information Moose , check out this article by Jon Rockway .
In addition to Moose , check out KiokuDB an interface for schema- less databases like Amazon SimpleDB and CouchDB as well as more traditional DBI for RDBMs .
In addition to supporting projects , ideally Perl 5's core module list can be modernized so more people will be able to take advantage of and feel comfortable recommending modern approaches to Perl development .
At the same time , I 'd also like to see them tackle a few more persistent issues , the most important of which is CPAN usability .
There is no doubt the Perl community and the CPAN are very compelling ; however , installing CPAN dependencies is more difficult than it needs to be .
Installation often requires many interactive prompts and can take a long time for applications with many dependencies .
There are typically no 5 minute installs like exist for WordPress , PHPbb , and MediaWiki .
Some exceptions include qpsmtpd and Catalyst using Matt Trout 's cat - install script .
I welcome EPO as another organization in the Perl community to keep Perl modern and vibrant .
This last trip to Cuba was one of many firsts including a few from my life to - do list , one of which was to ride on a horse .
And now that I ’ve done it I probably wo n’t do it again .
My ass thanks me in advance .
I definitely will not do it again in a place where there are no certainties about the care of the animals .
I worried for my little horse and wondered about all the heavy tourist butts she had been forced to bear in her lifetime of servitude .
The horseback trip we took was a short , but painful jaunt to a waterfall up in the mountains .
The waterfall itself was interesting , although not remarkable .
What was amazing were the plants !
I particularly loved the wall covered in epiphytic plants ( air plants ) shown in the photo above .
Would n’t you love to have that in your living room ?
Those strange snake - like plants on the left side are epiphytic cactus .
And the big - leaved vine in the foreground and left background ?
Philodendron !
Translation : Why is Braille so good ?
Few inventions have been as simple yet liberating as Braille .
To mark the 200th birthday of its inventor Louis Braille , former British home secretary David Blunkett explains how it shaped his life by providing him from an early age with a window on the world .
Picture a little boy of four .
He arrives at school - boarding school - for the first time .
Worried , sometimes even frightened , but determined not to cry .
Picture then a little boy with a contraption in front of him on his desk the following morning .
A stylus ( to him , a pin with a wooden knob on the top ) in which he 's expected not only to press downwards to make what he considers to be a " hole " in thick paper , but the daunting prospect of being told that he 's going to operate from right to left .
How Braille works Louis Braille became blind aged three .
In 1821 he started to devise the Braille system to help people with visual impairments to read and write .
Each Braille character is made up of six dots positioned in two columns of three dots each .
Braille is read by passing the fingers over each character .
The characters represent the letters in the alphabet as well as punctuation marks .
A key benefit of the six - dot system is the ability to recognise each letter using a single finger tip , without the need for repositioning .
Using both hands to read Braille achieves an average speed of 115 words per minute , compared to 250 words per minute for sighted reading .
BACK NEXT 1 of 5
That little four - year - old was , of course , me .
And yes , I was expected , along with all my fellow pupils , to use an old - fashioned Braille writing frame which had the six - dot system invented by Louis Braille , born on 4 January 1809 , to produce the alphabet and much more .
The reason why it was necessary to write from right to left was that , in those days , without the sophistication firstly of mechanical and then of electronic Braille production , the dots had to be pressed downwards and , when turned over , would provide a mirror image .
It was therefore not only necessary to write from right to left , but also to reverse the actual letters so that with the exception of letters like A and C , other parts of the alphabet had to be reversed .
D had to be written as an F .
In Braille , this is exactly the mirror image - and therefore came out on the opposite side exactly as you 'd read it left to right .
If all this sounds complicated , it damn well was !
To read Braille without being able to see you need to develop sensitive finger ends
Thankfully , new systems were developed as I went through the education system which allowed the production to be bottom - up ( with the dots punctured upwards from left to right , immediately readable by the user ) .
Despite all its difficulties in those early days , this system was nevertheless a liberator for me and hundreds of thousands of blind men and women like me .
Invented by Louis Braille at the age of 15 , the idea came from a soldier who had served in the Napoleonic army in Poland and had attempted to devise a system that could , with night - time manoeuvres , allow messages to be sent and instructions to be passed from hand to hand .

It did n't work , because the system was too complex and the soldiers did n't get it .
Not surprisingly , because to read Braille without being able to see you need to develop sensitive finger ends .
Finger ends which , unlike mine , need to be protected from burns developed whilst cooking , or rough handling of gardening implements and the like .
My fingers have developed what in a sighted person might be called " cataracts " , but I still plough on .
Art of oratory
All those years ago , Louis Braille decided that it was crucial that he should be able to read and , above all , to be able to write down his thoughts .
Two hundred years later , when chairing a meeting it is vital that I have an agenda on my own that I can refer to without reference to someone else .
It is vital that I have notes even when I shy away from actually reading speeches verbatim .
Mr Blunkett was rarely seen without his guide dog , Lucy
It 's no secret that I found reading statements at the Despatch Box in the Commons a trial .
Statements have to be read verbatim because the print version has been handed out , whereas of course speeches are an entirely different matter and much more up my street - as , of course , with answering questions .
With a set of notes you can make a speech having learnt the art of oratory at a very early age .
In fact it 's probably a question of cause and effect .
My own development of oratory came from the fact that by using notes I could overcome the difficulty of not being able quite so fluently as I would wish to skim over a written page of Braille - for Braille does n't have the opportunity to provide highlights .
You can't simply write Braille in large form so that as with print you can " catch your eye " on something that it is absolutely vital to deliver or to emphasise .
Underlining is possible , but more out of technical form than in terms of being able to quickly highlight what needs to be referred to and at what point .
Therefore , for me , Braille has been a method of ensuring that I can work on equal terms , using my own initiative and doing it in my own way .
As we celebrate the 200th birthday of Louis Braille , we lift a glass at the New Year to thank him for the ingenuity , the confidence and the determination
For others , it has been an absolutely vital way of ensuring private correspondence and , with more recent developments , being able to demand bank statements which allow privacy rather than relying on someone else to read them ( perhaps a neighbour ) at a time when confidentiality could be crucial .
In the future , so many of the public forms and communications we receive could easily be put in Braille by the use of computer software and the transcription equipment now readily available to public authorities .
My staff use exactly such software , along with Braille embossers , in order to be able to produce material for me on a regular basis .
So , as we celebrate the 200th birthday of Louis Braille , we lift a glass at the New Year to thank him for the ingenuity , the confidence and the determination that ensured that others like him sought and gained independence , equality and dignity .
Whilst doing so , we should recognise the critical role of organisations working with and on behalf of blind people , such as the Royal National Institute of the Blind here in the UK , whose support and resource base is crucial to making this old invention come alive in imaginatively new ways .
The year 2009 will indeed , here and across the world , be a chance to recognise this form of communication as an essential liberator , a window on the world for children reading their books ( under their bedcovers , as I did ) , or adults being able to go about their business with confidence - and with the certainty that very few other people will be able to read their secrets .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I have been a Braillist for many years now and am delighted to see that interest and understanding of this wonderful communication method is on the rise .
It could have so easily fallen by the wayside due to increased provision of audio recordings but I am much encouraged that it is still prevalent .
The only thing that concerns me with regards to the provision of Braille is that the so called " Lead Distributors " in the UK have become complacent due to their inherited status and that work that I have received from them in the past has been more than substandard and inaccurate , which is unacceptable when it comes to Braille .
Buck up your idea 's and your proofreading skills RNIB , you were great once , with a little care and consideration you could be great once again and deserving of the title Royal National Institute for the Blind !
Gemma Nicholl , Llanelli
It 's a fantastic invention which sadly Louis Braille never saw realised since he died before anyone used it .
His tutors though quietly impressed by his innovation where more concerned about reprinting books , retraining people how to read and building the machines to do it when they were already using the old raised letters system
Anon
Thanks very much for another helpful insight .
I listened to the BBC World service report this morning and was fascinated , so it was good to read directly about your experiences .
I do especially like the idea of being able to read under the bed covers in the dark !
That may even appeal to someone I know very well and inspire him to learn Braille , as reading by sight with a significant visual impairment can be arduous to say the least .
Mark Bagott , Newcastle Upon Tyne
My father lost his sight late in life .
He did not have the luxury or the time to learn Braille but what he did have was the RNIB and the local ' Blind ' Society .
He was an avid reader and thanks to all of them he continued to read via tapes and CDs .
All of this , and time was given freely .
Thank you
Heather , Milton Keyes
What a wonderfully inspiring story .
In todays world , children are loosing the art of reading books etc..
I hope especially with the gift of sight that they can be encouraged to read more .

A pleasure to read Mr Blunkett when he is n't on a political hobby horse .
Sensible topic sensibly discussed .
Thank you .
Rex Imperator , Lincolnshire uk Louis Braille attended The Institution for Blind Children in Paris , which was the world 's first workshop created specifically for the blind ( 1786 ) .
Its founder , Valentin Haüy ( 1745 -1822 ) , summarized the background to his philanthropy as follows : ' At the Saint - Ovide Fair , in September 1771 , I observed about a dozen blind pensioners from The Hospice for the Three Hundred - dressed in grotesque clothes and wearing opaque spectacles - playing a discordant piece of music , with all manner of instruments , which appeared to excite the pleasure of the spectators .
From that moment , I swore to myself that I would teach the blind to read and write so as to give them back their dignity . '
Dr. Roger Peters , Bristol I have taught myself Braille , ( not easy ) as my wife and I administer and organise BARTIMAEUS CENTRE FOR THE BLIND in Bangalore , India .
On a purely voluntary basis we offer tuition and accommodation to about 14 poor , blind students to rehabilitate them and hopefully find them employment .
This allows them to develop as valued individuals .
Our curriculum includes , mobility , English language and computer skills .
Braille is our ' backbone ' !
Reg Ansell ( Retired U.K. headteacher ) , Ross on Wye U.K. ( 6 months ) and Bangalore India ( 6 months )
This is a fascinating insight into some of the less obvious challenges of Braille usage .
I 'm surprised that technology is n't a bigger part of the braille user 's world though .
Kelly Mouser , Upminster , England I dated a man several years ago who was blind and he lamented that the young students at the schools for the blind were not being taught Braille .
He said that they were being raised as illiterates .
I hope this trend has changed since that time .
Angela , Abingdon , Virginia USA Dear Mr Blunkett , I was so amazed to learn that there are so much involved in Braille system .
You have explained it in easy to grasp language and it gave a new vision to my understanding .
Dr.G.Srinivasan , Derby A real tribute to Louis Braille on his 200 year birth anniversary celebration is to make education accessible to every blind child , to show empathy not sympathy towards blind .
Governments , societies , NGOs should work hand in hand to achieve this goal .
asra fatima , hyderabad .
India Politics and other things aside , Mr Blunkett has been a shining example of someone overcoming a disability .
The story told above is inspirational .
Michael Black , Manchester Terrific story but it would have been better had it also included the description of the mechanics behind the new way of creating Braille .
We have been discussing it at the lunch table and will attempt to Google this new missing information .
Anon I had to learn Braille for a job I took 3 years ago .
I am sighted but worked with Blind women and men in Zurich .
I found working with Braille very uplifting as I learnt Braille , both types of German Braille - there are two - a more complicated version to shorten the words ( not unlike shorthand ) and music Braille ( my Job was transcribing sheet music into Braille ) .
I left the job after receiving a chance to pursue my own music and can still read Braille ( with my eyes ) .
I am so glad to have learnt Braille as I also had to learn to write with simple Braillers ( right to left AND mirrored ) and working with blind people was so much fun as the power of conversation was so much more advanced than with most sighted people .
Blind people tend to be better listeners , appreciate music more , have unbelievable memories and can sense things us sighted people mostly can't .
Obviously there are different forms of Blindness and different people are affected differently by the onset of sight - loss .

This is wonderful .
I wonder whether teaching Braille to dyslexic children would help them more than struggling with normal print ?

“ To make a change in how you look , you are talking about a significant period of training , ” Dr. Kraemer said .
“ In our studies it takes six months to a year . ”
And , he added , that is with regular strength - training workouts , using the appropriate weights and with a carefully designed individualized program .
“ That is what the reality is , ” he said .
And genetic differences among individuals mean some people respond much better to exercise than others , said Dr. Mark Tarnopolsky , an exercise researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario .
He added that although he does not think the before - and - after photos in ads are doctored , most people will not change so markedly no matter how hard or long they work .
“ I believe they are taking the top one or two people out of thousands , ” Dr. Tarnopolsky said .
People who did change their bodies say six months is a bare minimum to see real change .
Schuyler Antane , 43 , a research scientist , is one .
He began in January 2006 with a diet , which meant , he said , “ letting go of the foods that taste good , but are wicked evil .
And no more beer . ”
In three months , he had lost 10 pounds and was down to 190 pounds on his 5 - foot - 8 - inch frame .
Then he read a magazine article on 5 - kilometer races and decided to try to run .
He could run for only five minutes when he started , and it took two months to train for his first race .
But he kept at it and improved .
Within six months , he weighed about 150 pounds .
Then he added bicycling and swimming , becoming a triathlete .
That , he said , got him to his fighting weight of 140 to 145 pounds .
“ My beer belly is long gone , ” he said .
“ The only flab in my midsection is excess skin , but I am not vain enough to have an operation . ”
Now , said Mr. Antane , who runs with a group in Princeton on Thursday nights , “ everything changed  my outlook on life , who I hung out with , how I felt about myself . ”
Jim Lisowski , 45 , the owner and chief executive of SciTec , a research and development company in Montgomery , N.J. , said he had let himself slip out of shape , going from 189 pounds to 225 pounds .
He is 5 - foot - 10 1/ 2 .
Then his wife bought a joint membership at a gym within walking distance of his office .
At first , he went sporadically , but he decided to get serious after about three years .

“ There is no question in my mind that , should a new Constitutional Convention be called , it would be the end of the United States of America as we know it , and our current Constitution and Bill of Rights would be forever altered beyond recognition , ” Constitution Party presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin wrote in his latest commentary .
“ The globalists who currently control Washington , D.C. , and Wall Street are , no doubt , salivating over the opportunity to officially dismantle America ’s independence and national sovereignty , and establish a globalist North American Union - in much the same way that globalists created the European Union .
A new Constitutional Convention is exactly the tool they need to cement their sinister scheme into law . ”
WND reported when the American Policy Center issued an alert that the plan was under consideration in the Ohio legislature .
The proposal was put aside , at least temporarily , because of publicity generated by the organization run by Tom DeWeese .
WND later reported some Wyoming lawmakers , alarmed by the prospects , announced they were working to ensure that if a convention is held , it would convene in the face of their opposition .
Wyoming previously called for a Constitutional Convention but rescinded the votes in 1999 .
However , it is unclear whether even a formal vote to withdraw a request for a convention would have an impact or whether any limits could be imposed , according to constitutional expert John Eidsmoe .
Baldwin , the founder of Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola , Fla. , and a radio talk show host , now is urging citizens to contact their state representatives on the issue , especially residents of Virginia .
“ As I noted in this column a few weeks ago , proponents of assembling a new Constitutional Convention are a scant two states away from achieving that monstrous reality , ” he wrote .
“ At that time , the state of Ohio was in the crosshairs .
“ Fortunately , enough people from that good state inundated their state representatives with objections , and the matter was tabled ( for how long , no one knows ) .
Now it appears that the Commonwealth of Virginia is going to be the next battleground state , ” he wrote .
“ In all likelihood , the Virginia legislature will be the next state government to take up the Con Con issue .
It is imperative , therefore , that the citizens of Virginia begin contacting their various representatives , demanding that they not authorize the call for a new Constitutional Convention . ”
WND ’s earlier report noted 32 states already have approved demands for the convention , and only two more states are needed to complete the list .
“ If called , a modern Constitutional Convention could declare the U.S. Constitution to be null and void , and could completely rewrite the document .
For example , former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger once declared , ‘ There is no effective way to limit or muzzle the actions of a Constitutional Convention .
The Convention could make its own rules and set its own agenda , ’” Baldwin wrote .
He said in Virginia , lawmakers previously had asked for the convention but rescinded the call in 2004 , so this year ’s debate apparently will be over the rescission .
Baldwin said residents of California , Connecticut , Hawaii , Illinois , Kentucky , Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Montana , New Jersey , New York , Ohio , Rhode Island , Vermont , Washington , West Virginia and Wisconsin have not yet voted for a new convention …

Well , there is no need for me to qualify my statements as conspiracy theory here involving Corporate Media .
Five corporations own most of it , those corporations have profited handsomely from BushCo and are republican , and they 've obviously received their no -talking points .
I am further shocked by one of the larger , so - called " progressive " blogs out there that is increasingly known as the blog that censors for no apparent reason .
It has buried news of this story since it happened ; THAT is not a normal thing to do , not at all normal .
I 've since taken that blog off of my favorites list .
People in the blogosphere should start expressing outrage over the way that blog is censoring news and opinion .
This Connell story infuriates me because it has all the signs of being anything but an accident ... and yet the Big Boys and Girls in media are just not interested .
And the silence from the republicans is so telling .
It does not add up , none of it .

Do n't forget to mention that Connell was not only involved with switching over the WH email system during the start of the Iraq war ..
He also converted the House. gov IT system and had his own servers inside the House firewall .
Not to mention the work he did for Dept of Energy ( think Enron ) , the OFHEO which is Fannie / Freddie oversight , he also was connected to people who were involved with privatizing the FL IT .
He set up websites for Ohio 2001 redistricting and also in Texas .
Not only was Rove 's private email probably used to improperly send classified emails , but he had inside access to sensitive House subcommittees and DOE websites .
Who knows the amount of insider access that was improperly set up .
This was a huge National Security issue and it still is thanks to all the stuff SMARTech still has access to .

KGO radio , a corporate " news talk " station in San Francisco , interviewed me very late last night about the Minnesota recount and the Connell story .
That interview is archived online for one week .
Click on Tuesday .
Then go to " 11:00 p.m. - mid. " and choose listen or download .
All the information in the interview has been previously seen on BRAD BLOG , Raw Story , etc .
I add it here only because it's another place the story was covered on the corporate media , for those keeping track .

Elliott and Flo~ I know .
In the previous thread I waxed on re : how our formerly progressive , exotic , new media tart has buried this story , how I 'm having serious issues with her ... issues .
When did she go all Cosmo ?
This is the second strike against our old , slightly - Greek -y , cerebral celeb pal .
I boycotted HUFFPO for about a year after she dissed exit polls , and actually told her readers not to participate in them .
Later , she seemed to retract the most damning mis-information , so I gave her another chance .
Now this .
These two gross failures of my " new media " as the last remaining shreds of our fourth estate , combined with the most ABSURD stories she 's posting IN THE PLACE of real news , day after day ; screaming headlines that bleakly reek of HBO 's old comedy series " Not Necessarily the News " , except HUFFPO is not necessarily funny .
If only she did Sniglets .
I learned recently that certain " hot words " are automatically rejected for posting in any of their threads .
I do n't remember which ones , but I think it 's words like " conspiracy " or " NWO " ... so , it 's not exactly the interactive , lil ' slice of democratic heaven that we have here at Bradblog .
Yes , someone needs to sit Zsa - Zsa down for a little chat .

HuffPo or rather Zsa Zsa made Saturday Night Live as a dimwit who wo n't stop babbling .
Unfortunately , some people take her site seriously .
It 's always been conservative with a little criticism thrown in just to appear progressive .
She never mentions 9/11 or any new developments like the recent lawsuit of the brave April Gallop which was on Raw and Alex Jones .
But McConnell should have had at least a condolence statement from White House - but then all the media would have been obligated to carry it .
How could Raw Story have said McConnell and his wife seemed nice and over their heads ?
They were doing diryt deeds for the neocons for years ......

to Bob : Keith Olbermann is basically on vacation this week and I emailed his countdown show sunday about Connell 's death and how his life had been threatened but they wo n't touch the story .
Monday 's night show was the best of KO 's stories from 2008 .
Last night he had a substitute and will probably have another sub tonight .
So , if they do n't cover the news story by Mon / Tues , the story is too old for them .
The Countdown producers refuse to touch upon anything related to the theft of the Ohio Nov 2004 election or the consequences thereof or the stealing of elections .
They prefer to be a sort of political newshow version of PEOPLE magazine in which keith can continue to harp upon the stupidity of various GOP figures like sarah palin , the gift that keeps giving .
The show is very clever in that it is funny , and does cover the big " political " stories but stays away from non-mainstream media stories like Mike Connell 's death like it was the black plague .
keith from time to time will gather up the courage to make his special comment about something .
Rachel Maddow 's show may have mentioned very briefly the death of Mike Connell but did n't go into much detail .
her email address is rachel@msnbc.com .
You 'll have better luck emailing her .
Too bad about HuffPo , they just got millions of dollars of a capital infusion from some investors , so that 's a shame they wo n't include this story .
Again the crime of this century that is not spoken about on any mainstream media news show is the theft of the Nov 2004 Ohio election .
It is now " safe " to talk about how the GOP seized victory by having their guy Scalia in the Supreme Court actually interfere with State 's right to stop the State of Florida from recounting the votes after Gore was ahead .
No one has brought up the possibility that Connell could have been killed because he refused to help Rove - Cheney - McCain steal the nov 2008 election after McCain had declared victory 2 weeks before on " meet the press " and said he was going to win afterall , a " come back from behind " victory , late in the evening of nov 4th .
Perhaps Connell finally saw who he was dealing with : not conservative pro-lifers but something much more sinister .
To : Brad
Keep up the great work and heal that wrist of your !

None .
And yet , after thorough and complete campaign and lobbying finance reform ( i.e. , no lobbying money ever , none , zero , to any politician for any reason ) , after election fraud , comes television & cable news reform ( if you consistently omit or lie about the fact , your license goes poof ! ) .

Oops .
Nevermind .
The HUFFPO piece , by one Thomas B. Edsall , is oddly loaded n' parsed : " ... there was no immediate evidence of wrong - doing or sabotage .
Nonetheless , Connell 's death provoked a groundswell of commentary among conspiracy theorists on the web , including Larisa Alexandrovna , Raw Story , Velvet Revolution , ePluribus Media , and TheZoo . "
( What ?
No mention of Brad ? ! )
" The most common unsubstantiated allegation on these sites is that Connell was about to provide crucial information in the case of alleged vote fraud in the 2004 Ohio presidential contest ... "
Hm .
Where does he get off using " unsubstantiated " ?
While it 's unknown what Connell was about to do , presuming he was n't going to provide crucial information is just as " unsubstantiated . "
Oh .
Unless you 're using Heather Connell to " substantiate " it .
Here 's something new .
Edsall writes : " In a telephone interview , Connell 's wife Heather adamantly declared " he was a good man .
He did nothing wrong .
He was n't about to talk , because there was nothing to talk about .
Nobody did anything wrong .
We won the elction fair and square .
Deal with it . "
Asked if he ever spoke about the disputed emails , Heather Connell said " I have no clue about that .
I just know it 's not him . "
This has prompted a separate post from Larisa in response , here : http://www.huffingtonpos...to-profess_b_153524.html

UPDATE : After Prof .
Edsall 's article received more than 450 comments at Huffpo , most of which were quite sophisticated in their knowledge of the FACTS involved in the case and rebuked the Professor for his shoddy reporting and superfluous name - calling ( even some comments in support of Larisa 's work from other Huffpo bloggers citing this article as " beneath the standards of Huffpo " ) -- the Professor has just issued the following belated retraction : UPDATE : " ... An earlier version of this story claimed : " Connell 's death provoked a groundswell of commentary among conspiracy theorists on the web , including Larisa Alexandrovna , Raw Story , Velvet Revolution , ePluribus Media , and TheZoo . "
To be fair : Larisa Alexandrovna acknowledged that suspicions that Connell 's death was the result of sabotage were unproven , and she urged that empirical evidence be pursued .
Her articles and those that she cites legitimately raised questions that in many cases are worthy of pursuit ( See Alexandrovna 's letter concerning this story here . )
I regret using " conspiracy theorists " to describe Larisa Alexandrovna , Raw Story , and the others ... "
I have combed through all 450 comments ( most of mine are still ' pending approval ' , but I saw some bradbloggers comments that were surprisingly intact . )
Thanks , my people !
I 'm slightly encouraged ...

I also find it interesting that hardly any news outlets have picked up on this , including local Akron and Cleveland area papers .
While my guess is that they would prefer the story never be told , I do n't think it is because Rove is behind this , but rather , for the simple fact that they stole elections and tampered with democratic processes .
While I originally leaned heavily in the direction of believing the " accident " was not really an accident , the more I learn , the more I believe it was , although there are some troubling pieces here .
I looked over his flight path using the data from flighttracker as well as the climate data at the time .
I even went so far as to recreate the flight in flight simulator .
It definitely appears to me that the likely cause was icing , and that the reason that he had veered west of the flight path was to either find the safest place to put the plane down , or the controls became so unresponsive and / or the aerodynamics of the plane with a bunch of ice put him there .
He was , it appears , lined up perfectly with the glideslope indicating he should have had no problem landing .
His avionics were state of the art - the navigational system made it virtually impossible to get lost , and he was lined up with the runway almost perfectly until problems occured .
There are a few things however that really bother me - some that I think Larissa also mentioned : 1 . Why was the NTSB so quick to rule out icing ?
Under the circumstances and from all preliminarily available data , icing does seem to be the most reasonable assumption .
What do they know ?
2 . How could the trooper possibly have identified Connell so quickly ?
That fire looked pretty hot , and burned for a solid 10 minutes or more before they put the fire out .
Surely his identification would have been destroyed along with the body , although they say the body was not badly burned .
How can that possibly be , unless his body was ejected from the plane prior to impact / explosion ?
Plus , the plane was not registered in his name .
3 . I 'm not sure what this means , if anything , but there was a curious time frame in which flight positions were not tracked , spanning 20 - 30 minutes or so which seems a bit odd .
Typically flight positions are recorded every 1 - 4 minutes , but there is a void which began as he was approaching Pittsburgh until nearing his Akron approach .
Perhaps a real pilot can explain this anomaly .
There are certain aspects of this that make me wonder if his death could have been faked , as I am inclined to think Ken Lay 's death was .
I will wait patiently for more info though .
Hopefully we will get to hear from more eyewitnesses to the crash , and especially the ATC dialog / recordings , and of course the coroner 's report .
In the meantime I hope that people will temper their tendency to put Rove behind this .
As much as I despise the man and do believe he is capable of almost anything , I do not at this point think he had anything to do with this .
Before I leave , you might want to google " piper saratoga " + icing .
You can find some very interesting reads about icing problems .

Travellers in first class had access to a cocktail bar up a spiral staircase .
Pilots ( two plus a flight engineer ) had to be retrained in new simulators because the cockpit was so high off the ground .
The original Boeing 747 was so big that airports had to be adapted to accommodate it .

( CNN ) -- Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa , whose hands and feet were amputated in a bid to save her from a deadly and little - known illness , died early Saturday , two friends of the model told CNN .
Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa died Saturday after undergoing multiple amputations .
" Unfortunately Mari could n't resist any longer .
She passed away at 3 a.m. today , " Henrique Fontes , executive director of Miss World Brazil , said in an e-mail to CNN .
Renato Lindgren , a friend of the model who runs a blog dedicated to her , confirmed da Costa 's death .
On his blog , Lindgren wrote that he and other friends were going to the hospital .
" On behalf of all the family , we are grateful for the support and the affection that the entire world has sent to us , " he wrote .
Da Costa , 20 , had fought a pernicious disease that has ravaged her body and forced doctors to perform the amputations and extract part of her stomach as well as both kidneys .
She had been breathing through a respirator , officials at Dorio Silva Hospital in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo said Friday .
Da Costa suffered from necrosis , or the fast deadening of tissue , caused by septicemia .
Septicemia , triggered by a bacterial infection , causes insufficient blood flow that can lead to organ failure .
Da Costa first sought medical advice after feeling ill in late December .
Hospital officials said she was transferred to Dorio Silva on January 3 in " septic shock , " a serious medical condition caused by an inflammation .
Da Costa was first diagnosed as suffering a urinary tract infection .
By the time the infection was detected , it had developed into septicemia .
Doctors decided to amputate first her hands and then her feet after the condition reduced the amount of oxygen being delivered to her limbs .
Just less than one month ago , da Costa was a healthy young woman well on the way to achieving her dream of becoming a world class model .
She placed sixth in the Miss Bikini International competition in China last year and took first place for the " Best in Swimsuit " category .
In 2007 and 2008 , she came fourth in the contest to become Brazil 's entrant for the Miss World pageant .
Thiago Simoes , da Costa 's fiance , said she was on her way to international stardom , signing with prominent model scout Dilson Stein , who brought Brazilian models , including Gisele Bundchen and Luize Altenhofen , to the world stage .
" All the agencies were very interested in knowing her .
I know for a fact that they would have loved her because Mariana is beautiful , " Stein told Brazil 's Tribuna newspaper .
Vital Signs Each month CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brings viewers health stories from around the world .

Simoes told CNN that da Costa woke up from a coma 10 days ago and told him how much she wanted to be alive .
" She told me she was praying to stay alive , that she still had a lot to do on this earth , that she wanted to go on with her plans , " he said .
" She comes from a humble family and she was the main breadwinner , " said Simoes , who refuted rumors that da Costa was dieting and that might have affected her health .
" She never dieted , never took pills ... she is a very simple , very warm human being , " he said .
A doctor who recently published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine on the disease , told CNN that little was known about the illness , although it is the tenth leading cause of deaths in the United States .
" We know a lot about what happens once a patient contracts the illness but we know very little about what causes it , " said Dr. Greg Martin of Emory University in Atlanta .
Martin said sepsis is a " response " to an infection that can cause the immune system to lose its balance .
" Basically , the immune system goes haywire after contracting an infection and begins to overreact , " he said .
Men are more susceptible than women , Martin said .
News of da Costa 's condition spread quickly throughout Brazil and then worldwide .
A message on her Web site said that the volume of traffic had caused it to crash , and that the site had received more than 15,000 hits in two days .
" The whole world , I repeat , the whole world is touched by the case of Mariana , " it said .
The message said they had received " e- mails of solidarity from all corners of the world : Australia , Ukraine , Czech Republic , France , Italy , USA , Russia , etc . "
CNN 's Hilary Whiteman and Helena de Moura contributed to this report .

The federal government is planning to provide more help to Canadian banks because they continue to cope with unfavourable credit conditions , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said yesterday .
Harper made those remarks prior to a private meeting with key executives from the banking and insurance industries about the global financial crisis .
He provided no details , but stressed any additional intervention would not expose taxpayers to any significant cost or risk .
" There has been some improvement in credit conditions but there are still some significant concerns , " Harper told reporters following a discussion at the C.D. Howe Institute in Toronto .
" We are not , by any means , finished in terms of further steps that will have to be taken .
That said , all the steps that we will take will be done for the wider benefit for Canadians , Canadian jobs , Canadian credit , Canadian economy , Canadian business . "
Speculation of further government action has been mounting in recent days .
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has hinted Ottawa could double the size of its mortgage purchase program , while providing other assistance to banks and private pension funds .
The federal government has already agreed to buy as much as $ 25 billion in residential mortgages from Canadian banks so they can keep lending to consumers .
So far , it has purchased about $ 12 billion of those loans .
Ottawa also agreed last month to provide guarantees on more than $ 200 billion of bank debt .
Harper 's comments , however , came just hours after the London interbank offered rate , or Libor , that global banks charge each other for three - month loans in U.S. dollars sank to the lowest level in four years .
The rate slid 12 basis points to 2.39 per cent , the lowest level since November 2004 , according to British Bankers ' Association data .
It was its 19th consecutive decline .
The overnight rate , meanwhile , rose less than 1 basis point to 0.33 per cent .
And the Libor - OIS spread – a gauge of cash scarcity among banks – narrowed 11 basis points to 181 basis points .
Separately , the European Central Bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points to 3.25 per cent , while the Bank of England lowered rates by a larger than expected 150 basis points to 3 per cent .
While Harper stressed Canada is in a " relatively strong position " compared with other countries , he conceded " many of the first shock waves of the current global storm were felt right here on Bay Street . "
Still , he cautioned the global community should only make " selective " changes to regulatory systems going forward .
When it comes to the Canadian economy , Harper again signalled that he is less averse to the idea of running a deficit in future fiscal years , citing " increasing pessimism and uncertainty about the future . "
He has promised to provide an economic and fiscal update by month 's end .
Canada will avoid a recession by the thinnest of margins next year , according to an International Monetary Fund economic update released yesterday .
The IMF said Canada 's growth will average just 0.3 per cent next year .
" The real key will be if we are forced into those circumstances that we avoid long - term , permanent , structural deficits .
That absolutely must be avoided , " Harper said .

At this point , there is no evidence of widespread use of Viagra by elite athletes , Mr. Tygart said .
Yet , because the drug is not prohibited and thus not screened for , there is no way to know precisely how popular it is .
There is some suspicion that Viagra may be used to circumvent doping controls in cycling , which has faced waves of scandal .
Last May , the cyclist Andrea Moletta was removed from the Tour of Italy after a search of his father ’s car turned up 82 Viagra pills , as well as syringes concealed in a tube of toothpaste , according to news accounts .
An investigation ended without formal accusations of doping .
Image Kenneth W. Rundell , lead researcher of the Marywood study , said Viagra provides an unfair advantage , at least at altitude .
Credit ... Niko J. Kallianiotis for The New York Times
The former major league baseball player Rafael Palmeiro once served as a pitchman for Viagra and tested positive in 2005 for the steroid stanozolol , although the connection , if any , between the drugs in his case is not known .
Some athletes are believed to take Viagra in an attempt to aid the delivery of steroids to the muscles and hasten recovery from workouts .
Others take Viagra to counter the effects of impotence brought on by steroid use , said Dr. Gary I. Wadler , the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency ’s committee on prohibited substances .
The agency , based in Montreal , is financing two studies related to Viagra and performance enhancement in sports .
The University of Miami is studying whether Viagra benefits aerobic capacity at lower altitudes than the Stanford study  comparable to heights where elite competitions take place .
This study is also examining whether there is a difference in the way Viagra affects male and female athletes .
The study at Marywood University is measuring the potential effects of Viagra as an antidote to air pollution , produced outdoors by the exhaust of factories and automobiles and indoors by ice - resurfacing machines .
Studies involving animals , and children in Mexico City , have indicated that pollution causes pulmonary hypertension .
If that could be alleviated for athletes by Viagra , “ performance is going to be enhanced , ” said Dr. Rundell , the lead researcher of the pollution study .
The Marywood study is expected to be completed by next month , and the Miami study is expected to conclude in February .
The earliest that the World Anti-Doping Agency could place Viagra on its list of prohibited substances would be September 2009 , five months before the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , British Columbia , a spokesman said .

SEOUL , South Korea  South Korea has railed for years against the Japanese government ’s waffling over how much responsibility it bears for one of the ugliest chapters in its wartime history : the enslavement of women from Korea and elsewhere to work in brothels serving Japan ’s imperial army .
Now , a group of former prostitutes in South Korea have accused some of their country ’s former leaders of a different kind of abuse : encouraging them to have sex with the American soldiers who protected South Korea from North Korea .
They also accuse past South Korean governments , and the United States military , of taking a direct hand in the sex trade from the 1960s through the 1980s , working together to build a testing and treatment system to ensure that prostitutes were disease - free for American troops .
While the women have made no claims that they were coerced into prostitution by South Korean or American officials during those years , they accuse successive Korean governments of hypocrisy in calling for reparations from Japan while refusing to take a hard look at South Korea ’s own history .
“ Our government was one big pimp for the U.S. military , ” one of the women , Kim Ae-ran , 58 , said in a recent interview .
Porn star runs for Senate , seems perfectly qualified
Adult film star Stormy Daniels says she may run against Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter .
Vitter , who was named in a Washington , DC prostitution ring , calls himself a social conservative .
“ I do n’t see how I can possibly embarrass him more than he already embarrassed himself … , ” Daniels said .
“ Honestly , I ’m not sure I ’m willing to take the pay cut that comes with being a senator . ”
This is like the old joke about the gorgeous woman who sits down next to a guy in a bar .
He turns to her and says , “ Would you have sex with me for $ 1,000,000 .
“ Well , that ’s a lot of money , ” she says .
“ I guess I would . ”
He says , “ How about $ 10 ? ”
She ’s shocked .
She ’s furious .
“ What do you take me for , ” she says , “ some kind of whore ? ”
“ We ’ve already established that , ” he says , “ now we ’re just haggling about price . ”
We know what Senators are .
Why not just elect someone who ’s willing to admit she ’ll screw us all if the money ’s right .

I have to admit , the rising tide of venom about the lateness of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS has gotten pretty discouraging .
Emails , message boards , blogs , LJ comments , everywhere I look ( and lots of places where I do n't ) , people seem to be attacking me , defending me , using me as a bad example of something or other , whatever .
I can and do avoid most of the online discussions , although I do regularly get emails from people eager to point out the latest URL where DANCE and I are being hashed over .
I can do that , and I can screen the trollish comments here on LJ , but there 's no avoiding the emails .
Some of you are angry about the miniatures , the swords , the resin busts , the games .
You do n't want me " wasting time " on those , or talking about them here .
Some of you are angry that I watch football during the fall .
You do n't want me " wasting time " on the NFL , or talking about it here .

You do n't want me co-editing WARRIORS or the Vance anthology or STAR - CROSSED LOVERS or any of the other projects I 'm doing with my old friend Gardner Dozois , and you get angry when I post about them here .
For reasons I do n't quite comprehend , the people who hate those projects seem to hate WILD CARDS even more .
You really do n't want me working on that , " wasting time " on that , and posting about it here .
Some of you do n't want me attending conventions , teaching workshops , touring and doing promo , or visiting places like Spain and Portugal ( last year ) or Finland ( this year ) .
More wasting time , when I should be home working on A DANCE WITH DRAGONS .
After all , as some of you like to point out in your emails , I am sixty years old and fat , and you do n't want me to " pull a Robert Jordan " on you and deny you your book .
Okay , I 've got the message .
You do n't want me doing anything except A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE .
Ever .
( Well , maybe it 's okay if I take a leak once in a while ? )
Here 's my reply :
Shortly before Israel was scheduled to start another three hour humanitarian pause in its now nearly two week long attack on the Gaza Strip , an Israeli tank attacked a United Nations aid truck at the Erez border crossing , killing the driver and seriously wounding another aid worker .
Following its attack on the aid truck , the Israeli military closed the crossing , through which todays humanitarian shipments were supposed to flow .
It seems Gaza ’s residents will face another foodless Thursday .
The United Nations also announced that it would be halting its aid shipments into the beset strip until Israel promises to stop attacking their aid workers , with spokesman Chris Gunness adding “ we ’ve been coordinating with them and yet our staff continue to be hit and killed . ”
The vehicle was clearly marked with a UN flag and insignia , and the reason behind the Israeli attack was n’t apparent , though the army claims to be investigating .
Likely it will be just another in the long string of unexplained killings of medical and humanitarian aid workers , coupled with an even longer list of unexplained killings of Gaza civilians .
Israel is also being petitioned over the large number of attacks by its military on ambulances , and the Red Cross is complaining that the Israeli military had denied them access to injured civilians for several days at a time .
As the death toll continues to soar and is peopled overwhelmingly by civilians since the ground invasion began , Israel will be under increasing international pressure to halt its killings , though it seems unlikely to be considering that in the near term .

If there 's one thing that makes me vomit in my mouth , it 's plastic gadgets painted silver .

It 's not the plastic .
I like plastic fine .
And although I prefer solid molded colors , painting plastic with other colors is ok , too .
It 's just that the overriding reason for painting a plastic device silver is to make it look like metal .
Which is stupid .
This needs to stop as surely as wooden panels on station wagons needed to stop 30 years ago and why tofurky is a totally unacceptable replacement for either turkey or tofu .
Silver painted gadgets started rising in prominence in the cellphone world , and 8 years ago were thought of as a premium finish to those in design circles .
" Blame Motorola or Casio , " say some designers I talked to about the trend .
Now the " tin man " treatment is reserved for the cheapest devices while the best get done up in real metal .
I 'm still confused as to why this was a good idea in the first place , and why companies , even some high - end brands , still maintain the facade .
( I 'm totally looking at you , Pentax , Canon , Dell and Sony . )

First off , it 's insulting to buyer intelligence .
Are makers trying to fool us into thinking a device is aluminum or magnesium or stainless steel when its actually a light piece of bent polymer ?
Maybe from 10 feet away , they'd think that we could n't tell the difference , and they'd be right .
Visually .
Allan Chochinov from Core77 , says :
Painting plastic objects so that they appear metallic is a fudge of course — and often convincingly so .
But the lie becomes apparent soon enough ; at the corners or wherever there 's any kind of friction , the paint wears away to reveal the true plastic .
Industrial designers talk about the virtues of an " honesty of materials " in design practice , and when that honesty is expressed in the final product it 's really great — but rare .
With the almost - suffocating cost constraints and real pressure to pump things out quickly , the artifice is just too irresistible .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Yes , the methods of turning a hunk of plastic into a shiny thing is getting better , so these piece - o - craps look better than ever close up .
But contextually , they 're not fooling anyone with half a brain .
Everyone , everyone , EVERYONE knows that when they see a huge silver TV , even from 30 feet away , it 's probably not made of metal but rather coated with Pantone 877c .
And that overly curvy designs are likely plastic sprayed with paint .
And mainstream gadgets , like PSPs and DVD players made in China , well , those things are too chintzy to ever get the full metal treatment .
They 're not worth their weight in metal .
Which brings us to cost .
Yes , like most commercial compromises made in the world , plastic made to look like metal for the most part comes down to saving dollars in manufacturing .
Cormac Eubanks , a principal engineer from Frog design told me :
As a raw material metal ( aluminum or zinc alloy ) is many times more expensive than the same volume of material in plastic .
In processing metal , parts need to be die cast , stamped , or ( if money is no object ) machined .
Then one needs to finish them with brushing , tumbling and / or bead blasting .
Lastly metal parts need to go through a plating or anodize process to prevent corrosion and oxidation over time .
All these finishing steps add considerable additional cost .
Painting plastic on the other hand can be inexpensively injection molded and painted silver in large volumes in a repeatable way .
Advertisement
Secondly , painting polymers to look metallic is insulting to plastic , which is n't hard and cold like metal , but has its own wonderful qualities and implications .
Like translucency , as shown in Zune 's cornershot multilayered finish and Samsung 's red - tinted LCD TV bezels .
And resiliency , flexibility , strength and lightness of weight .
Or if you like , some plastics can be heavy and stiff , since there are so many ways to make it .
Plastic can also insulate from heat and electricity , and when it 's really cold , plastic wo n't stick to your hand like a piece of metal does .
It can also be easily shaped into radical forms without having to be moved through an extensive finishing and forming process .
Those qualities are totally undersold when a machine 's plastic casing is passed off as being made from metal .
Leaving material qualities behind , I 'm sure there 's an aesthetic appeal here , too .
At least in the minds of tacky Vegas - brained marketers .
And maybe at first , the appeal works on those too stupid to catch the drift that they are being had .
But as anyone who 's owned a silver painted device knows , within months , if not weeks of heavy use , the thin veneer soon gives way to the gray / white / black plastic underneath .
Which would have been fine and beautiful in the first place , had it not been covered up .
Worn out silver colored plastic is uglier than the late Tammy Faye Bakker 's make - up job after a tearful sermon .
The Wii in white looks just as nice as it would in aluminum , to me .
And because the color is solid , it 'll look good no matter how often it gets scratched .

Eubanks says that companies should be " true to the material .
That means making plastic look like plastic , metal like metal and rubber like rubber .
Honesty with materials means you are being honest with your customers . "
I can agree with that .
And look forward to the day silver - painted gadgets are no longer made .
PHI Helicopter Crash Kills 8 in Louisiana ( Photos )
Eight people were killed after a PHI , Inc. helicopter crashed on Sunday in a marshy area of Terrebonne Parish , 100 miles southwest of New Orleans .
Coast Guard officerindicated there were nine people on board when the aircraft went down near Bayou Penchant at 3:30 p.m .
The chopper had just taken off from its operating base in Amelia and was taking a group to an offshore oil platform according to PHI Human Resources Director Richard Ravinelli .
The U.S. Air Force Rescue Coordination Center in Virginia picked up the initial distress call and alerted the New Orleans Coast Guard .
They launched a HH - 65C rescue helicopter to the scene of the accident .
The surviving passenger , 28 years old Steven Yelton of Texas , is listed in critical condition with severe head trauma .
He was initially airlifted to Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center in Houma , awaiting transfer to Oschner Medical Center .
PSI , Inc. is a helicopter services company that provides transportation to offshore oil and gas , onshore mining and medical and technical services industries .
They are independently owned .
Terrebonne Sheriff Vernon Burgeois has released the identify of seven of the victims .
They are Allen Boudreaux Jr , 23 , of Folsom , Jorey A. Rivero Sr. , 35 , of Westwego , pilot Thomas Ballenger , 63 , of Alabama , co-pilot Vyarl Wayne Martin , 46 , of Texas , Dynamic Industries employee Randy Tarpley , 53 , of Jonesville , La. , and MMR employee Charles Wilbur Nelson , 24 , of Pensacola , Fla .
Two additional employees from Dynamic have not been been named pending notification of their family members .
The cause of the crash has not been determined and is under investigation .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Zipf ’s law is a testament to the order in our world , showing that the same patterns emerge in a wide variety of situations .
The linguist George Kingsley Zipf first proposed the law in 1949 , when he noticed that the distribution of words in a newspaper , book , or other literary article always followed the same pattern .
Zipf counted how many times each word appeared , and found that the probability of the occurrence of words starts high and tapers off .
Specifically , the most frequent word occurs about twice as often as the second most frequent word , which occurs about twice as often as the fourth most frequent word , and so on .
Mathematically , this means that the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank .
When the Zipf curve is plotted on a log - log scale , it appears as a straight line with a slope of - 1 .
Since Zipf ’s discovery , researchers have found that the power law describes many other natural and human phenomena , including the distribution of cities ranked by their population , the distribution of corporate wealth , and Internet traffic characteristics .
When analyzing systems that follow Zipf ’s law , researchers usually assume certain mechanisms to be responsible for this patterned behavior .
However , no one has ever empirically demonstrated that these assumed mechanisms are indeed the origin of Zipf ’s law .
Now , a team of researchers from ETH Zürich ( the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich ) in Switzerland has confirmed that these assumed mechanisms – such as scale - free , proportional growth rates – are at the origin of Zipf ’s law .
The researchers used four orders of magnitude of data detailing the evolution of open source software applications created for a Linux operating system to confirm the assumption .
The team studied Debian Linux , a free operating system continuously being developed by more than 1,000 volunteers from around the world .
Developers create software packages , such as text editors or music players , that are added to the system .
Beginning with 474 packages in 1996 , Debian Linux has expanded to include more than 18,000 packages today .
The packages form an intricate network , with some packages having greater connectivity than others , as defined by how many other packages depend on a given package .
“ Open source offers a unique opportunity provided by the high completeness of data concerning open source ( thanks to the disclosure policy of the open source terms of license ) , ” lead author Thomas Maillart of ETH Zürich told PhysOrg.com .
“ Debian Linux allowed us to retrieve exhaustive information from several years ago .
Many other complex systems are not so well ‘ documented . ’ ”
As the researchers explain , the Linux network is constantly changing : new packages enter , some disappear , and others gain or lose connectivity .
Yet throughout the 12 years , the distribution of packages , as ranked by their number of incoming links from other packages , has followed Zipf ’s law , with a few very popular packages having much greater connectivity than most .
While many previous models of Zipf ’s law start with the assumption that the set of entities ( e.g. packages ) appeared at the same time , the Swiss researchers track the time evolution of package connectivity in the Linux network since 1996 .
This perspective enabled them to test for the presence of specific characteristics of the growth of the Linux network , which leads to the emergence of Zipf ’s law .
Using the data , they showed that the growth rates of connectivities between packages are proportional to the degree of connectivity between packages .
In addition , they showed empirically that the average growth rate of the total number of links to a given package over a time interval is proportional to that time interval .
Further , the variability of the total number of links to a given package increases proportionally to the square - root of time , providing a crucial test of the mechanism of stochastic proportional growth of connectivity between packages .
Altogether , these characteristics are responsible for the universal distribution pattern of Zipf ’s law .
“ We show that the distribution of connectivity of new entrants is also a power law with an exponent much bigger than 1 , confirming that the proportional growth mechanism is solely responsible for the Zipf 's law , ” Maillart said .
He explained that , while Linux data allowed the researchers to confirm the origins of Zipf ’s law , their results bring up more questions .
“ Linux Debian gave us the opportunity to verify the ‘ proportional mechanism , ’ thanks to an important dataset and a huge investigation potential , ” Maillart said .
“ All changes ( evolution ) in open source software are freely available and therefore can be tracked in detail .
However , model verification has brought one answer and many resulting questions we intend to give an answer to .
We think particularly of mechanisms of success / failure of projects in relation with their management .
“ Remember that we still do not clearly understand the reasons of the success of the open source , since it 's free and based on altruist contributions by programmers , ” he said .
“ Additionally , one can bet that further research in this direction ( open source and proportional growth ) may raise useful questions for other systems ( cities , economy , etc. ) that would bring new insights to explain their evolution . ”

The ‘ imgPreview ’ plugin allows your users to preview an image before clicking on it and , out of necessity , will preload the image so when a user does click through to it there is no waiting time !
The image preview shows up in a tooltip - like box appearing alongside the user ’s cursor when hovering over a link .
The plugin is entirely unobtrusive ; it does not require any hooks to target specific links ( no non-semantic classes ) ; it will automatically detect the anchors that are linking to images and will only apply the preview effect to them .
Options
Additionally , it allows for quite a high level of customisation , the following options are available : ( to see a demo , scroll down to the bottom of the post )
imgCSS – This setting must be an object .
The CSS specified within will be applied to the preview image .
So , if you wanted to limit all image previews to a width of 200 px you could do it like this : $ ( ' a ' ) .
imgPreview ( { imgCSS : { width : ' 200 px ' } } ) ;
– This setting must be an object .
The CSS specified within will be applied to the preview image .
So , if you wanted to limit all image previews to a width of 200 px you could do it like this : distance FromCursor – This setting must be an object .
Within it there must be a ‘ top ’ and ‘ left ’ property , both of which correspond to position of the preview in relation to the user ’s cursor .
By default the position is set to {top:10 , left:10} .
Be sure not to position the preview directly over the link as this will mess up the hover in / out effect ; an offset is required .

By default the position is set to .
Be sure not to position the preview directly over the link as this will mess up the hover in / out effect ; .
preloadImages –
This setting must be a Boolean value ( true / false ) .
This setting dictates whether or not the plugin will preload the images before the user hovers over any particular link .
This is recommended and is set to true by default – if you have a lot ( > 30 ) of links to images on a single page then it ’s advisable to disable this feature .

This is recommended and is set to true by default – if you have a lot ( > 30 ) of links to images on a single page then it ’s advisable to disable this feature .
Callback functions : on Show – The onShow setting must be a function .
It is a callback which will be run when the preview container appears .
Within the callback you have access to the preview ‘ container ’ via the this keyword and the hovered link via the first parameter .
onLoad – The onLoad setting must be a function .
It is a callback which will be run when the preview image has loaded .
It ’s different to on Show in that it will only run once the image has been loaded , not before .
Within the callback you have access to the preview image via the this keyword and the hovered link via the first parameter .
To get access to the container you could just do : $ ( this ) .
parent ( ) .
on Hide – The onHide setting must be a function .
It is a callback which will be run when the preview container disappears ( when a user stops hovering over a link ) .
Within the callback you have access to the preview ‘ container ’ via the this keyword and the hovered link via the first parameter .
containerID – This setting must be a String value and will determine the ID applied to the preview container .
This is not for the plugin ’s benefit ; its only purpose is to accomodate CSS styling ( within a stylesheet ) .

containerLoadingClass –
This setting must be a String value and will determine the class added to the preview container when an image is loading and will be removed when the image has finished loading .
If you ’ve enabled preloading of images then do n’t worry about this setting as it wo n’t have any effect .

If you ’ve enabled preloading of images then do n’t worry about this setting as it wo n’t have any effect .
thumbPrefix [ NEW in V0.13 ] –
This setting allows you to specify a thumbnail prefix for images .
So , if you have an anchor with an href of ‘ images / whatever.jpg ’ and you have set this setting to ‘ thumb_ ’ the preview - image will end up as ‘ images / thumb_whatever.jpg ’ .
– This setting allows you to specify a thumbnail prefix for images .
So , if you have an anchor with an href of ‘ images / whatever.jpg ’ and you have set this setting to ‘ thumb_ ’ the preview - image will end up as ‘ images / thumb_whatever.jpg ’.
srcAttr [ NEW in V0.2 ] –
This setting allows you to specify what attribute to retrieve the image SRC from .
So , if you have a link to a website and you want to show a screenshot of that website then you can store the location of the preview image in the ‘ rel ’ attribute of the anchor , leaving the ‘ href ’ untouched .
E.g. $ ( 'a' ).imgPreview({srcAttr : ' rel'} ) ; .
By default this setting is set to ‘ href ’ .
Along with this new option it is now possible to get an image preview when hovering over non-anchor elements – you must specify the right ‘ srcAttr ’ though .

Wayne Tippett has just two things of any real value left in his life : a 10 - year - old car and a granite tombstone .
At 51 , Tippett is broken , bankrupt and bunking in the guest room of his parents '
Burlington home after a divorce settlement that 's left him $ 75,000 in debt and racking up $ 1,000 more each month .
Today , he 'll appear in court at a default hearing to try to explain why he can't afford to pay his ex-wife ( the couple had no children ) $ 3,300 a month , $ 16,000 in retroactive alimony and $ 42,000 of her court costs out of a complex case he himself still does n't understand .
Even his ex-wife 's lawyer calls the situation " a total tragedy . "
And while he says Tippett " is paying for his own foolishness and stubbornness , " the settlement is , in many ways , a frightening example of bad timing , lack of adequate information , and a divorce court system that can be deadly unpredictable .
" You 're absolutely insane if you want to go into the ( divorce ) court system , " says London , Ont. , family law lawyer Peter Eberlie , who represented Tippett 's ex-wife Darlene Cormier , also 51 .
" Any court case is Russian roulette . "
A detailed Star examination of court transcripts , as well as interviews with both parties ' lawyers and some of Canada 's leading divorce lawyers , shows why family law lawyers have been pressing the Ontario government to devote more court resources " up front " to pre-trial case and settlement conferences aimed at helping warring couples reach a fair settlement quickly and without the ruinous legal fees of a lengthy court battle .
" I think most family law lawyers now regard going to court as a failure , of both them and their clients .
A failure to be reasonable , " says Philip Epstein , one of Canada 's most respected divorce lawyers .
Cormier refuses to discuss the case , other than to say she 's " struggling for survival , " and did n't expect to have to hire a lawyer and revisit an agreement on alimony payments the high school sweethearts had reached in 2003 – almost two years after their separation and 26 years together .
Every day that Tippett , a highly specialized Xerox technician , wakes up in the spare room he shares with three Cabbage Patch dolls and a teddy bear Mountie , he is falling further into a black hole .
Since last April , he has been on disability leave because of medical problems he says have been brought on by the stress of the case , which means his $ 90,000 a year in salary and commissions is now significantly less .
While Cormier is now getting just over $ 2,000 a month of his disability pay , technically Tippett is on the hook for $ 3,300 , so each month his arrears are climbing .
" I 've been given a life sentence and she 's been given a cash for life ticket , " says Tippett .
" I actually asked my lawyer at one point , ` Is n't there a human rights issue here ?
Do n't I have the human right to have a life after divorce ? ' "
In a desperate act to protect what little he says he has left , Tippett admits that he disregarded a judge 's order to make his ex-wife the beneficiary on an old insurance policy and used the $ 11,000 to pre-arrange his own funeral , buy a family headstone and have his name etched on it .
" Darlene wo n't bury me , and I do n't want my family to have to pay for that .
But I 'm afraid the FRO ( Family Responsibility Office ) will seize the stone . "
In fact , things might have turned out much differently had Tippett known that family law had undergone some dramatic changes in the time since his separation .
Had anyone simply pointed him to familylawcentre.com where he could do the math himself , Tippett might have realized he was at serious risk the minute he stepped into court .
Cormier and Tippett met in Grade 8 math class and by 16 had fallen love .
They both quit school in Grade 10 , although Tippett would later get a college diploma at night , and married in 1981 .
She was the love of his life .
" I believe in marriage , " he says , breaking down recalling how soothing it was to come home at night to hear the sound of Cormier 's flute wafting out the window of their home .
" I took my wedding vows word for word – till death do you part .
I thought I 'd take my last breath looking into her eyes . "
Cormier 's lawyer maintains Tippett was controlling and content to have his wife dabble at home - based craft and music businesses that never earned much money .
Tippett disagrees , saying he offered to help put her through school , pay for her to go overseas to study music , in hopes she could start earning a living .
None of that really matters now .
Under Canada's " no fault " divorce system it 's irrelevant who fell out of love first , or that Tippett voluntarily offered to move out and pay Cormier $ 2,145 a month to cover the mortgage and other expenses until they could work out a formal agreement .
By November 2003 , they had a deal for splitting assets and $ 2,300 a month in support , to be reviewed in three years .
Cormier would eventually buy a three - bedroom home kitty - corner to the matrimonial home and Tippett , with little left by the time debts were paid , rented rooms in hopes that the support would be reduced to , say , $ 1,400 , in three years .
" We were 42 when we separated .
I thought by 45 I would be starting all over again , that I 'd be able to get a little condo , that she'd be on her feet , " says Tippett .
" I had no intention of leaving her high and dry .
I knew I would always have to support her in some way . "
Tippett kept writing cheques for $ 2,300 , but the couple failed at every attempt to reach a deal .
He says he was " shocked " last January to find himself in the middle of a two - day trial , with his ex-wife citing a litany of health issues – from fibromyalgia to the circulatory problem Reynauds syndrome – that , her doctor testified , made it impossible for her to work full - time .
Even her 22 - hour a week job at an antique market was proving to be a hardship , Cormier testified , acknowledging that she took a quarter to a half an Advil a few times a week to deal with chronic pain .
What Tippett did n't realize is that since the couple 's 2003 agreement , a revolutionary set of " spousal support guidelines , " along with significant new case law , was now firmly taking hold in divorce settlements .

The guidelines – one aimed at childless couples , the other for those with children – were meant to bring some consistency and predictability to divorcing spouses , especially women emerging from " traditional " long - term relationships who were unlikely to find decent - paying jobs after years at home .
In fact , the guidelines added up to a sort of " 65 rule " – that if the partner 's age and years in the relationship equalled 65 or more , the main breadwinner would be paying " permanent support " the rest of his or her life .
" The view now about marriage is that ( both ) parties are entitled , to the extent possible , to enjoy the same lifestyle after a long - term marriage , " says Epstein , who sat on the committee that took five years to draft the guidelines .
" We operate on a system that , if you create economic dependency ( even if the wife is n't tied to the home caring for children ) , then you 're going to have to redress it . "
At the same time , judges were being much more aggressive in not just reviewing " time - limited " settlements but , in essence , going back to square one – looking at income , past support and setting new payments , as happened in Tippett 's case .
In fact , during last January 's court case , Cormier 's lawyer accused Tippett of getting " one heck of a deal " compared to the new guidelines .
Ontario Superior Court Justice Grant Campbell clearly agreed , not only boosting Tippett 's alimony payments by $ 1,000 a month in his ruling last March , but making them retroactive to November 2006 and ordering him to pay Cormier 's $ 42,000 court costs .
Facing massive legal bills of his own , Tippett filed for bankruptcy and it was only later , he says , he discovered he 's still on the hook , under bankruptcy laws , for any payments related to the divorce case .
That 's left Tippett in arrears that are growing monthly , on the default list of Ontario 's controversial Family Responsibility Office and facing seizure of his driver 's licence , his passport and , in time , a possible jail sentence .
Tippett says he knew " the whole world had flipped " the minute he left the courtroom last January .
" I was suicidal when I realized that I was going to lose .
All I could see was black .
I went home to my room and I cleaned things up .
I was going to kill myself .
No one knew what I was going through , " says Tippett .
Except his mother , who could see it on his face .
" Sometimes I still worry when he 's driving , " she says now .
" Wayne just spoiled Darlene to death , he loved her so much .
Now it 's ruined his life . "
Even Tippett 's Toronto lawyer , John Freeman , has been stunned at the turn of events .
" It 's always easy to say , ` This is what the law is , ' but up until that time ( the January alimony review ) the law was n't quite so clear .
The spousal support guidelines did not exist when the original ( 2003 ) agreement was drawn up so , to a certain extent , Wayne is being pilloried retroactively .
" I can't say that Wayne 's expectations ( of a reduction in alimony ) were unrealistic , " says Freeman .
" I thought he had a very good shot at reducing the amount .
I did n't see an increase was going to be coming , to be very frank .
Was it possible ?
Yes , but I did n't think that was a likely outcome . "
A report from the Productivity Commission shows more people die or are injured in Queensland hospitals than in any other state or territory .
The report shows there were 49 incidents that harmed or killed a patient in Queensland public hospitals in 2006 - 2007 , which is almost a quarter of the national total for that financial year .
There were 187 of these serious errors - referred to as " sentinel events " in health management - across Australia .
The state with the second highest number of such events was Victoria , with 45 , South Australia with 36 , New South Wales with 32 , Western Australia with 15 , the ACT with seven , the Northern Territory with two and Tasmania with one .
They range from operations on the wrong patient or body part , leaving surgical instruments inside the body , death in child birth and infants discharged to the wrong family .
" A high number of sentinel events may indicate hospital systems and process deficiencies that compromise the quality and safety of public hospitals , " the Productivity Commission said .
The report says there were 33 procedures in Queensland involving the wrong patient or body part compared to six the year before .
There were 29 in South Australia , 20 in Victoria , nine in New South Wales , six in Western Australia and one in Tasmania .
On 25 occasions across Australia people needed to have second operations to remove surgical instruments .
This occurred nine times in New South Wales , eight in Victoria , three Queensland and South Australia had three cases , and it happened twice in WA .
Of the 14 cases in which patients died after being given the wrong medication , six of them happened in Queensland ( five more than the previous year ) , followed by New South Wales ( three ) , Victoria ( three ) and WA ( two ) .
Queensland 's Opposition health spokesman Mark McArdle says the health system is still in crisis .
" Despite the billions of dollars poured into it by the Labor government what they 've provided is a death trap , " he said .
Four women died during childbirth in Queensland and one person fell seriously ill after an incompatible blood transfusion .
As well as the serious sentinel events , the report measured infection rates in four key procedures - hip replacement , knee reconstruction , lower segment caesarean section and abdominal hysterectomy .
Queensland had much lower rates of infection in the four procedures than the other states and territories .
The most common procedure was knee replacements , and the infection rate for this operation was 1.7 per cent in New South Wales , 1.5 per cent in Victoria , 0.4 per cent in Queensland and 0.6 per cent in Western Australia .
Opinion
Bush - Cheney deserve censure for declaring war against the Constitution
Before Inauguration Day , the 111th Congress should pass a forward - looking resolution censuring President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for executive aggrandizements or abuses that have reduced Congress to vassalage and shredded the rule of law .
The resolution should express a congressional intent to prevent repetitions by the President - elect Barack Obama or his successors .
The objective is not Bush - Cheney bashing , but to restore a republican form of government in which " We the People " are sovereign , and the president is checked and publicly scrutinized by Congress and the courts .
The Bush - Cheney duumvirate won an undeclared war against the Constitution .
Most troublesome , they captured the power to initiate war from a spineless Congress .
The Founding Fathers were unanimous in denying the president that constitutional authority .
They knew that presidents would chronically deceive Congress and concoct excuses for war to control public information , benefit political friends through government contracts , quell dissent , assert emergency powers and enjoy the intoxicating thrill of , " I came , I saw , I conquered . "
By wielding the threat of international terrorism , the Bush - Cheney team put the nation on a permanent war footing - the first time in history that war has been undertaken against a tactic .
They maintained that the entire post - 9/11 world is an active battlefield where United States military force may be used to kill suspected members of al Qaeda irrespective of international boundaries .
They claimed executive privilege and state secrets to conduct secret government - thereby circumventing political and legal accountability .
This included directives to former White House officials Karl Rove and Harriet Miers to flout congressional subpoenas for testimony .
They detained hundreds of people ( including American citizens ) as enemy combatants without accusation or trial .
They authorized torture ( waterboarding and extraordinary rendition ) , abductions , secret prisons and illegal surveillance of American citizens .
Like its immediate predecessors , the 110th Congress eagerly yielded its authorities - even the power of the purse - to the president .
The Iraqi War Resolution , the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Act , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments , and the declination to hold Rove in contempt of Congress were emblematic .
If left unrebuked , the Bush - Cheney usurpations of power will become part of the constitutional firmament and risk creating a safe harbor for future presidential abuses .
Every member of Congress , moreover , is required to take an oath to " support ( the ) Constitution " pursuant to Article VI .
There is no corresponding oath to support the Republican or Democratic parties or to subordinate the Constitution in the name of political harmony .
Censure would be no novelty .
The Senate voted to rebuke President Andrew Jackson for constitutional lawlessness in 1834 : " Resolved , That the President , in the late executive proceedings in relation to the public revenue , has assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the Constitution and laws , but in derogation of both . "
The censure resolution we contemplate would enumerate the serial Bush - Cheney constitutional violations ; and , censure them for complicity in wrecking the Constitution 's finely tuned balance of powers .
In two previous congressional sessions , Sen. Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , introduced censure resolutions against the president and vice president for deceiving Congress about the war in Iraq and warrantless spying on American citizens in contravention of FISA .
The resolution should also endorse a remedial legislative agenda that would be binding on all future presidents , including the president - elect .
It should include a criminal prohibition on intentional misrepresentations to Congress to obtain authorization for war ; or , the president 's initiation of war without an express congressional mandate .
The president 's withholding of information demanded by Congress should likewise be prohibited .
An independent prosecutor should be created to prosecute crimes allegedly perpetrated by high - level executive - branch officials in the course of executing presidential directives or defending presidential prerogatives .
FISA should be amended to restore individualized warrants based on probable cause to spy on Americans in order to gather foreign intelligence .
Censure will not , by itself , remedy the Bush - Cheney vandalizing of the Constitution .
But if members of Congress neglect even that modest step , our republic and democracy will have been irreparably harmed .
Gaza rocks Jordan
The fallout from the Gaza war and the intense Palestinian divisions is ricocheting around the Arab world — nowhere more than Jordan .
There have been several moments where the tensions seemed to be peaking .
At the end of December , for instance , King Abdullah shocked observers by removing Mohammed Dhahabi , his intelligence chief who had been pivotal in organizing an outreach to Hamas and Jordanian Islamists — and who is again at the center of controversy for allegedly criticizing Jordanian policy ( see below ) .
Another moment came a few days ago , when conservative and Islamist members of Parliament nearly came to blows .
Political tensions are running high .
American policy could make a real difference in either easing them or making them worse — and at least should take them into account as it reviews its regional strategy .
Political conditions in Jordan were tense long before Gaza , of course .
The economy is in disastrous shape , with unemployment running high and the middle class under tremendous pressure .
When I was in Jordan last spring I heard more open complaining about corruption at the highest levels than ever before .
The government had been clashing with the Muslim Brotherhood , until the recent thaw .
And the last Parliamentary elections had been deeply disappointing to most Jordanians and observers , with rampant complaints about electoral procedures and outcomes ( the Islamic Action Front was only the most prominent victim of seeming electoral fraud ) .
I mention this just for perspective — it ’s not like Gaza hit a serene , untroubled political environment .
That said , Gaza has inflamed at least four intersecting fault - lines .
First , Jordanian foreign policy .
King Abdullah has been walking a fine rhetorical line throughout the crisis .
He has chosen to stick with the U.S. - backed " moderate " camp — he sent his Foreign Minister to the Abu Dhabi meeting of " moderates " last week , and stayed away from the Doha " rejection " meeting .
But he has also tried to align his position with a mobilized Jordanian public opinion which largely supports the " rejection " camp , allowing an unusually large number of pro-Gaza demonstrations and calling repeatedly for an end to the fighting and for humanitarian relief .
For the most part , Jordanian politicians and pundits have praised the official position in public , as they must , but grumbling is increasing .
King Abdullah always lives in this grey zone , and wants to find an Arab consensus within which to hide .
The grey zone shrinks as lines sharpen , as they have in recent years with American backing .
No Arab leader would be more helped by a real Arab and Palestinian reconciliation — hence

Within a five - mile radius of London ’s Oxford Circus underground station there are 161 Starbucks outlets .
Talk about convenience , right ?
While living in New York ’s west village , I could stand on a certain corner and see four Starbucks at once — one in a Barnes & Noble , another across the street by a Staples , another up ahead in an NYU building and one more that ’s in a museum .
After a little angry investigation I found out this remarkable fact : they were all busy .
Somehow , people needed all four .
If you ’re ever in Seattle you can visit the original coffee shop near the city ’s famed Pike Place market .
Like many of the eclectic shops around there it ’s a really hip , cozy , bustling place — with its big bright glass windows , outdoor tables , and green - copper trim and worn , old school sign .
I can see why people like it .
In 1987 Howard Schultz took over the struggling 11 - store chain with the aim of spreading the brand to places not used to premium coffee .
Before he became CEO he called himself “ global strategist . ”
One of the original Starbucks founders , Gordon Bowker ( who also co-owns Pete ’s Coffee and Tea and Redhook Brewery ) said in a recent interview that as an avid reader he is more obsessed with the histories of the Roman Republic and Empire than business development .
As of 2006 Starbucks had spread their little coffee house to 13,168 locations across the world .
Like a seed taking root everywhere , Schultz and Co. took their tiny piece of old - time Seattle and put it in Kansas , Kuala Lumpur and Timbuktu and saw that people responded , big time .
Their goal — until the recent worldwide financial crisis — is to supplant McDonalds as earth ’s most ubiquitous brand in the next five years , opening eight stores a day till they have over 40,000 stores in every corner of the globe .
But what does that mean for us ?
What is happening to the soul of our towns ?
Do we care about what makes them unique ?
What makes New York New York and not Chicago or Tokyo or Buenos Aires ?
Is it the smell of roasted peanuts in Union Square ?
The boutiques in Soho , the hippies and the rats in Washington Square Park , the ferry fumes in Staten Island ?
What will keep New York from becoming what most of Main Street America has already coalesced into — a convenient but soulless series of interconnected malls ?
Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote a clever little piece on Sarah Palin ’s “ small town ” paradise of Wasilla that hits it on the head .
The scenery on the drive to Wasilla is stunning , with jagged snow - capped peaks and dense birch forests .
But if you travel this way , do not make the mistake of thinking you 're about to enter a quaint mountain village .
Some towns have character .
Some have a sense of place .
And then there is Wasilla , which greets visitors with Wal - Mart , Target , Lowe's , Kentucky Fried Chicken , Carl 's Jr. , McDonald 's and Taco Bell .
They paved paradise , and all they 've got to show for it is chalupas and discount tube socks .
He goes on :
I pulled into a strip mall parking lot , with a giant “ Congratulations Sarah ” sign on a storefront and asked a woman for help .
“ Ma'am , can you direct me to Main Street ? ”
“ This is Main Street , ” she said .
“ Well , where is the center of town ? ”
“ This is downtown Wasilla , ” she said .
I like pestering my grandparents about what their parents and grandparents did when they came to the U.S. Like many Americans , I come from a line of skilled foreigners who opened their own small businesses once they arrived : we had a Hungarian Kosher butcher shop , a haberdashery , a house painting business , a cigar shop , an Italian bar and restaurant , you name it .
It makes me wonder if they would have made it in these times when people can get meat , underwear , paint and beer at Wal - Mart in one fell swoop .
British think tank The New Economics Foundation ( NEF ) gave a name to the concerning chain phenomenon that ’s taking over our urban environments .
Its called The Clone Town .
As Jessica Williams describes in her book 50 Facts That Should Change The World , The Clone Town emerges when “ smaller commercial centers , among them many ancient market towns , have started to lose many of the features that made them representative of the areas they served . ”
The NEF documents that in Britain , between 1997 - 2002 , specialist stores like butchers , bakers and fishmongers were shutting up shop at a rate of 50 a week and 20 traditional pubs closed their doors .
In their place came mega supermarkets , and chain retail and franchise bars .
Williams writes , “ [ F ] or every 7 pounds of retail spending in the UK , 1 pound is spent in Tesco supermarkets . ”
That ’s enormous power .
With a workforce of over 1.2 million and annual profits in excess of $ 300 billion , Wal - Mart could have a standing army and a gross domestic product to rival many nations .
In many ways a city or a town is like a person — it has a history , a sound , a personality and look and feel all its own .
While New York retains some of Europe ’s vibrant cramped , crooked streets , sizzling street food and bohemian spontaneity in its many parks and squares , Chicago has a cleaner , open , and definitively more modern layout .
The wide grass prairie is still in its bones – the great lakes and the Mississippi river flows in its blood .
Thanks to the devastating fire of 1871 which leveled most of the wood - tenement downtown , local architects , community leaders and developers came together as the ashes were still smoldering to create a new kind of metropolis — a city of grids and steel , of glass and stone , of light and technology — with structures that stretched to the sky undaunted by wind and weather ; a glorious place that could withstand the claws of time .
With industrialization , immigration , migration and modernization came a renaissance in arts and sciences — atom bombs were conceived , dances created , and as the town went from farm backwater to meat - packing boomtown , Chicago got all those things that make a town itself : train systems , theaters , bowling alleys , colleges , libraries , prisons , diners , saloons , cafes , hotels , ghettos , castles , ballparks , roller rinks , factories , Vienna Beef , Morton Salt , Boeing Airplane , Wrigley Gum , the bikini - clad girls at North Ave Beach , the steaming corn vendors on Clark St. , everything that makes Chicago Chicago and nowhere else .
Having recently studied in Prague , I was disheartened to see the 16th century splendor of the royal castle and the cobbled Charles Bridge give way to a neon façade of Subways , Long John Silver ’s and Pizza Huts / Dunkin ’ Donuts / Baskin Robbins ’ three - headed monsters .
When I asked local Czechs about this development they just laughed it off : “ The iron curtain has indeed lifted with a vengeance , eh ? ”
I went to college in Ann Arbor , Michigan , a town that lives and grows around its young college population and has done an impressive job preserving its originality by instituting city ordinances against over - development and fast - food construction , saving various historic landmarks from the wrecking ball .
While places like the grungy and majestic Fleetwood Diner or Krazy Jim ’s Blimpy Burger stand out , the crown jewel of A2 is the Michigan Theater , a magnificent restored 1920s movie palace and concert hall with one of the last remaining Barton Pipe Organs still working in the country .
It ’s common knowledge that several times the theater was planned to be converted into a food court or a parking structure and if it were n’t for group of concerned Ann Arborites in 1979 , who started the Michigan Theater Foundation , it would no longer be there .
Unlike Ann Arbor , other towns with similar original historic landmarks are n’t as lucky .
When I return to my hometown of Evanston , IL , another college town , I am amazed to see how quickly it has changed just in my lifetime .
It was once a relatively sleepy and artsy suburb of Chicago , but walking up Sherman Ave. , one of the main drags , I am amazed to see 30 - floor condos rising up into the air — glittering Whole Foods Markets and Border ’s Books and Jamba Juices ensconced at their feet .
Traffic snarls .
A skyscraper is being planned for Fountain Square .
During one stretch on Sherman I did n’t see one store that was n’t a chain or a franchise .
Within the last few decades all the small theaters , including movie palaces The Varsity , art deco masterpieces like the Coronet , and vaudeville - era treasures like The Valencia have been removed or replaced by mixed retail .
A massive multiplex is Evanston ’s heart .
Classic venues that my father used to attend like The Amazing Grace Coffee House / Collective , which featured artists as diverse as the Grateful Dead , Charles Mingus and Muddy Waters , have been leveled and replaced with strangely faceless Soviet - era- looking apartment complexes .
While I have fond memories of the place , I feel little affection for the town now when I visit .
Why not embrace and preserve our history instead of decimating it and putting in one more food court with a Panda Express , Sbarro ’s or Wendy’s ?
Think about it .
Is this the bland world we want to leave to our children ?
Mr Wilson kept the otter safe and warm in his mailbag as they went on their tour of central Scotland
A postman who rescued a baby otter on a Scottish roadside took her on a 220 - mile tour in his mailbag .
Kenny Wilson , 50 , of Tweedbank , in the Borders , spotted the cub - named Orla - lying on the A7 near Stow on Sunday .
He stopped his car , popped her in his mailbag to keep her warm and then bought her kitten milk and fed her through the tube of a ballpoint pen .
He then took the otter with him on a Mini car enthusiasts ' rally before taking it to an animal rescue centre .
The six - week - old otter was said to be doing well at the Arthurshiel centre near St Boswells in Roxburghshire .
I popped her into the mailbag I had in the car and carried on up the A7 and just kept hearing little squeaks and sucking noises to imply she was hungry
Kenny Wilson Mr Wilson was travelling on the A7 road just north of Stow in the Borders in his 1999 Mini Cooper when he spotted Orla lying at the side of the road .
He explained : " She was frozen and I did not give her much of a chance to be honest .
" It looked as if she had either been abandoned or her mother had been hit by a car . "
Mr Wilson said the otter had come from the nearby Gala Water and " looked terrified from the noise of the cars and would soon have been hit " .
" I popped her into the mailbag I had in the car and carried on up the A7 and just kept hearing little squeaks and sucking noises to imply she was hungry , " he said .
" I stopped at Tesco at Dalkeith and bought some kitten milk and fed it through the tube of a ballpoint pen .
" She seemed happy enough and during our journey she kept crawling up my neck looking for more warmth . "
' Doing well '
Mr Wilson said everyone at the car rally was amazed when they saw the animal .
The pup was initially named Ozzie but when it was discovered it was female Mr Wilson 's wife , Jayne , came up with Orla .
Orla the otter has settled in well at the rescue centre
The postman added : " Orla seemed to enjoy her 220 - mile round trip round the Trossachs and when we got home we fed her some crushed chicken and put her in our cat Ebony 's basket as she decided to go out for the night .
" Not many otters have been on a tour of central Scotland .
" The next day we contacted Arthurshiel and took her over there where she seems to be doing well . "
Shona Middlemas of the rescue centre said the brown European otter was being fed and kept warm .
" We are hand - rearing her just now and she stayed last night in the warmth of our living room , " she said .
" I have been taking advice from people on the best way to look after her .
" Kenny did a good job because it sounds as if she would not have survived . "
However , she said the rescue had not come without expense .
" At the moment we are feeding her fish every two hours and she has got some appetite , " she explained .
" She is going through about £ 15 worth of salmon each day . "

The vast majority of apps downloaded from the App Store are in use by less than 5 % of users after one month has passed since the download , according to an analytics firm that is also shedding light on other aspects of the business .
The data was collected from more than 30 million app downloads Pinch Media has been tracking as part of its analytics services .
Included in chief executive Greg Yardley 's presentation ( embedded below ) at the New York iPhone Developers Meetup were several revealing conclusions about how users interact with their downloaded apps .
Just 20 % of users even return to run a free application again the day after it 's downloaded .
As time goes on , that decline continues , eventually settling below five percent at the one month elapsed mark and nearing zero after three months .
Paid applications showed a similar decrease , indicating that developers have just a short time to capture the user 's attention .
Yardley also took on a question developers often face : whether to charge for an app or use a free , ad - supported model .
He noted that paid apps are used slightly more than free ones and for slightly longer periods .
In his findings , very few apps can succeed with ad support .
The number of views just is n't there .
Assuming free apps are run a dozen times by each user , and that those free apps are run about 6.6 times more often in total than paid apps , Yardley showed that " the typical application would have to bombard its users with ads to beat the money it'd make from paid sales . "
Specifically , the average free app would need to earn $ 8.75 CPM ( an advertising term that means cost per thousand ) in order to equal revenues that paid apps receive on average , but the market is currently standing in a range of 50 cents to two dollars CPM .
Thus , Yardley concludes , only a few high - performing applications , representing less than 5 % of the market , can maximize earnings with advertising .
" In other words , unless there 's something inherent about the app that screams free , sell it , " he said .
Category matters , too : games are used for longer periods than any other genre .
Pinch Media found the long - term audience for the average app is just 1 % of the total number of downloads .
Sports apps retain users a little better over the short term , and entertainment offerings retain best over the long term .
Finally , the company estimates a free app needs 5,000 downloads in a 24 - hour period to make the App Store 's Top 100 list or 20,000 in the same period to place on the Top 25 .
Compared to six months ago , when there were fewer competitors , the threshold needed for the Top 25 has doubled .
Meanwhile , the Top 100 minimum barrier for entry has increased by a whopping five times .
While the price of beer has been stable and is likely to remain so , the perceived purchasing power of Germans is decreasing as the country enters the worst economic climate since the Second World War .

Thursday , January 29 , 2009 [ Following is the transcript of President Barack Obama 's first White House TV interview on Jan. 26 with Hisham Melhem , Washington bureau chief of Al Arabiya television , the Dubai - based , Saudi - owned international news network .
Melhem told CNN's Wolf Blitzer of " The Situation Room " that his network was chosen after Melhem mentioned that his daughter was , in fact , a campaign volunteer for Obama last year .
Melhem said he found Obama had " a sharp analytical mind " and " a very sophisticated understanding of the world . " ]
Q : Mr. President , thank you for this opportunity .
We really appreciate it .
THE PRESIDENT : Thank you so much .
Q : Sir , you just met with your personal envoy to the Middle East , Sen. Mitchell .
Obviously , his first task is to consolidate the cease - fire .
But beyond that you 've been saying that you want to pursue actively and aggressively peacemaking between the Palestinians and the Israelis .
Tell us a little bit about how do you see your personal role , because , you know , if the president of the United States is not involved , nothing happens — as the history of peacemaking shows .
Also In This Edition Amazon.com Widgets
Will you be proposing ideas , pitching proposals , parameters , as one of your predecessors did ?
Or just urging the parties to come up with their own resolutions , as your immediate predecessor did ?
Will you be proposing ideas , pitching proposals , parameters , as one of your predecessors did ?
Or just urging the parties to come up with their own resolutions , as your immediate predecessor did ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away .
And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature .
He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals .
And so what I told him is start by listening , because all too often the United States starts by dictating — in the past on some of these issues — and we do n't always know all the factors that are involved .
So let 's listen .
He 's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved .
And he will then report back to me .
From there we will formulate a specific response .
Ultimately , we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what 's best for them .
They 're going ...
Then Senator Barack Obama during a visit to Jordan in the summer of 2008 ... to have to make some decisions .
But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people .
And that instead , it 's time to return to the negotiating table .
And it 's going to be difficult , it 's going to take time .
I do n't want to prejudge many of these issues , and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months .
But if we start the steady progress on these issues , I 'm absolutely confident that the United States — working in tandem with the European Union , with Russia , with all the Arab states in the region — I 'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress .
Q : You 've been saying essentially that we should not look at these issues — like the Palestinian - Israeli track and separation from the border region — you 've been talking about a kind of holistic approach to the region .
Are we expecting a different paradigm in the sense that in the past one of the critiques — at least from the Arab side , the Muslim side — is that everything the Americans always tested with the Israelis , if it works .
Now there is an Arab peace plan , there is a regional aspect to it .
And you 've indicated that .
Would there be any shift , a paradigm shift ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , here 's what I think is important .
Look at the proposal that was put forth by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia .
Q : Right .
THE PRESIDENT : I might not agree with every aspect of the proposal , but it took great courage ... Q : Absolutely .
THE PRESIDENT : ... to put forward something that is as significant as that .
I think that there are ideas across the region of how we might pursue peace .
I do think that it is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what 's happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan .
These things are interrelated .
And what I 've said , and I think Hillary Clinton has expressed this in her confirmation , is that if we are looking at the region as a whole and communicating a message to the Arab world and the Muslim world , that we are ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest , then I think that we can make significant progress .
Now , Israel is a strong ally of the United States .
They will not stop being a strong ally of the United States .
And I will continue to believe that Israel 's security is paramount .
But I also believe that there are Israelis who recognize that it is important to achieve peace .
They will be willing to make sacrifices if the time is appropriate and if there is serious partnership on the other side .
And so what we want to do is to listen , set aside some of the preconceptions that have existed and have built up over the last several years .
And I think if we do that , then there 's a possibility at least of achieving some breakthroughs .
Q : I want to ask you about the broader Muslim world , but let me — one final thing about the Palestinian - Israeli theater .
There are many Palestinians and Israelis who are very frustrated now with the current conditions and they are losing hope , they are disillusioned , and they believe that time is running out on the two - state solution because — mainly because of the settlement activities in Palestinian - occupied territories .
Will it still be possible to see a Palestinian state — and you know the contours of it — within the first Obama administration ?
THE PRESIDENT : I think it is possible for us to see a Palestinian state —
I 'm not going to put a time frame on it — that is contiguous , that allows freedom of movement for its people , that allows for trade with other countries , that allows the creation of businesses and commerce so that people have a better life .
And , look , I think anybody who has studied the region recognizes that the situation for the ordinary Palestinian in many cases has not improved .
And the bottom line in all these talks and all these conversations is , is a child in the Palestinian territories going to be better off ?
Do they have a future for themselves ?
And is the child in Israel going to feel confident about his or her safety and security ?
And if we can keep our focus on making their lives better and look forward , and not simply think about all the conflicts and tragedies of the past , then I think that we have an opportunity to make real progress .
President Barack Obama and Al Arabiya Washington Bureau Chief Hisham Melhem 1-26-09
But it is not going to be easy , and that 's why we 've got George Mitchell going there .
This is somebody with extraordinary patience as well as extraordinary skill , and that 's what 's going to be necessary .
Q : Absolutely .
Let me take a broader look at the whole region .
You are planning to address the Muslim world in your first 100 days from a Muslim capital .
And everybody is speculating about the capital .
( Laughter . )
If you have anything further , that would be great .
How concerned are you — because , let me tell you , honestly , when I see certain things about America — in some parts , I do n't want to exaggerate — there is a demonization of America .
THE PRESIDENT : Absolutely .
Q : It 's become like a new religion , and like a new religion it has new converts — like a new religion has its own high priests .
THE PRESIDENT : Right .
Q : It 's only a religious text .
THE PRESIDENT : Right .
Q : And in the last , since 9/11 and because of Iraq , that alienation is wider between the Americans and in generations past , the United States was held high .
It was the only Western power with no colonial legacy .
THE PRESIDENT : Right .
Q : How concerned are you and — because people sense that you have a different political discourse .
And I think , judging by ( inaudible ) and Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden and all these , you know — a chorus .
THE PRESIDENT : Yes , I noticed this .
They seem nervous .
Q : They seem very nervous , exactly .
Now , tell me why they should be more nervous ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , I think that when you look at the rhetoric that they 've been using against me before I even took office ... Q : I know , I know .
THE PRESIDENT : ... what that tells me is that their ideas are bankrupt .
There 's no actions that they 've taken that say a child in the Muslim world is getting a better education because of them , or has better healthcare because of them .
In my inauguration speech , I spoke about :
You will be judged on what you 've built , not what you 've destroyed .
And what they 've been doing is destroying things .
And over time , I think the Muslim world has recognized that that path is leading no place , except more death and destruction .
Now , my job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well - being of the Muslim world , that the language we use has to be a language of respect .
I have Muslim members of my family .
I have lived in Muslim countries .
Q : The largest one .
THE PRESIDENT : The largest one , Indonesia .
And so what I want to communicate is the fact that in all my travels throughout the Muslim world , what I 've come to understand is that regardless of your faith — and America is a country of Muslims , Jews , Christians , non-believers — regardless of your faith , people all have certain common hopes and common dreams .
And my job is to communicate to the American people that the Muslim world is filled with extraordinary people who simply want to live their lives and see their children live better lives .
My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy .
We sometimes make mistakes .
We have not been perfect .
But if you look at the track record , as you say , America was not born as a colonial power , and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago , there 's no reason why we can't restore that .
And that I think is going to be an important task .
But ultimately , people are going to judge me not by my words but by my actions and my administration 's actions .
And I think that what you will see over the next several years is that I 'm not going to agree with everything that some Muslim leader may say , or what 's on a television station in the Arab world — but I think that what you 'll see is somebody who is listening , who is respectful , and who is trying to promote the interests not just of the United States but also ordinary people who right now are suffering from poverty and a lack of opportunity .
I want to make sure that I 'm speaking to them , as well .
Q : Tell me , time is running out , any decision on from where you will be visiting the Muslim world ?
Then Senator Barack Obama and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the summer of 2008 THE PRESIDENT : Well , I 'm not going to break the news right here .
Q : Afghanistan ?
THE PRESIDENT : But maybe next time .
But it is something that is going to be important .
I want people to recognize , though , that we are going to be making a series of initiatives .
Sending George Mitchell to the Middle East is fulfilling my campaign promise that we 're not going to wait until the end of my administration to deal with Palestinian and Israeli peace .
We 're going to start now .
It may take a long time to do , but we 're going to do it now .
We 're going to follow through on our commitment for me to address the Muslim world from a Muslim capital .
We are going to follow through on many of my commitments to do a more effective job of reaching out , listening , as well as speaking to the Muslim world .
And you 're going to see me following through with dealing with a drawdown of troops in Iraq , so that Iraqis can start taking more responsibility .
And finally , I think you 've already seen a commitment , in terms of closing Guantanamo , and making clear that even as we are decisive in going after terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians , that we 're going to do so on our terms , and we 're going to do so respecting the rule of law that I think makes America great .
Q : President Bush framed the war on terror conceptually in a way that was very broad , " war on terror , " and used sometimes certain terminology that the many people — Islamic fascism .
You 've always framed it in a different way , specifically against one group called Al Qaeda and their collaborators .
And is this one way of ...
THE PRESIDENT : I think that you 're making a very important point .
And that is that the language we use matters .
And what we need to understand is , is that there are extremist organizations — whether Muslim or any other faith in the past — that will use faith as a justification for violence .
Then Senator Barack Obama prays at the Western Wall during a visit in the summer of 2008
We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith 's name .
And so you will , I think , see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like Al Qaeda — that espouse violence , espouse terror and act on it — and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions , or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop .
We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful .
I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians , and we will hunt them down .
But to the broader Muslim world , what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship .
Q : Can I end with a question on Iran and Iraq then quickly ?
THE PRESIDENT : It 's up to the team .
MR .
GIBBS : You have 30 seconds .
( Laughter . )
Q : Will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran ?
And if not , how far are you going in the direction of preventing it ?
THE PRESIDENT : You know , I said during the campaign that it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of U.S. power , including diplomacy , in our relationship with Iran .
Now , the Iranian people are a great people , and Persian civilization is a great civilization .
Iran has acted in ways that 's not conducive to peace and prosperity in the region : their threats against Israel ; their pursuit of a nuclear weapon , which could potentially set off an arms race in the region that would make everybody less safe ; their support of terrorist organizations in the past — none of these things have been helpful .
But I do think that it is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran , to express very clearly where our differences are but where there are potential avenues for progress .
And we will over the next several months be laying out our general framework and approach .
And as I said during my inauguration speech , if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist , they will find an extended hand from us .
Q : Shall we leave Iraq next interview , or just — MR .
GIBBS : Yes , let 's — we 're past , and I got to get him back to dinner with his wife .
Q : Sir , I really appreciate it .
THE PRESIDENT : Thank you so much .
Q : Thanks a lot .
THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate it .
Q : Thank you .
THE PRESIDENT : Thank you .

The Top Ten Reasons Why Cybersex is Good for You
Yes , you , red- blooded , non-perverted American citizen .
Cybersex wants you .
Bonnie Ruberg
When I tell people I write about cybersex , I get a lot of curious reactions .
I�ve grown used to , for example , the � Oh my God , you �re secretly a pervert� grimace : a sour , prudish twisting of the mouth .
I�m also well - acquainted with the � You actually have sex on the internet ?!� look of shock and concern�raised eyebrows , dropped jaw .
And then there�s the most curious reaction of all : the understanding , almost sympathetic nod , which says , � It must be tough , but good for you .
After all , somebody has got to uncover that den of online perversion . �
Rarely do people �even sex positive people �respond cybersex positively .
Why is that ?
When so many consenting adults are having sex online , why do we still think of it as �wrong� ?
Sure , we can blame media that feeds us anti-cybersex sensationalism ( To Catch a Predator , with its line - up of internet prowling pedophiles , come to mind ) .
But the truth is we love sex , and we definitely love technology .
So why can�t we love the two together ?
I was shocked to receive a recent email from a Click Me reader that asked , � Are there any benefits to cybersex ? �
Like , seriously ?
Maybe I haven�t been making myself clear : of course there are benefits to cybersex !
Cybersex , like real - life sex , can be a wonderful thing �full of pleasure , skill , and sexual self - expression .
Here are the top ten reasons you�yes , you , red- blooded , non-perverted American citizen �should be out doing it right now .
1. Safety : Despite the sensationalist buzz around internet predators , cybersex is actually a lot safer than sex in real life .
Don�t give out personal information to strangers , of course , and you�ll find the only thing you have worry about is what turns you on �not STD�s , not unwanted pregnancy , not even how to find a babysitter .
As one single mom put it , � Why endanger my kids by bringing home sexual partners if I can tuck them into bed and have fun online in the next room ? �
2. Convenient sex for singles : Cybersex doesn�t require an empty house , a hotel room , or even a bed .
More importantly , it doesn�t require the lengthy tactics of face - to - face seduction .
Whether you �re looking for a quick romp before you head off to work �hard to come by if you live alone �or an end - of - the - night , on - demand orgasm , the internet and its wealth of cybersex enthusiasts is always waiting and ready .
3. Convenient sex for couples :
He lives in California .
She�s spending three weeks visiting family in the Philippines .
How will this couple handle their time apart ?
By having regular webcam sex , of course !
Being long - distance doesn�t mean you have to be sexually frustrated .
In fact , it can be a great time to explore sexy new sides to a relationship �with the help of a little technology .
4 . Trying new kinks :
Because cybersex is n�t �real , � it gives people a chance to experiment with sex acts and fetishes they haven�t , wouldn�t , or couldn�t in real life .
Think you have a thing for stockings ?
Want to practice switching genders ?
Does the idea of being a giant whale really turn you on , but you can�t figure out the logistics ?
Internet sex communities are often accepting and almost always anonymous .
Who�s going to judge you ?
5 . Meeting new people : Having cybersex with someone you�ve just met may seem strange , but it can actually lead to lasting online friendships .
Hook up with a hottie in a virtual world and you may find yourself chatting about indie rock and ice cream preferences for hours after the sex is over .
There�s also the appeal of the virtual one - night stand : a new lover every night , from the comfort of a desk chair .
6 . Exercising your creative muscle : Cybersex is an art .
How often do you get to write like an erotic novelist and dream up new ways to describe that tired , old �throbbing member� ?
Alternately , take pride in your digital - camera skills .
You �re a real pornography photographer when you snap those naked pictures and post them online .
Own up !
7 . Making money : Sure , there are stigmas around using your body for cash .
But combine the safety , creativity , and convenience of cybersex , and you�ve got a great recipe for online sex work .
From escorting in Second Life to performing on webcams , the possibilities abound for internet users who feel comfortable putting themselves out there online �and earning something back in exchange .
8. Gaining confidence : Don�t think you �re a sexy person ?
You �re wrong .
Someone out there on the world wide web shares your sexual interests �and thinks you �re hot .
Start chatting ; buy yourself a webcam .
With enough cyberers wrapped around your sexy , virtual finger , you might just look in the real - life mirror a whole new way .
9 . Practicing for � the real thing� :
Talking dirty in real - life bed can be hard �not because it�s actually difficult , but because it comes with a lot of pressure .
� What if I sound stupid ?
What if he doesn�t think it�s sexy ? �
Enter text - based cybersex .
Thanks to the anonymity of the internet , it�s easy to get feedback on dirty talk �and to get used to hearing it coming out of your fingertips , if not your mouth .
10 .
The sheer pleasure : Cybersex is sexy , and it feels good .
So go on , have some already !

It seems Hollywood just can’t help itself from remaking old classic films .
And new classics .
And movies that came out five years ago that were n’t that great to start with .
I guess there are just no good ideas left .
So it should really come as no surprise that the amazing Wolfgang Peterson fantasy film The Neverending Story is getting remade .
This was a childhood favorite of mine .
And they do n’t make them like they used to …which is dark and messed up and scary and visually lush with depth and shadows .
Well , I ’ve heard Coraline is kinda like that .
Anyway , Kennedy / Marshall and Appian Way are in talks with Warner to make the movie .
Sigh .
But there is one more piece of sadness to cross my desk this morning .
It seems Neal H. Moritz ’s Original Films is working with Columbia to remake the immortal classic Total Recall .
Rumor has it he wants to update it to a more contemporary setting and use hi-tech computer effects .
I ’m shocked .
How original .
But really , WHAT ?!?!?
I mean , there can only be one Quaid , right ???
Well , two if you count that Schwarzenegger guy from the original .
Part 0 : For the Undecided ( Linux Benefits )
Contents of this section :
0.1 Fundamentally , why Linux ?
0.2 Is Linux for me ?
0.3 Linux is difficult for newbies .
0.4
What are the benefits of Linux ?
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#TheGNUsystem
To get a flavour for the value of Linux , here are some prices for commercial software as listed at www.amazon.com.
All prices are in $ USA , as listed on 2001 - 02 - 03 , with discounts .
Roughly equivalent Linux software is included on almost any Linux CD ( but with no restrictions on the number of clients ) .
In addition , the hardware for Linux is MUCH cheaper , since Linux can run all services on a single server : Microsoft Windows 2000 Server ( 5 - client ) --$ 848.99 ; Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server ( 5 - client ) - -$ 1,279.99 ; Microsoft Outlook 2000 ( 1 - client ) --$ 94.99 ; Systems Management Server 2.0 ( 10 - Cals ) --$ 994.99 ; Proxy Server 2.0--$ 886.99 ; Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Standard Edition ( 5 - client ) - -$ 1,229.99 ; Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Standard Edition ( 1-user License ) --$ 4,443.99 ; Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server 4.5 NT ( Add - On 5 - CAL ) --$ 264.99 ; Windows NT Server Prod Upgrade From BackOffice SBS Small Bus Server ( 25 - client ) --$ 558.99 ; Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server Upgrade ( 25 - client ) --$ 3,121.99 ; Microsoft FrontPage 2000 --$ 129.99 ; Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server --$ 664.99 ; Site Server Commerce 3.0 ( 25 - client ) --$ 4,092.99 ; Visual C++ 6.0 Professional Edition with Plus Pack --$ 525.99 ; Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise 6.0 with Plus Pack --$ 1,128.99 ; Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe 6.0 CD --$ 469.99 ; Microsoft Office 2000 Standard ( 1 - client ) --$ 384.99 ; Adobe Photoshop 6.0--$ 551.99 ; Microsoft Plus Game Pack --$ 19.99 .
0.5 What are the differences between Linux and UNIX ?
Command - line - wise , almost none , although this has been changing ( for better or worse ) .
Linux has a much larger market appeal and following than any commercial UNIX .
GUI - wise there are also no major differences -- Linux , as most other UNICES , uses an X - Windowing system .
The major differences :
- Linux is free , while many UNICES ( this is supposed to be plural of UNIX ) , cost A LOT .
The same for applications -- many good applications are available on Linux free .
Even the same commercial application ( if you wanted to buy one ) typically costs much more for a commercial UNIX than for Linux .
- Linux runs on many hardware platforms , the commodity Intel - x86 / IBM - spec personal computers being the most prominent .
A typical UNIX is proprietary - hardware - bonded ( and this hardware tends to be much more expensive than a typical PC clone ) .
- With Linux , you are in charge of your computer , whereas on most UNICES you are typically confined to be an " l- user " ( some administrators pronounce it " loser " ) .
- Linux feels very much like DOS / Win in the late 80s/90s , but is much sturdier and much richer , while a typical UNIX account feels like a mainframe from the 60s /70s .
- Some UNICES may be more mature in certain areas ( for example , security , some engineering applications , better support of cutting - edge hardware ) .
Linux is more for the average Joe who wants to run his own server or engineering workstation .
0.6 What are the differences between Linux and MS Windows ?
The major differences :
- Linux is free , while MS Windows costs money .
Same for applications .
- Linux file formats are free , so you can access them in a variety of ways .
On MS Windows , the common practice it to make you lock your own data in secret formats that can only be accessed with tools leased to you at the vendor 's price .
How corrupt ( or incompetent ? ) must the politicians who lock our public records into these formats be !
" What we will get with Microsoft is a three - year lease on a health record we need to keep for 100 years " [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_1694000/1694372.stm].
- With Linux , you are unlikely to violate any licence agreement -- all the software is happily yours .
With MS
Windows you likely already violate all kinds of licenses and you could be pronounced a computer pirate if only a smart lawyer was after you ( do n't worry , most likely none is after you ) .
- MS Windows tries to be the " lowest - common - denominator " operating system ( for better or worse ) , whereas Linux is built for more sophisticated , feature - hungry computer users ( for better or worse ) .
- MS Windows is based on DOS , Linux is based on UNIX .
MS Windows Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) is based on Microsoft - own marketing - driven specifications .
Linux GUI is based on industry - standard network - transparent X - Windows .
- Linux beats
Windows hands down on network features , as a development platform , in data processing capabilities , and as a scientific workstation .
MS Windows desktop has a more polished appearance , smoother general business applications , and many more games for kids ( these are not better games though - - Linux games tend to be more sophisticated ) .
- Linux is more feature - rich than you could imagine .
Heard on the Internet : " Two big products came from the University of California : UNIX and LSD .
And I do n't think it 's a coincidence . "
0.7 I do n't believe in free software , etc .
Here is the opinion of an IBM executive : " The reason we are so excited about Linux is we believe Linux can do for applications what the Internet did for networks " ( http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-08-17-001-04-PS-EL). IBM just ( May 2002 ) spent 1 billion dollars making Linux run on all their hardware platforms ( mainframes , workstations , PCs , laptops ) .
0.8 " There ai n't no such thing as a free lunch "
0.9 I need high security .
With commercial software , I can sue them if things go wrong .
0.10 I need standards .
Big software corporations ( Microsoft ) provide standards .
" We need standardized , open file formats so that users can exchange documents between platforms .
The actual word processing software used to generate these documents should n't even be an issue . "
( Ted Clark , http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-09-29-004-06-OP-MR-0010).
Linux , by its very nature , is based on true , published and free standards because " open source " makes the full specifications available to everybody ( competitors or not ) .
I believe that the urge for open standards is the very driving force behind Linux .
Some people feel that they cannot afford to trust their algorithms and data to a commercial entity , let alone one that repeatedly demonstrated it is untrustworthy .
Have a look at a draft of this Argentinean law for a taste of the future .
It sounds like the Argentineans may be the first to decide that their public records cannot be held hostage by a commercial entity : ( source : http://slashdot.org/articles/01/04/28/010216.shtml): " ... Public National Organizations mentioned in article 1 of this law , will not be allowed to use programs that store data in non-public format ... " .
Several other counteries are contempleting or enacting legistlations requiring storage of data in public file formats .
There is a strong perception in the Linux community that there is a serious problem with the computing " standards " championed by large software vendors .
This includes their standards for our " static " data , as well as the knowledge embedded in our computer codes .
Can we afford to have somebody decide for us when , how , and at what cost we can access our work ?
This problem is ignored and even aggravated by people who are paid to take care of it .
Linux is a grass - root answer .
0.11 I Need MS Windows for Reading Writing MS Word Documents
In a large corporate environement , you may have little choice -- they locked themselves by cheerful productions of non-portable forms , templates , visual basic - driven web pages and other " tools " .
In a smaller environment , you can use OpenOffice.org suit ( OO ) that runs on Linux , Windows , Mac , Solaris , with full file - level compatiblity .
It can be downloaded and installed for free ( no restrictions whatsoever ) so nobody should really complain about the file format ( some control freaks still will ) .
Just to make sure , it can import and export MS Word and Excel documents of reasonable complexity very well .
However , its native file format is fundamentally much better ( and non-propriatory ) .
Feature - by - feature , it can do almost anything MS Office can , plus some extras .
Depending on whom you ask , the ease of use veries between " 50 % more difficult " to " 20 % easier " ( measured on experienced MS Office users ) .
Very complex documents are best transferes as pdf , and OO can make them on the fly .
So , probably you do not need MS Office any more .
Download your OO for MS Windows and Linux at : http://www.openoffice.org/
0.12 MS Windows popularity insures that it is " here to stay " .
Linux is quite positively here - to - stay because of its open - source nature ( Linux cannot possibly be put out - of - business ) .
It is a standard selected for countless projects that are not going to go away , and some of them are quite " mission - critical . "
Try the International Space Station , for which Linux is the operating system ( http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue59/3024.html ) .
Plus , never underestimate the strength of the Linux community .
Linux is " here to stay " at least for the computer avant - garde .
Many Linuxers do not even want Linux to become very popular because they fear it could " dumb down " the elite Linux platform .
0.13 But LINUX may fork into many different systems ...
" Forking " in this context means " branching a computer program , " so as to create parallel " subversions " of the program , and consequently fragment Linux .
There is very little ( if any ) evidence of harmful forking of any software included with a typical Linux distribution .
Where forking did occur , it has always turned beneficial .
Quite possibly , this is because although there are no artificial barriers to fork software under Linux , there are also no artificial barriers to merge the best pieces back .
The theoretical background on how forking software can be good for its development might have been actually given quite some time ago by the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ( 1770 - 1831 ) , with his concept of dialectic development .
E.g. , in " Phenomenology of Spirit " , Hegel concludes : " ... the schism incipient in a party , which seems a misfortune , expresses its fortune rather . "
0.14 Linux is a cult
Face it , you salespeople pretending to be journalists .
There is hardly any integrity left in the computing press .
How many words on Linux did your PC Magazine ( or whatever ) publish by 1999 - 01 - 01 ?
Was n't Linux at least an interesting technology by that time ?
It surely was , yet you conspired to keep your readership in the dark , selling your journalistic integrity for money .
And now , after Linux has surfaced in the mainstream ( non-computer ) media , you keep writing misleading articles about it saying " yah , but it will / cannot / may .... " whatever ( trying the " fear , uncertainty and doubt " tactics to kill it ) .
And adding " Microsoft is already ... " , continuing to write about the vaporware and the future paradise in the face of the increasingly stealthy , unstable , pricey , architecturally unsound computer platform , whose greatest achievement has been exhorting unheard - of - before money by denying inter-operatibility , and killing any existing or proposed standard ( by " embracing " and then proprietary - extending it ) .
Whom do you serve ?
Surely not your readers .
I worded it as strongly as I could .
Am I a zealot ?
Or am I just trying to voice my disapproval for the self - serving actions of the computer " powers - that - be " ?
You think " self - serving " is ok in business ?
How pathetic must your business be !
I always thought that business was a social contract in which we exchange good values , for a mutual benefit .
As I read history , societies use to hang / guillotine / electrocute those members who really persisted in their self - serving business .
Well , times have changed .
A bit for the better , a bit for the worse :) ) )
0.15 The total cost of ownership ( TCO ) of Linux is high
Let me try a simple estimate of how much the average total cost of the ownership of MS Windows is .
Let 's add the fortunes accumulated by all the MS Windows software makers .
Add all the salaries of all generic Windows programmers , consultants , support and training personnel , IT management , etc .
Now , add the losses customers must surely have suffered while the software corporations were presenting them with " features " so as to achieve their current monopolistic status .
Divide this figure by the number of years ( whatever timeframe you selected ) , and the number of MS Windows users ( only in the countries in which software is normally paid for ) .
Here is the TCO of MS Windows .
However you count it , it will be many thousands of good US dollars per average joe per year .
You did n't pay that much money ?
Well , you must have , it has just been hidden from you .
Yes , developed countries waste billions every year on software .
How much did Linux cost ?
Hardly anything .
The number of users is much lower , too , but you will be hard pressed to come up with $ 10 per user per year .
Yet , in my opinion , the total cost is not what matters the most .
What value did I receive for my money ?
You would have to calculate the total value of ownership ( TVO ? ) , then subtract from it the total cost of ownership ( TCO ) to obtain the " net benefit of the ownership . "
I guess accountants only talk about the TCO for software " necessary for doing business , " and thus skip the issue of value and benefit .
There is no value in the normal commercial software , it is just the necessity for doing business these days .
Well , Linux satisfies my computing necessities at zero monetary cost , and the personal pleasure and learning value is just great .
0.16 Linux is idealistic " dreaming " ; it is business that rules the world nowadays
Linux is the end - product of activities of many such loose " consortiums " who " scratch their needs . "
So Linux is a business , but it is not necessarily about selling software -- it is about access to reasonably - priced software that matches your need , solves your problem , sells your hardware or service , and which is totally yours ( the licence never expires , and you will never be cut off from the source code ) .
0.17 Linux sux etc .
In this context , it may be worthwhile to briefly summarize Linux strengths and weaknesses : Linux is owned by its fans ( your piece of ownership comes free with your free subscription to the fan club ) , definitely very powerful and feature - rich , highly configurable , as flexible as you want it to be ( comes with complexity ) , low on the cost of hardware , comes with any networking bell - and - whistle known to man , requires a computer literate administrator , some essential desktop applications are still behind commercial offerings on other platforms ( e.g. , spreadsheet and word processing ) , a number of excellent end - user applications come " standard " and free with the operating system , the graphical user interface is very nice but still not as polished as Apple or MS offerings , Linux is highly standard ( UNIX , POSIX ) , open file formats used all along , thousands of programs available for free download ( although the ease of use and quality of these varies vastly ) .
And most of all , Linux is enjoyable !
Comcast hopes to roll out wideband Internet connections to 65 percent of its footprint in the US this year , the company announced Thursday .
The cable giant said that it has already introduced beefed - up DOCSIS 3.0 speeds to more than 15 million homes and businesses , roughly 30 percent of its footprint , and its goal is to eventually get its entire footprint up to a minimum of 12 Mbps .
Comcast noted that its DOCSIS 3.0 rollout was already reaching customers in ten major markets across the US , including the Twin Cities , Boston , parts of New Hampshire , Philadelphia , parts of New Jersey , Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Ft. Wayne , Portland , and Seattle .
Many of those markets are fairly recent additions to the list , and the fact that Comcast has already surpassed its October 2008 goal of reaching 10 million homes and businesses is encouraging .
By the end of 2009 , the company hopes to offer DOCSIS 3.0 capabilities to 30 million homes and businesses , enabling speeds of up to 100 M bps down .
" What we 're finding is that speed really matters to consumers , particularly as they watch more video on the Internet on sites like YouTube and Fancast.com .
In addition , gaming , downloading and other applications get even better with more speed , " Comcast 's COO and President Steve Burke said in a statement .
Comcast first flipped the switch on its first DOCSIS 3.0 deployment in the Twin Cities in April of 2008 , pricing the 50 M bps tier at $ 149.95 per month .
Comcast 's newly renamed Extreme 50 service is now a bit cheaper at $ 139.95 ( upstream speed is 10 Mbps ) .
The cable giant 's other new service tier is Ultra , which offers speeds of up 22 M bps down and 5 M bps up for $ 62.95 .
Most current Comcast customers will at least get a speed boost from DOCSIS 3.0 : Performance broadband customers will see their speeds doubled to 12 M bps / 2Mbps up , while Performance Plus subscribers get a boost to 16 M bps down .
Comcast 's newly implemented 250GB monthly bandwidth caps will also remain in place for its DOCSIS 3.0 deployments .
Comcast spokesperson Charlie Douglas confirmed that the new tiers are subject to the same cap , but stressed that " far less than 1 percent " of residential customers are ever affected by the cap 's presence .
With its aggressive plans for 2009 , Comcast is clearly looking to compete even more fiercely with Verizon 's FiOS offerings .
Verizon has rolled out its 50 M bps / 20 M bps tier across its entire fiber - to - the - home network for anywhere between $ 89.95 and $ 139.95 per month , so while expensive , Comcast 's Extreme 50 service is priced competitively with Verizon 's offering .
All I can say , being based in Chicago , is that I hope that homes that are actually inside city limits get some wideband love from Comcast this year .
My suburbanite coworkers should n't be allowed to have all the fun !
Dozens of nearly - imperceptible mini-earthquakes have made Yellowstone National Park tremble over the past few days - they might be early warning of an eruption so huge it buries half the U.S. under hot ash .
Advertisement
Located in Montana and Wyoming , Yellowstone is famous for its geysers , including " Old Faithful , " which blasts steam into the air like clockwork every day .
Now geologists studying the recent mini-quakes in the park say we might be in for a big blast .
Such blasts tend to come about once every 600 thousand years , and we have n't seen one for roughly that amount of time .
The last big explosion in Yellowstone , according to Scientific American , was roughly 640 thousand years ago , and it covered about 240 cubic miles in hot ash , scalding rocks , and magma .
But do n't worry yet , says SciAm 's David Biello :
Although the earthquake swarm continues , according to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory , the volcano alert level remains normal .
And a slew of larger earthquakes have occurred throughout the western U.S. , Alaska , Puerto Rico and even Pennsylvania in the past week without incident , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
In recent years , Yellowstone 's caldera has been rising thanks to uplifting magma beneath it - leading to more cracks , hot springs and even more frequent eruptions of Steamboat Geysers .
Paired with the earthquakes , such magma movement might presage an eruption - either big or small .
Unfortunately , scientists can't really predict when the next such eruption will happen , and the range of possibilities is large : from later today to a million years from now .
How will we know if we should start worrying ?
The real warning signs will be rapid changes in the shape of the ground as well as volcanic gases leaking from the ground , neither of which have been sighted - yet .

Locked in a visitation dispute with his former girlfriend over their young daughter , J.P. Weichel wanted to vent , court records say .
Weichel , 40 , allegedly posted comments about the woman on the Craigslist “ rants and raves ” forum , accusing her of child abuse and welfare fraud and making crude comments about her sex life .
The woman said the postings were defamatory .
But unlike the majority of libel cases , which are tried in civil court , local authorities have taken the unusual step of charging Weichel with a crime .
Colorado is one of a dwindling number of states with a criminal law against libel .
The statute dates to the 19th century and is rarely used .
Advertisement
But Larimer County Dist .
Atty .
Larry Abrahamson said Colorado ’s statute applied precisely to what Weichel was accused of doing .
“ This is what the Legislature of the state of Colorado has determined is criminal , ” Abrahamson said .
“ We ’re obligated to enforce the laws in the state of Colorado . ”
Weichel could not be reached for comment , and his lawyer , Michael Liggett , has a policy of not speaking with reporters , an assistant in his law office said .
But several lawyers said the case should be handled in civil court .
Bringing the government into the dispute , they said , is a troubling infringement on free speech .
Advertisement
“ Being a jerk is n’t necessarily grounds for felony prosecution , ” said Mark Silverstein , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado .
Gregory Lisby , a communications professor at Georgia State University , has tracked criminal libel prosecutions .
He said the states that retained such statues -- there are 17 , according to free - speech groups -- had simply not updated laws from English common law .
Criminal libel prosecutions are “ a sledgehammer when a scalpel would do the same trick , ” Lisby said .
His research shows that criminal libel cases have dropped , but the Internet could reverse that , he said .
People do n’t realize that scathing postings or e-mails can make them liable for defamation charges .
Advertisement
“ More and more people view the online world as a free - rant place , ” Lisby said .
“ They think it ’s par for the course , but they ’re setting themselves up for lawsuits ” or prosecution .
In civil libel cases , truth is the best defense and the dead can not be libeled .
But Colorado ’s criminal statute holds that it is illegal to “ blacken the memory of one who is dead . ”
Truth is not a defense in such cases , or in ones that “ expose the natural defects of one who is alive . ”
The state Supreme Court upheld the law in 1991 but said its provisions would not apply to constitutionally protected political speech .
In 2006 , the ACLU successfully blocked the Greeley Police Department from using the statute to pursue a blogger who posted material critical of a professor at the University of Northern Colorado .
The ACLU argued that prosecution would violate the 1st Amendment .
Police and court records say Weichel ’s postings were purely personal .
Advertisement
Weichel ’s former girlfriend contacted police in Loveland last December about anonymous postings that referred to her sometimes by her nickname and other times by her full name .
A police report said the postings alleged that she abused her child and concealed it from social workers , and that she committed welfare fraud and worked for a “ crooked ” Fort Collins lawyer whom she sexually serviced .
The postings were laced with crude references to her body .
The woman told police that people who knew her read them and tried to defend her in online comments .
Police traced the postings to a computer that Weichel had access to .
In August , Loveland police questioned Weichel at his workplace .
Advertisement
“ Weichel stated he was ‘ just venting , ’ ” according to an affidavit for an arrest warrant .
Abrahamson ’s office filed two criminal libel charges against Weichel on Oct. 21 .
The state ’s libel law carries a maximum sentence of 18 months in jail .
As news of the prosecution circulated , it prompted critics of the law to call for a revision .
David Lane , a 1st Amendment lawyer in Denver , said prosecutors almost never used the law because they knew it could easily be stricken by a federal court .
“ It ’s shocking the statute exists , ” Lane said , “ and that someone ’s even using it is more shocking . ”

German intel head threatens whistleblower site Muriel Kane
Published : Monday December 22 , 2008
Print This Email This
In the latest twist in a scandal involving the presence of the German intelligence service or Bundesnachrichtendienst ( BND ) in the Balkan nation of Kosovo , the head of the BND has ordered whistleblower website Wikileaks to remove all BND - related files under threat of " immediate prosecution . "
Wikileaks has responded with a press release noting that the demands have no legal force outside Germany , so the order " must be assumed to be an attempt to engage Wikileaks via its German component -- or does Mr. Uhrlau suggest it is now BND policy to kidnap foreign journalists and try them before German courts ? "
According to Wikileaks , " The threats , made by BND President Ernst Uhrlau , were triggered by the Wikileaks publication of an article by Tom Burghardt , a US journalist , on the BND 's bungled Kosovo operation , together with a classified BND dossier on senior Kosovo figures from 2005 -- both of which were specifically named by Mr. Uhrlau . "
The Kosovo scandal began on November 19 , when three Germans were arrested in Kosovo 's capital of Pristina on suspicion of throwing explosives at the European Union office .
The men , who said they were not behind the incident but were merely observing the crime scene , were identied by the German paper Spiegel as BND agents .
Germany is one of the strongest diplomatic and financial supporters of the government in Kosovo , which declared its independence from Serbia last February , and the BND is known to be active there .
BND sources charged that the incident was the work of local radicals , who are opposed to the deployment of EU forces in their country to replace UN peacekeepers in certain areas , which they see as likely to lead to an eventual partition of the country into a Serbian half and an Albanian half .
However , other analysts suggested that the high - profile arrests might represent an attempt to embarrass the BND by Kosovo 's prime minister , who was accused in the 2005 BND report of being involved with organized crime .
The article by researcher Tom Burghardt , which Wikileaks sees as a primary cause of the BND order , describes Kosovo as both " a European narco state " and " a militarized outpost for Western capitalist powers intent on spreading their tentacles East , encircling Russia and penetrating the former spheres of influence of the ex-Soviet Union . "
" For the ruling elites of the former Yugoslavia and their Western allies , Kosovo is a veritable goldmine , " Burghardt writes .
" Situated in the heart of the Balkans , Kosovo 's government is deeply tied to organized crime structures : narcotrafficking , arms smuggling , car theft rings and human trafficking that feeds the sex slave ' industry . '
These operations are intimately linked to American destabilization campaigns and their cosy ties to on - again , off - again intelligence assets that include al - Qaeda and other far - right terror gangs . "
Burghardt implies that the incident may have been meant as a slap on the wrist to the BND for " stepping on the CIA 's toes and that agency 's cosy intelligence ' understanding ' with Mafia - linked KLA fighters and al - Qaeda assets . "
Whether he is correct or not , it does seem that the BND chief would like to see his speculations suppressed .
Click to viewHey , I just had some time to play with the Palm Pre , maybe the most important handset to be announced in two years , and here 's what it was like to use it .
Updates coming .

NOTE : If you want the latest Pre details , check out our Palm Pre Review and Palm Pre FAQ .

The Palm Pre is a lot smaller than I initially thought it would be .
A good size comparison would be an iPod classic with a big hard drive .
In terms of thickness , it 's definitely not as thin as the iPhone , or even the bold , but it 's an acceptable size considering it 's a slider .
The Pre 's Web OS UI and and UX really looks great .
After watching ( and using ) for 20 minutes ,
It rarely looked ( or felt ) unresponsive , choppy , or laggy and it's clear a lot of thought was put into the design , especially with regard to how the phone would be used with fingers , as opposed to a stylus or d-pad

The Card system is really a great way to keep your information in front of you and know what you 're working on .
When you launch an app , you can drag it onto your phone desktop to create a new card , then when you 're finished with a card for a specific app , closing it is as simple as flicking the card upwards .
The input technology that does n't involve the screen is also top notch .
Palm created the gesture bar , which is the black surface under the screen , because they found it was too hard to control a touchscreen phone with one hand , especially when trying to reach the upper part of the screen .
The Gesture Bar streamlines some of the navigation so you can use the phone on the go .

There 's also an accelrometer that works with apps like the web browser and photo viewer , which automatically rotates the screen depending on its orientation .
It 's the same as what 's on many other phones , but it 's worth noting that the accelerometer works quite well .
If you 're working in a specific app , you can drag your finger up from the Gesture Bar to the screen , hold it for a second , and the wave dock will appear , making it easy to quick launch another app .
The trackball , which feels similar to that of the G1 and Blackberry phones , provides another quick way to get around the Web OS interface .

There 's also the keyboard .
It pretty much looks and feels the same as previous Palm keyboards of late , which is n't spectacular , but it works well enough .
When asked why they opted to go with the vertically oriented slide out keyboard , Palm had two main reasons — they did n't see much less of a difference in effectiveness when compared to a horizontal slider , and found that more people messaged holding the phone vertically .
Second , they said there are n't really any other smartphones with a vertical QWERTY slider , so it makes the phone more recognizable .
While the hardware is definitely high quality , I 'm not entirely blown away by the design .
It looks really nice , and original , but it 's a little too cutesy in shape and kind of reminds me of an oversized pebble .
A slightly larger screen could have definitely been put to good use , and I really do n't like the black space on the side 's of the screen .

I think this phone 's biggest appeal will be the central role the internet plays in the OS .
The way it pulls data from various web services , and melds it into its own framework is top notch .
I think being able to text , and gChat and send IMs over AIM all from the same window is such a benefit to the user to not have to switch windows for 3 different apps for messaging .
And obviously , you wo n't be talking to someone on a bunch of different messengers at once , but over a period of a week , you might have convos over these different services , and it 's good to keep track of all these interactions in one place .
The browser is also a far cry from Blazer that was on the Treo's Garnet OS .
The new browser is built on top of Webkit , just like the Android and iPhone browsers , and renders full pages in under 10 seconds .
The zoom and drag / pan functionality is very much like the other browsers , both in operation and feel .
There was no glitchiness and the browser was extremely responsive .
Advertisement
I also love the way you can search for something on your phone , and then shoot that same query up to Google or Wikipedia without having to launch your web browser .
It 's another way the internet has subtly worked its way into the phone without being constricted to a specific app or browser .
The design influence of the iPhone OS is definitely apparent in Web OS .
The App dock that sits at the bottom of the home screen is definitely a page out of the iPhones playbook , and for good reason — it works well .
The design of the menus such as the contacts list take that same simple approach of not showing more than you absolutely see on any one page , something the iPhone perfected .

The screen is beautiful , and it really shows when looking at photos , which are so bright and colorful , I 'd almost say it looks sharper than any other phone .
The camera takes really beautiful photos as well .
Even in lighting that was n't super bright , colors came out rich , and though a little grainy , it did n't suffer the same washed out , sandy look that other camera phones generate .
This is also due in part to some image post processing that takes place behind the scenes of the camera app .

As far as video recording goes , it 's not available on the Pre for now , but it 's something Palm is looking at for future upgrades .
I find this slightly disappointing , because Palm is touting this as an internet phone , and user generated video is a very big part of what 's going on in the online world .
A feature where you could live stream or auto upload to YouTube seems like an idea that fits in with the Pre philosophy .
I think this absolutely has to be added in the next year .
The Apps and SDK for Web OS i think will be promising .
Palm will make the SDK available to anyone to use , but there will be an App Store which will be accessible on the phone only and an approval process for apps .
Palm says there are always exceptions , but they will not play the role of Big Brother so much when it comes to apps .
What they are mostly concerned with are the security and stability of the apps .
Making sure there are n't apps that crash or provide holes for their phones to be hacked .
They also say they will work close with select partners on app and give them access to deeper areas of the OS that are not available in the SDK .

Like Android , there is an Amazon music store app that looks and smells very similar to that on the G1 .
It lets you preview songs , as well as download from the same screen .
When I asked Palm about flash on the Pre , they said it was n't something they were talking about for now .
But Dan Lyons over at Newsweek claims that the phone will run flash on it .
Advertisement
It also has a few features not found on the iPhone , which include copy and paste and MMS messaging , something hardcore iPhone users have been clamoring for since its introduction .
I asked Palm if the Pre and the Web OS platform will be married to the Sprint service , and they said that Web OS - based products will eventually be available on other carriers , but they have no specific announcements on that .

From an earlier set of impressions :
It transcends what a mobile device should feel like .
It 's smooth but also tough enough to feel like you 're using something that 's going to last .
I really like how the back of the slider is reflective like an iPod touch ( might be good for the ladies and their make - up too ) .
The display looks richer in color gamut than any handset I 've ever seen ( almost like a mini Cinema Display ) .
The GUI seems fluid enough so that it's not overtly cheesy and plasticky looking ( transitions are still rough around the edges sometimes and not always as snappy as you 'd like . )
Speakerphone seems more than adequate for being Monophonic ( totally useable for listening to music / calls . )

This is just like OS X , Expose , Spaces , Spotlight — uninterrupted multitasking .
Even the cal is like iCal — on the desktop OS .
When you get a call , the OS puts what you 're doing down at the bottom , instead of dumping it like on iPhone .

[ Correction : I passed these notes off to a colleague who stated that I , Brian Lam , got to handle the phone in an earlier version of this post .
That was an error in communications in the heat of the moment , and I 've updated it to say that the impressions were from a friend .
We will have more photos and impressions in a bit from our own experience with the phone .
The post is now under Adrian Covert 's byline , because the new hands on impressions are his . ]
Steve Jobs ' medical leave from Apple is likely to be permanent , analysts say .
In a letter to Apple staff on Wednesday , Jobs said he was taking a five - month medical leave because his health issues are " more complex than I originally thought . "
Jobs ' letter contradicts a statement the CEO published just last week , in which he said he was " undergoing a simple and straightforward treatment " for a hormone imbalance .
The earlier statement gave the impression that Jobs merely needed to gain weight , and would continue as normal as Apple 's CEO .
Now , however , Jobs ' ill health appears to be much more serious .
He is taking five months off work , not planning to return until June 2009 .
By contrast , he took only a month away from Apple after undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004 .
" My bet is he 's not coming back , " said Roger Kay , an Endpoint Technologies analyst .
" Despite all the protestations , I think he has cancer .
They talk about digestive this and digestive that , but ... forget all the buzz you 're hearing .
Just look at the photos . "
ThinkPanmure analyst Vijay Rakesh said it 's been obvious for some time that Jobs ' health condition is critical .
" What he 's indicating is it needs more urgent attention , " Rakesh said .
There are several reasons to think that Jobs ' latest letter is as unreliable as the milder health statement he made a week ago :
A health expert recently interviewed by Wired.com that Jobs ' initial statement about his health was contradictory and made little sense .
According to the expert , the symptoms Jobs described could reflect anything from hyperthyroidism to a new form of cancer .
Jobs did not deliver his keynote speech at Macworld Expo 2009 .
Before the show , Apple said this move was purely for business reasons .
Later , Gizmodo reported a rumor that Jobs was not delivering a keynote because of his declining health .
A day before Macworld , Jobs explicitly said he had opted out because of his health .
In recent press events , Tim Cook and Phil Schiller , Apple 's COO and vice president of marketing , respectively , have been sharing the stage with Jobs more prominently than in the past .
One analyst contacted by Wired.com viewed this as a sign that Apple is preparing to dethrone Jobs .
Jobs ' increasingly gaunt figure between public appearances in the past year is a possible sign of active cancer , according to Dr. Alan Astrow , Director of Hematology and Oncology at the Maimonides Cancer Center .
Apple customers , journalists , bloggers , investors and analysts are hoping that Jobs is well and will retake the reins in the summer .
Shortly after Jobs ' announcement on Wednesday , Twitter lit up with " get well " wishes for the CEO .
" My mother just asked me if I heard about Steve Jobs — of course I have , " tweeted Warbrain .
" I wish him the best . "
Many expressed their appreciation for his leadership and their desire for his quick recovery .
" Apple wo n't be the same w/o his creative leadership , " tweeted Heredes .
" Praying for your health , Steve . "

KABUL , Afghanistan
For those readers who ask me what they can do to help fight poverty , one option is to sit down at your computer and become a microfinancier .
That ’s what I did recently .
From my laptop in New York , I lent $ 25 each to the owner of a TV repair shop in Afghanistan , a baker in Afghanistan , and a single mother running a clothing shop in the Dominican Republic .
I did this through www.kiva.org, a Web site that provides information about entrepreneurs in poor countries — their photos , loan proposals and credit history — and allows people to make direct loans to them .
So on my arrival here in Afghanistan , I visited my new business partners to see how they were doing .
On a muddy street in Kabul , Abdul Satar , a bushy - bearded man of 64 , was sitting in the window of his bakery selling loaves for 12 cents each .
He was astonished when I introduced myself as his banker , but he allowed me to analyze his business plan by sampling his bread :
It was delicious .
As stated in my announcement of candidacy , I expect the first phase of my presidential campaign — probably well into 2010 — to be largely internal to the libertarian movement and to the Libertarian Party and Boston Tea Party .
That internal focus is itself in two parts :
– Helping the movement to better understand and more consistently communicate the libertarian message rather than some other message .
Or , from a less positively stated vantage point , internal ideological and organizational struggle for the purpose of either re-radicalizing the LP and re-merging the BTP into the LP , or establishing beyond doubt that the LP cannot be re-radicalized and helping the BTP to replace the LP as the libertarian movement ’s political arm .
– Helping the movement develop institutions to better communicate its message to the public .
As we learned in the 2008 cycle , we ’re extremely vulnerable to having our name hijacked and our message re-written by anyone possessed of even a minor - league “ celebrity profile . ”
We have to develop an ongoing , recognizable media presence so that there ’s no message vacuum for opportunists to fill with non-libertarian talking points .
On that front , I expect to announce a major initiative , involving a number of respected libertarians , in January .
While that initiative will be a campaign - created project , I expect it to quickly become independent of my candidacy and to carry on long after that candidacy is forgotten .
These are things that can certainly be done outside the context of a presidential campaign , and many other libertarians are pursuing them via other avenues .
I chose this avenue for the same reason that I announced early :
The opponents of a radical , i.e. libertarian , LP are already using the 2012 campaign stump for their own purposes , and I do n’t believe we can afford to leave that ground uncontested even this early in the race .
If this program of “ internal improvements ” succeeds , then I ’ll be satisfied — my presidential campaign is a way of seeking those goals , not an end in itself .
In a recent piece in The Daily Beast , Michael Lind offers a solid blueprint for a liberal nightmare : Rising populist sentiment in the working class base of the Democratic Party could very well cost the Left both its agenda and even a second term for President Obama .
A few of Lind 's prime examples include the tax failings of top administration cabinet appointments .
Timothy Geithner 's ascension to Treasury Secretary is a particularly vulnerable point , and the " taxes are for little people " mixes rather well with Rick Santelli ’s rant about the unfairness of watching your irresponsible neighbor keep his or her house .
These issues , along with the fear of Republicans redefining the stimulus and bailouts as special - interest hand - outs , Lind argues , have political implications as wide - sweeping as the Left 's fall from grace in the 1960s with Lyndon B. Johnson and the Great Society :
If the Right succeeds in defining the stimulus passage as a giveaway to minorities and women at the expense of unemployed working - class white men ( and their wives and children ) , then conservatives have half the populist script written for them .
The other half is provided by the bailout , if that is perceived as a massive subsidy to financiers with political clout in Washington .
The acolytes of Lee Atwater and Karl Rove will find it easy to write a campaign ad in 2010 or 2012 portraying Democrats as an alliance of the top and the bottom against the middle — a classic populist theme .
Both scenarios are entirely possible .
There ’s been a lot of recent writing on the ratio of Republican to Democratic TV commentators ( it 's rather off ) .
House Majority John Boehner ( R - OH ) and several Southern governors , such as Louisiana ’s Bobby Jindal ( R ) , are soaking up the ratings .
But after a brutal news cycle covering the negotiations and continued Republican grandstanding , recent polling shows high approval ratings for Obama as well as a strengthening among his base and Independents .
He 's only losing Republican support , and the GOP is n't winning any ground with egregious misrepresentations of the stimulus ; it does n't look like it 's gaining much traction with the " porkulus " angle .
Over at The Next Right , Patrick Ruffini expressed surprise over a " Breaking News Alert " email from The Washington Post .
The email carried the item , " Large majorities support president 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus package and $ 75 billion plan for stemming mortgage foreclosures , according to a new Washington Post - ABC News poll " :
This is " breaking news ? "
That the media released a poll ?
Are bottom lines that pressed that both the Gray Lady and the Post feel it necessary to spam their readers on a daily basis with mundane tidbits that are most definitely not breaking news ?
These e-mails get sent almost daily , and this is only the worst infraction , but certainly not the only one .
I suspect the " breaking news " has more to do with the virulent nature of stimulus commentary .
Considering how remarkably combative , insulting , and counter - productive rhetoric from the Far Right has been , as well as the immensity of America 's economic distress , it 's no surprise the Post threw around that poll with gusto .
There is strong evidence , though far from concrete proof , that a good part of Obama 's message and his handling of the issues are resonating with voters despite cyclonic print , network and online coverage .
YouTube videos certainly do n't have the impact that TV first had on presidential communication ; the Internet is the filter for YouTube that print and radio could n't be for television .
But a filter does not catch everything , and Obama 's steadfast line of bipartisanship is definitely paying off .
The public perceives — if not as much as liberals would like — a divide between the administration 's legitimate bipartisan efforts and Republican ideological , hands - in - pockets heel - digging .
The failings of Tom Daschle and Geithner need to be taken on the chin , the former less so than the latter since Geithner was actually confirmed .
The irony is baldly unsubtle , and the administration is fast running out of vetting bona fides .
More importantly , the notion that Geithner 's tax problems run the risk of triggering populist resentment via a perceived double standard is flawed ; the public is consistently reminded of the double - standards of all politicians : Bill Clinton 's womanizing , Christian Republicans ' own moral failings , Spitzer , Vitter , Ted Stevens , John Edwards .
Geithner 's timing could n't be worse , but it is n't the impetus for Lind 's populist movement .
No liberal I know denies the serious costs of Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security — our social safety net .
The sweeping legislation that LBJ ushered in with his vision of a Great Society permanently changed America 's fiscal environment .
A good amount of that legislation was born of Ivory Tower , " brightest and best " types , rife with major problems for future Congresses and administrations to solve , but its impact on the quality of American life is a liberal cornerstone .
The immense crush of deficit spending that accompanied LBJ's Great Society was not that liberally pure ; indeed , one of the first benefactors of deficit spending was the military , helping to chart a trajectory that has put America 's defense budget atmospherically higher than any other country's .
The Vietnam War was LBJ 's undoing ; he could n't sell the war and the Great Society at the same time , and the Left collapsed .
Lind glosses over this in his essay , but America 's current military situation , coupled with domestic costs , is potentially more problematic than a populist turn of political events .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have drained a huge amount of money , but scaling back forces in Iraq while pushing more into Afghanistan is n't going to close the deficit ; letting Bush 's tax cuts expire might .
Thankfully Obama will probably do just that .
The hoots and hollers from the Right over such a " tax increase " are disingenuous because a ) the stimulus ' tax cuts are deeper than Bush 's ( and history ’s ) , and b) Bush 's tax cuts were meant to expire , at least in theory .
The administration ramped up strikes within Pakistan 's border — exactly what Obama he said he'd do in the campaign — and ordered 17,000 more troops into Afghanistan .
That is going to cost money .
Not necessarily Iraq - level tabs , but enough to be a major dent in the administration 's budget .
It 's quite possible the continued cost of war is as much a factor on the size of the stimulus as was the blanket resistance from Congressional Republicans .
Marc Ambinder does some clutch aggregating of various op - ed pages across the pages regarding the War in Afghanistan :
The Concord Monitor makes a strong case that President Obama should explain to the American people — and to the families of soldiers who might die there - exactly what the mission in Afghanistan is , how long it might take and how success will be measured .
And ,
The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette echoes these concerns , arguing that the country still does n't been given a clear understanding of " the parameters , the objectives or the end game " of the Afghanistan conflict .
Can America realistically escalate its war efforts abroad at a time when it is strenuously grappling with economic survival at home ?
A lot depends on how much Obama commits to Afghanistan ; it 's easy to forget that America 's wars are as big an item as the economy , health care and energy reform .
The administration has been trying since day one to fill in all the corners of domestic and international policy .
Despite their efforts , gaps remain in the Treasury Department and the Cabinet itself .
The administration had the ball in its court on November 5 , but it ’s still playing catch - up ( as is the rest of the country ) in some areas .
The Left 's agenda will not rise and fall with economic crisis .
So far it is weathering the storm far better than the Right .
And it is gaining momentum with support from Alan Greenspan , Lindsay Graham , the MBAs ( kind of ) , and young professionals .
But as Lind 's essay illustrates effectively , there are too many variables to presume any sort of concrete political future for either party .
His conclusions lean toward doom and gloom ; mine are more optimistic .
Each of the forces at play in America 's domestic , economic and foreign spheres are great enough to produce a domino affect in either direction .
So far the Obama administration is keeping up in the right places and leading in others — but there is a long way to go .

Werewolf Sighting : Boy Poisons Creature with Antifreeze
MEDFORD , WISCONSIN – An area boy told local authorities he was able to fend off a werewolf attack Friday night using nothing more than a gallon jug of antifreeze .
He was reportedly walking to the barn to complete his nightly chores , when a creature rushed him .
Quick thinking , the boy grabbed a nearby gallon of antifreeze and dumped it on the concrete walkway .
The boy told authorities he knew antifreeze was poisonous to dogs , and they cannot resist drinking it .
“ Prestone ’s sweet to them , like Kool Aid , ” said the boy “ And the wolfman got on all fours and lapped it up just like one of the hounds drinks from a puddle . ”
The body of a teenage girl who had disappeared earlier this month was found nude at the location .
The boy claims she changed back to human form after drinking the deadly Prestone cocktail .
In a possible related incident , the boy ’s father has also disappeared .
Area officials are investigating whether there is any connection to the incident ..

Informers and Benefit Fraud :
A Libertarian View
By Sean Gabb
I have just been sent one of the most disgusting newspaper articles I have seen this year .
It is from today ’s issue of The Guardian , and describes how the British Government is considering a scheme to reward those who inform on benefit cheats .
Astonishingly , the Ministers seem to think this will make people more inclined to vote Labour at the next general election .
If they are right , I am not sure how much longer I want to live in this parody of a country .
But , now I have said enough about the proposed scheme , let me explain what I find so disgusting about it .
The first is that , while every respectable person has a duty to report crimes against life and property , and to bear witness if required , there is much difference between this and calling into being an army of paid spies and police informers .
Such people are not needed to report genuine crimes .
Their general use is to act as the eyes and ears of an oppressive state .
Established for one purpose , their use inevitably spreads to other areas .
There is a natural temptation for paid informers to become agents of provocation .
There is an equally natural temptation for them to become blackmailers .
The resulting culture is one in which friends drop their voices when discussing anything in public that might be overheard to their disadvantage – and where new acquaintances , and even old friends , are viewed with suspicion .
My wife grew up in Communist Czechoslovakia , where all this was a fact of everyday life .
It was this , far more than the police and security services , who were responsible for a collapse of trust between ordinary people that has outlived is cause by twenty years .
It may be argued , that unlike drugs and prostitution , benefit fraud is not a victimless crime , but is theft from the taxpayers – but that , while they may be expected to report burglaries , individual taxpayers have no incentive to turn in someone who is claiming while working on the side .
This is true , but needs to be seen in perspective .
No one knows how much benefit fraud actually costs – the figure of £ 1 billion is believed to be a gross underestimate .
However , even if the cost were five or ten times this figure , it would still amount to barely two per cent of total government spending .
Most of this goes on paying for services that , where not useless , are harmful to life , liberty and property .
Look , for example , at Trevor Phillips .
In 2006 , he was appointed Chairman of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights at a salary of £ 160,000 .
Doubtless , this has since gone up .
Even so , his initial salary was equal to more than 2,488 weekly payment of jobseeker ’s allowance at the maximum single rate of £ 64.30 .
In return for this , his most famous achievement to date has been to hound the British National Party into not insisting that its members should be white – while doing nothing to stop the various Black Police Associations from insisting that their members should be black .
As if his published salary were not enough , Mr Phillips was revealed in 2008 to be the majority shareholder in Equate Organisation , which offers a “ discreet , customised service ” on how to handle the sort of equality issues that are investigated by his Commission .
Oh , and the man who is employed to make then nearest things acceptable in public to puking sounds every time the name Nick Griffin is mentioned apparently keeps a bust of Lenin on his desk .
But if more loathsome and better paid than most of the others , Mr Phillips is just one among hundreds of thousands of New Labour apparatchiks given our bread to eat in return for oppressing us .
I have no doubt these people collectively earn more than the £ 116 billion that is paid out every year on benefits .
According to the probably fake statistics that attended the informer proposal , benefit fraud may cost every taxpayer in this country £ 35 a year .
Well , I for one , can live with that .
Once all the excise duties are paid , it is much less than a single tank of diesel for my car .
The New Labour State costs me upwards of half my income , plus my liberty and my sense of nationality .
The only people who are really harmed by benefit fraud are those committing it .
They lose yet more of their self - respect .
This being said , the benefit rates are so awful that I fail to see how anyone can feed himself and his children without some cheating .
Certainly , those on public welfare should not be able to buy cars and flat screen televisions .
But they should be able to pay their heating bills and afford Christmas presents for their children without putting themselves into the hands of loan sharks .
And I do not believe that this sort of benefit cheat costs me anything approaching £ 35 a year .
Everyone knows that the benefits system is being systematically milked by gangs of – usually foreign – criminals .
Everyone knows that key parts of the system have recently been captured from the inside by organised criminals .
Twenty years ago , a friend mine worked behind the counter of a Post Office in South London .
He told me at the time how workers from the local benefit office used to come round to cash cheques they had written out to each other .
I shall be most surprised if this turns out now to be the worst manner of inside fraud .
And these are frauds that can and should be detected by ordinary policing .
They do not require the machinery of a police state .
This brings me back to the informer scheme .
I cannot help mentioning that it has been by Jim Reid , the Scottish Secretary .
He is said once to have been a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party .
Trust a Labour politician to have dropped all his proclaimed ends of raising up the poor – but not the police state means these ends were supposed to justify .
I hate everyone of my generation who went into politics .
Thirty years ago , they sneered at me and people like me as “ selfish ” and “ abhorrent ” .
They spent the next twenty years insisting to each other and anyone who was stupid enough to listen to them that , when they came into their own , ordinary people would live in dignity and want for nothing .
They have since then matured into the worst ruling class this country has seen since the Normans assimilated .
The expenses scandal is nothing compared with how they have governed the country in public .
Now , I suppose I should offer some positive recommendations of my own for dealing with benefit fraud .
I doubt anyone important is listening to me .
But let it be supposed that some political party were to consult me on welfare reform – what would I suggest ?
In the short term , I would set the police on catching the organised gangs of benefit cheats .
Once these were in prison or deported to their countries of origin , much of the problem would have been solved .
For the rest , I would advise looking the other way unless some minor fraud came to the attention of the authorities in the normal scheme of enforcement .
In the longer term , I would try to make most of the state welfare system redundant by lifting the tax and regulatory burden that stops the poorest people in this country from looking after themselves .
And this is not – let me say at once – some soft version of the neo-liberal gloating about forcing welfare recipients into work by cutting their already pitiful benefits .
Though it may always exist in a free society , the wage system as we have known it during the past few centuries is neither natural nor desirable .
It is a cleaned up version of the bottom end of the feudal system , transmitted to industrial society via the management of domestic servants .
Middle class people often moan about the surly attitude of the working classes – about their unwillingness to do as they are told unless they are banned from union membership , or unless their unions can be taken over by middle class bureaucrats who then sell their members out .
But I can think of no middle class person who would like working class conditions of work .
I remember reading some years ago of a B&Q warehouse in Bristol .
The casual workers employed there were electronically tagged .
If anyone stopped moving for more than ten minutes , a computer shouted a message into his earpiece to report to the management office .
No one does this sort of work unless he is desperate .
No one who does it can have any pretensions to dignity .
To say people have a choice whether to work for B &Q is a patronising joke .
It is B &Q or Tesco , or some other demeaning job .
It is like saying a man has a choice of meals if the menu shoved under his nose offers turd sandwich or snot pizza .
What I have in mind is letting poor people start their own micro-businesses in the manner described by Kevin Carson .
Let someone start a coffee shop in the front room of his house .
Let a family brew beer and sell it .
Let people open little schools to teach reading and writing .
Let them look after other people ’s children .
These things are currently not permitted .
Or they are prevented by taxes and regulations that raise the fixed costs of doing business to the point where unreasonably large revenues must be generated year after year .
Some people may get rich from doing this .
Most will not .
But enrichment is not the purpose .
The real purpose is to give people the ability to survive without having to rely for all their income on salaried work .
It goes without saying that all subsidies to existing large businesses should be cut off at once – no more transport subsidies that allow goods to be moved about at less than full cost ; no more interventions abroad to stabilise export markets , or secure access to artificially cheap goods and labour ; no more taxes and regulations that can be carried by big business as cartellised costs , while flattening new entrants to the market ; above all , no more limited liability laws that foster the growth of huge joint stock enterprises that are little more than the economic wing of the ruling class .
Where welfare is concerned , people should be enabled to join together in free mutual societies , accepting members and offering such benefits as may be agreeable to the relevant parties .
This means no more taxes and financial regulation , and no more money laundering laws that , again , are little more than state cartellisation .
One of the failings of libertarianism – and I do not exempt myself from past guilt – is that we have too often argued as if actually existing capitalism was the free market .
We may have conceded that business was too highly taxed and regulated , and that this frequently was turned to the advantage of the bigger firms in any market .
But the assumption has too often been that a free market is effectively Tesco minus the state – that the wage system and big business were both natural and desirable institutions .
As said , they are neither .
The state capitalism that , in the 1980s and 1990s , we called Thatcherism or Reaganism was nothing approaching a free market .
It was better than state socialism .
But that is not saying very much .
It has to some extent been our fault if ordinary people have been offered an apparent choice between a system in which a lucky few grow gigantically rich through connections and the ability to shuffle paper in the accepted ways , and ordinary people cannot buy houses and have children without going head over heels into debt – and sometimes not even then – and the present system of shadow boxing between multinational corporations and a huge superstructure of at best intrusive and at worst corrupt officials .
I might end by accusing the present Government of moral and intellectual bankruptcy .
But this would be to absolve the equally if differently useless Tories .
It would also be to concede that any of these people ever had anything good to offer .
They are evil .
Never mind the ideals they still sometimes ritualistically claim to guide their actions .
All they have ever had to offer is a land fit for police spies and agents of provocation .
They must all be destroyed – politically and financially .

According to reports , four people were killed from IDF artillery fire in south Gaza , and the bodies of 15 others were pulled from the rubble of a number of structures throughout the Strip .
Gaza Health Ministry officials said the Israeli offensive has killed at least 1,060 Palestinians , about half of them civilians , including 300 children and teenagers .
More than 4,500 Palestinians have been wounded , they said .
Meanwhile , 11 IDF soldiers were lightly injured overnight in a number of incidents in north Gaza .
The troops were evacuated to hospitals in Israel for treatment .
IDF forces operating in Gaza overnight hit 35 terrorists in a series of clashes in the northern Strip .
Air Force fighter jets struck at 70 targets and naval warships provided backup for the ground troops ; the IDF Spokesman 's Unit said Thursday .
Calgary Flames forward Todd Bertuzzi , former NHL player Steve Moore and their respective legal teams met Monday in Toronto in an effort to resolve an ongoing lawsuit , according to media reports in Canada .
It was the players ' first face - to - face meeting since March 8 , 2004 , when Bertuzzi sucker - punched Moore and drove his head into the ice during a game , according to the Calgary Sun and the Calgary Herald .
The meeting was an attempt to reach a settlement before the suit , filed by Moore , goes to trial .
Also present were mediator Tom McGrenere and Bertuzzi's former coach , Marc Crawford , according to both Calgary newspapers .
" The purpose behind mediation for all cases is to facilitate a resolution of the dispute , " Tim Danson , Moore 's lawyer , told the Toronto Sun on Tuesday , adding that the discussions were confidential .
Moore , who was with the Colorado Avalanche , suffered three fractured vertebrae in his neck , a concussion and facial cuts , and has not played since .
Bertuzzi , who was with the Vancouver Canucks at the time , was charged with assault in June 2004 .
He was sentenced to community service and one year of probation after he pleaded guilty .
He was suspended by the NHL , and reinstated after 17 months -- time that also included the 2004 - 05 lockout .
Moore subsequently filed a lawsuit seeking $ 38 million in damages and lost income , naming Bertuzzi , the Canucks and the team 's then - parent company , Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment , as defendants .
Bertuzzi filed a " third - party claim " in early 2008 , alleging Crawford , who was the Canucks ' coach , ordered him to retaliate against Moore for Moore 's hit on then - Vancouver captain Markus Naslund two weeks earlier .
Bertuzzi's filing claimed that Crawford should be included in the responsibility for any damages awarded .
Crawford , in a defense filing , alleges Bertuzzi ignored the coaches ' orders to return to the bench and went after Moore instead .
No one from the Moore or Bertuzzi camps spoke to the media afterward the meeting .
On Tuesday , however , Danson said that no court date for the lawsuit has been set .
No other mediation session has been scheduled .
Bertuzzi , who has played with the Detroit Red Wings , Florida Panthers and Anaheim Ducks since , joined the Flames in the offseason with a one - year , $ 1.95 million deal .
He has maintained silence on the case since joining the Flames .
Bertuzzi is expected to rejoin his teammates Tuesday night for their game against the Blues in St. Louis .

At around 4:20 AM EST , Twitter once again broke down with some technical error .

Barack Obama to add 600,000 Government Jobs
As can be read in this article Barack Obama has gone on record as saying that he wants to create 600,000 new government jobs .
Naturally he did n’t come right out and say that , but the simple math shown in the above linked article shows us that that is his goal .
It has long been my belief that Democrats want as many people reliant on the federal government as possible in order to ensure a permanent voting base and what better way to accomplish that goal than by hiring more people to work for the government ?
Just one question , who pays government employees ?
The taxpayer .

My wife sat down on the couch next to me as I was flipping channels .
She asked , ' What 's on TV ? '
I said , ' Dust . '

The woman said , ' Unbutton your shirt ' .
So I opened my shirt revealing My curly silver hair .
She said , ' That silver hair on your chest is Proof enough for me ' and she processed my Social Security application .

Evolutionary biologist Armand Marie Leroi tells the story of evolution theory since Darwin postulated it in 1859 and how the new science of ' evo devo ' might predict its future .
Documentary which tells the story of evolution theory since Darwin postulated it in 1859 in ' On the Origin of Species ' .
The theory of evolution by natural selection is now scientific orthodoxy , but when it was unveiled it caused a storm of controversy , from fellow scientists as well as religious people .
They criticised it for being short on evidence and long on assertion and Darwin , being the honest scientist that he was , agreed with them .
He knew that his theory was riddled with ' difficulties ' , but he entrusted future generations to complete his work and prove the essential truth of his vision , which is what scientists have been doing for the past 150 years .
Evolutionary biologist Professor Armand Marie Leroi charts the scientific endeavour that brought about the triumphant renaissance of Darwin 's theory .
He argues that , with the new science of evolutionary developmental biology ( evo devo ) , it may be possible to take that theory to a new level - to do more than explain what has evolved in the past , and start to predict what might evolve in the future .
Impact Mozilla Yields Instructive Findings for Firefox , and OSS Overall

In late December , Mozilla announced the winner of its Impact Mozilla campaign , which was a far reaching effort to get community members , including new members such as previously uninvolved MBA students , to contribute ideas for how to improve Mozilla 's marketing efforts .
The winners of the competition were Phani Kumar Vadrevu and Uttam Byragoni of India , for their " Fox For All " marketing plan , which , in addition to proposals , includes a number of surprising statistics about usage of the Firefox browser .
The Impact Mozilla campaign strikes me as a good idea for many types of open source projects , which often have less - than - ideal marketing surrounding them .
Here 's a look under the hood of the campaign and the Fox For All plan .
Phani Kumar Vadrevu and Uttam Byragoni based their winning Fox For All plan on online research of usage patterns for Firefox involving 985 respondents .
Among the findings :
866 users had Firefox installed on their machines , but 356 had stopped using it .
Of those 356 users , 337 had never installed a single extension !
Of 124 users who currently had Firefox extensions loaded , a whopping 93 listed the extensions as their primary reason for using the browser .
Of the 124 users who had extensions installed , only 23 had 6 or more loaded .
The results of the Fox For All survey were slightly skewed because most of the users were engineering students , but the overall finding I agree with : Extensions - - a primary reason to use the browser -- have lower penetration than they should have .
The Fox For All plan goes on to suggest fostering development of add - ons , and especially personalization - focused add - ons .
It also suggests separating the idea - generation part of producing new add - ons from a developer - driven - only model .
That last idea , and the general idea of new ways to foster extensions , should cause the folks at Mozilla and Google to think long and hard .
The open source browsers are leading the way in browser innovation , and Firefox 's overwhelming advantage lies in its useful universe of extensions .
Google , as we 've covered , has extensions on tap for its Chrome browser .
It makes sense for both companies to subsidize the development of useful extensions , and get idea - generators who are users -- not developers -- to drive extension creation .
Moreover , many open source projects could benefit from better marketing , including the kinds of studies of usage patterns that traditional marketers often do .
Here , with Impact Mozilla , Mozilla has laid out how to go about this in an exemplary way .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
The terrorism threat to the United States over the next five years will be driven by instability in the Middle East and Africa , persistent challenges to border security and increasing Internet savvy , says a new intelligence assessment obtained by The Associated Press .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear attacks are considered the most dangerous threats that could be carried out against the U.S.
But those threats are also the most unlikely because it is so difficult for al - Qaida and similar groups to acquire the materials needed to carry out such plots , according to the internal Homeland Security Threat Assessment for the years 2008 - 2013 .
The al - Qaida terrorist network continues to focus on U.S. attack targets vulnerable to massive economic losses , casualties and political “ turmoil , ” the assessment said .
Earlier this month , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction remains “ the highest priority at the federal level . ”
Speaking to reporters on Dec. 3 , Chertoff explained that more people , such as terrorists , will learn how to make dirty bombs , biological and chemical weapons .
“ The other side is going to continue to learn more about doing things , ” he said .
Marked “ for official use only , ” the report does not specify its audience , but the assessments typically go to law enforcement , intelligence officials and the private sector .
When determining threats , intelligence officials consider loss of life , economic and psychological consequences .

The U.S. State Department fiercely denied claims made by Ehud Olmert about his influence over President George W. Bush , in an incident that has stirred up old debates about the role of the Israeli government and the so - called " Israel lobby " in formulating Middle East policy in Washington .
On Monday , Olmert claimed that he demanded and received an immediate conversation with President Bush , during which he convinced the president to overrule the wishes of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and abstain from a United Nations resolution calling for an immediate cease - fire in Gaza .
In response , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack on Tuesday called Olmert ’s claims " wholly inaccurate as to describing the situation , just 100 - percent , totally , completely not true . "
The State Department did not respond to an IPS request for further elaboration .
Olmert ’s comments were made in Ashkelon , a southern Israeli city that has been the target of rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip .
According to Olmert , he called the White House upon hearing of the upcoming UN Security Council resolution .
" I said , ‘ Get me President Bush on the phone . ’
They said he was in the middle of giving a speech in Philadelphia .
I said I did n’t care : ‘ I need to talk to him now . ’
He got off the podium and spoke to me , " Olmert said , according to multiple media reports .
As a result of his conversation with President Bush , Olmert claimed , the president called Rice and forced her to abstain from voting on the measure , which she herself had helped author .
" He gave an order to the secretary of state and she did not vote in favor of it  a resolution she cooked up , phrased , organized , and maneuvered for .
She was left pretty shamed and abstained on a resolution she arranged , " Olmert said .
The Security Council resolution passed by a vote of 14 to 0 , with the U.S. the only abstention .
The U.S. government was quick to counter Olmert ’s remarks .
In addition to the State Department ’s rebuttal , a White House spokesman also denounced " inaccuracies " in the story .
Regardless of the truth of Olmert ’s claims , the story comes as an embarrassment to the Bush administration , which has faced criticism for its alleged unquestioning support for Israeli positions .
While most U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere have called for an immediate cease - fire since the Israeli bombardment of Gaza began on Dec. 27 , the Bush administration has been unwavering in its refusal to condemn the campaign or suggest a timeline for its conclusion .
The U.S Congress has also expressed its strong support for Israel ’s actions in Gaza .
Last week , both the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed nonbinding resolutions in support of the military campaign .
But polls indicate that both members of Congress and the public at large may be more skeptical of the Israeli offensive than the official positions of the U.S. government would indicate .
An anonymous poll of 68 congressmen conducted by National Journal found that 39 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of Republicans felt that Israel had used " too much " force in Gaza .
Nevertheless , over 90 percent of representatives voted in favor of the House resolution , which placed all blame for civilian casualties in Gaza upon Hamas .
And in late December , a Rasmussen poll found that the U.S. populace as a whole supported the Israeli offensive by a narrow 44 to 41 percent margin .
Among Democrats , 55 percent felt that Israel should have tried to find a diplomatic solution first .
The diplomatic spat over Olmert ’s comments , along with this alleged disparity between U.S. public opinion and policies on Israel - Palestine , have given new intensity to an old set of debates .
Charges of pro-Israel bias have not been unique to the Bush administration .
Critics also accused the Bill Clinton administration , and particularly its top negotiator Dennis Ross , of giving priority to Israeli concerns during the peace negotiations of the late 1990s .
Ross , who is rumored to be in line to become President - elect Barack Obama ’s top Middle East envoy , was accused by U.S. and Arab negotiators of not being " an honest broker " in the peace process , according to a book by Ross ’ former colleague Dan Kurtzer .
And in 2005 , former U.S. peace negotiator Aaron David Miller complained that " many American officials involved in Arab - Israeli peacemaking , myself included , have acted as Israel ’s attorney , catering and coordinating with the Israelis at the expense of successful peace negotiations . "
On the U.S. domestic scene , Congress ’s overwhelming backing of the Gaza offensive despite apparently lukewarm public support has been taken as further evidence for the existence of an " Israel lobby " skewing policy in a hawkish direction .
This claim was put forth by political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt in a 2006 article in the London Review of Books entitled " The Israel Lobby , " later turned into a 2007 book .
They alleged that hawkish pro-Israel lobbying groups  most notably the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC )  have for decades skewed foreign policy in a direction detrimental to U.S. interests .
The Mearsheimer / Walt thesis has been extremely controversial since its publication .
To critics , the thesis was simply the latest manifestation of a long line of conspiracy theories alleging covert Jewish domination of politics .
Defenders countered that the idea of an Israel lobby was not meant to stand in for Jews as a whole  both because the policies of groups like AIPAC were unrepresentative of the more dovish views of most U.S. Jews , and because the lobby was also made up of large numbers of evangelical Christians .
Regardless , the years since the publication of Mearsheimer and Walt ’s article have seen more open debate about the way that Israel policy is formulated in Washington .
Relatively centrist commentators such as Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Joe Klein of Time , while taking pains to distinguish their views from those of Mearsheimer and Walt , have suggested that hawkish Jewish groups in the U.S. political establishment are skewing Israel policy in an unhealthy direction .
As world debate over the Gaza war remains fierce , it seems unlikely that these controversies will die down in the near future .
Walt , for one , has taken recent developments as a further vindication of his views .
" [ A ] lthough most Americans support Israel ’s existence and have more sympathy for them than they have for the Palestinians , " he wrote Jan. 5 in response to the Rasmussen poll , " they are not demanding that U.S. leaders back Israel no matter what it does .
But that ’s what American politicians reflexively do . "

HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) --
Monetary authorities in China are likely to roll out further reductions in interest rates this year after data released Tuesday showed consumer price - increases eased for the ninth straight month while wholesale inflation dropped 3.3 % in January .
" We anticipate further interest rate cuts from the [ People 's Bank of China ] in the coming months , especially considering the recent rise in real interest rates , " wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Jing Ulrich in a note emailed to reporters Tuesday .
Consumer - price inflation eased to 1 % from a year earlier , cooling from 1.2 % in December , and 2.4 % in November , according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics Tuesday .
Wholesale inflation , a measure of producer prices , fell to negative 3.3 % , extending a month - on - month declining trend since peaking at 10.1 % in August .
Analysts had on average forecast wholesale inflation of negative 2.6 % , according to a poll by Dow Jones Newswires .
Moody 's economist Sherman Chan said the central bank will extend aid to businesses and households hit by the hard economic times through additional monetary easing " though at a milder pace than that adopted in late 2008 . "
In final quarter of 2008 , the People 's Bank cut its base lending rate by 2.16 percentage points to 5.31 % .
It has not made any changes this year .
Money - supply growth accelerated to 17.8 % in December on year , after rising 14.8 % in November .
" With inflationary pressures evaporating , the central bank will see more room to loosen monetary policy , " Chan said .
China ' economic growth eased to 6.8 % in the December - ending quarter on year , from 9 % in the preceding quarter .
Some economists think China 's economy is currently in recession .
Merrill Lynch said Tuesday that China appears set to become the first major economy to recover from the global crisis .
The broker noted that the inflation pointed to the emergence of a more benign pricing environment for manufacturers .
" The much sharper decline in PPI inflation compared to CPI inflation could improve profit margins and even boost earnings growth for a number of sectors , " wrote Merrill economists headed by Ting Lu in Hong Kong .
Merrill added that recent data suggest the economy is well on its way to achieving the government 's target for 8 % GDP growth this year .
Still , declines in consumer prices would have been sharper if it had n't been for resilient food prices as a winter drought ravaged part of the nation 's main agricultural belt .
Buoyant consumer spending over the Chinese New Year in late January , also helped underpin prices .
For the most part , the decline in producer prices had been well - flagged following sharp declines in industrial commodities such as crude oil and coal from about the middle of last year .
Consumer prices are expected to decline further in coming months before rebounding later in the year when the government 's stimulus policies take effect .
Many economists have predicted the fourth quarter as the likely period when China 's economy will strengthen .
Standard Chartered regional economist Kelvin Lau said China 's consumer price inflation rate would likely remain " pretty low " for the next three quarters before staging a " mild " rebound in the fourth quarter .
Merrill Lynch 's
Lu said there were few risks of sustained deflation in China this year .
Prices would be supported against a backdrop of loose monetary policy , the removal of some price controls , ramped up government spending , and commodity prices that appear set to rally off lows
The broker defined deflation as a persistent decrease in the general price level of goods and services lasting for a prolonged period .
Merrill forecast the PBOC will cut interest rates by 0.81 - percentage point this year and said the major risk was that the central bank could cut rates less than many expect .
Merrill 's outlook is for consumer - price inflation of negative 2.6 % in February , a number that may exaggerate price weakness because of the distortion caused by the spring Lunar New Year festival .
China suffered deflation for about a year ending in 2003 and for two years ending in 1999 following the Asian economic crisis .
" If we do see a prolonged period of deflation , say more than 12 months , it will make a very big difference to domestic consumption , " said Standard Chartered Lau , " it will lead to changes in expectations of prices over the medium to long term . "
Lau said it was unlikely China would fall into prolonged deflation this year .
Individuals with diastolic blood pressure under 70 mm
Hg coupled with an elevated systolic blood pressure may have a greater risk of heart attack and stroke than indicated by the systolic blood pressure values alone , according to a UC Irvine study .
Dr. Stanley Franklin and colleagues at the UC Irvine Heart Disease Prevention Program in conjunction with researchers at the Framingham Heart Study reviewed blood pressure data from 9,657 participants in the Framingham Heart Study who had not received antihypertensive treatment and found that the combination of low diastolic and high systolic numbers to be a superior predictor of future adverse cardiovascular events .
" Systolic blood pressure as a single blood pressure component is usually superior to diastolic blood pressure in predicting cardiovascular risk in middle - aged and older individuals , " Franklin said .
" But a very high or very low diastolic blood pressure can add to the risks identified by systolic blood pressure alone . "
Currently , physicians diagnose hypertension with systolic and diastolic readings of 140/90 and above .
This study suggests that doctors should give even greater consideration to systolic blood pressure when the diastolic blood pressure is low .
Franklin said , however , that a diastolic number under 70 mm
Hg when combined with a systolic blood pressure less that 120 mm Hg indicates normal values with no increased cardiovascular risk ; the low diastolic blood pressure must be coupled with an elevated systolic reading to indicate increased risk .
This combination of blood pressure components is an indicator of increased stiffening of arteries , which is a strong risk factor for future heart attacks and strokes .

January 27th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
Pittsburgh may be the next center of solar power in the U.S. Yes , that Pittsburgh .
On Monday Mayor Luke Ravenstahl held a day - long seminar with planning and development types on the potential for solar power in the Steel City .
The mayor said city government will install a solar hot water heating system , a first for the city , at a to - be - determined firehouse .
City government will take a closer look at solar power to see what problems and promise there may be in Western Pennsylvania for the technology .
The government is currently working with Sandia National Laboratory to examine how to bring solar to public buildings and lower the obstacles to putting solar power on private property .
When you consider that Pittsburgh was chosen as the setting for the cold , snowy , gray parts of the screen adaptation of Cormac McCarthy ’s post - apocalyptic
The Road , it may not be the first city that springs to mind for having the potential to use a lot of solar power .
However , the city was named one of 25 “ Solar America Cities ” in 2007 by the U.S. Department of Energy , a designation that gave it access to $ 200,000 in grants for solar projects .
And a DOE official at Monday ’s event noted that Germany and other European countries are now lauded for their solar power installations , and Pittsburgh gets more sun than many of those locales .
After all , if folks in Antarctica and Minnesota can find ways to use solar , why not Pittsburgh ?

Police in Western Australia are considering placing security guards at Perth police stations after two cars of police officers were torched in the compound of a police station .
I know .
All the cops must have been busy eating donuts at the tome .
Apparently Western Australian police are “ under siege ” following a similar attack on another police station when a utility vehicle was driven to the station ’s doors and set alight , causing extensive damage .
The police called 911 ( 000 in Australia ) but after realizing that they had to answer the call themselves , and because Spiderman was n’t available they are considering the option of putting private security guards at police stations .
Apparently Western Australian Police Commissioner , Karl O’Callaghan is unfamiliar with the concept of irony .
“ We might have to place security guards or something like that , ” Mr O’Callaghan said .
The second firebombing had sparked concerns among officers for their safety at work .
“ I ’m concerned about any threat on police , obviously my first concern is for the officers , to make sure they are safe and we will be looking at security as a matter of priority , ” Mr O’Callaghan said .
Once the police stations are properly guarded , the cops can go back to eating donuts in peace .
I think Karl O’Callaghan may be police chief Wiggum in disguise , just not a very good disguise .

Guardsmen to conduct urban training at Arcadia in April
Posted on by iowamark
The Carroll National Guard unit will train on urban military operations by holding a four - day exercise at Arcadia .
The purpose of the April 2 - 5 drill will be to gather intelligence , then search for and apprehend a suspected weapons dealer , according to Sgt. Mike Kots , readiness NCO for Alpha Company .
Citizens , law enforcement , media and other supporters will participate .
Troops will spend Thursday , April 2 , staging at a forward operations base at Carroll .
The next day company leaders will conduct reconnaissance and begin patrolling the streets of Arcadia to identify possible locations of the weapons dealer .
The primary phase will be done Saturday , April 4 , when convoys will be deployed from Carroll to Arcadia .
Pictures of the arms dealer will be shown in Arcadia , and soldiers will go door to door asking if residents have seen the suspect .
Soldiers will knock only at households that have agreed to participate in the drill , Kots noted .
" Once credible intelligence has been gathered , " said Kots , " portions of the town will be road - blocked and more in - depth searches of homes and vehicles will be conducted in accordance with the residents ' wishes .
" One of the techniques we use in today 's political environment is cordon and knock , " Kots explained .
" We ask for the head of the household , get permission to search , then have them open doors and cupboards .
The homeowner maintains control .
We peer over their shoulder , and the soldier uses the homeowner 's body language and position to protect him . "
During this phase of the operation , troops will interact with residents and media while implementing crowd - control measures and possibly treating and evacuating injured persons .
The unit will use a Blackhawk helicopter for overhead command and control , and to simulate medevacs .
The drill will culminate in the apprehension of the suspected arms dealer .
Alpha Company will conduct a review of the drill on Sunday , April 5 .
A meeting to give residents more information and accept volunteers will be held 7 p.m. Monday , March 2 , in the Arcadia American Legion hall .
Kots said the exercise will replace Alpha Company 's weekend drill for April .
" We have a lot of extended drills this coming year , " he added .
In addition to surveillance , searching and apprehension , the exercise will also give the troops valuable experience in stability , support , patrol , traffic control , vehicle searches and other skills needed for deployment in an urban environment .
" This exercise will improve the real - life operational skills of the unit , " said Kots .
" And it will hopefully improve the public 's understanding of military operations . "
The pre-drill work with residents is as important at the drill itself .
" It will be important for us to gain the trust and confidence of the residents of Arcadia , " said Kots .
" We will need to identify individuals that are willing to assist us in training by allowing us to search their homes and vehicles and to participate in role - playing . "
" We really want to get as much information out there as possible , because this operation could be pretty intrusive to the people of Arcadia . "
" The primary phase will be done Saturday , April 4 , when convoys will be deployed from Carroll to Arcadia .
Pictures of a suspected arms dealer will be shown in Arcadia , and soldiers will go door to door asking if residents have seen the suspect .
...
The drill will culminate in the apprehension of the suspected arms dealer . "

Remember “ Spontaneously jihad syndrome ” ?
By acting independently , the jihadis were not tied to “ cell ” which meant that they could n’t be stopped through the use of informers .
It looks like the future is going to hold a lot of “ spontaneous patriot syndrome ” .

I recall learning something a about “ habituation ” being a component of classical operant conditioning .
. . .
I also recall learning something about “ The Law of Effect , ” too .
I also recall learning that it is unethical to use human subjects in any test , trial , or experiment without their knowledge and “ informed consent , ” and then only after they have volunteered to participate , with the understanding by all parties concerned that said “ subjects : may at their discretion and without explanation leave the test , trial , or experiment at any time .
There was something else about this thing called the “ Scientific Method , ” too .
“ Gosh , Wally , when I read the article , and then I think about all this , it sounds just like someone is setting up some sort of psychology experiment or something .
You know , like in that book they have in the library .
It 's like maybe if somebody put plywood over the windows in Dad 's office at work , and Dad would be real mad about that at first , but if they just leave it there long enough , pretty soon he 'll just get used to it being like that , and gee , he 'll even forget what it was like before they covered up his windows and then after a while he stops complaining about it , and after a longer while he does n't even care .
Hey !
It 's like he gets so used to it being like that that he does n't even seem to notice . ”
“ Knock it off , will ya , Beave ?
Gee , everyone knows that that psychology stuff is just some kind of crazy science .
Besides ,
‘ In science , if it only happens once , it never happened . ’
I mean , take a chill pill , will ya ?
It is n't like this has happened before or is happening anywhere else . . . is it ?
Beave ? ” ( Mmmm -hmmmm . . . . )
To : LSUfan
absolutely !
It is the kind of warfare we 've faced for the last 8 years and more .
It only makes sense to train for it and as long as we send national guard troops to the front lines , they need the skillset to cope and survive .
Now that 's not saying that the skills could n't be used domestically .
Our Founding Fathers had a healthy fear of standing armies .

I ’m trying to see your point .
I ’ve been a Guardsman and appreciate the need for realisitic MOUT traininig .
Maybe I ’ve grown more cynical but the described template makes me suspicious .
Why an “ arms dealer , ” and not , say , a terrorist secreting a nuclear device ?
Trying hard to be P.C. is my guess .
I ’ll keep an open mind but will also be watching closely .

I absolutely agree .
Add to that the fact that we have muslim terrorist cells all over the place on our own soil !

German billionaire Adolf Merckle has committed suicide after his business empire ran into trouble in the global economic slowdown .
His family has released a statement saying he was " broken " by the financial crisis .
Mr Merckle ran up losses of about $ 750 million last year because of wrong - way bets on Volkswagen shares .
In the world of scenario planning , the fact that something is unthinkable should not prevent us from considering it .
The breakup of the Soviet Union was unthinkable almost until the day it happened .
At the same time , of course , not every impossible thing will happen .
Among the most unthinkable scenarios for most Americans is the unthinkable idea that the United States could become the disunited or turn into divided states .
Even though this union accumulated very slowly in the first place , and against all odds — in other words it was not inevitable — the fact that the USA will not always be as united , or at least united in the way it is now , is considered , well … unthinkable .
But as Juan Enriquez notes in his amazing PopTech talk , based on his book “ The Untied States of America : Polarization , Fracturing , and Our Future ” , no US president has ever died under the same flag that he was born under .
That is , the borders of the United States has constantly shifted even in modern times .
The last state was added in 1959 ( after I was born ! ) and more could be added still .
Americans are comfortable ADDING states , but it might not take much to subtract one .
The outcome of the US Civil War has biased Americans to disbelieving in subtraction , but that might change .
In past decades bold American thinkers have imagined how the US might break up , but these were more thought experiments indicating the cultural differences within this large country .
There ’s no shortage of maps showing the alternative arrangements of North American countries .
One of the finest is Joel Garreau ’ s 1981 scenario of the Nine Nations of North America .
However the current economic instability and the general devolution of nation states around the world has led to several outsiders considering the break up of the US as a serious possibility .
Two of these scenarios come from Russians .
In the past year or so , traffic to Dmitry Orlov ’s online presentation about the ‘ collapse gap ‘ has soared as word of mouth recommendations about his scenario flourished .
Orlov ’s argument is that the parallels in the state of the USSR twenty years ago and the USA now make an economic collapse likely .
Orlov does not specifically talk about breaking up as collapse .
He says the USSR was better prepared for collapse than the US .
The most recent breakup scenario was noted today in the Wall Street Journal in a piece about Russian professor Igor Panarin , who predicts the breakup of the US in the year 2010 .
He has been predicting the same for the past decade but is now getting an audience .
The logic of his scenario goes like this :
He predicts that economic , financial and demographic trends will provoke a political and social crisis in the U.S.
When the going gets tough , he says , wealthier states will withhold funds from the federal government and effectively secede from the union .
Social unrest up to and including a civil war will follow .
The U.S. will then split along ethnic lines , and foreign powers will move in .
With his Soviet KGB background it may be no surprise that in Panarin ’s scenario the breakaway “ countries ” all succumb to foreign influence and are not really independent .
In contrast American scenarios of breakup envision the resultant countries — like the Pacifica coast — as vibrant independent influences themselves .
It is certain that in the long run , the borders of the US will change .
I think it is far from clear how it will change at the moment .
I would be willing to bet the US will add something ( Puerto Rico ? ) before it subtracts , but that is a minor matter .
History is betting that at some point the nation as we know it will break up .
So , to my fellow Americans , happy new year !
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores Inc and other top U.S. retailers delivered disappointing December same - store sales and profit warnings on Thursday , sparking fresh recession concerns that hit stock and currency markets .
Nearly a dozen retailers , including Macy ’s and Target Corp , told investors that profits would take a further hit in the fourth quarter , which includes key holiday sales .
The results confirmed that the U.S. recession , job losses and winter storms right before Christmas produced the most dismal holiday shopping season in nearly 40 years .
The International Council of Shopping Centers said holiday sales , which include November and December , fell 2.2 percent -- the worst result since it began compiling such data in 1970 .
The new year is not expected to bring relief , with the ICSC forecasting a 1 percent decline in January sales at U.S. retail chains open at least a year , or same - store sales .
Wal - Mart , the world ’s largest retailer , surprised investors who have seen it outperform rivals as the store of choice in a downturn .
Its U.S. December same - store sales rose 1.7 percent , excluding gasoline -- worse than Wall Street ’s expectation of a 2.8 percent increase .
It also cut its profit forecast for its fourth quarter , which began on November 1 .
While some retailers beat sales expectations , many of those did so only by slashing prices , which will hammer fourth - quarter margins .
“ The sales numbers are not a lot worse than expected , but I think what ’s really going to take a toll on these companies is when you report earnings and you see what kind of discounts you had to have to pull the numbers , ” Morningstar analyst Joe Beaulieu said .
Wal - Mart shares fell 7.5 percent .
The Standard & Poor ’s retail index rose 0.8 percent .
The Wal - Mart news weighed most of the day on U.S. stocks , helped U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains in a safe haven bid and prompted a tumble in the U.S. dollar .
Overall , same - store sales fell 0.9 percent , according to the Thomson Reuters index of 35 stores , slightly better than the 1 percent decline forecast .
Excluding Wal - Mart , the drop was 3.6 percent , better than an expected 4.8 percent decline .
WEAKER JANUARY EXPECTED
The report from Wal - Mart was the latest sign of how the recession has prompted consumers to cut down on any but the most essential purchases .
“ The economy is in real difficult shape here , and their core consumers , lower - and middle - income consumers , that have really been flocking there cut back on discretionary spending , ” said Ken Perkins , president of research firm Retail Metrics .
With the holidays over and nothing to spur recession - wracked consumers to shop until a new economic stimulus plan is approved by Congress , analysts expect the coming months to remain tough for retailers .

Wal - Mart said January same - store sales could be flat to up 2 percent .
Rival Target Corp said sales could show a mid - single - digit decline .
Limited Brands Inc , parent of Victoria ’s Secret , forecast a mid- to - high teens drop in January .
Other retailers posting share price declines were Abercrombie & Fitch Co , down 3.5 percent after saying that fourth - quarter profit would be far below its previous forecast .
Some gainers included Sears Holdings Corp , up 23 percent after forecasting fourth - quarter profit above Wall Street estimates and Urban Outfitters Inc , which said same - store sales at its namesake stores rose 3 percent during the holiday .
REPEATED MARKDOWNS
Retailers across the board offered deep discounts to lure shoppers in the holiday season , often repeatedly marking down items like clothing as traffic to stores proved weak .
Profit warnings spanned from the lowest end of the retail spectrum to upscale store chains .
Macy ’s same - store sales fell 4 percent in December , besting the average analyst estimate of a 5.3 percent drop , and said it would close 11 stores .
But the company cut its fourth - quarter profit forecast on expectations for a steeper decline in November - January .
Department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc said same - store sales fell a less - than - expected 8.1 percent , but the company had to cut prices aggressively to help sales in the later part of the month .
Clothing seller J Crew Group
Inc expects a loss of 24 to 29 cents a share for the quarter instead of a previously forecast profit of 5 to 10 cents .
Gap Inc same - store sales fell 14 percent , worse than the 9.3 percent average forecast , and said fourth - quarter profit would be worse than analysts expected .
Luxury retailer Nordstrom
Inc said deep markdowns meant it would not meet its fourth - quarter earnings forecast , while Saks Inc still expects a drop in fourth - quarter gross margin from a year ago .

Theexistence of massive stars ?
up to a whopping 120 times the mass of the sun ?
haslong perplexed astronomers .
The big question was how these stellar behemothsreached their enormous sizes without blowing off all the gas that feeds them .
A newcomputer simulation of starformation has found a surprisingly simple solution to how these stars mightget around this problem .
The newfindings , detailed in the Jan. 16 issue of the journal Science , alsoexplain why thesegiants tend to occur in binary or multiple star systems .
" Wedidn ?t ' set out to solve that question , so it was a nice side benefit of thestudy , " said study leader Mark Krumholz of the University of California , Santa Cruz .
Balancingforces
When a starbegins to form , two opposing forces are at play .
One is the pull of gravitycreating by the rotating gas cloud from which the star is born .
Gravity pullsthe gaseous material in , feeding the protostar .
The otherforce , called radiation pressure , is generated by the growing star itself .
Thispressure is the force exerted by electromagnetic radiation on the surfaces itstrikes .
For ordinary light , this force is nearly negligible , but it becomessignificant in the interior of stars because of the intensity of theirradiation .
For massivestars , radiation pressure is the dominant outward - flowing force counteractinggravity 's inward pull to prevent the further collapse of the star .
Previousstudies had suggested that radiation pressure would blow away a star 's gascloud before the star could grow much larger than 20 times the mass of the sun .
" Whenyou apply the radiation pressure from a massive star to the dusty interstellargas around it , which is much more opaque than the star 's internal gas , itshould explode the gas cloud , " Krumholz explained .
Yet plentyof these massive stars have been spotted by astronomers ( though they are rarerthan small stars ) .
Surprisesolution
Krumholzand his colleagues solved the dilemma with a three - dimensional computersimulation of the collapse of a giant interstellar gas cloud to form a massivestar .
Their research was funded by the National Science Foundation , NASA andthe U.S. Department of Energy .
As thedusty gas collapsed , onto the star 's growing core , instabilities developed thatresulted in channels where radiation blew out through the cloud intointerstellar space , while gas continued falling inward through other channels .
" Youcan see fingers of gas falling in and radiation leaking out between thosefingers of gas , " Krumholz said .
" This shows that you do n't need anyexotic mechanisms ; massive stars can form through accretion processes just likelow - mass stars . "
The disk ofthe collapsing gas also did something unexpected : it clumped to form a seriesof small secondary stars , mostof which collided into the primary star , but some of which came to be starsin their own right and formed a multiple star system .
" Ithink now we can consider the mystery of how massive stars are able to form tobe solved , " Krumholz said .
The eight states enjoying the greatest net in -migration of people from other states between 2000 - 2008 all have Right to Work laws .
But of the eight states suffering the worst out - migration , only Katrina - hit Louisiana has such a law ( see chart below ) .
" Study after study has shown that forced unionism eliminates job opportunities and cuts employees ' real incomes .
Apparently , ordinary citizens know these studies are right .
A new U.S. Census Bureau report shows that the massive 1990s exodus of employees and their families from forced - unionism states is accelerating during the current decade .
According to the report , between April 1 , 2000 and July 1 , 2008 , a net total of 4.7 million Americans moved from forced - unionism states to Right to Work states .
That 's on top of a net population transfer of nearly five million Americans to Right to Work states during the 1990s . "
A Spanish judge today opened preliminary investigations into claims that a bomb attack on Gaza in 2002 warranted the prosecution of a former Israeli defence minister and six senior military officers for crimes against humanity .
Judge Fernando Andreu agreed to ­investigate the deaths of 15 Palestinians , mostly babies and children , who died when the Israeli air force bombed a target in Gaza City .
He named the former defence minister Benjamin Ben Eliezer , the former defence chief - of - staff Moshe Ya'alon , the former air force chief Dan Halutz , and four ­others .
Andreu , an investigating magistrate at the national court in Madrid , said evidence presented to his court showed the seven men may have committed the sort of crimes against humanity which Spain was bound by international laws to prosecute .
The magistrate accepted that the aim of the 2002 attack had been to kill Saleh ­Shehadeh , who he described as a suspected leader of " the terrorist group called Hamas " .
But the Israeli air force appeared to have dropped such a huge bomb on Shehadeh 's house that it was inevitably going to kill many other innocent people living nearby , Andreu said .
Israeli authorities had not replied to his request for information on the case after the Gaza - based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights presented a writ in the victims ' names last April .
" These events can and should be investigated by Spanish courts , especially as there has been no reply at all to this court 's request for relevant information from the state of Israel , " he said .
" Between 11.30 pm and midnight on July 22 2002 , a one - tonne bomb was dropped by an Israeli air force F - 16 on the al - Daraj neighbourhood of Gaza City , " ­Andreu said in a court document laying out the evidence presented to him .
" The objective was the house of Salah Shehadeh , suspected of being a Hamas leader , and the intention was to kill him .
" Salah Shehadeh 's house took a direct hit from a highly powerful bomb , even though it was situated in one of the world 's most densely populated residential zones , " he said .
Most of the victims represented in the case were related to a Mr Mattar , who lived in the house next door .
" The two houses were less than two metres apart , " the magistrate said .
" As a result of the attack his home was destroyed and seven members of his family were killed . "
Fifteen people , including Shehadeh , died and a further 150 were said to have been injured .
Andreu is acting under a doctrine that allows prosecution in Spain of alleged crimes against humanity or crimes such as terrorism or genocide , even if they are committed in another country .
Spanish magistrates have used the doctrine to pursue a number of current or former government leaders , but convictions or extraditions have been rare .
Spain 's national court , which has tried and jailed human rights abusers from Latin American countries in recent years , has become a first stop for people wanting to bring cases under international human rights laws .
Israel 's former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said : " It 's absurd ; Israel is fighting against war criminals and they are charging us with crimes ?
There is nothing more ridiculous and absurd than them accusing us , a democracy legitimately protecting itself against terrorists and war criminals , of these crimes ; it is absurd and makes a mockery out of international law . "

Lawyers representing the Westfield Sportsman 's Club said Friday the club is innocent of any wrongdoing in the death of an 8 - year - old boy who accidentally shot himself in the head with a Micro Uzi submachine gun at the club in October .
Meanwhile , a lawyer representing Pelham Police Chief Edward B. Fleury , who was charged in the death because he owns the company that co-sponsored the gun show , also denied Friday that his client is responsible .
Northampton lawyer Charles F. Ksieniewicz , one of two lawyers representing Fleury , said Friday " We were disappointed in the indictment .
We intend to defend it . "
The club , Fleury and two other men were indicted Thursday on involuntary manslaughter counts in the death of 8 - year - old Christopher J. Bizilj of Ashford , Conn. , who accidentally shot himself in the head at the Machine Gun Shoot and Firearms Expo Oct. 26 at the sportsman 's club .
The sportsmen 's club will enter a plea of not guilty when it is arraigned on a charge of involuntary manslaughter , lawyers for the club said Friday .
The club will also deny allegations that it furnished a machine gun to minors for use during the gun show on the club grounds on Furrowtown Road , said attorneys Thomas " Tom " Drechasler , of Boston , and Edward F. George Jr. , of Malden .
Drechasler will represent the club during criminal proceedings in Hampden County Superior Court , while George will defend the club in any civil complaints that may be filed as a result of the charges filed against it Thursday by Hampden County District Attorney William M. Bennett .
" The club is a corporation and a sportsmen 's association established in 1949 .
It is a non-profit organization run by volunteers and has never experienced an incident like this in its history , " Drechasler said .
He said the club did not furnish machine guns to minors during the Oct. 26 event ; they were provided " by other entities which were not acting as agents of Westfield Sportsman 's Club . "
Drechasler and George said that as a corporation , officers of the club will not be required to be present during court arraignment .
They also said club officers have been advised not to discuss the case with the media .
However , Drechasler said he does expect club representatives will attend the court proceedings .
In Pelham , selectmen said they will continue to talk to town counsel about their options regarding the police chief .
On Monday , at the board 's regularly scheduled meeting , selectmen will officially appoint Lt. Gary L. Thomann as acting chief .
Thomann has informally been acting chief since the shooting .
Fleury is the owner of COP Firearms & Training , a private company owned by Fleury and co-sponsor of the gun show .
Also indicted on involuntary manslaughter charges were two other individuals , identified in court records as Carl Giuffre , of Hartford , and Domenico Spano , of New Milford , Conn .
Fleury and the sportsman 's club were each also indicted by a Hampden Superior Court grand jury on four counts of furnishing a machine gun to a person under 18 .
The boy 's father , Dr. Charles Bizilj , who was reaching for his camera when his son was shot , was not charged .
Fleury has not commented since the accident , although he did release a statement through his lawyers expressing his sorrow for the accident and pledging to cooperate with investigators .
He continues to remain out of work on paid sick leave , Selectman Edward C. Martin said Friday .
Martin , police liaison , said Thomann has been with the department for more than a decade .
Selectmen have also promoted reserve officer Christopher Rice to a part - time position " to make up some of the time " caused by Fleury 's absence , he said .
The board would not comment on whether Fleury will be asked to resign or take a leave of absence .
" Chief Fleury is still on sick leave .
We are aware of the indictments against him , " said Chairman William R. Martell .
" We are in contact with town counsel regarding our options . "
Other than appointing Thomann Monday night , he said " the board of selectmen will not have any further comment "

Output to a new buffer .
htmlize - file .
Takes a input file name , output to new file .
This will help us a lot .
Here 's a outline of our algorithm :
Grab the text inside the < pre class= " lang_name " >…</ pre > tag the cursor is in .
Create a temp buffer .
Insert the text in .
Set the new buffer to a major mode corresponding to lang_name , and fontify it .
Call htmlize - buffer
From the htmlize - buffer output , grab the ( htmlized ) text inside < pre > tag .
Kill the htmlize output buffer and my temp buffer .
Delete the original text , insert in the htmlized text .
To achieve the above , i decided on 2 steps :
Write a function “ htmlize - string ” that takes a string and mode name , and returns the htmlized string .
Write a function “ htmlize - pre - block ” that does the steps of grabbing text , calls “ htmlize - string ” , then replace original text with the new .
Htmlize String Function
The “ htmlize - string ” takes a string and a mode name , and returns a htmlized string .
( defun xah - html - htmlize - string ( @input - str @major - mode - name ) " Take @input - str and return a htmlized version using @major - mode - name .
The purpose is to syntax color source code in HTML .
If @major - mode - name is string .
It 'll be converted to symbol and if is not in `obarray ' , `fundamental - mode ' is used .
This function requires the `htmlize - buffer ' from htmlize.el by Hrvoje Niksic . Version 2018 -09 - 28 " ( interactive ) ( let ( $ output - buff $ resultStr ( $ majorModeSym ( intern - soft @major - mode - name ) ) ) ( with - temp - buffer ( insert @input - str ) ( if ( fboundp $ majorModeSym ) ( funcall $ majorModeSym ) ( fundamental - mode ) ) ( font - lock - ensure ) ( setq $ output - buff ( htmlize - buffer ) ) ) ( with - current - buffer $ output - buff ( let ( $ p1 $ p2 ) ( setq $ p1 ( search - forward " < pre > " ) ) ( setq $ p2 ( search - forward " < / pre > " ) ) ( setq $ resultStr ( buffer - substring - no - properties (+ $ p1 1 ) ( - $ p2 6 ) ) ) ) ) ( kill - buffer $ output - buff ) $ resultStr ) )
It 's called like this :

Setting Up htmlize.el and CSS
Note : quote from htmlize.el 's header documentation :
htmlize supports three types of HTML output , selected by setting `htmlize - output - type ' : `css ' , `inline - css ' , and `font ' .
In `css ' mode , htmlize uses cascading style sheets to specify colors ; it generates classes that correspond to Emacs faces and uses < span class= FACE >…</ span > to color parts of text .
My functions assume you are using the CSS mode output .
This means , you 'll have to do a one - time manual process of taking the CSS code generated by the htmlized output and place it in your own HTML page to reference it .
You can use my CSS code for language here :
pre { font - family : " Courier " , monospace ;} pre . bash , pre . bash - output , pre . bbcode , pre .code , pre .cpp , pre .css , pre .emacs-lisp , pre .html , pre .java , pre .js , pre .mathematica , pre .ocaml , pre .org - mode , pre .output , pre . perl , pre . python , pre .

If your HTML is in Unicode UTF - 8 encoding , you might add the following to your emacs init file :
( progn ( require ' htmlize ) ( when ( fboundp ' htmlize - region ) ( setq htmlize - convert - nonascii - to- entities nil ) ( setq htmlize - html - charset " utf - 8 " ) ( setq htmlize - untabify nil ) ) )
They will prevent htmlize creating ugly HTML entities .
For example , if you have a bullet char “ • ” ( Unicode U+2022 ) , you will see the character as is instead of • .
If you are not familiar with {HTML , CSS} , see :
Dehtmlize Text , and Move Code to a File
It 's also convenient to remove all the span tags and get just plain source code text .
Also , a command to move the current pre code block into a file .
So you can actually run the code .
For these commands , see Emacs : Xah HTML Mode
JavaScript Solution
Google has a open source technology that uses JavaScript to color code in HTML on the fly instead of using the bulky markup .

Did Bush cause the financial crisis ?
By Greg Wood
BBC North America Business Correspondent , New York
" Consider the terrible consequences of the ' anything goes ' Bush Administration , whose irresponsible non-regulation of financial institutions has led to this crisis . "
President Bush was not always a champion of deregulation
Those words , from the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi , sum up the charge against George W Bush - that in the eight years of his presidency he actively pursued policies of deregulation which caused the biggest financial and economic meltdown since the Great Depression .
It is a grim legacy for President Bush to contemplate as he enters his final days in office - but is it true ?
Market collapse
He certainly presided over a widespread failure of regulation .
On his watch , the US authorities did little to prevent the sale of millions of mortgages to people who could never afford them .
They failed to police the market in mortgage - backed securities which has now collapsed with such devastating consequences .
And credit default swaps , those multi-billion - dollar bets on other people going bust , went virtually unregulated .
In recent days , Congress has been holding hearings to determine how the regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) missed numerous warning signs - " Red Flags " - about Bernard Madoff , the man accused of running a gigantic Ponzi scheme which has defrauded investors of at least $ 50 bn .
The image of Mr Bush as the arch deregulator and the Democrats as the champions of stricter rules for business does not quite tally with the evidence
Paul Kanjorski , the Democratic Representative who is chairing the hearings , argued that the SEC 's failings were - in part - due to chronic understaffing , implying that the Bush Administration had starved the agency of the resources needed to do its job .
In the blame game for this financial crisis , George W Bush comes a close second to greedy and unscrupulous Wall Street bankers .
But there are serious flaws in this argument .
Deregulation started long before President Bush came to power , and it was enthusiastically pursued by both Democratic and Republican administrations .
Here is just one example : The Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 separated the activities of commercial banks , which take deposits , from investment banks , which invest money .
It was repealed in 1999 .
That relaxation of the rules enabled commercial lenders , like Citigroup , to trade instruments such as mortgage - backed securities and collateralised debt obligations .
' Far - reaching reform '
Many see the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act as a major , direct cause of the current financial crisis .
But it was signed by a Democratic President , Bill Clinton , and supported by many other Democratic politicians , among them the scourge of Bush deregulation Nancy Pelosi .
What is more , President Bush actually increased the burden of regulation on US companies , enacting in 2002 what he called " the most far - reaching reform of American business practices since the time of Franklin D Roosevelt " , the Sarbanes - Oxley Act .
A response to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals , including the collapse of the energy group Enron , Sarbanes - Oxley significantly increased the reporting requirements and accountability of company boards and management .
As president , he bears the ultimate political responsibility and his party has paid the ultimate political price
So the image of Mr Bush as the arch deregulator and the Democratic Party as the champion of stricter rules for business does not quite tally with the evidence .
But Mr Bush is not entirely blameless .
Affordable home ownership , especially for African - American and Hispanic borrowers , who had traditionally found it difficult and expensive to get a mortgage , was a key policy goal of the Clinton administration and one enthusiastically carried forward by President Bush .
A laudable aim - but there is evidence that it led to severe political pressure on mortgage providers to lower their lending standards , spawning the now infamous " NINJA " loans for borrowers with " No Income , no Job or Assets . "
The mortgage finance company Fannie Mae was also being urged to fulfil its mission of helping low income homeowners by buying up more and more risky loans .
This political pressure , as well as rock - bottom interest rates and unscrupulous lending practices , helped to inflate the sub - prime housing bubble .
President Bush must take his share of the blame .
There is no doubt that George W Bush is a natural supporter of deregulation and that his administration did nothing to stop all sorts of questionable financial activities in the private sector ( even though it did not condone them ) .
As president , he bears the ultimate political responsibility and his party has paid the ultimate political price .
But this financial crisis has many causes , being - as it is - the product of conflicting human emotions and imperfect markets and organisations .
It is impossible to blame it all on one man .

While the closure of Circuit City may mean excellent ( and not so excellent ) deals on video games and electronics , it can also mean buyer remorse .
Especially when one considers the " All sales are final " policy .

Reader John tells us his tale of nonreturnable woe , a massive disappointment to the tune of $ 7.50 .
Advertisement
" I went into Circuit City today to capitalize on their misfortune , and saw a copy of Resident Evil 4 for PS2 on sale for $ 7.50 .
Upon waiting in the checkout line , I saw a sign that said , ' All sales are final . '
I figured it was fine , because , for seven bucks , you could n't go wrong .
Well , you could . "
John continues .
" I got home and opened my purchase to see this monstrosity of a game disc .
Also I can't play or return it .
All I have to say is : ' Shit . ' "
Buyer beware .
And if anyone sees " Danny " — who probably also returned a no - longer - working paper shredder to the same Circuit City — make sure to give him the world 's most painful charlie horse .
He deserves it .
Normally I try to avoid posting straight business news , but I think that these 3 stories combine to something meaningful .
Muleguy noted Microsoft is laying off 5,000 , Mspangler reports that Intel is cutting 5 - 6 k , while nonyabidness afraid4 myjob submitted that IBM Layoffs have begun with no number , but estimates as high as 16,000 .
To underscore that voting third party or not voting at all will help elect McCain and Palin , and thereby re-empower the self - righteous ideologues who berated progressives , liberals , democrats , greens , libertarians , etc. , for the past 8 years while their leaders were on board , I 've asked my fantastic vlogger collaborator , Sharona L. Smith ( VoiceOfAmericans2008 ) , to compile a short video of some of the harassment we 've endured .
Before you decide NOT to vote for Barack Obama , who I view as our most realistic HOPE to restore some sense of sanity to our rapidly failing world , I implore you to watch Sharona 's masterful 4 + minute compilation of pro-Obama / pro-McCain confrontations ... and more :
Please understand that these pro-war , pro-torture , anti-women , anti-science , racist , bigoted , uninformed , self - righteous taunters will be re-empowered if THEIR candidates are elected to office .
This would be a travesty !
Please tell me : do you really want McCain and Palin elected ?
Do you really want to empower these vicious right wing zealots and fanatics who support them ?
I know you 've debated ad nauseam on your choice to vote third party .
You 've stated and restated your case .
And there lies the rub - IT 'S YOUR CASE !
It 's right for you .
It 's justice for YOU .
But is it right for America and is it right for the world ?
Will a Barack Obama presidency really be as bad as John McCain ?
I know Barack Obama did n't vote as we wanted on FISA .
I get that his policy toward Afghanistan is WRONG .
He should n't have supported the bailout .
I 'm still angry at his first vote in the U.S. Senate to confirm Condoleeza Rice .
I get it .
The guy AIN'T PERFECT .
But he 's still got to win .
Barack Obama is the ONLY candidate who can defeat McCain and Palin .
I understand the need for a Third Party , and a Fourth Party , and a Fifth .
But timing is EVERYTHING .
We have to defeat McCain and Palin !!
If we do n't beat McCain and Palin we elect an apoplectic madman and a manipulating twit .
There 's no other way to put it .
This IS THE TRUTH !!
No matter how much you respect Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney for their progressivism , and Ron Paul for his libertarianism , they 're not going to win .
No matter how much Bob Barr wants to save our privacy , he 's not going to win .
Voting for Nader , McKinney , Paul and Barr in a heartfelt act of passion will provide YOU a moment of pleasure and the world insurmountable pain .
If you buy Obama 's mega - lead as sold by corporate media , you 'll be ill - advised .
Even if it 's true for right now , THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTES !!
Republicans are dirty tricking every second so Obama will lose .
For weeks now , conservatives led by Rush Limbaugh and CNN's Lou Dobbs , have been instigating the challenge to an Obama victory by charging ACORN ( Association of Community Organizations For Reform Now ) , a grassroots bottom up organization , with purposeful voter registration fraud .
The fact is , ACORN has been around for 40 years mobilizing and assisting the disenfranchised our society has left behind - while Lords Dobbs and Limbaugh have been living lives of riches .
I 'd trust ACORN any day over these class - monger race - baiting whores .
This election cycle , with the possibility of the first African American president , voters are more energized than ever and registering in record numbers .
While conservative media is smearing ACORN and working to incite violence if Obama wins , MCCLATCHY NEWSPAPERS , a legitimate news source , is reporting THE TRUTH that will hopefully drown out partisans like Limbaugh and Dobbs .
As MCCLATCHY reports , ACORN was sloppy with its registrations - NOT fraudulent .
With this throng of new registrants there will be a percent that are n't valid .
This is nothing new .
There are registrations in every election that are discarded after vetting .
What 's different this year is the vast number of new registrations .
By law , ACORN must turn in EVERY registration - even those it has flagged as questionable or false .
Nonetheless , right wing activist Dobbs calls ACORN a " radical left wing activist group . "
Sadly , for racist Dobbs , any organization that is predominantly non-white and non-rich is radical , self - serving and left wing .
Point of fact , John McCain and Sarah Palin are a danger to our nation .
Electing them would be a travesty .
The only way to ensure their loss is to vote for Obama in record numbers .
Even though the popular vote does n't win an election , the larger the popular vote the more legitimacy is afforded a challenge to a questionable election .
I want Obama and Biden to win this nation in a landslide .
Do n't you ??
Yes , I want a Third Party - but I 'm still going to vote for Obama .
Call me a hypocrite if you want to .
But this year I 'm chasing the rainbow .
AND I'M BEGGING YOU TO CHASE IT , TOO !!

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Leon Panetta , chief of staff in President Bill Clinton 's White House , will be President - elect Barack Obama 's choice to be CIA director , two Democratic officials told CNN on Monday .
Leon Panetta , who has a strong background in economics , was chief of staff for President Bill Clinton .
The officials also said retired Adm. Dennis Blair , who formerly headed the U.S. Navy 's Pacific Command , will be tapped as director of national intelligence .
Panetta , 70 , has had a long political career , beginning in 1966 when he served as a legislative assistant to U.S. Sen .
Thomas H. Kuchel . R-California .
He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1977 , serving California 's 16th ( now 17th ) District until Clinton appointed him to head the Office of Budget and Management in 1993 .
He was chief of staff from 1994 to 1997 .
Panetta and his wife , Sylvia , founded and co-direct the Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University , which provides study opportunities for students there and at several other schools .
He serves on several boards and committees , and lectures internationally on economics .
With a strong background in economics , Panetta has little hands - on experience in intelligence .
But he is known as a strong manager with solid organizational skills .
Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , who will be the new chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said she had not been told in advance of Panetta 's selection .
" My position has consistently been that I believe the agency is best served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time , " the California Democrat said .
But Sen. Ron Wyden , a senior member of the Intelligence Committee , said he was consulted on the pick and praised Panetta .
" I believe he has the skills to usher in a new era of accountability at the nation 's premier intelligence agency , " said Wyden , D - Oregon .
" For too long our nation 's intelligence community has operated under a policy of questionable effectiveness and legality in which consulting two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee counted as ' consulting with Congress . ' "
Sen . Kit Bond , R- Missouri , the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee , also questioned Panetta 's lack of intelligence experience , as did outgoing committee chairman Sen.

Rep . Pete Hoekstra , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , would n't comment until Obama makes an announcement , but his spokesman said that Hoekstra " has called for a new direction and a change in the culture a the CIA for some time . "
" Whether it is Leon Panetta or someone else , it is important the agency move in a new direction , " Jamal Ware said .
Blair , 61 , was a 1968 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and attended Oxford University in Britain as a Rhodes scholar at the same time as Clinton .
Blair retired from the Navy in 2002 .
He was the CIA 's first associate director of military support and served on the National Security Council .
He has been sharply critical of U.S. policy in terms of strategic long - term planning .

" I am in awe of the sophisticated strategies that American politicians can devise and pursue over many years , " he told a House panel in July .
" They involve very public activities -- speeches , programs , alliances -- but also backroom deals , and stratagems , tactical flexibility but strategic constancy , investment in intellectual and organizational capabilities that will not pay off for years .
" I have yet to see these same brilliant politicians come up with similar strategies to advance the national interest when they come into national office .
Our national strategies show little of the depth , brilliance and effectiveness of the domestic political strategies this country produces . "
Blair also is known in Navy circles for once trying to water - ski behind the destroyer he skippered , the USS Cochrane .

The final stop on our impressions trip takes us to wonderful SimCity , the sim game that started it all , for the iPhone and iPod Touch .

I originally scoffed at the idea of a game like SimCity on the iPhone .
Not only does the game require a large investment of time to do anything , the idea of using the touch screen to place buildings meticulously on a grid seems impractical .
EA may have proved me wrong , however , as it seems they have found a way to compensate for your fat , ungroomed fingers .
The controls act the same way they do for Google maps .
Sliding your fingers together , inward , zooms out , while sliding them apart zooms in .
Touching and dragging moves your view around the map , while continuous taps cycles through the zoom levels .
Placing singular objects is simple , but placing large zones or roads can be tricky to maneuver .
Once you 've selected the zone you want , you touch and drag to the appropriate length and width .
However , there are times when you may find zones overlapping or roads not lining up properly .
EA allows for easy corrections as you can reposition or delete unwanted blocks by the touch of a finger .
I found this to be a little wonky at times the more dense an area becomes due to the increased chances of deleting the wrong block or building .

Looking into the discursive context of these developments in agriculture , we again find plentiful references to eugenic thought current at the time ( cf. Kevles , 1985 ; Paul , 1995 ) .
The Journal of Heredity , official organ of the American Genetics Association , is an exemplary source for this connection .
It consists of a breath - taking and sometimes curious mix of papers on plant and animal breeding research on the one hand , and population issues , twin research and ‘ ‘ race problems ’ ’ on the other .
Orator F. Cook , one of the most prolific writers of the journal , member of its editorial board and employee at the USDA 's Bureau of Plant Industry , wrote about plant geography in Peru , about economic problems of American farmers , about the dangers of race mixing and the necessity of a ‘ ‘ rural eugenics ’ ’ for the US , anxiously arguing that ‘‘ the race must be immunized against urbanism ’’ ( Cook , 1935 , p. 204 ; see also Cook , 1925 , 1928 ) .
Jack H. Kempton , also with the USDA and a learned corn breeder , dealt with the origin of cultivated plants and with eugenic measures to improve the American human stock .
Plant breeding in maize , he wrote , could serve as a good model for eugenics , the maize plant thus becoming ‘ ‘ a sort of beneficent Frankenstein ’’ ( Kempton , 1926 , p. 51 ) .
Meanwhile , the ‘ ‘ human stocks ’’ sections at state agricultural fairs featured ‘‘ Fitter Families ’’ contests throughout the country ( Squiers , 2001 , p. 10 ) .

Roystonea , the royal palms , are the most striking palms in the Caribbean , and arguably , in the world ( though , granted , a talipot palm in flower comes a close second ) .
The name of the genus was coined by Orator F. Cook , an American botanist , in 1900 , in honour of Roy Stone , an American general involved in the capture of Puerto Rico during the Spanish - American war .
I 've wondered for years why Cook replaced what seemed to be a perfectly good generic name , Oreodoxa , with Roystonea ... turns out that there were problems with Oreodoxa that were not easily addressed .
Over the course of trying to figure that out , I started reading some of Cook 's writing .
The article in which he first proposed the namegives fascinating insight into the state of botanical nomenclature a century ago ( now there 's a subject I can imagine throngs of people being fascinated by ) , so I did a search on Web of Science to see what else of his I could easily find .
And what I found made me wish that I had never started looking .
In between Cooks solid publications about genetics , taxonomy and evolution you find articles ( mostly book reviews , from the look of it ) with titles like Human Hybrids in Virginiaand Idiots as Reversions : Mongolism and Other Abnormalities Ascribed to Racial Interbreeding .
Cook , as it turns out , was a eugenicist .
Eugenics and marketing - " if inferior people have 4 children while superior people have 2 , this is what will happen " Now , it 's important to look at historical writing in the appropriate context .
In Idiots as Reversions ( a review of F.G. Crookshank 's The Mongol in Our Midst , a Study of Man and his Three Faces )
Cook actually takes a more progressive approach than the author , who asserts that the three human races ( Europeans , African and Asians ) actually evolved from different ape species ( chimpanzees , gorillas and gibbons respectively ) .
And despite his obvious distaste for mixing of the races , he is willing to concede in the face of data that it can be an advantage to the " less advanced " races ( and suggests that Chinese men be allowed to settle the more primitive parts of the world and introduce superior genes into these populations ) .
He even objected to Virginia 's anti-miscegenation laws as too restrictive on American Indians .
( Actually he did n't ; see my clarification below . )
Despite being willing to try to interpret this sort of thing in an appropriate context , it can be mind - boggling .
Michael Flitner ( 2003 ) , in a fascinating article which looks at agricultural moderisation and eugenics in the US , USSR and Germany writes : Creationists like to use eugenics in their attempts to discredit modern biology ; last year 's propaganda movie , Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed is an excellent example of this .
But even as we reject their spin , it 's our responsibility as scientists to address and come to terms with this dark period in our own history .
While we cannot reject Cook 's scientific contribution simply on the basis of his embrace of racist pseudoscience , we also can't simply ignore it either .
Sloppy thinking , after all , is sloppy thinking .
President Obama ’s interview with al - Arabiya television is remarkable in several ways , but what strikes me the most is that it coincided with the first air strikes on Pakistan under his administration : 22 people were killed , including between four and seven Taliban / al - Qaeda bad guys .
In the Arabiya interview , Obama was at his charming best , and the easily charmed were bowled over .
Andrew Sullivan , for example , fairly swooned , and announced it ’s " about the same thing as inviting Rick Warren or supping with George Will : it ’s about R - E - S - P - E - C - T . "
What would you say if the police came into your neighborhood to confront reported criminals , killed a few  and also managed to knock off 18 or so bystanders ?
Would you say this shows the police respect the neighborhood ?
All the sweet talk wo n’t drown out the protests of the elected president of Afghanistan , who wants us to stop bombing his people too .
Yet , truth be told , Obama ’s honeyed words are alluring :
" My job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well - being of the Muslim world , that the language we use has to be a language of respect .
I have Muslim members of my family .
I have lived in Muslim countries . "
" Al - Arabiya : The largest one . "
" Obama : The largest one , Indonesia .
And so what I want to communicate is the fact that in all my travels throughout the Muslim world , what I ’ve come to understand is that regardless of your faith  and America is a country of Muslims , Jews , Christians , non-believers  regardless of your faith , people all have certain common hopes and common dreams . "
Even as he was speaking , American drones were snuffing out lives and his generals were planning a wider war .
That seems to be the signature Obama style : cool , calm , and collected as he talks out of one side of his mouth , while he ’s giving the order to kill out of the other .
If that does n’t scare you , then you ’ve probably had a little too much of that sweet - tasting Obama - brand Kool - Aid .
Yes , these issues are all " interrelated , " as the current Washington buzzword would have it , albeit not in the way Obama imagines .
Many Muslims worldwide watched his interview on the same day  perhaps in the same newscast  they heard of the Pakistani air strike .
It ’s a short walk , in this instance , from cognitive dissonance to hypocrisy .
The Arabiya interview had some troubling aspects , an undercurrent of hardness running through the feel - good rhetoric , the mailed fist beneath the velvet glove :
" Now , Israel is a strong ally of the United States .
They will not stop being a strong ally of the United States .
And I will continue to believe that Israel ’s security is paramount .
But I also believe that there are Israelis who recognize that it is important to achieve peace .
They will be willing to make sacrifices if the time is appropriate and if there is serious partnership on the other side . "
" Paramount , " according to Merriam - Webster ’s online dictionary , means " superior to all others . "
This is what President Obama is telling the peoples of the region : Israel comes first , over and above the Palestinians , the security interests of Israel ’s neighbors , and maybe even above any moral concerns one might have .
( You ’ll note he did n’t condemn Israel ’s brutality in Gaza , even though the interviewer gave him ample scope to do so . )
But there ’s a message in there for us Americans , too : Israel ’s alleged security also trumps U.S. interests in the region , an odd situation that , as Professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt pointed out in their book , The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , has distorted and in many ways poisoned our relations with the Arab world .
Those who criticize our new president on these grounds are bound to be attacked by the party - liners , as Professor Juan Cole has been  if you can take this empty razzing seriously — by the talk - radio lefty Taylor Marsh .
Cole ’s answer to her is priceless :
" The notion that we should not say something critical of the policy of a Democratic president because it might give aid and comfort to the right - wing enemy is completely unacceptable .
It is a form of regimentation , and equivalent to making dissent a sort of treason .
We had enough of that the last eight years ( it used to be from different quarters that I was accused of traitorously succoring the enemy ) .
" I am an analyst , and a truth - teller .
I do n’t work for anyone except , in a vague way , the people of Michigan , who took it into their heads to hire me to tell them about the Middle East , and their charge to me is to call it as I see it .
I serve no interest .
I am a member of the Democratic Party , but I do n’t accept everything in the party platform , and I am not so partisan that I cannot admire politicians and principles of other parties , whether the Greens or ( some ) Republicans .
I did n’t agree to join the Communist Party , such that no dissent is allowed lest it benefit the reactionaries and revanchists . "
Amen , brother .
The occasion for the Obama -ite assault on the respected Professor Cole was " Obama ’s War , " a Salon.com piece that questioned the president ’s announced plan to launch a major escalation of the Afghan war by extending it into Pakistan .
As Obama begins to implement this vastly ambitious military campaign , a mindless " you ’re giving aid and comfort to the ‘ enemy ’ " mindset will increasingly dominate the pro-Obama airwaves  yet on the Internet it ’s a different story , and this is the real playing field on which the future of American politics is being contested .
Do n’t let the Iraq " drawdown "  if and when it occurs  fool you .
Those troops , for the most part , will be transferred to Afghanistan and environs .
Bring the troops home ?
Not a chance .
Aside from signing on to the " war on terrorism " concept , a generational conflict comparable to the Hundred Years War or both World Wars , Obama has also inherited the Bush doctrine , the central canon of which is military preemption of potential threats .
He is now acting on that principle : that ’s what the Pakistan air strikes and the Afghan " surge " are all about .
What rationale is there now for continued U.S. military operations in Afghanistan ?
Osama bin Laden and his crew have long since vanished into obscurity , and there is no real evidence he ’s hiding in the wilds of Waziristan , as is constantly inferred .
U.S. military operations in Pakistan are a blatant violation of international law , and the potential blowback is frightening to think about .
If we destabilize the government of Pakistan , and radical Islamists take possession of the country ’s nuclear weapons 
I do n’t even want to think about it .
Yet this is a very real danger .
If we are really in for an extended military occupation of Afghanistan , and even parts of Pakistan , let ’s hear it from the chief : how long , and at what cost ?
I ’m very much afraid , however , that , like a president he increasingly resembles , he ’s apt to say we must pay any price , bear any burden .
How many will follow him into that abyss ?
It will defend to the death our right to be spared from digital filth .
Part of the Federal Government 's cyber - safety plan , the initiative will block content blacklisted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority .
It is claimed the blacklist will prohibit access to child pornography - and no rational person would argue with that .
Not even Evelyn Hall or Voltaire .
And certainly not me .
Nonetheless , rational people are arguing with a scheme that could block anything a government authority does n't fancy .
Last November , Conroy said the blacklist would filter child - porn sites as well as " other unwanted content " .
How untoward those " other " sites might be is not a matter for public discussion .
The authority 's list issecret .
Naturally , advocates for free speech are troubled and one might say their concerns have been answered with dogged piety .
" If people equate freedom of speech with watching child pornography , then the Rudd Labor Government is going to disagree , " Conroy said in 2007 .
According to some , this particular ministerial blogger has been nothing short of bolshie .
To those who fear their speech will be stifled , or their net access slowed , he has offered a stubborn response : if you 're opposed to the department 's cyber - safety plan , you are opposed to the protection of children .
His evangelical logic seems lost on many , and not only civil liberties groups who are unhappy with his Reverend Lovejoy decree .
Much of the IT community is adamant the clean feed will slow our connectivity .
Normally moderate thinkers are horrified that we 're taking cultural cues from China and North Korea .
Even some child protection workers gently suggest that federal attention and funds would be better disbursed elsewhere .
Nonetheless , it remains difficult to counter the won't - someone - think - of - the - children reasoning without being branded a perve .
Upright people are trying , though .
They 've been loud and eloquent in their censure .
It 's time for the less seemly to have their say .
It 's time for fans of Voltaire , and his civil biographer , Miss Hall , to defend to the death the tastes of people like me .
It 's time to ask : " Wo n't someone think of the porn fans ? " I enjoy pornography .
Perhaps not quite so much as I enjoy living among citizens who take an entitlement to free speech for granted .
But I do like it quite a lot .
And it seems that my porn is endangered .
If Conroy 's clean feed works , which some tech sceptics argue that it cannot , it will prevent access to all pornography .
According to the interpretation of Electronic Frontiers Australia and other advocates , the clean feed will mean that garden - variety X - rated material may not be viewed online in Australian territory .
Further , R18 + content will be prohibited .
And MA15 + sites hosted in Australia will probably go as well .
According to the communication authority 's criteria , everything saucy must go .
This will certainly save many Australian adults thousands of hours .
This will possibly save a handful of unsupervised minors from harm .
But not many .
As a keen internet hobbyist , I can report that one does n't simply amble into X - rated or even R18 + material .
One must actively seek it .
I have become adept at this ; children , presumably , have not .
And if they have , clearly they are the issue of the world 's most reprehensible parents and should be sent to live with Hetty Johnston forthwith .
The usefulness of the World Wide Web is threatened by Conroy .
I have found the medium terribly instructive .
When I am lacking culinary inspiration , I will browse a recipe database .
When my writing is misfiring , I catch up with The New Yorker .
And when my boudoir has become as flavourless as my writing or my food , I go to a website that propriety will not permit me to divulge .
I am very grateful for the DIY stylings of my internet teachers .
And I imagine many others are grateful for the inspiration that gushes from these amateur couplings as well .
Despite the best efforts of some , there is no evidence that pornography will negatively affect me or other consenting adults .
The only lasting effect of my access to porn is a reflex giggle when the pizza delivery man knocks on my door .

Stewart skewers Cheney 's ' dickishness masquerading as introspection ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday January 20 , 2009
Print This Email This Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart turned with a note of nostalgia on Monday to The Daily Show 's final installment of " You Don't Know Dick . "
" Vice - President Cheney said his last goodbyes via an exit interview with Jim Lehrer , " Stewart began , characterizing Cheney 's attitude as one of " defensiveness mixed with dickishness masquerading as introspection . "
" The economic downturn is on a par with the Great Depression , " Lehrer suggested to Cheney .
" Is n't that part of the stewardship of the president and the vice president and his administration to see these things coming and try to prevent them ? "
" Did you see it coming ? "
Cheney shot back .
" You 're an expert . "
Stewart boggled at this .
" This whole thing has been Jim Lehrer 's fault ! " he whispered conspiratorially .
" I knew it !
Lehrer ! "
Lehrer further asked Cheney , " The president has also said that he made some mistakes in the last eight years .
Did you make any ? "
" Well -- make mistakes , " Cheney replied reflectively .
" I can think of places where there were -- where I underestimated things .
...
For example , talking about Iraq , the extent to which the Iraqi population had been beaten down by Saddam Hussein was greater than I anticipated . "
" Is it fair to say , then , " Lehrer continued , " that the miscalculation resulted in the chaotic situation that existed immediately after ... the invasion and all that sort of stuff ? "
" I can't say that , " Cheney shurggled .
" I ca n't link those two particular points . "
At this response , Stewart screeched in anguish .
" You ca n't link those -- you linked Saddam Hussein and 9/11 ! "
Stewart yelled .
" You were the Link - master !
You were Art Linkletter , Linky Tuscadero , Linc from the Mod Squad , Abraham Linkage !
But that mystifies you ! "
" I guess if we expect a man who 's kept alive by IV drips of panda tears and angel blood to understand cause and effect , " concluded Stewart sadly , " we still just do n't know Dick .
And probably never will . "

We 'll compare you to anything we want .
And if you call us out on it , we 'll compare you to ' spinners '
by Jeremy Hooper
If someone mentions marriage equality for same - sex couples in the same sentence as bestiality and incest , is it really " spin " to say that said person is unfairly affixing the three concepts to one another ?
Well listen to this clip from today 's " Liberty Live " radio show and decide for yourself .
In it , Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. makes the gay / brother - loving / sheep - schtupping connection , and Matt Barber defends it / denounces anyone who would dare be offended by it :
Well yes , Matt , the homosexual bloggers will respond to this .
But " spin " ?
Yea ?
That 's what you wanna go with ?
That 's what you think we 're doing ?
Because from where we sit , we quite clearly hear a religious person , Jerry Falwell Jr. , connecting our lives and loves with things that would NEVER be mentioned in the same breath with heterosexual people ( even those who " sin " with premarital sex or adultery ) .
And through our gay ears , we hear a brutal affront to our existences and the acceptance thereof .
So you can call us aggressive self - lovers if you must , Matt , but we are always , always , always , ALWAYS gonna have a thing or two to say when a self - professed personal of morality connects our bond to that which might exist between a human female and a goat !
Liberty Live radio [ LC ]
Your thoughts
And yeah , they 're trying to have it both ways .
" Love the sinner , hate the sin " does n't work AND is unbiblical AND is irrelevant to the discussion of civil marriage rights .
I swear , it 's like they 're trying to drive us nuts .
Posted by : Matt Algren | Jan 21 , 2009 6:09:56 PM
Oh , GREAT !
Another Fartwell !
But , the one thing that Matt Blubber said is that " ... fuckin ' outside of marriage ... " is sinful .
But , then , they do n't want us to be able to get married , so that means that they are making up the rules to suit themselves .
And , yes , using bestiality and pedophilia in the same sentence as same - sex marriage is tantamount to equating the two things .
The lying liars might try to spin it as something else , but ultimately it is what it is .
But , the one thing that is undeniable is that they can no longer attack us based simply on the fact that we are same - sex couples .
They have to bring up more scintillating or salacious topics to fire up the angry , blind hordes now .
They can't do that by just vilifying us .
And , in some sense at least , that is a good thing .
Of course , as an intended result , the stupid among the angry hordes do end up thinking that all LGBT persons are pedophillic bestiallic sex - driven zombies .
I , personally , do n't hear a lot about bestiality , but the way that these guys keep bringing it up , you would think that they all must have secret livestock pens for their personal sexual pleasure .
And , that they must all have dreamy eyes for their siblings .
But , when we point out that ALMOST ALL sexual molestation of children is done by STRAIGHT men ( and women ) , then their attempts to link us to their own sexual proclivities to us , ends up turning around and biting themselves on the ass .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Jan 21 , 2009 6:25:18 PM
Dick Mills ,
Thanks for that .
It is reassuring that they have to go back to beastiality yet again .
On the other hand , that a people who brought reason to the world are being compared to sheep humpers is an outrage .
I just wish our so called leaders would learn to talk back to those creeps , by metioning a historical figure or two and a few of our modest contributions , like logic and democracy and the computer .
Cow screwing indeed .
Part of the problem is our movement is hooked on pretty leaders who could n't argue their way out of a paper bag .
Posted by : Wilberforce | Jan 21 , 2009 7:56:11 PM
I would argue that Matt Barber knows deep down that the comments are inappropriate .
That 's why he was so quick to get his two cents in about the " homosexual bloggers . "
His mind had a " ruh roh " moment and immediately went into spin mode .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Jan 21 , 2009 8:05:03 PM
Falwell Jr.!
Too bad Hee
Haw is n't on TV anymore , but there 's always the 699 Club !
A prediction :
One of these days we 'll hear about little Matty Barber busted in a mens room , tappa tappa tappa .
He will say he was practicing morse code .

This portrait of the Milky Way ’s central region was made by combining images taken by Hubble ’s Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer ( NICMOS ) between February and June 2008 and images previously taken by Spitzer ’s Infrared Astronomy Camera ( IRAC ) .
The region at lower left shows pillars of gas sculpted by winds from hot , massive stars in the Quintuplet cluster .
At the centre of the image , ionised gas surrounding the supermassive black hole at the galactic centre is confined to a bright spiral embedded within a doughnut - shaped ring of gas and dust .
( Hubble image : NASA / ESA /Q D Wang / UMass Amherst ; Spitzer image : NASA / JPL /S Stolovy / Spitzer Science Center / Caltech )
The Milky Way came into unprecedented focus on Monday as astronomers released the sharpest infrared picture yet taken of the roiling furnace at the centre of galaxy .
The new mosaic reveals massive filaments of gas as well as a new population of massive , rogue stars .
The centre of the galaxy is full of hot gas and dust and is thought to harbour a black hole weighing about 4 million Suns .
The area is not easily seen at visible wavelengths , which are largely absorbed and scattered by dust , but astronomers can image the centre using infrared light , which passes through intervening material more easily .
The picture , released at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach , California , combines images taken during 144 orbits of the Hubble Space Telescope with pictures taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope .
The Hubble portion of the panorama is 10 times as sharp as Spitzer ’s map , and covers a 300 - by 115 - light - year area around the centre of the Milky Way .
( Earth sits some 26,000 light years from the galactic centre . )
Advertisement
The new map reveals some 600,000 stars , including a new population of about 200 massive stars .
These stars illuminate the gas around them with strong blasts of radiation , and – curiously – seem to be loners .
That is surprising , since most massive stars near the Milky Way ’s centre are found in one of three star clusters called Central , Quintuplet and Arches .
The newly found stars , on the other hand , are found in isolation , and researchers are not sure if they were born outside the clusters or were cast away from star clusters that were torn apart by gravitational forces in the violent region around the galaxy ’s central black hole .

Jealousy and Envy deny the merit or the novelty of your invention ; but Vanity , when the novelty and merit are established , claims it for its own ...
One would not therefore , of all faculties , or qualities of the mind , wish for a friend , or a child , that he should have that of invention .
For his attempts to benefit mankind in that way , however well imagined , if they do not succeed , expose him , though very unjustly , to general ridicule and contempt ; and if they do succeed , to envy , robbery , and abuse .

The issue of software patentability is an important topic because it affects the environment in which programmers and designers work , software innovation , the health of the software industry , and U.S. competitiveness .
This paper while motivated by " Against Software Patents , " by the League for Programming Freedom in Communications ( Jan 1992 ) , is an overall defense of software patents .
U.S. Patent 4,736,308 , the first patent under the heading " Absurd Patents " in " Against Software Patents " is described : " For example , Apple was sued because the HyperCard program allegedly violates patent number 4,736,308 a patent that covers displaying portions of two or more strings together on the screen , effectively scrolling with multiple subwindows .
Scrolling and subwindows are well - known techniques , but combining them is apparently illegal . "
The League calls this an " outrageous result . "
Based on this description alone , any reasonable person would have to agree .
But I am that inventor and Apple was actually sued on a prior related patent , 4,486,857 .
Because my patents were misrepresented , I researched the other patents described in the League 's article and am reporting my results .
There is much the League did not say about my patent and the circumstances surrounding it .
First , it did not describe my background .
In 1963 I worked on the software for the first computer designed to be a timesharing computer .
I was at Xerox PARC in its early days , wrote two articles for the CACM [ 17,20 ] and a book on user interface design . [ 16 ]
My patent covers a commercial product called Zoomracks [ 19 ] which introduced a new computer metaphor called the card and rack metaphor .
Although there is a MS / DOS version , Zoomracks was marketed primarily on the Atari ST .
Zoomracks developed a strong base of users who used it for a very broad range of applications , but it was a financial struggle largely because Atari did poorly .
In August 1987 , Apple Computer introduced HyperCard which is based on a similar , but more limited card and stack version of the metaphor .
I was then faced with having invested six years of raising money , developing a product , marketing it , and proving its value in the market , only to find I was in debt , my customer base was on a dying computer and Apple was giving away free a more polished and featured , although less elegant , version of the metaphor .
While Apple may not have set out to rip Zoomracks off , it was aware of it ( having seen it under non-disclosure ) , of HyperCard 's similarity to Zoomracks , and Zoomracks ' patents .
HyperCard created expectations that Zoomracks could not meet , and other companies began to develop HyperCard clones .
Meanwhile , I asserted my rights , sued and settled with Apple licensing the patents .
Apple is to be applauded for respecting my patents .
IBM was less respectful :
We had twice brought our patent to its attention with respect to products like HyperCard and we had visibly asserted our patents and sued and settled with Apple by the time IBM decided to bundle what many consider to be a HyperCard clone .
I spent six months patiently trying to deal with IBM .
Finally IBM representatives flew to San Francisco to show us prior art - earlier technology - invalidating our patents that they claimed to have .
When they arrived , they refused to show us the prior art , " for fear the patent office would recertify our patents in error . "
Even if IBM had been straightforward with me during the six months , to accept such an assertion without evidence would have been naive .
Faced with a choice of accepting IBM 's offer of 0.2 % of the $ 5 million IBM is said to have paid to license the token ring patent , or to accept its challenge to " sue us " if we wanted to see the prior art , IBM left me no choice but to fight .
But I have chosen to fight in the court of public opinion where possible , rather than the civil courts where , because of its financial strength , IBM has the advantage .
I added a detailed description of my dealings with IBM to my book [ 16 ] and sent copies of my book to the members of the Commission on Patent Reform when they asked for comments .
Based on my experience I formulated Heckel 's Principle of Dealing with Big Companies :
There is no such thing as a free lunch ; unless you 're the lunch .
With Apple and IBM , I did battle against large companies who were sophisticated about intellectual property , rather than small ones that were not .
I felt it was in everyone 's interest to force companies and the courts to make decisions about software patents so the rules and the marketplace realities can be clear to all .
not just the sophisticated few .
This article is written in that same spirit .
While it is a personal issue , I write to clarify the software patent issues in general , to raise he level of discussion and because like most good inventors , I am curious about what the truth is .
One can only understand the need for patents in the light of a competitive marketplace .
We need a heavy to show what the innovator faces as Humphrey Bogart needed Sidney Greenstreet in The Maltese Falcon .
IBM has already presented itself in that role ; it will reappear as did Sidney Greenstreet .
We will visit the other eight patents mentioned by the League in its article and show that the patents it selected , on examination , disprove its case .
But first , we take the broader view .
Should software be patentable like other technologies ?
The primary issue is a policy one and so we have been influenced by Neustadt and May and their book on governmental decision - making [ 33 ] .
In the background of our analysis are these questions : What analogies ( to software ) exist ?
What are the similarities and differences ?
What are the assumptions , explicit and hidden ?
" What is known ? " " What is the history of the issues ? "
What are the interests of the various players ? "
We will follow the Goldberg rule and ask , not " What is the problem ? " but " What is the story ? "
Most important , we ask , " How did things turn out in the past ? "
History and innovation economics , more than law and computer science , must be the foundation on which to make policy .
We have framed 10 points which are , we believe , the consensus of informed opinion on software patents .
We hope they help you crystallize your thoughts on patents and enable you to better articulate your differences , if any , with the informed opinion .
1 . By creating property rights , patents promote innovation in non -software areas .
They particularly promote innovation from small and mid-size companies .
Most of the arguments against software patents turn out to be arguments against patents per se .
These arguments are advanced most credibly on the basis of established technologies where data and research already exist .
Patents have been accepted around the world as promoting innovation .
Many giants of U.S. industry such as G.E. , AT&T , Polaroid , Xerox and Hewlett - Packard , started as small companies that used patent protection to protect their inventions .
Yet , most of the articles on patents in the trade , business and even academic press read by the computer community [ 5 , 13 , 26,27,28,41,42,48 ] have a an antisoftware patent bias .
The reason is that for every patent there is one patentholder who is reluctant to speak because the issue is complex and what someone says could be used against them in litigation .
And there are a dozen who might like to use the patented technology without paying for it and so are willing to malign the patent and patent system and pass on unsubstantiated rumors and misinformation
Economists have researched innovation in other technologies [ 24 , 31,43 ] and found the following : patents encourage innovation ; and small entities - individual inventors and small companies - are a very important source of innovation .
According to Jewkes et al . [ 24 ] ,
It is almost impossible to conceive of any existing social institution so faulty in so many ways .
It survives only because there seems to be nothing better .
And yet for the individual inventor or the small producer struggling to market a new idea , the patent right is crucially important .
It is the only resource he possesses and , fragile and precarious as his rights may be , without them he would have nothing by which to establish a claim to a reward for his work .
The sale of his ideas directly or the raising of capital for exploiting the ideas would be hopeless without the patent .
While several articles discuss software patent and copyrights [ 8,46,47 ] , few have been written for the software , as opposed to the legal , community [ 11,16,37 ] .
Such studies have only rarely been linked to software [ 7 ] , and , we are unaware of any empirical studies of the effect of software patents on innovation other than this one .
If we are to reject patents in principle , we should argue that case .
If we accept patents as promoting innovation elsewhere but not in software then we should differentiate software from other technologies .
2. Patents have evolved to address the concerns raised by those who suspect software patents .
The courts have developed a patent jurisprudence as a unifying mechanism to support many technologies and foster evolutionary improvement while balancing the rights of patentholders and potential infringers .
Patents have a long history ( see sidebar ) , Most of the concerns about patents raised by the League have been raised long ago in the context of other technologies and addressed in case law and legislation and have stood the test of time .
The patent system , like MS / DOS , is not perfect .
MS / DOS has a long history of evolutionary improvement : it is a derivative of CP /M , which is a derivative of TOPS - 20 , which is a derivative of the SDS - 940 timesharing system which evolved from the first timesharing system developed at BBN about 1960 .
Patent jurisprudence has a similar history of evolution .
Part of the value of patents is they are a proven , public domain standard of intellectual property protection that have a history of evolutionary improvement over 500 years , compared to the 30 or 40 years of experience developing operating systems .
TopView and OS / 2 , demonstrate how developing a new operating system and crystallizing a new infrastructure around it are fraught with dangers known and unknown .
An infrastructure has crystallized around MS / DOS .
It includes developers and consultants who know it , books explaining its use , and commercial products based on it .
Similarly , an infrastructure has crystallized around that patent system .
It includes patent lawyers , case law examples of valid and invalid , infringed and not infringed patents , and books and articles explaining patents to both lawyers and non-lawyers .
3. Patents are not perfect .
There are problems with the patent system .
Only that which is not real is perfect .
The patent community and the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) are aware of the problems and have been working to address them .
A Commission on Patent Reform is considering improvements .
The problems that the patent community sees are these : ( a ) the difficulty and expense of prior art searches ; ( b ) patents being issued with inadequate examination ; ( c ) imprecise claims making it difficult to know whether infringement has occurred ; and ( d ) the length of time the examination process takes .
( This hurts both the patentholder who can't enforce unissued patents and potential infringers who wo n't know about them .
Patents are published automatically 18 months after filing in all other countries . )
None of these problems are unique to software .
If lack of perfection was a reason to get rid of something , no teenager would survive to adulthood .
Other industries find patents useful in spite of these problems ; software will too .
Patents , it is said , inhibit standards .
They do not ; they inhibit the expropriate of intellectual property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment .
Where patents exist standards are created two ways :
Where people want a standard which infringes a patent , the standards body usually negotiates an agreement whereby the patentholder in return for having the technology required as part of a standard , agrees to make a standard license and rate available to all .
Most standards do n't infringe any intellectual property .
The QWERTY keyboard and the standard automobile controls ( Steering wheel , brake and accelerator ) demonstrate that patents do n't inhibit standards creation .
Both public domain standards were developed during the working lifetime of Edison who received 1100 patents .
4 . Software is not inherently different from other technologies in the way innovation or patents work .
Arguments that software is different should be treated critically ; you can be sure those same arguments will be used by those who do not believe that the protections of the Bill of Rights extend to areas where computers and software are used .
Fred Brooks , following Aristotle , suggested the distinction between essence and accident [ 3 ] , and that distinction has guided our analysis in the distinctions raised by the League and the academics ( see sidebar ) .
The question is whether the differences between software are essential or accidental in their encouraging innovation .
The League says software is different and should be protected differently .
They present two arguments .
A. Programs are complex .
Why , so they are ; but so are airplanes , silicon chips , silicon chip fabrication plants , potato chip plants , oil refineries and many things .
But people find the patent system beneficial in these other technologies .
B. Software is cheap to develop compared to other technologies because it is a cottage industry .
Other industries have cottage manufacturers and they deal with patents .
Outside of software much invention is a cottage industry ; about 5000 independent inventors belong to the 37 organizations that are members of the National Congress of Independent Inventors .
And most cottage industries do n't rely on invention .
We should no more optimize an intellectual property system for cottage developers then we should for Fortune 500 companies .
When one talks about marketing and maintaining commercial software products , the costs are much greater than the estimates made by the League .
At the other extreme , IBM is reported to have spent 2.5 billion dollars to develop OS / 2 , including applications .
It is expensive to develop software if the task is to design it from scratch and make it a success in the market ; it is not , if the task is to clone something that already exists or is precisely specified .
Indeed , that clone software is so much cheaper to develop argues for the necessity of patent protection if one wants to stimulate the development of products worth cloning .
Making software non-patentable or subjecting it to a different form of protection creates practical difficulties , rather like a state seceding from the Union and setting up checkpoints on its border .
And if one state secedes , they all can .
If each technology has a sui generis ( unique to itself ) form of protection , we would have to set up boundaries between the different technologies and would need rules for what happens at the boundaries .
This situation occurs in software development .
Should programmers be able to define their own conventions or should they conform to the system conventions even where they are not optimal ?
Do new programmers get to define their own conventions just because they were not involved in the original decision ?
Are n't programmers expected to abide by the conventions so the code will integrate better and others can maintain it later .
Of course , as problems surface , it is foolish to resist all change in conventions just because changes have repercussions .
Changes are made , but as part of a deliberative process in which the burden of proof is on those who advocate the changes .
The evolution of the law works the same way ; computer law is just another subsystem to be integrated into the fabric of jurisprudence .
The problem of having different conventions in different areas is demonstrated by the Cadtrak patent which is discussed later .
It is a hardware , rather than a software , patent .
It requires a display device but no software to infringe it .
A computer can be designed so it does not infringe , although a simple program running on it can .
This demonstrates that simple software programs can infringe almost pure hardware patents and suggests the difficulty of drawing a legal distinction between hardware and software .
In the legal debate ( see sidebar ) women are playing important roles .
Susan Nycum , the founding chair of the ACM Section for Legal Issues advocated in 1974 that software be patentable . [ 34 ]
She recommended I get patents in 1981 and suggested Hugh Finley , another long - time ACM member , as a patent lawyer .
She now heads the computer law group at , Baker and MacKenzie .
This view is now the mainstream view taken now by the practicing and academic patent bar and most computer lawyers .
The contrarians who argue against software having the same breadth of protection as other technologies are led by Pamela Samuelson .
Unless overruled by the Supreme Court. , the issues will be decided by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit whose chief judge is the Honorable Helen W. Nies
The League for Programming Freedom has launched an offense in the debate .
Like the Battle of the Bulge , up close it looks formidable .
But , while it must be treated seriously , it is the last gasp of a dying cause .
The PTO and those patent lawyers who prosecute software patents have much more experience in the nitty gritty of protecting software than the contrarian academics .
And the PTO and the courts have more experience weaving new technologies into the fabric of the patent system than the software community has in creating forms of intellectual property protection .
The pioneers in each new technology see that technology as new , different , and central , and expect the world to accommodate it .
To some extent the world does .
But slowly each new technology becomes woven into the tapestry of knowledge encompassing other technologies - each distinctive in its picture - but using the same threads and the same weave .
5 . A Marxist economic system is not optimal in promoting innovation in software .
This is the paradox that one must confront if one argues software patents decrease innovation .
The essential difference between Marxism and Capitalism is property rights .
Patents and copyrights create intellectual property rights which can be brought , sold , rented and licensed like other property rights .
Marxism may be better than Capitalism in some areasÐcertainly not in Russia , but Capitalism , with all its flaws , has outperformed Marxism .
The paradox of Marxism is not just a theoretical issue .
Stallman , the founder of the League for Programming Freedom , heads the Free Software Foundation which is developing and planning to distribute a clone of the Unix¨ operating system .
AT&T has invested in Unix based on its ownership as manifest in patents and copyrights .
AT&T can't be pleased when Mr. Stallman comes along and gives away free copies of a clone of a product it invested millions in developing and marketing .
If AT&T had not used patents and user interface copyrights to protect its intellectual property rights , Mr. Stallman would have no trouble making and distributing a Unix clone .
But AT&T must pay its bills with money it receives from customers and has asserted its rights .
If it is acceptable to clone Unix or any program , will anyone invest in new ideas ?
Should we optimize an intellectual property jurisprudence for , not large entities , not small entities , but companies that distribute free clones of other people 's software ?
For all his talk about wanting to promote innovation , Mr. Stallman seems to get his ideas for technology from AT&T , 1969 and his ideas for intellectual property protection from IBM , 1965 .
Many software developers do it for the fun of it .
But the distinction is based , not on the technology , but on amateurism : amateurs flourish in the early stages of a new technology .
From the time the world 's oldest profession began , professionals have accepted that others give it away , but they bristle if they are expected to work at the same rates .
6 . Like every technology , software has its unique problems .
Software patents have unique problems : prior art libraries are limited , the search classification system was designed for hardware patents , few computer scientists are examiners .
Still , when it gets to specific cases computer scientists and the PTO see invention similarly .
( See Document Comparison )
For the last two years the PTO has been improving the situation .
It is improving its prior art search facilities in software , has published a new software classification system , and is actively recruiting computer scientists .
The PTO has still not been able to rid itself of the prejudice against software patents as patent practitioners in the software area will tell you .
It still is conservative in its interpretation of what constitutes patentable subject matter and has rejected several applications that that are being appealed .
7. Legally , software is patentable .
And it will remain so .
Prior to 1982 , about 30 different software related patent cases went through the Appellate Courts .
The range of technologies - seismic , medical , petrochemical , telecommunications , firmware , and software - demonstrate that software is both well grounded in patent law , and basic to the advancement of American Industry .
Software has become pervasive in industry that it has been basing business decisions on software 's being patentable for 10 to 20 years .
This has created a sophisticated broad - based constituency for keeping software patentable .
Congress has not given in to demands to make less pervasive technologies , such as biotechnology , unpatentable ; it is less likely to do so with software .
Software has been clearly patentable longer than it has been copyrightable ( See Patents and Copyrights ) .
Chisum , the leading authority on patents , wrote an article on the patentability of software and concluded :
The continuing confusion over the patentability of computer programming ideas can be laid on the doorsteps of a single Supreme Court decision , Gottschalk v. Benson , which held that mathematical algorithms cannot be patented , no matter how new and useful .
A careful analysis of that decision shows the holding is not supported by any of the authorities on which it relied , that the Court misunderstood the nature of the subject matter before it , and that the Court failed to offer any viable policy justification for excluding by judicial fiat mathematical algorithms from the patent system .
The Benson decision is inconsistent with the later Supreme Court ruling in Diamond v. Chakabarty that the patent system applies impartially to new technologies and that any policy issues for excluding new technologies should be addressed to Congress .
Policy considerations indicate that patent protection is appropriate for mathematical algorithms that are useful for computer programming as for other technological innovations . [ 8 ]
Chisum is in the mainstream in saying the courts made a mistake by making software unpatentable .
But courts are reluctant to overturn previous decisions directly , and then only after their scope has been eroded .
A similar situation where prejudice had become part of the jurisprudence occurred earlier : Plessy v. Furgesson ( 1896 ) held that " separate but equal " facilities for whites and blacks were lawful .
The courts did not directly overturn it , but eroded its vitality on a case - by - case basis over a period of years in a number of decisions starting with Murrey v. Maryland while appearing to show respect for Plessy .
Finally , when faced with Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) , ample precedent had been created for the Supreme Court to overrule Plessy directly .
Samuelson , having asked Professor Chisum to write his article , now attempted to refute him , but after arguing for over 100 pages that the basis for software patentability is weak , was forced to conclude that :
... the only principle which seems to have guided the court 's decisions is one of upholding the patentability of as many program - related inventions as possible while appearing to show respect for the Supreme Court 's decisions . [ 39 ]
Samuelson 's observation seems to be compelling evidence that while she has not been persuaded that Benson , like Plessy , is a fundamental error in giving prejudice the force of law , the Court has and will , in due course , reverse it .
The original intent of Congress will again become law , and statutory subject matter will " include anything under the sun that is made by man . "
8 . Whether or not one agrees that software patents are beneficial , patents are here to stay so we should plan to work with them .
The software community will be best served by articles about how to avoid infringement , how to deal with infringement notices , how to find prior art , how to use patents to protect new ideas , how to differentiate products , and how to make the patent system work better for software ( based on experience rather than speculation ) .
In brief , we should direct our energies towards making the system work so as to increase innovation and U. S. competitiveness , rather than fighting patents .
9 . The practical effect of to spreading misinformation on software patents will be to hurt small developers and U.S. competitiveness in software .
Patents , like a cat 's claws .
are weapons to punish when necessary .
A declawed cat will not survive long in the wild ; nor can a defenseless startup once it succeeds and attracts substantial competitors .
Patents are not the only defense , but they are a vital one to innovative startups that must survive in a real world .
In business , as in the jungle , respect is given only to those who can protect themselves .
Microsoft , IBM and others are applying for patents in quantity .
Those who do n't understand the situation , are not .
Many are happy to have software patents attacked .
Why let your competitor in on a good thing ?
Why pioneer new product ideas when it is less risky to copy competing products and incorporate useful features once market success is proven .
From the perspective of large companies , a loud voice , like the League , yelling against software patents can be useful , as a meat packer finds a Judas goat useful in leading sheep to slaughter .
The Japanese are aggressively filing for U.S. patents on software .
While our strength is innovation , Japan 's is in adapting innovations and steady improvement .
If they have the improvement patents and we did not file for the basic patents , we lose .
If we arrogantly dismiss the Japanese as incapable of creating good software or cavalierly dismiss patents as undesirable , then 20 years from now we will be trying to get back the software market from Japan just as today we are trying to get back the automobile and semiconductor markets .
We are n't even trying to get back the consumer electronics market .
Who is responsible for the misperception about the desirability and legality of software patents ?
In a certain sense , it is the League for Programming Freedom .
But it knows not what it does .
And its arguments are the ghosts of arguments for IBM 's corporate self - interest of a bygone era .
Is not the origin of the problem IBM 's attempt in the 1960's to declaw a competing technology by depriving its practitioners of their constitutional rights as inventors ?
( See Software Patents : IBM 's Role in History . )
If it was just a question of IBM outfoxing its competitors , we might learn our lesson and let it pass .
But we think it useful to ask some questions :
Is it in the interest of the United States to have strong , competitive , innovative software industry ?
Is it in IBM 's interest ?
Did IBM use its position on the 1966 Patent Commission to put its corporate self interest ahead of that of the United States ?
Should IBM be held responsible for its role in creating the current software patent mess ?
Some have proposed making software patents unenforceable .
Might a law making IBM patents unenforceable make more sense ?
Or a law that would prevent IBM from obtaining patents for a period of time , say 5 or 10 years ?
At a time when when competitiveness with Japan is a major concern , what kind of a message should we send about what happens to those who use their positions on government commissions to sacrifice their country 's interest to their corporate self interest ?
Similarly , if we should eliminate patents to avoid patent litigation as the League suggests , should we not eliminate all laws so as to avoid all litigation ?
10 .
In considering the issues , we should deal with examples of real patents and , where possible , real infringement .
If we are to have a meaningful debate on whether software should be patentable , I suggest we take our standards , both of debate and of where the burden of proof lies , from Abraham Lincoln :
I do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did .
To do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience - to reject all progress - all improvement .
... if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case , we should do so upon evidence so conclusive , and argument so clear , that even their great authority , fairly considered and weighed , cannot stand ...
If any man [ believes something ] , he is right to say so , and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can .
But he has no right to mislead others , who have less access to history , and less leisure to study it , into [ a ] false belief ... thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument .
What I find most frustrating in this debate is that the mode of argument used against software patents by so many [ 15,26,27,28 ] is to throw as much mud against the wall as possible and hope some of it will stick .
I have expended some effort here removing some of the mud .
I do n't claim to have removed it all , but I hope that I have wiped away enough to show you that the rest will wash off too .
In its article , the League lists nine patents , mine and eight others to make its case .
It is unlikely that the members of the League considered the positive side of any of the patents they cited .
It is as if they went searching for quarters with heads showing , and finding several , reported their findings without turning any of them over .
Here we turn over the other eight quarters in an attempt to produce some empirical results .
U.S. Patent 4,197,590 : The inventor founded a company to develop and market what appears to be the first personal computer to write directly from memory to the display .
This invention has been widely licensed to the personal computer industry by Cadtrak .
The " XOR " is only part of the invention .
Cadtrak filed and has won at least one lawsuit against a larger company .
The idea behind the " XOR " claims of this patent is simple .
A program XORs a cursor icon onto a display device ; later a second XOR to the same place erases the cursor restoring the original display .
To move the cursor one XORs the cursor to its old location , then XORs it onto the new location .
There are many ways to get around this patent .
One can use an underline as a cursor or " logically or " the cursor onto the display , erasing later by rewriting the display with its original information .
This approach is fast , lets you change cursor icons easily , accesses the minimum possible data , and requires no space be reserved on the screen for the cursor .
The League says this patent can be infringed in " a few lines of a program . "
It can be , but not on a computer that was commercially available at the time the invention was made .
The invention is largely the invention of the frame buffer .
As such , it requires hardware which has since become common , making it possible to infringe the XOR claims with a few lines of code .
Many , if not most , computer manufacturers including Apple and IBM have taken out licenses which covers programs running on their computers .
This patent illustrates that it is usually easy to design around a patent one accidentally infringes .
If this patent , a hardware patent , is a " bad " patent as some claim , it only demonstrates that the electronics industry tolerates " bad " patents because it finds patents beneficial on balance .
Software should be able to tolerate " bad " patents similarly .
To discard the patent system because some bad patents exist would be the same as suppressing free speech to stamp out lies .
U.S. Patent 4,398,249 : This is what the League mischaracterized as the " Refac recalculation patent . "
In 1970 Rene Pardo and Remy Landau invented the concept of an array of formulas which would enable businessmen to write their own programs to create business applications .
Although the word was not used , their invention is in essence the modern computer spreadsheet .
That the claims cover recalculation is an artifact of how the patent claims were written .
Pardo and Landau marketed a commercial spreadsheet - like product based on this technology .
This invention has been widely adapted in the personal computer industry - over 250 spreadsheets have been marketed .
This patent was originally rejected by the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) as a mathematical algorithm and thus unpatentable subject matter .
Pardo and Landau felt so strongly about their inventive contribution that they appealed their case pro se , which means they , not a lawyer , wrote the brief and argued it before the appeals court .
The decision , In re Pardo [ 23 ] is a major legal precedent which establishes that an invention is patentable whether or not the novelty involves software .
If their experience was typical , they were stonewalled when they tried to enforce their patents .
This would explain why they approached Refac a white knight in the fight against the patent pirates .
If Pardo and Landau have the same deal Refac offered others , then they can expect to collect royalties only as Refac does .
U.S. Patent 4,633,416 : This patent is held by Quantel , a company that developed a line of commercial video editing products protected by its patents .
Quantel filed for patents when it was small .
and it has grown from being small to large because it has used its patents to prevent competitors from using its technology .
The first company Quantel sued was much larger than it was .
U.S. Patent 4,777,596 : The League tells us XyQuest was notified that their product XyWrite infringed Productivity Software patent protecting the ability to accept an abbreviation or correct a spelling error by hitting a space bar .
When licensing negotiations failed , XyQuest removed the feature from future releases .
Productivity Software was founded in 1984 to develop data input systems where minimal keystroke data input is important .
Based on its patented technology , Productivity Software has grown to seven employees and markets 31 specialty products .
It has found niches in the medical and legal transcription and the handicapped marketplaces .
Patent problems are generally minor compared to the other problems pioneering companies face .
At about the same time XyQuest had postponed introduction of its latest version for about a year so it could upgrade to IBM standards as part of an agreement where IBM would market XyWrite exclusively .
At the last minute IBM reneged on the deal [ 25 ] .
While the first five patents are held by small entities , the last four patents are held by large entities and they also protected commercial products .
U.S. Patent 4,558,302 : Unisys licenses this , the LZW compression patent , for 1 percent of sales .
It has threatened a large entity with a lawsuit , but no small ones .
U.S. Patent 4,555,775 : The League describes AT&T 's backup store patent as " Too Obvious to Publish . "
Yet , in a letter in this issue of CACM , Dennis Richie points out that this technology was published in the ACM [ 35 ] and was recently called " a seminal paper " whose ideas are seen in X Windows , Macintosh and many other windows systems [ 14 ] .
While AT&T has sent notification letters on this patent , it has put the patent into reexamination and has not threatened suit or sued anyone on this patent .
U.S. Patent 4,656,583 : This is an IBM patent on compiler speedup .
U.S. Patent 4,742,450 : This is an IBM - shared copy on write patent .
These two patents are what IBM calls Group 1 patents whose royalty is 1 % of sales .
They have been licensed by IBM as part of general licensing agreements but have not been licensed individually .
( About 50 of IBM patents are Group 2 patents .
Group 2 patents can be licensed for 2 % each ; the entire Group 1 portfolio , for 2 % ; and the entire IBM patent portfolio for 5 % . )
These two patents have not been litigated and I do not believe that IBM has aggressively asserted these patents against anyone .
IBM , like most companies , normally files for patents only to protect what they expect to become commercial products .
We treat these patents as protecting commercial products .
Most patents are never asserted .
Much of the value of patents , like that of the Swiss Army , is that they act as a deterrent .
The patents described here are typical of the small number where the patentholder forces a resolution : the infringer may take a license , designs around the patent , or produce prior art showing there was no infringement .
Many letters asserting patents are no trespassing signs , putting potential infringers on notice should they infringe or telling them not to .
They require no action .
The notified companies might send prior art back to the patentholder , who might send it to the PTO for reexamination .
The " infringer " may ignore the notice , waiting to see the reexamined patent or for the patentholder to become more assertive .
The resolution may be hidden , in that an infringer may design around the patent .
Rarely , a product is withdrawn from the market .
The statistics on the cited patents are summarized in Table 1 .
Whether any patent including those described here , is valid and infringed is a complex legal and technical question .
An advantage of the patent system is that the question is an objective one based on the patent , prior art , and the " infringing " device .
Such a dispute is less acrimonious than one where the task is to evaluate testimony where one person yells " thief , " and the other " liar . "
Whether infringement actually occurred in any of the cases is irrelevant .
The relevant question is did the original patentholders bring commercial products to market based on the patented technology and motivated by the rights a patent bestows ?
The 9 patents cited by the League summarized in Table 1 lead us to these conclusions :
1. Software patents stimulate companies to bring commercial products to market .
All nine patents protected commercial products .
2. Software patents stimulate new business formation .
Four of the nine patents were from startups funded to exploit the patented technology .
A fifth filed for its patent in its seventh year .
All five companies struggled for years .
3. Software patents stimulate the commercial introduction of fundamental advances by small entities .
The technology pioneered by at least three of the small patentholders was significant in that they started new product categories or were widely adopted in the industry .
4. Licenses are usually available where companies enforce patents .
Only Quantel seems to be unwilling to license its patent .
5 . Where similar - size companies had a dispute , they settled differences quickly without litigation .
The only patent dispute between similar sized companies ( XyQuest ) was settled readily .
No small entities were faced with a lawsuit brought by a large entity without the advantage of the patentholder having settled earlier with a large infringer .
6 . Small entities incurred little if any royalty and litigation costs for infringing patents .
The only disputes where a small entity paid patent royalties or was sued was where the patentholder had previously settled disputes with larger companies .
No case was cited where a big company aggressively went after a small one over patents unless a large company had respected the patents first .
The only big company this author knows about that has gone after small ones is IBM ( see sidebar ) .
7 . Patent piracy by large entities appears to be common and small entities have a tough time getting their rights respected .
Four of the five small entities had large entities use their technology without first licensing it .
All four were forced to sue .
This makes it unlikely that all the patent disputes were an honest difference of opinion although some likely were .
It is for this reason " piracy " seems a fair characterization .
These same small entities have had their patents mischaracterized and their motives impugned in the academic , trade and business press read by the software community .
It can cost over a million dollars to litigate a patent through to trial .
The data shows that large entities are quick to use their power to try to intimidate small ones into abandoning their rights or accepting nuisance settlements rather than address infringement issues on their merits .
It appears that this high rate of patent piracy is caused in part by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which tilt the scales of justice against the weak .
Our results confirm the League 's suggestion that big companies will readily bully small ones but refutes its suggestion that a patentholder who asserts a patent will get showered with gold .
The yellow matter is not gold .
8. U.S. companies are slow to accept software innovations from outside sources .
The Japanese adapt innovations from sources outside the company twice as fast as United States companies [ 31 ] .
The technology protected by at least two of the patents ( CadTrak and HyperRacks ) was exposed to companies that later became the first infringers .
Japan 's ability to accommodate outside [ the firm ] innovation may be one of the reasons it has been so successful in dominating markets .
If the U.S. is to exploit its strengths in innovation , it must learn to adapt outside innovations without the inefficiency of legal confrontation .
Fast and efficient patent enforcement should encourage U.S. companies to license outside technology early on rather than waiting until they have an infringing product in the market and face substantial legal exposure .
If large companies are forced to deal with a infringement issues early , they might see it is in their advantage to work with the inventors to use their knowledge .
Now , the legal system keeps the patentholder and infringer at war until such time as the patentholders knowledge is of little value to the " infringer , " thus wasting one of our most valuable resources : the creativity and experience of innovators .
9 . Developers do not seem to be infringing multiple patents on a single product .
The only example that was cited where someone faced infringement issues from more than one patentholder seems to be XWindows facing the CadTrak and AT&T patents , but this has not been resolved and no lawsuits seem to have been filed or threatened .
10 .
The patent system seems to reject bad patents early in the patent assertion process .
We think the League is right in alleging that bad patents have been issued .
The League , however , fails to identify a patent that was rejected by the courts .
We think this is because issues of prior art and patent invalidity are considered early on in the patent assertion process .
Patentholders rarely continue to assert patents in the face of solid evidence of invalidity or non-infringement .
11 . If software patents were more widely respected we would probably have had fewer variations on a theme , and more themes on which to vary .
Product development effort seems to have focused on creating many versions of an invention once its value was proven .
Over 250 different spreadsheets and at least four products generally considered to be HyperCard clones were marketed .
12 . Big companies ' patents do not seem to inhibit small developers .
The innovations protected by small entity patents listed here seem to have been more widely adopted than those of big companies in their industries .
Big companies are better at commercializing and protecting their minor innovations , than their major ones .
That small entities seem to introduce the more fundamental innovations to the market is telling .
Big companies are often unsuccessful in transforming innovations into commercial success : Xerox PARC pioneered much of modern day personal computer and its software .
Although IBM invented a predecessor to the spreadsheet ( expired U. S. Patent 3,610,902 ) , it did not market a commercial product based on it , nor did it assert the patent even though its claims seem to read on ( i.e. be infringed by ) modern spreadsheets .
These technologies became major product categories primarily through the efforts of small entities .
13 . Small entities using patents are exceptionally cost - effective in encouraging innovation - especially compared to federal funding .
Table 2 shows a rough estimate of the efficacy of three major sources of innovation : federally funded , large entity , and small entity .
Our results show that small entities are 7.5 times as cost - effective at stimulating innovation as large ones , and 200,000 times as cost - effective as federal funding .
The U.S. grants patent rights to universities as part of its research contracts thus patents are issued in all these areas and patents asserted is a reasonable measure of innovation .
We believe that a more scientific study would refine these results , but doubt it would change the basic conclusion .
As a software developer , you might review the patents discussed and put yourself in the place of each of the parties involved .
If your product finds satisfied users , do you think better financed companies with stronger marketing organizations will market competitive products using your innovations ?
If so , will patents be useful to you ?
If a patent is enforced against you , do you think you will be able to design around it ?
If you have to license it , do you think your competitors will also have to license it , thus passing the cost on to the end customers ?
Which problem would you rather have : a big company entering a market you developed , or finding out you were accidentally infringing a patent ?
Do you think the effect of software patents might be more innovation , higher software prices and an industry with more long term profitability ?
If you are protected by patents , your success depends in part on your patented inventions as others must deal with them .
If you accidentally infringe a patent , designing around it is within your expertise .
If you do not have patents , success depends much more on the ability to finance and market products - capabilities outside of your expertise and control .
If you are a software developer , do n't patents benefit you by manifesting your contributions in rights you can bring to the bargaining table , while confining the problems largely to your area of expertise and control ?
Issues in Science and Technology ( Winter 1991 / 2 ) contains a letter from Commissioner of Patents Harry F. Manbeck who said of another article by the same authors that they [ 15 ] :
... demonstrate they do not understand the current law ... Most of their statements ... do not appear to be the result of a balanced and reasoned inquiry and do not appear to be supported by the facts .
... they cavalierly dismiss the view of those who appear to have used the patent system successfully and impugn their motives ...
The PTO issued about 89,000 patents in 1990 from which the League , with the advantage of hindsight , can pick and choose the ones to attack .
Consider the information presented here on patents the League selected to demonstrate the PTO 's mistakes .
Whose standards are higher , the League 's or the PTO's ?
After reviewing our results we can make some general recommendations .
1. Policy should be made on the assumption that innovation occurs in software as in other technologies until compelling evidence to the contrary is found .
This is consistent with the results described here .
The operational implications are to continue to let the system operate as it is accepting evolutionary changes based on experience rather than speculation .
2 , The PTO should be viewed as a source of innovation that competes for funding with other federally funded sources of innovation .
PTO fees should be reduced , especially for smaller entities , and the PTO should receive a higher level of funding to improve its ability to examine patents so it can issue better quality , more timely , patents in software and other technologies .
European patent offices are much better equipped and much better funded .
It seems that the PTO should compete with the NSF and other organizations for federal funding on the basis of their cost effectiveness in encouraging innovation .
In 1990 only $ 2 million of the PTO budget of $ 419 million came from federal funding ; the rest came from user fees .
Superficially , it might seem that investing in the patent system will have a multiplier effect of 80,000 in creating innovation as compared to federally funded science .
We suggest no such thing .
We do however ask the question :
If taxpayers were to spend on additional $ 160 million per year to support innovation , we could either increase the $ 64 billion federal funding on science by one - fourth of one percent ( 0.25 % ) or increase PTO funding by 40 % enabling the PTO to issue better patents and restore reduced user fees for small entities .
Which will likely produce a more innovation ?
Which will achieve a greater multiplier effect by encouraging additional private investment ?
An example of federally funded science is fusion power research which has been going on for at least 25 years , has cost hundreds of millions of dollars and has produced little practical result .
Pons and Fleishman developed ( and filed for patents on ) cold fusion without government funding yet they , having invested their own money and not being in the mainline of governmental funding , are heavily criticized .
While it is not clear that Pons and Fleishman have produced cold fusion , respected people in the field believe that they have , even if no one yet understands what is happening .
This is just an example of how the system is biased in favor of governmental funding of expensive conventional solutions , and against individuals and small companies who risk their own time and money to innovate .
Individuals taking a contrarian view have been the major source of new ideas in both science [ 38 ] and engineering [ 24 ] .
This is why small entities and the patent system is so important .
Most will fail , but the successes more than make up for the failures
It would be interesting to evaluate the results of federally funded science to determine which projects are worth the cost .
Some projects seem to have become like those welfare mothers , who generation after generation , are entrapped in a governmental support system .
3 . The patent laws should be modified to make it possible for small entities to assert their patent rights more effectively .
The data shows that it is commonplace for large companies to pirate the technology of small entities .
No case was cited where a large company licensed a small entity 's technology without first being sued suggesting that the existing laws do not motivate large companies to resolve patent disputes with small companies quickly .
The issue here is not just fairness to inventors and improved efficiency in settling disputes , it has to do with avoiding the waste that occurs because U.S. companies are so much slower at adopting new innovations than Japanese companies .
Congress responded with anti-piracy legislation where software copyrights are concerned ; we would hope it would similarly pass legislation to prevent patent piracy .
Remedies similar to the criminal penalties for copyright infringement and Rule 11 sanctions for attorneys who file frivolous suits are worth considering .
We also suggest the following as possible remedies for patents disputes to stimulate discussion :
After being put on notice , an " infringer " would have six months to file any prior art with the PTO to be used to defend the infringement suit .
( I find it difficult to believe it is well - known art if it can not be found in six months . )
If a patentholder prevails in a lawsuit , the remedies should include an extension of the period of his exclusivity against that infringer equal to the length of time the suit was in progress .
Discovery should be limited .
These suggestions which should induce speedier resolution of patent disputes , like all our recommendations , are suggested for all patents disputes , not just software .
The patent system , an enormously productive system for inducing innovation , is being stymied by a cumbersome dispute resolution process .
Is it in the public good to have a system of conflict resolution which discourages conflict resolution ?
Should innovators spend their time innovating or litigating ?
If the courts could resolve software patent and copyrights issues more quickly , it would clarify the law so everyone can make decisions with some predictability .
The problem are not unique to patents but occurs in all litigation .
That the judicial and even the legal , community are beginning to address the inefficiency of dispute resolution and litigation is grounds for cautious optimism .
4 . Further study of the role of patents and federal funding in software innovation is useful
We are keenly aware that the sample is small and unscientific and so our results should be considered suggestive rather than definitive .
A more definitive study should be useful in bringing out facts that would be useful in evaluating future changes to the patent law .
The recommendations can be summarized as : Redress the balance of incentives so innovators will prefer to develop their ideas commercially , using patent protection , rather than search for federal funding .
The software industry is getting more competitive .
Almost every company that has hit products uses its cash flow to develop entries in other product categories .
As a result , product categories are getting very competitive .
Since most software companies have confined their intellectual property to source code copyrights , trademarks and , sometimes , user interface copyrights , whenever they come up with a successful innovation , their competitors will often quickly replicate it .
As a result , the impetus is toward similarly featured products competing on price , differing only in the mistakes which the originators must maintain to support their existing customers .
Now companies are recognizing that by using patents , they can compete on features and function Ñnot just tactically , but strategically .
Even if competitors do replicate the features they will likely make them different enough to avoid infringement .
Companies following this approach will support standards , but their products will have a substantial proprietary component engendering products with more diverse feature sets .
This will enable the industry to compete more on the profitable playing field of unique capabilities and market position and less on price .
This is consistent with standard business school product marketing , where product differentiation and market segmentation are basic .
Intellectual property has already driven the market for those who got in early and established standards .
Lotus owns the 1 - 2 - 3 standard .
Novell owns a major network standard and Wordperfect a major word processor standard .
Apple owns the Macintosh User interface standard and Intel and Microsoft own the IBM compatibility standard .
Patents give companies the opportunity to establish and own something of value in the market based on their innovativeness , rather than their marketing and financial capabilities .
While the problem of people accidentally infringing software patents has been greatly exaggerated , several patents will be successfully asserted against existing products .
This will be primarily between those companies that focused on innovation and have patents , and those that focused on exploiting recognized business opportunities .
This kind of confrontation happened earlier on in the aircraft and other industries [ 21 ] .
During these confrontations , the businesses with a large volume of infringing product will , if they are not patent aware , understandably feel " extorted " .
Such businesspeople will take support for their position from those who argue against software patents and advocate or suggest invalidating existing software patents [ 15,39 ] .
The software innovators who advanced the technology and made business decisions based on their patent rights will similarly feel cheated especially where they pioneered commercial products based on their inventions .
When depositors made decisions based on government guarantees of S&L deposits , no one suggested that the government default on their obligations to insured depositors as people suggest the government invalidate existing software patents .
No one vilifies the S & L depositors because the government has to pay them money , yet software innovators find themselves vilified with lies and half truths .
In this confrontation , both sides start out feeling cheated .
Many " infringers " will react emotionally and view it as a problem to be gotten rid of and many will fight to the bitter end .
This raises the stakes , as a company having been put on notice may be liable for treble damages and attorney 's fees .
Patentholders will not likely pursue these cases for four or five years while the infringer 's liability builds up .
After a suit is filed these companies will be getting much of their advice form those who have most to profit from the litigation : their litigators .
This seems to be what is happening with Lotus .
Some software developers on finding out that the rules were not what they thought , face the problems of infringing others ' patents while not having patented their own successful innovations .
Some will chalk it up as one of many risks and uncertainties of business .
Those who react emotionally might find it useful to first ask :
Which of the players have acting in good faith ?
Which have not ?
Which have been responsible for the patent mess ?
Which have been innocent victims ?
Having answered these questions , such developers can more effectively target their wrath .
Companies that act rationally will analyze the patents to ascertain their scope and validity , whether infringement is occurring , and how easy it is to remove the " infringing " capability .
The will check with other licensees .
They will consider the obvious options , such as taking out a license , removing the infringement , finding prior art and showing it to the patentholder , or fighting in court if that is the only possibility .
They will likely try to address the problem early on before the liability builds and consider designing around the patent , negotiating a license or using some form of alternative dispute resolution to resolve infringement and validity issues .
If the problem is associated with purchased product , most companies will stand in back of their products and provide a license , warrant it against infringement , or provide guidelines on how to avoid infringement .
It will put its " no problem " in writing .
Astute companies will view infringement as an opportunity in disguise .
If the patent is good and competitors are , or soon will be , infringing it , the first licensee can generally get an inexpensive license forcing competitors to pay more if they want the technology .
It may be possible to get an exclusive license on some feature which differentiates a product from the competitor 's .
It can be worthwhile to see if the patent covers useful capability which could be added to the product .
The best time to negotiate for the patented technology is when you are not incurring liability of infringement but rather can offer to create a demand for that technology by incorporating it into a product .
Invention being the mother of necessity , competitors will be faced with the choice of paying a higher price to license patented technology or leaving it out thus differentiating your product from theirs .
In brief , what superficially looks like another problem to be dealt with in the increasingly competitive , commodities oriented software business , will prove to be what makes products less price competitive .
Many industries have worked on this basis all along : patents make industries more diverse in their offerings , more profitable , more innovative , and ultimately will make the U.S. more competitive .
The essence of this article is simple : Software intellectual property issues are not inherently different in substance from other technologies ; what motivates people is not inherently different ; industry life cycle is not inherently different ; marketing and business strategies and tactics are not inherently different ; the law and policy issues are not inherently different .
The technology is not even new .
Software has been around for 40 years .
The issues may be new to those who had no experience of them , but the only thing that is different is that software is a mass market industry for the first time and real money is at stake .
