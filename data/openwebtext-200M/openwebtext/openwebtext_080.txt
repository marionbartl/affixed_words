Russia 's supreme court announced that it had liquidated the small Republican party , claiming that it had violated electoral law by having too few members .
The party is one of very few left in Russia that criticises President Vladimir Putin .
The move against Russia 's opposition came as pro-democracy activists prepared for the latest in a series of anti-government rallies that have infuriated Russia 's hardline authorities .
Hundreds of demonstrators are expected to gather today in Nizhny Novgorod , Russia 's fourth biggest city .
The protesters from The Other Russia , a coalition of opposition groups , are expected to march despite attempts by pro-Kremlin officials to prevent them from demonstrating .
" The march 's leaders are being called in by police and intimidated .
We are half a step away from a police state , " Denis Bilunov , a member of the march 's organising committee , told the Guardian .
" There is n't much point in talking about democracy in Russia any more . "
Today 's protest follows an opposition rally earlier this month in St Petersburg in which at least 5,000 people chanted slogans against Mr Putin , and which was violently dispersed by police .
The size of the last demonstration appears to have surprised the authorities .
They have refused permission for the latest rally to go ahead and blocked the route .
On Thursday Moscow 's prosecutor 's office also suspended the Nationalist Bolshevik party , another radical and previously banned anti-Kremlin group .
The National Bolshevik party is a radical activist group that has been a driving force behind recent anti-government protests , as the country prepares for parliamentary elections in December and next year 's presidential vote .
Vladimir Ryzhkov , the leader of the Republican party , said yesterday that the ban was part of a Kremlin - inspired campaign to crack down on dissent .
" This is part of the Kremlin 's policy of suppressing the opposition .
It 's being done to prevent opposition parties from taking part in elections , " he told the Guardian .
" This is the fate any opposition party in Russia . "
Mr Ryzhkov - one of a handful of independent MPs in the Duma , the lower chamber of parliament , and a leading Putin critic - said his party would appeal in Russia and to the European court of human rights .
Organisers of today 's rally in Nizhny Novgorod say they have faced widespread intimidation by the city 's pro-Kremlin authorities .
Earlier this week police from the special organised crime unit of Russia 's interior ministry seized 60,000 copies of an opposition newspaper due to be distributed during the demonstration .
The mayor 's office announced a children 's festival on the site of the proposed march , and blocked off the road to carry out what it said were urgent repairs .
" Taking to the streets is n't our plan , " said Mr Bilunov .
" But the problem is that the opposition is being pushed out of the legislative process .
This is the only way we can protest legitimately .
We are being barred from federal channels and from parliament . "
The Other Russia brings together a series of diverse opposition groups hostile to the Kremlin .
They include Gary Kasparov 's United Civil Front , the Popular Democratic Union , led by Mikhail Kasaynov - a former prime minister who fell out with Mr Putin - and the National Bolsheviks .
Organisers also hope to attract the support of locals fed up with new construction in the city 's historic heart , as well as environmentalists concerned about the destruction of green spaces .
At their last rally in St Petersburg the opposition marched under the slogan Those Who Don't Agree .
Yesterday the National Bolshevik leader , Eduard Limonov , predicted the latest ban on his party would lead to " big problems " .
He told Interfax news agency : " I am not afraid for my life .
I am primarily afraid for my relatives and friends .
I have accepted the prosecutor 's office 's challenge .
We are launching a fight . "
The Kremlin argues that its new electoral law - which says that all political parties must have 50,000 members and be represented in half of Russia 's provinces - is meant to streamline Russia 's untidy political scene .
Critics say the legislation is designed to kill off smaller parties that oppose the Kremlin .
Backstory
Russia 's tiny opposition is represented in the current Duma by four or five MPs .
Pro-Kremlin parties predominate among the 447 deputies .
The small opposition Republican party , banned yesterday , was formed by defectors from the Soviet Communist party .
It emerged in 1990 on the wave of liberalism encouraged by then - Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
The Republican party has one MP , Vladimir Ryzhkov ; its other attempts to win seats have repeatedly failed .
But it has played a solid role in the liberal opposition .
The liberal Yabloko party also has two MPs .
Two other anti-Putin MPs sit as independents .
In theory , the opposition includes Russia 's Communist party and the far - right Liberal Democratic party .
In reality , they rarely if ever voice opposition to the Kremlin , observers point out .
Republicans are busy thumping their chests over blocking a non-existent medical procedure using a bill that was intentionally written to mislead .
If the goal was to terrify women and confuse physicians , they 've succeeded .
However , their concern for " life " is clear in the results of other legislation .
From 2002 on , every year has brought proposals of slashing health programs for the poor .
By 2006 , Medicaid was the largest single reduction in the budget .
Even as the bill was being signed , there were predictions that the series of cuts would have an impact even larger than their considerable size .
But Republicans , using their standard black - is - white logic , argued that the cuts would be good for those depending on Medicaid .
... in his State of the Union address last week , he did make this vow : " Our government has a responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly , and we are meeting that responsibility . "
Ironically , one of the ways Republican lawmakers say they 're meeting that responsibility is by scaling back the Medicaid health program for the poor .
The targeting of Medicaid has n't stopped .
Bush 's 2008 budget includes huge cuts to both Medicaid and Medicare .
The cuts have drawn many warnings , since they directly targeted those who need help most .
[ Public health expert Sara Rosenbaum ] says that for children in particular , coverage has never contracted -- until now .
" This is the first time in 40 years , that is since the program was enacted , that we actually have policy coming out of Congress that reduces Medicaid 's commitment to the poorest children . "
As the health data for the last few years begins to become available , the evidence shows that these cuts are bearing the awful fruit that even the most cursory analysis would have predicted .
As detailed in Erik Eckholm 's New York Times article , for the first time in over a decade , infant mortality rates are soaring , especially among the very population served by Medicaid .
To the shock of Mississippi officials , who in 2004 had seen the infant mortality rate — defined as deaths by the age of 1 year per thousand live births — fall to 9.7 , the rate jumped sharply in 2005 , to 11.4 .
In Mississippi alone , that one year saw 65 more children die than the previous year .
At 17 deaths per 1,000 births , the death rate among blacks in that state is now higher than it 's been at any time since the Reagan administration -- another era of Medicaid cuts .
That 's worse than 83 countries .
Worse than Tonga , and Sri Lanka , and Uruguay .
Worse than Russia .
While Republican legislators made excuses for their cuts , saying that they would give " more flexibility " to governors ( like Republican Haley Barbour of Mississippi ) , the result is scenes like this one .
Jamekia Brown , 22 and two months pregnant with her third child , lives next to the black people ’s cemetery in the part of town called No Name , where multiple generations crowd into cheap clapboard houses and trailers .
So it took only a minute to walk to the graves of Ms. Brown ’s first two children , marked with temporary metal signs because she cannot afford tombstones .
Mississippi is n't the only state to be affected by Medicaid cuts , and it's not the only state seeing this sad rise in infant mortality .
However , there 's a reason why that state was particularly hard hit .
In Mississippi , Bush had an eager partner .
In 2004 , Gov. Haley Barbour came to office promising not to raise taxes and to cut Medicaid ...
As a result , the number of non-elderly people , mainly children , covered by the Medicaid and CHIP programs declined by 54,000 in the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years .
Want to know the truth about Republican " pro-life " positions ?
You can find it in the cemetery behind No Name .
Bush and Barbour delivered on lower taxes , but the price for putting more money in the pockets of the richest , is dead children for the poorest .

After you are done with the repair you should probably invite some friends over to ... uh , stress - test the system ?

f'ing ridiculous -
the pumps are inline then ?
( two pumps in parallel doubles volume but volume@head stays the same )
most important here would be to find out why the gfci tripped , and why it can't be reset .
For as long as they have existed , students have embraced the role of obliging guinea - pigs , on hand to take part in all manner of intrusive , humiliating and bizarre experiments dreamed up by their supervisors .
Nonetheless , one of Michel Cabanac 's experiments must have raised eyebrows .
" I offered them money to feel pain , " says the physiologist at Laval University in Québec .
" It can be quite dangerous , because what if a student has just destroyed his parents ' car ?
He 's going to need money really badly . "
Undeterred , Cabanac lined his students up against a wall .
It was going to be bad , but not as bad as they might have thought .
He got them to sit , as if perched on an imaginary stool , a position which forced their weight onto their knees .
" Try it , " he says .
" The pain soon becomes unsufferable . "
Cabanac then promised the students increasingly large lumps of cash to endure the pain .
The more he offered , the longer they suffered .
The longest lasted for eight minutes 20 seconds .
Ironically , Cabanac 's experiment was part of a broader investigation into the science of pleasure .
His aim was to find out what , if anything , was the point of pleasure .
His conclusions , and those of other scientists working in the field , suggest that not only is pleasure good for our health , but it is at the root of our ability to make sense of the complex world in which we live .
Cabanac 's proof that people will suffer pain for payment will come as no surprise to the millions who do things they hate in return for a monthly pay cheque .
But in a follow - up experiment , Cabanac showed there was a more fundamental point to make about what influences our behaviour .
Before the second test , Cabanac asked people to rate the pleasure they got from playing a video game .
They were then sat in a temperature - controlled room and Cabanac , while cooling it down , asked them to rate how unpleasant the feeling was .
He then combined the two experiments .
" We cooled the room down , and every time , the same thing happened .
As soon as it was cold enough for their displeasure rating to just outweigh the pleasure of playing the game , they stopped the experiment , " he says .
According to Cabanac , the tests show that , while it might not be obvious all the time , each of our decisions is ultimately driven by pleasure - seeking .
" Pleasure is the common currency that allows us to make any , and I mean any , decision in our lives , " he says .
" Any decision is made according to the trend to maximise pleasure . "
Pleasure - seeking certainly makes evolutionary sense .
As organisms developed , the emergence of pleasure as a sensation will have helped reinforce healthy behaviour , such as eating certain foods , having sex and keeping warm .
But while Cabanac 's theory might make evolutionary sense , that does n't make it correct .
It does n't take long to think of examples where a decision looks entirely unpleasurable .
What about a decision that ultimately leads to a person 's own death ?
How could that choice come out as the most pleasurable path to take ?
In 1969 , Jan Palach , a Czech student , set himself on fire in protest at the Soviet invasion of his country .
He died from his injuries three days later .
" That 's an atrocious death , yet he did it by choice , " says Cabanac , who assumes Palach was not mentally ill .
" The fact that he was suffering hell by dying by fire was compensated by an overwhelming joy of telling the Russians ' Look .
Look what we are able to do against you .
You do not win . ' "
At the Neurosciences Research Institute at the State University of New York , director George Stefano believes that pleasure is not only the driver for every decision we make , but is a crucial component for making sense of the world .
" As human beings , we always pride ourselves in being rational , but if we were 100 % rational , we would have to weigh up every single possible action we might take at any time .
Imagine how time - consuming that would be .
Even a cognitive organism does n't have time to be truly rational , " he says .
Pleasure , says Stefano , is our brain 's way of short - cutting the rational process by subconsciously and continuously ranking what is most important to us from the vast number of options we are faced with .
Stefano 's phrase for it is likely to make dedicated hedonists smile : " Pleasure leads to pure rationality , " he says .
As with the majority of neuroscience , some of the most reliable evidence comes from studying people who were born with , or have later suffered , damage to specific parts of the brain .
At the University of Iowa , a team lead by neuroscientist Hanna Damasio has been studying people with lesions in a region of the cortex associated with pleasure .
They found that although the patients had no intellectual impairment , in a simple gambling test , they made hopeless decisions .
" They are oblivious to the consequences of their actions , " the team noted in a paper published in the journal , Brain .
Despite decades of effort , scientists are still teasing out the precise neural circuitry that allows us to experience pleasure .
In the 1980s , many scientists believed there was just one major brain circuit that governed pleasure .
Triggered by the neurochemical dopamine , it excited the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens .
But more recent research has cast doubt on the role of dopamine .
It now seems the chemical plays a subtly different role - making us feel desire rather than pleasure .
Scientists now know that another brain circuit , triggered by chemicals called opiods , does play a key role in pleasure sensations .
Injecting drops of opiod into a part of the brain called the ventral pallidum heightens the enjoyment of sweet tastes , they found , suggesting it boosts the natural pleasure sensation .
Meanwhile , at Oxford University , a team lead by neuroscientist Edmund Rolls has discovered that a region of the brain called the orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , which lies just behind the eyes , contains bundles of cells that are triggered by different types of pleasurable experience .
Signals from the OFC are then thought to feed into the dopamine and opiod circuitry .
According to Cabanac , pleasure can only be a transient sensation , the feeling of warming up when cold , or of eating when hungry .
He believes that the lack of these gaps between how we feel and how we want to feel explains a lot of misery in modern society .
" We 're not hungry , we 're not cold , we have everything , " he says .
The result , he says , is that we are tempted to seek pleasure in other ways , by taking drugs , or over - indulging in pleasurable activities .
Extremely hedonistic lifestyles may be caused by compulsive behaviour leading to an endless craving for pleasurable sensations , or subtle damage to the underlying brain circuitry , he adds .
Of course , it 's possible to have too much of a good thing , and pleasure can easily become pain .
This flipping of pleasure into pain has been investigated using brain scans focusing on the OFC and have captured the fine line that is the difference between the two states .
Marilyn Jones - Gotman of the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University recruited self - confessed chocoholics and fed them lumps of chocolate while monitoring their brain activity using a brain - scanning technique called positron emission tomography .
After each chunk , the person was asked to rate how much they wanted another piece .
" We fed them until they absolutely could not face another bite , " she says .
Jones - Gotman found that as the experience of eating chocolate flipped from being intensely pleasurable to downright repulsive , activity in the orbitofrontal cortex shifted from the centre to nearer the outside .
They had captured the exact point where pleasure became pain .
But is this the change that tells us when we 've had too much of a good thing ?
Jones - Gotman does n't think so .
" If you 're over - eating , expecially in cases like Christmas dinner when you 're eating food that people like very much and associate it with the good feeling of previous Christmases , you probably wo n't stop until it 's actually painful , " she says .
While pleasure may have evolved as a way to encourage creatures to indulge in healthy behaviour and avoid more harmful pursuits , Stefano believes there is another benefit .
Inside brain neurons , and also other tissues in the body , is a chemical called proenkephalin .
He says that when we experience pleasure , proenkephalin is broken down , producing a substance that causes a feel good sensation .
But the same enzymes involved in that process also release another chemical called enketylin , a strong antibacterial agent .
" Just think of the beauty of that : when you 're feeling good , you protect yourself , " says Stefano .
Though scientists are slowly teasing out the secrets of pleasure , they have a long way to go .
One problem is that little funding goes into looking at why things go right in humans .
Instead , money pours into researching disease and disorders .
" It 's time that changed a little , " says Stefano .
" Feeling good is healthy .
Why do n't we look into it ? "

Around 90 percent of Americans consume caffeine every single day in one form or another .
More than half of all American adults consume more than 300 milligrams of caffeine every day , making it America 's most popular drug by far [ source : Johns Hopkins ] .
But the U.S. is far from the lead when it comes to national caffeine consumption .
According to a 2010 report by commodities analysts for Businessweek , Scandinavian nations such as Finland consume more caffeine per capita -- mostly in coffee -- than any other country .
The report noted other surprising trends , like a move in Brazil to offer coffee drinks as part of grade - school lunches [ source : Wallace ] .
Although Americans are n't the world 's biggest per-capita caffeine fiends , we 're not exactly teetotalers .
Research by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the American Medical Association ( AMA ) has led these groups to consider 300 milligrams ( about two cups of coffee ) the upper limit of a moderate daily dose .

Report Cutting Our Losses after 40 Years of Money - Losing Timber Sales in the Tongass A new report documenting 40 years of money - losing timber sales in the Tongass National Forest
By Phil Mercer
BBC News , Sydney
Papua New Guinea is a diverse , but mainly Christian nation
Police have alleged that Steven Tari killed and ate three young women he recruited as sex slaves .
The former bible student was arrested after almost two years on the run but has been too ill to appear in court .
He said he was the " true Christ " and promised his followers great wealth and redemption .
Among his disciples were allegedly dozens of sex slaves .
The cult leader was said have called them his " flower girls " .
Police in Papua New Guinea have claimed that three young women were raped , murdered and then eaten by Steven Tari in his jungle hide - out .
After being on the run , he was captured by a group of villagers and was apparently beaten so badly before being handed over to the police that he has been too unwell to appear in court .
In the regional capital , Madang , hundreds of people gathered outside the police station to get a glimpse of Mr Tari .
He had studied to become a Lutheran pastor but disappeared from his theological college after disputing the Bible 's teachings .
He turned up in the mountains surrounding Madang wearing flowing white robes and surrounded by an army of devotees .
There were allegations of cannibalism and sacrificial killings , which led to Mr Tari 's arrest two years ago .
He then absconded and melted away into the jungle .
Papua New Guinea has a strong Christian tradition but witchcraft and superstition remain powerful forces in some parts of the country .
Here ’s the problem : in some places , there are n’t enough women around .
For example , high - traction blogs , newspaper op - ed pages , and the computer business .
It ’s obvious and it ’s been obvious for a long time , but has provoked a flurry of pretty interesting conversation this last couple of weeks .
This is provoked not only by the recent traffic but by a trip to the bathroom on a recent evening at the opera .
The Reading List ·
There ’s been an awful lot of virtual ink spilled around this , from which I draw the following link harvest ( Note : I do not agree with some of these pieces ) : Maureen Dowd on op - ed writing , Shelley Powers on why top -100 lists and blogrolls are damaging , Kevin Drum on women bloggers , Michael Kinsley generalizes , Dahlia Lithwick on voice imbalance , Chris Nolan on the Top Ten Reasons
Why , and lightweight remarks from Steven Levy that are here because they were in Newsweek and thus likely read by millions .
Most of these pieces are well - populated with links to further exploration of the issue ( except of course , those from the mainstream media , who do n’t seem to feel the need to link ) .
Two Problems ·
This is n’t just one problem ; David Weinberger shows why : “ After talking with some women , I considered skipping etech this year because it ’s too much of a boy ’s club : Only 9 % of the speakers are women , by my count .
That sucks .
So , I checked with O’Reilly .
They say that 5 % of the submitted paper topics came from women .
That sucks even more because it ’s harder to fix . ”
So if we want more women on the op - ed pages or the famous - bloggers list or in the tech industry , we have to solve two problems :
First , make it a club they want to join and second , try not to discourage the ones who ’ve done so .
Like David said , the first problem is harder .
We ’re making progress on the second : immense progress in my lifetime on removing the de jure and institutional barriers ; but any women will tell you that there are still all sorts of intangibles and cultural problems getting in the way .
For example , see Chris Nolan ’s piece referenced above .
But I know an awful lot of men who really go out of their way not to get in the way , and I think the proportion of people like that is growing .
Women in High Tech · I do n’t know anything about newspaper op - ed management and I ’ve never been near Technorati ’s Top -100 list , but I do know a lot about one discipline that has this problem : high technology .
Let me start with an imaginary scenario , closely based on many real - life conversations :
Senior Engineer :
Hey , you need to work on the performance of the detail checkin module , it ’s running like dogshit .
Junior Engineer : Oh , OK , I know what to do , we ’ll have to make the authtable lookup multi- threaded .
Sr. : How do you know that ’s the problem ?
Just guessing ?
Jr. :
It ’s obvious , there are like 20 hits a second on that table and they ’re all mutexing .
Sr. : You ’re just guessing .
Go do some profiling and measuring and find out where the time ’s really going , then we ’ll figure out how to fix it .
( I ’ve been in this conversation many times both as Jr. and Sr. )
Okay , now I ’m going to make some generalizations that I consider appallingly wrong - headed :
Women do n’t want to get into a career where you have to invest days of your lives in making detail checkin modules run faster .
Women do n’t want to get into a career where this kind of confrontational dialogue style is considered OK .
There ’s a lot of this kind of generalization going on .
And it ’s all misleading and wrong and dangerous .
Statistically Wrongheaded · Notice that I did n’t actually say these generalizations are wrong .
But if they ’re right , they ’re only statistically right .
I actually think that there may be something that comes with having two X chromosomes that makes people less likely to find the computer business interesting .
But that finding is only statistically true ; which is to say , that even if it is true , there are going to be some number of women who like geeking out , and if you make it hard for them to get into the business because of their gender you ’re being stupid and immoral .
So do n’t do that .
And one real good way to avoid doing that is to never use sentences that start “ Women want ... ” or “ Men want ... ” or “ Arabs want ... ” or “ Italians want ... ” .
If you scan the pages I linked to above , you ’ll notice that mostly , they avoid this pitfall ( although Maureen Dowd does level some broadsides at men- in - general ) .
Changing the Rules ·
So if you ’re in a discipline that is excluding women ( or any other group you ’re not happy excluding ) , you not only have to welcome them individually , you might have to change some basic cultural patterns .
What ’s worse , it might not work .
I personally suspect that engineering will remain male - dominated and early childhood education female - dominated no matter how hard we try to be inclusive .
And that ’s probably OK .
What ’s not OK is if the engineers are trying to keep out the women who do want in , or the elementary teachers are trying to keep out the men .
Of course , there are some bigger rules that it would be good to change .
Like whatever rule it is that says that women have do most of the housework and childcare , and whatever rule it is that says the cigar bar at the golf course is a good place to do business deals .
The Blogosphere · As I said , I wo n’t be surprised if certain practices and professions remain gender - imbalanced way into the future .
But blogging should n’t be one of them .
I do n’t know of any prejudice ( statistically backed or not ) that alleges women are less skilled at communicating or connecting ; which is what this is all about .
And if anyone thinks they might want to turn this into a business , well they ’re going to want to have female readers , which means that they ’d better offer offer female writers .
Which is a long - winded way of saying that I think the griping about the big - name - blogger imbalance is justified and there is a problem here .
Shelley Powers has n’t quite convinced me that dropping blogrolls and top -100 lists would help that much , but it ’s an interesting direction and worth thinking some more about .
I ’m pretty sure , though , that a little bit of affirmative action in choosing who to link to is likely to be helpful , moral , and smart .
The Bathrooms at the Opera · The other night we went to see Mozart ’s Così Fan Tutte .
On stage and in the audience , I did n’t see any gender imbalance .
But during the intermission , the lineups for the women ’s bathroom were ridiculous .
Given that this is a three - hour opera that started right after dinnertime , the upshot is that quite a few women did n’t get a chance for witty repartee about the failings of the horn section or libretto ’s misogynist drivel .
So , in some places , gender is n’t a big deal , pro or con .
In other places , it ’s a big problem .
Which it ’s worth fighting to fix , even if maybe you ’re not going to win .

The governor of Utah signed a nonbinding resolution on Tuesday that calls on the US Congress to do something about the rising tide of Internet pornography , preferably using technology to stick it in a ghetto where those who do n't want to see it do n't have to do so .
The resolution , which passed both houses of the Utah legislature , was backed by CP80 ( " Clean port 80 " ) , a group founded and headed by Ralph Yarro .
CP80 's plan to cleanse the Internet is n't the only controversy that Yarro 's involved in , though ; he also happens to chair the board of directors for SCO .
Yarro 's bio lists his previous experience as a " graphic artist " for the Noorda Family Trust ( Ray Noorda helmed Novell for many years , and Yarro was a confidant of his ; he had a recent falling - out with the Noordas that escalated into a lawsuit ) .
Yarro now spends time trying to get " graphic " art pushed into its own corner of the Internet through his work with CP80 , which wants Congress to legislate that all porn must use a series of alternate ports .
Port 80 , the main HTTP port , would be reserved as a " community channel . "
" The Internet is not a force of nature — it 's a man -made creation .
It can be changed and evolved to better serve us all , " said Yarro in a statement after the signing of the resolution .
" There is no reason why we should tolerate an Internet that allows children to easily access pornography . "
This is n't going to happen automatically , so Yarro 's group wants to bring the force of law to bear on the Internet to make it happen .
CP80 wants Congress to pass the " Internet Community Ports Act " ( written by CP80 ) , but they have yet to find anyone who will introduce the legislation .
So they 're bringing pressure at the state level , hoping to goad Congress to action on the issue .
Their draft bill would use the " Miller test " for obscenity , and anything deemed obscene that appeared on the " community channel " would open the web site operator to a prosecution or fine .
Utah is the first state to pass such a resolution ; not coincidentally , Yarro is from the state and exerts influence there .
CP80 's solution would apply to the US only , of course , and their plan for dealing with international pornographers ( who are unlikely to move to another port dictated by the US ) is a simple but draconian one : consumers would ask ISPs to " simply block all IP addresses originating from a non-compliant country . "
Problem solved !
CP80 compares web browsing to watching television where all content is transmitted on a single channel ; what parent would let a child watch a TV channel that could show porn at any moment ?
If we think of each web site address as the " channel number , " though , the analogy falls apart — a worthwhile lesson in the danger of arguing from metaphors .
There are plenty of ways to keep from seeing porn on the ' Net , everything from web blockers to " accountability software " to specialized ISPs .
But the truth is , it takes work and some stringent monitoring , and many people want a simpler fix .
This idea is an attempt at providing one , but the plan elevates pornography over every other ill on the web : violence , racism , consumerism , and plenty of other " isms " would all be fit for the " community port , " while porn would find itself on a special channel .
The port solution might be a nice solution to the porn problem ( in theory ) for those offended by it , but it 's unlikely to work in practice .
If mandated by government , all the old problems about " who decides ? " pop up again , and censorship questions rear their ugly heads ( does the government really want to get into the battle of classifying websites ?
Probably not ) .
If left up to voluntary compliance , however , nothing 's going to change , because few pornographers want to be confined to an easily - blocked ghetto , and the plan would face all the same problems faced by the .xxx domain name idea .
Even if it were to pass , how would it possibly be implemented ?
Would consumers really choose to shut off all access to other countries ?
This approach would only work well in a worldwide context with most nations signing on — which suggests that CP80's proposal really belongs with an international body like ICANN or the UN .
A resolution signed by the governor of Utah seems hardly the way to make it happen .

The Game : Setting Up the Board
America 's up to something .
The Bush administration 's ham - fisted efforts at diplomacy ground to a halt this week when it became apparent that the UN Security Council would not be bullied into supporting America 's war plans .
In fact , America 's ultimatum - Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq to forestall the invasion - is itself just the latest in a long string of lies , since White House Spokesperson Ari Fleischer announced that US forces will still " enter Iraq " , ostensibly so Iraq can be disarmed . [ 1 ]
If America 's goal was disarmament , then it would allow the UNMOVIC and IAEA inspectors to continue their work , which Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei agree is progressing with Iraq 's cooperation . [ 2 ]
Even as Blix complained that the inspections have been interrupted despite their progress [ 3 ] and UN Director - General Kofi Annan questioned the invasion 's legitimacy without a Security Council resolution [ 4 ] , America is going ahead with its plans , citing the support of its " coalition of the willing " ( this will be discussed further in Newsletter # 18 , coming soon ) .
Ultimately , the Bush administration 's line on Iraq just does n't add up .
In the past year , the government has burned through several reasons , one after another , on why the rest of the world should support America 's invasion plans .
As each reason is discredited , the government segues seamlessly to the next one .
It 's part of the " War on Terror " - Saddam has links to al - Qaeda .
Well , okay , he does n't , but Saddam has nuclear weapons .
Well , okay , he does n't have nukes , but Saddam has chemical and biological weapons .
Okay , Saddam does n't have any of those , either , but he could have them " within months " .
Alright , so his weapons program is a shambles , almost completely dismantled , but did you know that Saddam gassed his own people ?
What ?
We sold him the chemical weapons ?
Never mind that - Saddam is a tyrant and we need to liberate Iraq 's people because we care about human rights .
Saddam would rejuvenate his banned weapons programs if he could !
We just wo n't be safe until Saddam is gone .
In any case , Bush would lose face if he backs down now .
Did we mention that Saddam oppresses Iraqi Kurds ?
We care about the Kurds .
What do you mean , our ally Turkey also oppresses the Kurds ?
Wait , Saddam does have links to al - Qaeda after all !
This is part of the " War on Terror " .
Did we mention that Saddam kicked out the UN inspectors ?
And so on , ad nauseum .
When the official reason to invade shifts with the prevailing winds , you can be sure that the real reason is buried somewhere deep under the pronouncements .
Into the gaping hole left by the Bush administration 's hollow rhetoric has rushed a host of theories , some credible and some outrageous .
Overwhelmingly , the most oft - repeated claim is that this war is about oil .
Drilling for Answers
Well , in any government composed of George W. Bush ( Arbusto , Harken ) , Dick Cheney ( Halliburton ) , Condoleeza Rice ( Exxon ) , Donald Evans ( Tom Brown ) , Spencer Abraham ( Ford , GM , DaimlerChrysler ) , Gale Norton ( Delta Petroleum ) , Andrew Card ( GM ) , Zalmay Khalilzad ( Unocal ) , and others , plus executives from the Defense and Aerospace industries [ 5 ] , it 's pretty clear that oil comes into play somewhere in their plans , especially considering the fact that the US government regards oil as a strategic resource and a matter of national security .
Certainly , British Petroleum CEO
Lord Browne has no illusions about the importance of oil , of which Iraq has the world 's second largest reserves after Saudi Arabia .
He has warned the US government not to hoard all the oil for American companies [ 6 ] .
White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer has stated that after the Hussein regime is toppled , America will use Iraqi oil sales to pay for reconstruction , leading some officials to refer to the oil as " spoils of war . "
[ 7 ]
It 's surely relevant that the two countries most in favour of invading Iraq - America and Britain - are home to the world 's largest oil companies .
In descending order of size , they are : Exxon Mobil ( US ) , Royal Dutch - Shell ( UK ) , British Petroleum - Amoco ( UK ) , and Chevron - Texaco ( US ) .
Since America and Britain have been the strongest proponents of the sanctions against Iraq , these companies have had the most difficulty doing business in Iraq , but the world 's second largest reserves of oil are a tantalizing prize .
In 1998 , Chevron CEO Kenneth T. Derr told the Commonwealth Club of San Fransisco that " Iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas  reserves Id love Chevron to have access to . " [ 8 ]
Further , in spite of the sanctions , Iraq is the sixth largest importer of oil to America , behind Canada , Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , Mexico , and Nigeria .
Bush 's Energy Policy underlines the importance of Persian Gulf oil , noting that " By 2020 , Gulf oil producers are projected to supply between 54 and 67 percent of the world 's oil ... This region will remain vital to U.S. interests ...
By any estimation , Middle East oil producers will remain central to world oil security .
The Gulf will by a primary focus of US international energy policy . " [ 9 ]
This merely echoes the longstanding American claim that free access to Gulf oil is a matter of national security .
Consider this statement of policy for United States Central Command ( USCENTCOM ) , which General Tommy Franks now commands :
The broad national security interests and objectives expressed in the President 's National Security Strategy ( NSS ) and the Chairman 's National Military Strategy ( NMS ) form the foundation of the United States Central Command 's theater strategy ... The purpose of U.S. engagement , as espoused in the NSS , is to protect the United States ' vital interest in the region - uninterrupted , secure U.S. / Allied access to Gulf oil . [ 10 ]
Lining up at the Trough
American oil services companies like Halliburton , of which Vice President Dick Cheney was recently the CEO , and Schlumberger Ltd. , of which one board member , MIT Professor John M. Deutch , was the Director of Central Intelligence when the CIA tried to stage a coup in Iraq and is a strong advocate for invasion , supplied Iraq with millions of dollars worth of oil services in the 1990s , circumventing American sanctions by operating through foreign subsidiaries . [ 11 ]
These companies are expected to be early winners after Hussein is deposed , when they are awarded contracts to rehabilitate Iraq 's derelict oil infrastructure . [ 12 ]
Halliburton has already been awarded a contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Iraq 's oilfields after the war . [ 13 ]
The US government will probably tear up the memoranda of agreement that Hussein signed with European oil companies to develop Iraq 's oilfields after the sanctions are lifted [ 14 ] , but the oil companies themselves are generally keeping a low profile in their enquiries .
Bid invitations for reconstruction contracts through USAID are quietly being given exclusively to American companies , which currently are partially locked out of Iraq due to the sanctions . [ 15 ]
As one industry executive put it , " these companies are really in a position to win something out of this geopolitical situation . " [ 16 ]
This tendency to invite only American companies to bid for post - Hussein contracts is what sparked BP 's Lord Browne 's concerns that the American - only trend would continue to new oilfield development contracts .
However , it is dangerously misleading to assume that this war is mostly or even mainly about securing access to Iraq 's vast oilfields .
America 's demand for imported oil will increase significantly over the next fifty years , but there 's no shortage of companies - or countries - willing to sell it , including Iraq under Hussein .
Further , as neoconservatives love to point out , simply increasing the supply of oil by turning up Iraq 's pipes will theoretically hurt the oil industry , because the increased supply will depress the unit price , leading to reduced profits . [ 17 ] .
Unless we look beyond access to oil and towards more ambitious , long - term goals , America 's war on Iraq seems confusing at best .
Beyond Oil
So it 's not just about oil .
But neither is it about ridding the world of terrorists , as the US government and its conservative mouthpieces continue to assert despite the utter lack of credible evidence to link Iraq with al - Qaeda .
The Bush administration would have us believe that all of its efforts abroad are dedicated to the cause of making the world a safer place for freedom and democracy .
Doubtless , anti-terrorist activities form part of America 's agenda .
But if we assumed , as Bush insists , that this is the real issue , particularly in regards to Iraq , then we would become understandably confused .
The Washington Post reports that on September 17 , 2001 , President Bush signed a top secret document outlining the US government 's plan to invade Afghanistan and to begin planning the invasion of Iraq .
Noting that this policy decision was made in an " ad hoc " way by long - time hardliners outside the normal decision - making channels , the Post reported that the pressure to invade Iraq preceded 9/11 , but that the hardliners were previously stymied by the dissent of moderates in the Administration . [ 18 ]
The decision to invade Iraq was made by taking immediate steps to link Saddam Hussein with the " war on terror , " a linkage no one , including the CIA , is able to establish .
In fact , Donald Rumsfeld contacted his aides in the Defense Department to begin drafting plans to invade Iraq mere hours after the 9/11 attacks .
" Go massive , " Rumsfeld told his aides , asking them to establish how to include Iraq in the battle plans being drafted against al Qaeda .
Rumsfeld does not seem to have been concerned whether Iraq was actually involved .
" Sweep it all up , " he told his staff .
" Things related and not . " [ 19 ]
The Bush administration hawks ' desire to invade Iraq was merely waiting for the right circumstances , which the 9/11 attacks provided .
Five years ago , Paul Wolfowitz ( deputy Secretary of Defense ) and Zalmay Khalilzad ( Special Envoy to Afghanistan ) , both of whom I will discuss in more detail below , wrote articles for the Weekly Standard under the topic " Saddam Must Go : A How - To Guide . "
Also in 1998 , a number of US hawks , including Wolfowitz , Khalilzad , Donald Rumsfeld , and Richard Perle , wrote an open letter to President Clinton urging " a comprehensive political and military strategy for bringing down Saddam and his regime . " [ 20 ]
Pax Americana
The Bush administration claims to be invading Iraq to secure freedom and democracy .
This makes sense if we apply a very special definition of " freedom and democracy . "
In standard American government rhetoric , expanding freedom and democracy abroad means pursuing America 's interests abroad .
If actual freedom an democracy happen to ensue , then so be it ; at the same time , if it results in greater oppression , that 's okay too , as long as American interests are served .
In fact , America 's current plans only start to make sense if we replace the commonsense definition of " freedom and democracy " with this special definition .
I mean to argue that the Bush administration has planned nothing less than global Imperial hegemony .
I write this neither rhetorically nor hyperbolically ;
The Merriam - Webster dictionary defines Imperialism as :
the policy , practice , or advocacy of extending the power and dominion of a nation especially by direct territorial acquisitions or by gaining indirect control over the political or economic life of other areas ; broadly : the extension or imposition of power , authority , or influence
Many governments , especially in democracies , are composed mainly of lawyers , and it shows .
The Bush government is composed mainly of military hawks , oil executives , and industrialists .
And it shows .
As the following evidence will demonstrate , global imperialism is exactly what America plans to pursue .
I will focus my argument primarily on four sources , all of which are linked to US government officials and planners , and all of which espouse a policy of global reach and influence , preventing , co-opting , or pre-empting actual and potential rivals , and reshaping global politics to serve America 's interests .
They are :
The Grand Chessboard : American Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives , by Zbigniew Brzezinski , Basic Books , 1998
, by Zbigniew Brzezinski , Basic Books , 1998 The Principles and position papers of the Project for a New American Century
The 1992 draft of the Defense Policy Guidance
President Bush 's National Security Strategy
as well as various reports and papers that document America 's efforts in this regard .
Because it sets the stage for America 's long term strategy , I will address the first of these sources , The Grand Chessboard , in the second part of this newsletter .
The other three sources will make up the bulk of material for Newsletter # 15 , The Game : Players & Strategies .
The Grand Chessboard
To understand what America has planned , we begin with Zbigniew Brzezinski , Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) Scholar , Trustee of the Trilateral Commission , former National Security Advisor to President Carter , former Member of the NSC - Defense Department Commission on Integrated Long - Term Strategy for President Reagan , former Member of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board for President Reagan , and former Director of the Trilateral Commission .
In 1998 , he wrote a small but influential book , The Grand Chessboard : American Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives , in which he established a framework for continued American global hegemony .
The nice thing about reading The Grand Chessboard is that Brzezinski largely dispenses with the quasi-evangelistic , pro-American rhetoric that characterizes so much writing by Americans about American imperialism .
Instead , Brzezinski unapologetically regards America as a global empire , and writes pragmatically about what America can do to maintain and build on its unique historical position .
He identifies four of what he calls " decisive domains of global power " : military scale and reach , economic output and growth , technological innovation , and cultural appeal .
He observes that while other countries may rival America in one of the last three domains ( for example , Germany and Japan challenge America 's economic supremacy ) , America has the largest and best - positioned military by a huge margin , and only America can claim primacy in all four domains .
( p. 24 )
Brzezinski makes the case that for America to maintain its position of world hegemony for as long as possible , it needs to establish clear dominance over the massive Eurasian landmass , which :
is the globe 's largest continent and is geopolitically axial .
A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world 's three most advanced and economically productive regions .
A mere glance at the map also suggests that control over Eurasia would almost automatically entail Africa 's subordination , rendering the Western Hemisphere and Oceania geopolitically peripheral to the world 's central continent .
About 75 percent of the world 's people live in Eurasia , and most of the world 's physical wealth is there as well , both in its enterprises and underneath its soil .
Eurasia accounts for about 60 percent of world 's GNP and about three - fourths of the world 's known energy resources .
( p. 31 )
The Cold War is best understood as a competition between the American empire ( which controlled most of the world 's seas ) and the Soviet empire ( which controlled most of the world 's land ) over which would eventually prevail and gain effective global control .
He notes that the effect of nuclear deterrence via mutually assured destruction " made the contest truly unique ...
The intensity of the conflict was thus simultaneously subjected to extraordinary self - restraint on the part of both rivals . " ( p. 6 ) The Cold War ended with the struggle over southern Eurasia , when the Soviet empire invaded Afghanistan , the American empire intervened to support anti-Soviet rebels ( i.e. the Mujahideen , about whom I write in Newsletter # 8 , in order to give the Soviet empire " its Vietnam war " as Brzezinski explained in a 1998 interview ) , and America engaged in " a large - scale buildup of the US military presence in the Persian Gulf ... on a par with its western and eastern Eurasian security interests . " ( p. 7 )
When the Soviet empire finally collapsed under the weight of its own internal contradictions , authoritarian structure , and diminished capacity for creativity and enterprise , America found itself " simultaneously the first and the only truly global power . " ( p. 10 ) Similar to previous empires , " the exercise of American ' imperial ' power is derived in large measure from superior organization , from the ability to mobilize vast economic and technological resources promptly for military purposes , from the vague but significant cultural appeal of the American way of life , and from the sheer dynamism and inherent competitiveness of the American social and political elites .
Earlier empires , too , partook of these attributes . " ( p. 10 ) Specifically , America controls all the world 's oceans and seas , and has established military bases all around the periphery of Eurasia in such a way that it can " project its power inland in politically significant ways .
Its military legions are firmly perched on the western and eastern extremities of Eurasia , and they also control the Persian Gulf .
American vassals and tributaries , some yearning to be embraced by even more formal ties to Washington , dot the entire Eurasian continent . " ( p. 23 )
In order to maintain this position of dominance , America must exercise care and forethought in dealing with potential rivals , particularly Russia and China .
He writes that " Lacking the ability to project forces over long distances in order to impose their political will and being technologically more backward than America , ( Russia and China ) do not have the means to exercise - nor soon attain - sustained political clout worldwide . " ( p. 24 ) America must act to make sure this does not change .
To execute what Brzezinski calls " the long - term management of America 's Eurasian geopolitical interests , " ( p. 39 ) America must do two things , worth quoting in full :
first , to identify the geostrategically dynamic Eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them ; and to pinpoint the geopolitically critical Eurasian states whose location and / or existence have catalytic effects either on the more active geostrategic players or on regional conditions ;
second , to formulate specific US policies to offset , co-opt , and / or control the above , so as to preserve and promote vital US interests , and to conceptualize a more comprehensive geostrategy that establishes on a global scale the interconnection between the more specific US policies .
( emphasis added ) ( pp. 39 - 40 )
In other words , determine what other countries or alliances could possibly usurp America 's primacy , and then move pre-emptively to ensure they do not gain enough power to do so .
This includes preventing countries from forming strategic alliances that do not serve America 's interests , or in Brzezinski 's words , " consolidat ( ing ) and perpetuat ( ing ) the prevailing geopolitical pluralism on the map of Eurasia . " ( p. 198 ) He warns that America must " prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge America 's primacy , not to mention the remote possibility of any one particular state seeking to do so . " ( p. 198 ) Brzezinski summarizes his strategy with shocking bluntness when he writes , " the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals , to keep tributaries pliant and protected , and to keep the barbarians from coming together . " ( p. 40 )
One way America acts to co-opt potential alliances and power grabs is to establish and dominate a series of key institutions that it can manipulate to maintain a balance of power among its potential rivals .
These institutions and agreements include : an expanded NATO that encompasses the new Eastern European and Balkan countries , ongoing support and protection of Japan in order to maintain its military subjugation , multilateral investment organizations like NAFTA and APEC , strong military presence in the Persian Gulf , and the IMF / World Bank system , which , " in reality ... are heavily American dominated " .
( p. 27 ) He notes that , as a practical result of America 's centrality in all these world institutions , over a thousand foreign governments and organizations have registered active lobbying groups in America in an attempt to influence American foreign policy .
In a rare burst of gushing , he calls this " the highest compliment that the world pays to the centrality of the democratic process " in America ( p. 28 ) , but in reality , this merely represents widespread recognition that America truly has the power to shape the fates of other countries .
Of special concern are Russia and China .
It will be exceedingly difficult to co-opt even a democratizing Russia , since that country has a " deeply ingrained desire for a special Eurasian role . " ( p. 51 ) Russian officials believe - correctly - that America wants to prevent this , by co-opting Russia 's former vassals .
Brzezinski stresses the importance of recognizing and aiding the independence of the Eastern European and Balkan states in order to prevent their reversion under Russia 's imperial umbrella .
This is especially true of the Caspian countries , with their potentially massive supplies of oil and natural gas .
It is vital to American interests that these countries be " linked to Western markets by pipelines that do not pass through Russian - controlled territory . " ( p. 47 ) He singles out Azerbaijan as " the cork in the bottle containing the riches of the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia , " ( p. 46 )
Similarly , China represents a potentially significant regional power that could block America 's Eastern dominance .
Brzezinski writes ,
" The most appealing outcome ( of China 's emergence as a major power ) would be to co-opt a democratizing and free - marketing China into a larger Asian regional framework of cooperation " ( p. 54 ) , but he warns that a China that continues to grow in power but refuses to be co-opted " could entail an intensifying conflict . " ( p. 54 ) Brzezinski's worst scenario would be what he calls an " antihegemonic coalition " ( p. 54 ) of China , Russia , and Iran , which would be comparable to the Soviet Union in its ability to block America 's pursuit of its interests .
This must be prevented at all costs .
Brzezinski writes at some length about the peculiar tensions of a global empire with a democratic system of government at home .
He notes that , at the ending of the Cold War , " the emergence of the United States as the single global power did not evoke much public gloating but rather elicited an inclination toward a more limited definition of American responsibilities abroad . " ( p. 25 ) That is , Americans do not want America to use its power to increase and entrench its global control .
Polls consistently show that Americans want America to share power with other countries .
As a result , America must exercise its power with more tact and less overt military action than empires in the past .
He writes that " America is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad .
This limits the use of America 's power , especially its capacity for military intimidation ... the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion , except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public 's sense of domestic well - being ( emphasis added ) . " ( pp.35 -36 )
I 'll return to this emphasized point later in more detail , but let me leave it right now with the observation that Brzezinski was Director of the Trilateral Commission , a group that observed in its 1975 Task Force Report " The Crisis of Democracy " that " Some of the problems of governance in the United States today stem from an excess of democracy ( emphasis added ) . "
( Michael Crozier , Samuel P. Huntington , Joji Watanuki , The Crisis of Democracy : a Report on the Governability of Democracies to the Trilateral Commission , New York University Press , 1975 , p. 113 )
The authors argued that governments need to find ways to scale back the active participation of their citizens so that the decision - making process does n't get bogged down .
" The effective operation of a democratic political system usually requires some measure of apathy and noninvolvement on the part of some individuals and groups . " ( p. 114 ) This profoundly anti-democratic report claimed that " In many situations the claims of expertise , seniority , experience and special talents may override the claims of democracy as a way of constituting authority . " ( p. 113 ) However , the report lamented that all kinds of previously marginalized and apolitical groups in America were insisting on more direct involvement in the formation of policy .
Brzezinski returns to this theme later in The Grand Chessboard when he writes that " as America becomes an increasingly multicultural society , it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues , except in the circumstances of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat .
Such a consensus generally existed throughout World War II and even during the Cold War ( emphasis added ) . " ( p. 211 )
Ultimately , Brzezinski's is the most balanced and nuanced of the frameworks for American global hegemony .
He advocates continued America geostrategic primacy for the short and medium term , while acknowledging that in the long term , America must build the kind of international structure that will sustain a global peace after America 's dominance inevitably wanes .
He advocates détente with Iran and China , preferring to co-opt them into the global framework rather than demonizing - and trying to isolate - those significant regional powers .
At the same time , he apparently was critical of the Clinton administration 's dovish premise that " the threat of war is off the table " , claiming that this premise " is likely to be stable only in those parts of the world in which American primacy , guided by a long - term geostrategy , rests on compatible and congenital sociopolitical systems . " ( p. 56 ) That is , in parts of the world with incompatible sociopolitical systems , the threat of war must be put back on the table .
Compared to other models to be discussed in this essay , The Grand Chessboard is relatively dovish .
Brzezinski argues that " it is unlikely that democratic America will wish to be permanently engaged in the difficult , absorbing , and costly task of managing Eurasia by constant manipulation and maneuver , backed by American military resources , in order to prevent regional domination by any one power . " ( pp. 198-199 ) Instead , it makes more sense to cultivate " genuine strategic partnerships " in Eurasia , so that eventually , Eurasia 's own powers will act to preserve peace and security in order to protect their own " vital interests . " ( p. 199 ) He observes that " ( n ) uclear weapons have dramatically reduced the utility of war as a tool of policy or even as a threat , " ( p. 36 ) and that , therefore , " maneuver , diplomacy , coalition building , co-optation , and the very deliberate deployment of one 's political assets have become the key ingredients " of America 's ability to maintain it 's primacy in Eurasia .
Unfortunately , as we will soon see , the current US government has revealed a much greater passion for the utility of war as a means of maintaining and bolstering its primacy .
Brzezinski also recognizes the great value of America's " cultural superiority " and " cultural appeal " as means to influence other countries without great military expenditure .
He observes that Germany and Japan " recovered their economic health in the context of almost unbridled admiration for all things American .
America was widely perceived as representing the future , as a society worthy of admiration and deserving of emulation . " ( p. 8 ) Brzezinski notes that this is a classic feature of successful empires , noting that Rome " exercised its sway largely through superior military organization and cultural appeal ( emphasis added ) " ( p.21 and that the British empire prior to World War I enjoyed " Cultural superiority , successfully asserted and quietly conceded , ( which ) had the effect of reducing the need to rely on large military forces to maintain the power of the imperial center . " ( p.21 )
Under the Bush administration , America is now losing that " cultural appeal " , and its increasingly belligerent power mongering is quickly dampening the " almost unbridled admiration for all things American " that sustained over half a century of hegemony among the western democracies in Western Europe and East Asia .
The appeal of American - style liberty and democracy , or its " cultural superiority " , are diminished by its rampant anti-liberal and anti-democratic activities on the world stage .
America 's great strength has been the sheen of freedom and democracy that it has projected onto the world stage .
However , the current administration 's severe bellicosity is making it impossible to maintain the fiction that America stands for freedom and democracy , either at home or abroad .
As faith in the American model is eroded by America 's heightened readiness to use force , the " cultural appeal " that has , in the past , had citizens of other countries welcoming and celebrating the arrival of American troops ( recall the protesters at Tiannmen Square , who still saw the Statue of Liberty as a symbol of freedom ) will also erode the support of America 's " vassals " .
That will , in turn , increase America 's reliance on force as a means of maintaining control .
Unfortunately , the Bush administration does not seem to see this as a problem .
In summary , Brzezinski's framework for continued American global primacy is based on the following :
Continued global dominance in the four decisive domains : military scale and reach , economic output , technological innovation , and cultural appeal
A strong and decisive presence in Eurasia based on control of the oceans and of strategic linchpins around Eurasia 's periphery ( Europe , Japan / South Korea , Persian Gulf )
Identification of potential rivals or alliances of potential rivals
Pre-emptive moves to prevent those potential rivals from aspiring to challenge America 's dominance , by : blocking alliances maintaining and expanding strong military presence and reach , especially in the Persian Gulf and in Asia , where America does not enjoy the benefits of cultural appeal minimizing asymmetries between competing powers by manipulating America - centred global institutions Co-opting and democratizing hostile regimes , possibly through invasion and regime change preserving the subjugation of America 's protectorates , including Japan , Israel , Turkey ,
A comprehensive , unified global strategy for fulfilling these aims
Next Issue :
Probably the single most influential think tank in America today is the conservative Project for a New American Century .
PNAC members occupy some of the highest posts in the Bush administration , and their policy recommendations quickly become official government policy .
In the next issue , we will look closely at PNAC , its membership and policies , and other activities of PNAC members over the past decade .

On a clear day I can see forever .
Clarity is good .
When I look at my code , the bit I am writing right now , if it is clear , I can understand what it does , why and how .
If I look around at the other pieces of code I am using and they are clear I can understand what they are doing and why , and no doubt if I care to look inside them I can discover how , though because they are clear I do not need to do that .
It does n’t matter if I wrote them , or someone else did , because their intention is clear .
If my project manager looks at my software and all is clear , then even though he does n’t understand what I have been doing , certainly not in any detail , he can still understand what it does and why .
If my users look at my software and all is clear , then even though they have never seen the source code , nor programmed a line of code in their life , and even if they have , it does n’t matter because the intention is clear and they understand how the software works and why .
They can see how to do what they want to do , without needless detail nor resorting to manuals or forums or google .
If everything is clear , everything is good .
And if everything is not good , I can fix it , because its clear what is not good and why and how .
So when I name my variables and functions and classes I think for a moment , so I can be clear about what I want this thing to do .
And if I change my mind , because something has become clear to me , then I change the name of the variable or method or class so it is clear for everyone .
Sometimes a class or function or variable is not used clearly and is confused , so I change it , split it up , merge it together , rewrite it until it is clear or as clear as I can make it right now .
But I come back to it .
You might think , um , does n’t this take time , well yes it does , but you have to speculate to accumulate and I do and so I do .
So when the software is complete and everyone can see it is complete , it took less time and works better .
Though that is not always obvious to everyone .
And it is good and I know it is good , because it is clear , at least to me .
There have been studies made , many , many studies and it turns out almost all programming is thinking , of the order of 80 % ( Glass , Robert L. Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering – Fact 22 – I implore you to read this book , if you havn’t already , it contains what appear to be actual facts ) , in fact almost all software development regardless of the activity is thinking , of the order of 70 % ( Fred Brookes via Allen Holub here ) .
So if it is clear , I can get to understanding more quickly and from there I can get to the right answer , but if it is not clear , then I will make mistakes and invalid assumptions and do the wrong thing .
Then I have two problems , the original problem and the mistakes I have made .
In fact if everything is clear , the odds are good that I will ‘ see ’ a problem just by reading through the code , while I am working on it .
Or maybe the code will tell me I have got it wrong , because of instrumentation I have put in it .
So I try and make everything clear , because clear begets elegance , which is better even than cuspy .

An IBM scientist holds a thinned wafer of silicon computer circuits , which is ready for bonding to another circuit wafer , where IBM´s advanced " through - silicon via " process will connect the wafers together by etching thousands of holes through each layer and filling them with metal to create 3 - D integrated stacked chips .
The IBM breakthrough can shorten wire lengths inside chips up to 1000 times and allow for hundreds more pathways for data to flow among different functions on a chip .
This technique will extend Moore´s Law beyond its expected limits , paving the way for a new breed of smaller , faster and lower power chips .

IBM today announced a breakthrough chip - stacking technology in a manufacturing environment that paves the way for three - dimensional chips that will extend Moore ’s Law beyond its expected limits .
The technology – called “ through - silicon vias ” -- allows different chip components to be packaged much closer together for faster , smaller , and lower - power systems .
The IBM breakthrough enables the move from horizontal 2 - D chip layouts to 3 - D chip stacking , which takes chips and memory devices that traditionally sit side by side on a silicon wafer and stacks them together on top of one another .
The result is a compact sandwich of components that dramatically reduces the size of the overall chip package and boosts the speed at which data flows among the functions on the chip .
“ This breakthrough is a result of more than a decade of pioneering research at IBM , ” said Lisa Su , vice president , Semiconductor Research and Development Center , IBM .
“ This allows us to move 3 - D chips from the ' lab to the fab ' across a range of applications . ”
The new IBM method eliminates the need for long - metal wires that connect today ’s 2 - D chips together , instead relying on through - silicon vias , which are essentially vertical connections etched through the silicon wafer and filled with metal .
These vias allow multiple chips to be stacked together , allowing greater amounts of information to be passed between the chips .
The technique shortens the distance information on a chip needs to travel by 1000 times , and allows for the addition of up to 100 times more channels , or pathways , for that information to flow compared to 2 - D chips .
IBM is already running chips using the through - silicon via technology in its manufacturing line and will begin making sample chips using this method available to customers in the second half of 2007 , with production in 2008 .
The first application of this through - silicon via technology will be in wireless communications chips that will go into power amplifiers for wireless LAN and cellular applications .
3 - D technology will also be applied to a wide range of chips , including those running now in IBM ’s high - performance servers and supercomputers that power the world ’s business , government and scientific efforts .
In particular , IBM is applying the new through - silicon - via technique in wireless communications chips , Power processors , Blue Gene supercomputer chips , and in high - bandwidth memory applications :
-- 3 - D FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY : IBM is using through - silicon via technology to improve power efficiency in silicon - germanium based wireless products up to 40 percent , which leads to longer battery life .
The through - silicon via technology replaces the wire bonds that are less efficient at transferring signals off of the chip .
-- POWER PROCESSORS EXPLORE 3 - D FOR POWER GRID STABILITY :
As we increase the number of processor cores on chips , one of the limitations in performance is uniform power delivery to all parts of the chip .
This technique puts the power closer to the cores and allows each core to have ample access to that power , increasing processor speed while reducing power consumption up to 20 percent .
-- BRINGING 3 -D STACKING TO BLUE GENE SUPERCOMPUTING AND MEMORY ARRAYS :
The most advanced version of 3 - D chip stacking will allow high - performance chips to be stacked on top of each other , for example processor - on - processor or memory - on - processor .
IBM is developing this advanced technology by converting the chip that currently powers the fastest computer in the world , the IBM Blue Gene supercomputer , into a 3 - D stacked chip .
IBM is also using 3 - D technology to fundamentally change the way memory communicates with a microprocessor , by significantly enhancing the data flow between microprocessor and memory .
This capability will enable a new generation of supercomputers .
A prototype SRAM design using 3 - D stacking technology is being fabricated in IBM 's 300 mm production line using 65 nm- node technology .
IBM has been researching 3 - D stacking technology for more than a decade at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and now at its labs around the world .
This is the fifth major chip breakthrough in five months from IBM , as it leads the industry in its quest for new materials and architectures to extend Moore ’s Law .
In December , IBM announced the first 45 nm chips using immersion lithography and ultra - low - K interconnect dielectrics .
In January , IBM and Intel separately announced “ high - k metal gate , ” which substitutes a new material into a critical portion of the transistor that controls its primary on / off switching function .
The material provides superior electrical properties , while allowing the size of the transistor to be shrunk beyond limits being reached today .
In February , IBM revealed a first - of - its - kind , on - chip memory technology that features the fastest access times ever recorded in eDRAM ( embedded dynamic random access memory ) .
Then in March , IBM unveiled a prototype optical transceiver chipset capable of reaching speeds at least eight - times faster than optical components available today .

“ Do n’t think and then write it down .
Think on paper . ”
Harry Kemelman
***********************************************
Get things down on paper first .
Then rearrange , adjust , and tweak .
Right now , I have three clients in the humanities who keep getting stuck on the outlines of their dissertations .
As they plan the sequence of their arguments , they get stuck because every theory and every argument can be connected in a multitude of ways .
There is no perfect order , I tell them .
In life , things are not linear and do n’t follow a single sequence .
Complex ideas are truly connected in a multitude of logical ways .
Write first , I suggest .
Work with the outline you ’ve got and , as you ’re writing , if you find that things come up in a different way , then take that path .
Do n’t worry about whether it is the “ right ” path , or even the “ best ” path .
Get it down on paper .
Then assess .
You can go back and evaluate the order of your narrative at a later phase .
You can get feedback from other people – especially your advisor – about choosing a sensible line of reasoning .
Trust your unconscious more :
When you allow yourself to slip into the flow of steady writing , you may be surprised at the fluidity of the logic that emerges as the words tumble out .
Thinking on paper is just as important for people in the sciences .
In most cases , the order that scientific data should be presented is fairly clear ; but scientists can still gain important benefits by writing before they have finished data collection .
I ’ve convinced one of my clients to begin writing his results section even though he still needs to conduct a few more experiments .
As he has begun to put together his tables , and writing up his results , he has discovered gaps in his argument that need to be filled .
There are a few logical holes that suggest additional experiments and appropriate controls .
As he writes , my client is locating areas where he can strengthen the power of his propositions .
Of course he can’t write about experiments that have n’t yet been conducted .
Therefore , when he ca n’t add any more prose to his results section until he conducts a certain experiment , he keeps his paper moving forward by writing the methods section , the literature review , and pieces of his discussion .
Daily writing is possible while he ’s still in the process of data collection .
The scholarship of social scientists falls in between that of those in the humanities and the sciences .
Their research tends to alternate between clear linear progression and areas that could be connected in many , equally valid directions .
Either way , social scientist can think on paper .
Writing as you go , watching your ideas and findings take shape on paper , is a useful approach in any field .
It is my experience that all scholars should attempt to write on a consistent basis , from the inception of a project and during data collection process , rather than at the conclusion of their research process .
Unfortunately , this skill is not taught .
In fact , high school students and undergraduates are routinely expected to collect and read material and write their papers as the final step .
This habit usually persists , unexamined .
It may not feel natural at first to write as you go .
But it is a technique that can be learned .
And I promise that if you think on paper , on a consistent basis , your scholarship will improve and your productivity will soar .
The Islamists control much of southern Somalia
The cinema owner and a young girl were reportedly killed by militia loyal to the Union of Islamic Courts , who seized control of parts of Somalia last month .
The courts have introduced Sharia law , including in some areas a World Cup broadcast ban .
Somalia has had no effective central government since 1992 .
According to reports on a Somali news network , gunmen arrived to close down the cinema in the town of Dhuusa Marreeb in central Galgadud district , where a crowd had gathered to watch the Germany - Italy World Cup semi-final .
Some of the football fans began to protest and according to reports , the gunmen fired in the air in an attempt to disperse them .
When this failed , shots were fired at the demonstrators and two people were killed .
The introduction of Islamic law , or Sharia , has included in some areas a ban on cinemas and on broadcasts of World Cup games because they have carried advertisements for alcohol .
The courts now control much of southern Somalia , introducing a level of civil administration and justice which the country has not seen for the past 15 years .
The BBC's Hassan Barise says in more than a decade of Islamic justice in the capital , there have been more than 16 amputations - the punishment for theft - in that time .
But there have been no confirmed amputations or stonings to death - for murder or rape - in the month since the Islamists seized the capital .
One of the new Islamist leaders , Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys has called on the interim government to impose Sharia law but our correspondent says his colleagues have offered assurances they do not want a Taleban - style state .
Dangerous
Meanwhile , regional diplomats are meeting the interim government in Baidoa to discuss the possible deployment of a regional peacekeeping force to the fragmented country .
Facts and figures about life in Somalia
At-a-glance
Headed by President Abdullahi Yusuf , the government is confined to the town and is unable to relocate to the capital , Mogadishu , now under control of the Islamic courts .
The diplomats are from the Arab League , African Union and the East African regional organisation , Igad , which last month said it intended to send a peacekeeping force of Ugandan and Sudanese troops .
But the Islamists say they are opposed to the deployment of any foreign forces .
After talks in Baidoa , the diplomats say they hope to go on to Mogadishu for direct talks with the Islamist leaders .
On Tuesday , a two - member United Nations security team met Mogadishu 's new rulers in the capital : the UN 's first contact with them since they took over from the warlords a month ago .
Most aid workers have pulled out of Mogadishu because it is too dangerous .
A Swedish journalist was shot dead at a rally in the city last month .
Somalis , weary after 15 years without an effective national government , are worried about a possible new conflict between Islamist and secular forces in their country .
Correction :
This article incorrectly asserted that a non-profit Common Knowledge violated a children 's online protection law .
That was incorrect as the rule applies only to commercial websites .
I regret the error .
The FBI has set up a masterful site called Safe Online Surfing to help kids learn how to use the internet safely .
Via a scavenger hunt , children get to learn that it 's okay to talk about Disney characters online , get online safety tips from the Miami Dolphins website and take an Internet test at the Common Knowledge Scholarship Foundation .
Now , what 's great is n't that the final Internet quiz actually tests you on whether you know how to become an FBI Special Agent ( Sample question :
What do you say to a female applicant who says she 's not strong enough to bust down doors ? )
What 's great is that the Common Knowledge site does not comply the Children 's Online Privacy Protection
Act , which mandates that any commercial site collecting personal information on a child under the age of 13 must get verifiable consent from a parent .
As a non-profit organization Common Knowledge does not have to comply with the rules though it claims to be in compliance with COPPA .
Still , I was able to register as a 12 year - old ( First name : Vulnerable , Last name :
Child Address : 123 TouchMe Way ) .
Registration requires a name , an address , a phone number , a date of birth , an email address , your school name , and your extra-curricular interests just to take an online quiz .
While I was required to add my parent 's email address , the site never sent an email to that address , let alone complied with the law requiring the site to get a parent 's verifiable consent .
The site 's legitimacy is only burnished by having its domain registered to a post office box and running Yahoo !
ads on the front page .
This is brilliant since any child going through the scavenger hunt should have learned never to give any of this information out , so the way to finish the scavenger hunt is not to finish it .
Pretty sneaky , FBI .
Schools that do really good on the test get a visit from a professional football player , which makes sense , because nothing says online smarts like a 6 ' , 230 lb linebacker sitting in your school 's cafeteria .
Hat Tip to reader SS who tipped 27B to the site .
Update : Edited the first paragraph for clarity .
Travel
1. Airlines : Paper tickets
You remember actual airline tickets , do n't you ?
If you are n't comfortable with an electronic flight record , you 'll pay a steep price for an old - fashioned paper version .
The paper - ticket fee is all about forcing you to go electronic , thus saving the airlines money .
$ 75 at United ; $ 50 at American , Continental , Northwest and US Airways ; $ 45 at Virgin AtlanticEmbrace change .
When airlines routinely let you use a ticket on another airline if your flight was canceled , carrying a paper ticket was the safest bet .
Today , flights are so full you probably wo n't be able to get on another carrier .
Plus , most major airlines have e-ticket agreements with competitors , so there 's no drawback to going paperless .
Some Democrats want US troops to be brought home now
The Senate narrowly rejected a Republican amendment that would have removed the withdrawal clause from a bill on military funding .
The vote is a boost for the Democrats , but Mr Bush has vowed to veto any bill setting out a timetable for withdrawal .
The House of Representatives also backed withdrawal in a vote last week .
The House bill , which imposes a 31 August 2008 deadline for pulling troops out , was passed narrowly by 218 votes to 212 on Friday .
Both pieces of legislation are tied to more than $ 120bn ( £ 60 bn ) in emergency funding for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A final Senate vote on the whole funding bill will take place later this week .
It will need the support of a dozen Republicans to pass .
' Must change course '
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is definitely a step in the right direction , momentum is growing to end the war
Dylan , South Carolina
Send us your comments
The latest vote was an important and somewhat surprising victory for the Democrats in the latest Congressional skirmish over the war in Iraq , reports the BBC's James Coomarasmy in Washington .
Two weeks ago , Senate Democrats failed to pass legislation setting a timetable for withdrawal , but two more senators sided with them this time , giving them a victory by 50 votes to 48 .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called the vote a significant step forward and a pointed message to Mr Bush .
" With this vote , the Senate is giving our troops the resources they need in combat - including a strategy in Iraq worthy of their sacrifices , " he said .
" The president must change course , and this legislation gives him a chance to do that , " he said .
But there were no concessions from the White House .
Mr Bush " is disappointed that the Senate continues down a path with a bill that he will veto and has no chance of becoming law , " his deputy press secretary , Dana Perino , said in a statement .
And a presidential hopeful , Republican John McCain , said setting a schedule for pulling troops out of Iraq would encourage insurgents .
Republican Senator Lindsay Graham said the Democrats had picked a wrong and dangerous fight :
" Whatever mistakes the Bush team have made - and there are many - the Congress is about to make the greatest mistake of all and that is to tell the enemy what they have to do to get us out of Iraq on their terms , not ours .
" It is a death blow to moderation . "

Cormac McCarthy 's
The Road is set during a nuclear winter .
Two survivors walk south , breathing toxic air , seeking out the continent 's last canned food while ducking bands of flesh - eaters .
Describe it as " post- apocalyptic , " as most critics did , or as a masterpiece of dystopian literature .
Just do n't call McCarthy 's novel " science fiction . "
Even when clearly appropriate , film studios and publishers avoid the phrase " science fiction . "
So do the novelists , film directors and editors in their employ .
McCarthy 's book , which is about to become a blockbuster – Oprah Winfrey will tout it on an upcoming TV show as part of her book club – is just another example of how the powers that be dodge the term , especially when it applies to " serious " fiction or cinema .
You wo n't find the words " science fiction " in Random House 's bio of Arthur C. Clarke Award - winning author China Miéville .
Instead , he 's called the " edgiest mythmaker of the day . "
Michel Gondry 's The Science of Sleep ?
It 's classified as comedy , drama , romance and fantasy , but not sci- fi , at Amazon.com .
Even Battlestar Galactica , the flagship show of ( hello ! ) the Sci Fi Channel , keeps a distance .
" It 's fleshed - out reality , " explains executive producer Ronald D. Moore in the sci - fi mag SFX .
" It 's not in the science - fiction genre . "
The nose - thumbing is nothing new .
In the '50s , Robert Heinlein dismissed the term , opting for " speculative fiction . "
( What fiction is n't ? )
But today , one might imagine that the term could gain traction .
Our lives are entangled with everyday gadgetry Heinlein could only have dreamed of .
The impact of science on culture – climate change , stem - cell research , the internet – is the subject of continuous debate .
Writers including McCarthy and Margaret Atwood ( another despiser of the term " sci-fi " ) and filmmakers like Gondry , Richard Linklater and Darren Aronofsky have explored the terrain of traditional sci-fi .
Plus , the term itself – isolated from its pulpy origins , the fanboy confabs and the endless sniping over its definition – remains an evocative one .
Science fiction : stories that engage with science .
Chris Barsanti , a critic who dared to reference
The Road in terms of sci- fi literature , said the phrase " science fiction " summons images of " space battles , aliens , mad scientists , time travel and the like ... fantasy with testosterone . "
So publishers , wary of putting their book into an " artistic ghetto , " twist themselves into knots to avoid using the label .
In the face of its shrinking reputation , some institutions are attempting to legitimize science fiction .
In 2004 , Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen opened Seattle 's Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame , and The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation gives grants to those who incorporate scientific subject matter into their fictional works .
The University of Kansas and the University of California at Riverside have substantial sci-fi collections .
And the University of Liverpool offers a master 's degree in science - fiction studies and publishes the scholarly journal Foundation .
" There 's been a vast increase in the popularity of science fiction : big special effects movies , TV , games , " says Andy Sawyer , head of Liverpool 's sci- fi department .
" But you rarely see it in the best - seller charts , unless it 's dropped the name ' science fiction . ' "

BBC News , Geneva
Israel says it is ready to use the new symbol outside its borders
In Geneva diplomats from the 192 countries which have signed the Geneva conventions are meeting to discuss a third emblem for the international Red Cross .
Red Cross officials hope approval of a third emblem will finally put an end to decades of controversy over the issue .
At the moment , the only two emblems recognised under the Geneva conventions are the red cross and the red crescent ; relief workers and ambulances bearing these symbols are protected under international law .
In war zones or disaster regions , they must be granted free access to people in need of help .
We 're actually trying to get a solution for the Red Cross , but some seem to want us to try to solve the entire Middle East conflict
Swiss diplomat
Over the years , a number of countries have applied to have their own distinctive emblems recognised , but all have been refused .
Francois Bugnion , director of international law with the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , believes too many emblems could compromise protection .
" Hundreds of emblems would mean they would not be recognised , and so they would not be respected " , he explains .
" They would be identified with different countries , so instead of conveying the message ' this is an ambulance , this is neutral and must be respected ' , it would be a sign of identification which would run against the objective of the protective symbol . "
Red Star of David
One country in particular , however , refuses to use either the red cross or the red crescent .
Israel 's Magen David Adom Society ( MDA ) uses the unrecognised red star of David as its emblem .
As a result , the society is still not a member of the international Red Cross movement , something which many Israelis see as unjust .
Israel 's ambassador to the UN in Geneva , Itzhak Levanon , shares that opinion .
At present , only two emblems are officially recognised
" MDA is active all over the world , " he points out .
" In the tsunami , for example , or following earthquakes , we are often first on the scene , and we deserve to be part of the international movement . "
The problem is , the star of David is primarily Israel 's national symbol , rather than an emblem of humanitarian relief .
Arab states have made it clear they will never accept the red star being recognised under the Geneva Conventions .
At the same time , the conventions stipulate that national relief societies must use only recognised symbols outside their internationally accepted borders .
That means Israel should probably not be using the red star in the occupied territories .
Red Crystal
The wrangling over the issue has gone on for decades , and it is proving costly for the International Red Cross .
For the last five years , the American Red Cross has withheld its subscriptions to the international movement in protest at Israel 's exclusion , creating a shortfall of over $ 30 m .
The only solution seems to be a third emblem , and Red Cross officials have come up with a design they hope will please everyone .
To be known as the red crystal , it is a red diamond shape on a white background .
Israel has said it is ready to use it outside its borders , and , after some intense negotiations , the MDA and the Palestinian Red Crescent signed an agreement on working together in the occupied territories .
Syrian objections
On the surface then , everything looked promising for the approval of the new emblem .
Switzerland , as the repository state for the Geneva Conventions , sent out the invitations for the conference , and Swiss diplomats , who played a key role in getting the agreement between the MDA and the Palestinian Red Crescent , were initially very optimistic .
But there is one issue which might get in the way - many Arab countries already see the third emblem as an unnecessary accommodation of Israel .
Now that the MDA has agreed to work with the Palestinian Red Crescent in the occupied territories , some are suggesting that a similar agreement is necessary for the Golan heights .
Since this is also disputed territory , surely , they say , the Syrian Red Crescent should have a role there ?
" The Syrian Red Crescent cannot operate there , " insists Mr Levanon .
" We have no diplomatic relations with Syria , the issue is simply not in the debate .
But I 'm not excluding that some Arab countries will try to raise it , and if they do , the losers will be the Palestinians , " he says .
' Honest endeavours '
In the last few days , Geneva , normally a tranquil city , has seen a flurry of diplomatic activity , as officials try to reach a last - minute agreement .
Masood Khan , as ambassador for Pakistan , is negotiating on behalf of the 56 countries belonging to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference .
" It 's very complicated , " Mr Khan says .
" All sides are making honest endeavours to reach agreement .
We must create the right kind of environment where we have an understanding between the Israeli and Syrian national societies , because of the question of occupied Golan and whether the Syrian Red Crescent can operate there . "
Frustration
For the Swiss , who have spent months working towards the conference , and whose foreign minister has made several trips to the Middle East and Israel in the last few weeks , this last - minute hitch is causing great anxiety .
" It 's frustrating , " said one diplomat who asked to remain anonymous .
" We 're actually trying to get a solution for the Red Cross , but some seem to want us to try to solve the entire Middle East conflict . "
Nevertheless , most diplomats agree that there is , if not consensus , then at least a majority in favour of the red crystal .
And some do also see the agreement between the MDA and the Palestinian Red Crescent as a small but hopeful step towards better relations in the Middle East .
And , if the red crystal is approved , it could have big implications for the Red Cross movement .
Any country wishing a more neutral emblem will be able to adopt it and it is thought a number of countries with mixed religious populations may do so in the long term .
That would mean that the world 's best known humanitarian movement , whose original emblem was simply a reversal of the Swiss flag , would start to look rather different .

With both sides resting , jury instructions and deliberations ahead , David Shuster gives a recap to date of the testimony and how not only do all arrows point to the office of the Vice President but to the President himself .
Remember when George said that anyone found leaking classified information would be dealt with ?

" Listen , I know of nobody -- I do n't know of anybody in my administration who leaked classified information .
If somebody did leak classified information , I 'd like to know it , and we 'll take the appropriate action . "
Deal with yourself , George .
We 're waiting .
On a related note , the NY Times notes the new push / pull relationship of the blogosphere with the traditional media insofar as the coverage of the Libby Trial .
In addition to scooping the traditional media frequently , the blogosphere ( and by that , I mean the fabulous coverage by FireDogLake ) has been ahead of the curve in understanding the significance of the trial and the testimony given :
With no audio or video feed permitted , the Firedoglake " live blog " has offered the fullest , fastest public report available .
Many mainstream journalists use it to check on the trial .
[..]
For blogs , the Libby trial marks a courthouse coming of age .
It is the first federal case for which independent bloggers have been given official credentials along with reporters from the traditional news media , said Robert A. Cox , president of the Media Bloggers Association . [.. ]
" They 're putting in a lot more opinion and a lot more color than the traditional reporters , " said Mr. Cox , adding that the bloggers were challenging " the theory of objective journalism . " [..]
In the courthouse , the old - and new - media groups have mixed warily at times .
Mainstream reporters have shushed the bloggers when their sarcastic comments on the testimony drowned out the audio feed .
But traditional reporters have also called on the bloggers on occasion to check a quote or an obscure detail from the investigation .
Some bloggers at the trial have seen their skepticism about mainstream reporting confirmed .
" It 's shown me the degree to which journalists work together to define the story , " said Marcy Wheeler , author of a book on the case , " Anatomy of Deceit , " and the woman usually in the Firedoglake live - blogger seat .
Hardball transcripts below the fold
( CHRIS MATTHEWS ) Welcome back to Hardball .
Closing arguments in the trial of Scooter Libby are scheduled for next Tuesday .
At its core , this case revealed how the Bush administration sold the war with Iraq and tried to under - cut a critic of that sales job .
And the evidence in this case involved not just Vice President Cheney but also President Bush .
Hardball correspondent David Shuster has the report .
( DAVID SHUSTER )
While the trial against Scooter Libby has revealed that Vice President Cheney directed efforts to smear a high profile administration critic ...
The evidence from both sides shows President Bush took an interest in Joe Wilson as well and eventually played a role in trying to undermine him .
In May of 2003 , before Wilson went public , this article by Nicholas Kristof referred to an ambassador 's findings in Niger .
at the grand jury , Libby was asked about one of his notes .
Libby / Fitzgerald : Q. does that indicate the President was interested in the State of the Union and the Kristof article ?
A. Yes .
Q. And do you recall what the occasion was that , that you came to learn that the President was interested in the Kristof article ?
A. I , I do n't .
It could be something that somebody said to me that I -- it does n't mean that I observed it .
It may be something someone said to me and I wrote it down .
Q. Any recollection of discussing with the Vice President the interest of the President in the Kristof article ?
A. I do n't , I do n't have a recollection of it .
But two days after Joe Wilson went public , accusing the administration of twisting evidence and ignoring findings that Iraq was not seeking uranium from Africa , Vice President Cheney and President Bush took action .
Evidence left unchallenged by the defense shows the leaders declassified a secret National Intelligence Estimate , gave it to Libby , and authorized him to leak it to reporter Judy Miller as part of an effort to push back at Wilson .
Nobody else knew the NIE had , in effect , been declassified ...
Not CIA Director Tenet , not then National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice , not her deputy Stephen Hadley .
Libby / Fitzgerald : I had talked to Judith Miller about the NIE at the President 's , you know , at , at the President 's approval relayed to me through the Vice President , l and I did not tell Mr. Hadley at that time .
Q. And was there any reason why you did n't tell Mr. Hadley that you had told Ms. Miller about the NIE ?
A , I was sitting with the Vice President .
The Vice President knew it and chose not to tell Mr. Hadley and so I did n't change what he had done . "
And yet just two months later ...
President Bush , Sept. 30 , 2003 : " Listen , I know of nobody -- I do n't know of anybody in my administration who leaked classified information .
If somebody did leak classified information , I 'd like to know it , and we 'll take the appropriate action . "
Soon after that , even though Vice President Cheney knew that Scooter Libby -- at Cheney 's direction -- had spoken to reporters about the NIE and about Valerie Wilson 's CIA status just days before she was outed ...
Notes show Cheney told White House Press Secretary Scott McLellan to publicly clear Libby , just as McLellan had already cleared Karl Rove .
Scott McClellan , Oct. 7 , 2003 : " They 're good individuals , they 're important members of our White House team , and that 's why I spoke with them , so that I could come back to you and say that they were not involved . "
Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has argued the evidence is clear Rove and Libby were lying to McLellan .
The evidence at trial also shows the White House misled the public by blaming the CIA for the president 's false pre war State of the Union claims .
When the claims were retracted , documents reveal Vice President Cheney helped write the White House talking points .
Ari Fleischer July 14 , 2003 : " The broader statement about seeking uranium from Africa was vetted through the CIA .
Scott McClellan July 15 , 2003 : " I mean , if CIA had said , take it out , we would have taken it out . "
But evidence at the Libby trial shows the CIA director did urge White House officials to take it out ...
In an audio recording played in court , former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , during an interview with Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward , says CIA director George Tenet personally told the White House the claim was wrong and got it removed from another Bush speech before the State of the Union .
Armitage / Woodward : ( Woodward )
Oh really ?
It was taken out ?
( Armitage ) " Taken out .
George said , you can't do this . "
( Woodward ) How come it was n't out of the State of the Union then ? " ( Armitage )
Because I think it was overruled by the types down at the white house .
Condi does n't like being in the hot spot . "
The implication appears to be that Condoleezza Rice , who was responsible for voicing Tenet 's concerns to the president did n't like having to stand up to Vice President Cheney who was pushing the uranium claim .
When Joe Wilson spoke out 7 months later ...
His CIA wife was outed 8 days after that .
David Shuster : Prosecutors say Scooter Libby lied about those crucial 8 days in order to protect himself and possibly Vice President Cheney .
And as first reported by the on - line newspaper Salon , supporters of Libby confirm he was urged by friends to cut a deal with prosecutors and tell them about the vice president .
Libby refused .
Closing arguments in Libby 's case are set for Tuesday ...
A case revealing that the effort to undermine a Bush administration critic involved both Vice President Cheney and President Bush .
I'm David Shuster , for Hardball , in Washington .

株式市場とは、投資家と企業の化かしあいである。
企業は、儲かってない会社を儲かっているように見せて、投資家の金を集めようとする。投資家は、公開された資料に含まれる、そういう嘘やゴマカシを見抜き、本当に儲かっている企業を探し出す。
この化かしあいが、全く制限無しに行なわれたら騙す方に分がありすぎるので、市場がその化かしあいに一定の枠をはめる。何をどこまでごまかしていいかを「上場基準」というルールで定める。上場基準が厳しすぎれば企業に敬遠され、緩すぎれば投資家に逃げられるから、中間のちょうどいい所をさぐり、世の中の動きに合わせて細かく調整しながら運用していく。
ルールはあるけど本質的に化かしあいであるから、企業は抜け道を探し、形式的にはルールに違反してない範囲で、儲かっているように見せかける手段を探し続ける。抜け道を作る方が複雑なことをすると、その嘘を剥ぎとる方もノウハウが高度化し洗練されていく。
その結果、企業会計や投資という領域は非常に複雑なノウハウのかたまりとなる。そこに多くの優秀な人材が投入されて、膨大な知恵とエネルギーがつぎこまれている。
有望な経済領域を個人責任によって競争で探し出す、という市場の原点から見ると、この化かしあいは一種の過剰品質であり、破壊的イノベーションの余地が生じていると思う。
つまり、企業が、騙すことをやめてそのコストを本業に回すことができたら、それだけで競争優位になるのではないだろうか。
伝票を公開し、営業日報を公開し、議事録を公開し、企業活動の全てを公開する。社内のコミュニケーションに使用しているブログやチャットやSNSやIMも全部公開する。
オープンソースな会計、オープンソースな決算、オープンソースな企業活動である。
伝票を公開したら監査は不要になる。つまり、売上なり仕入れなりの合計が正当な数字であることは、内訳が公開されていれば誰でも確認できる。アナリストは不要になる。アナリストは(ルールの範囲内で)ごまかされた数字から正味の企業活動を復元する仕事であり、現状は、騙す方もプロだからそれをチェックする側にもプロが必要になる。もし、内訳つきで数字が公開されたら、復元するまでもなく出た数字をそのまま信じればいいだけなので、アナリストに頼らずとも誰にでもその企業の業績、実態を把握できるようになる。
もちろん、現代の企業活動は複雑だから、伝票が全部見えるから中身が全てわかるとは言えない。これは、Firefoxのソースが公開されているからと言って、Firefoxが100%安全であると保証できないのと同じである。
しかし 、Firefoxに意図的なトラップコードが含まれている確率は限りなくゼロに近い。リポジトリが世界中に公開されているのだから、見つかった時には、誰がいつやったことか一目瞭然でわかってしまう。
明細、あるいはソースを履歴つきで見せるというのはそういうことで、ごまかしの余地が無いとは言えないが、もしバレた時には犯人がほぼ確実にわかるようになっている。競争相手がいれば、そこが、公開された情報に含まれる問題点を専門的な目でチェックしていることを期待できる。
そして、こういう会社は、他の会社からは嫌われるだろう。この会社から何か買って、そこが売上伝票を公開したら、強制的にこちらの仕入れ伝票が部分的に公開されることになる。ここと取引することで、自分の側も同時に全てが公開されてしまう。
製品開発も全てオープンに進める必要がある。この会社が来年出す新製品について、どのような技術が採用され、どういう市場をターゲットとして、どのような画期的な機能があるのか、それが公開された議事録からまる見えになる。やはり、ここと協力して開発している企業は、自社の来年の計画がまる見えになってくる。
同じようなオープンソース的企業であるか、そうでなくてもかなり透明性が高い企業しかここと取引できない。
だから、こういう形で企業活動を行なうことは、非常に制約があることは間違いないが、全部公開して新製品を開発している会社には、ヴェイパーウエアはあり得ない。「現在ここまでできていて、来年にはこういうものができる」と言ったら、その新製品は間違いなく来年にはそのような形で登場するのだ。投資家から見て投資しやすいことも確かだろう。特に特別の情報源を持たない個人投資家にはありがたい。
不二家の信頼回復対策会議最終報告の信頼回復対策会議最終報告書(PDF)によると、不二家には直接的な健康被害につながるような衛生管理上の問題は無かったようである。
不二家の問題は、品質管理が行なわれていなかったことではなく、品質管理に明確な指針がなく、客観的な証拠が残るような体制が無かったことだ。
だから、内部文書が流出してそれを誇大に報道されたり、あやしげな元従業員の証言を元にマスコミから批判されたりした時に、それを否定する材料が無かった。
全てを公開している企業であれば、このような問題で株価が乱高下する心配はない。謀略に強いということは、流動性の高い現代のグローバル経済において非常な強みとなる。
情報源を持たずアナリストに払う金もない個人投資家はローエンドである。そのようなニーズは当初は、ニッチに見えるだろう。しかし、ローエンドを確実に押さえ着実に成長する企業は、いつか破壊的イノベーションによって世界を変える。
全てを公開することによって企業活動を本音方向へ大幅にシフトするイノベーション、すなわち「本音ベーション」によって、世界を変えてしまう企業が出現すると私は予想する。

Bite Size Why Predators Are the Size They Are
New research from scientists from the Zoological Society of London explains why some predators are big while others are small -- and why polar bears are the carnivore kings .
Story Highlights • Bomb found at a clinic where abortions are performed
• Device configured in a way " to cause serious bodily injury or death , " police said
• Device was safely detonated by police ; nearby buildings were evacuated
• No suspects identified , but clinic does have cameras
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) --
An explosive device " which could have caused substantial harm " was found Wednesday in the parking lot of an Austin , Texas , women 's clinic where abortions are performed , authorities said .
" It was configured in such a way as to cause serious bodily injury or death , " Austin Police Assistant Chief David Carter told reporters Thursday .
An employee reported the suspicious device at the Austin Women 's Health Center , and Austin police responded at about 2:15 p.m .
The employee also notified the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , as per clinic protocol , police said .
Southbound lanes of nearby Interstate 35 were closed as bomb technicians detonated the device , and the clinic , an insurance agency and an apartment building behind the clinic were evacuated .
" [ Officials ] came in banging on the doors , telling us to get out .
I got home from work early today and said , ' Are you serious ? ' and they starting taping off the area , " one resident told News 8 Austin .
After the detonation , " closer examination of the package revealed an unknown powdery substance in the device , " police said .
Field analysis showed the substance was an explosive powder , but not a biological hazard , authorities said .
Austin police spokesman Kevin Buchman said there are no reports thus far of anyone suspicious in the vicinity at the time the package was found , but said authorities were canvassing the area for potential witnesses .
The clinic does have cameras in its parking lot .
Asked whether that might aid police in their investigation , Carter said , " Time will tell . "
Carter said the device was in a " carry - all type bag " , but Austin police and the FBI would not provide more details on the device and its makeup .
The Joint Terrorism Task Force was investigating , Carter said .
Authorities were also making contact with other clinics in the city .

Florida Nudists To Use $ 2 Bills Exclusively
PASCO COUNTY , Fla . --
Nude tourists are ready to dig deep into their pockets to shed more light on how important they are to the Florida economy .
Resorts that cater to nudists are big business in Osceola and Pasco counties .
Now , the au natural tourists are stocking up on two dollar bills to prove how important they are to Florida 's bottom line .
"
We just want to show the merchants that , yes , we 're still here and stronger than ever , " said Chuck Foster , Caliente Resort .
The nudist resorts bring in more than 100,000 tourists a year .
Now they want to flex their economic muscles .
" I think they wanna show the economic impact they have on the local community , that they are here spending a lot of money and , you know , they buy their gas , they eat in restaurants , they buy their food and they want people to know that , " said Kathy Dunkley , Pasco County Chamber of Commerce .
The nudists will use only two - dollar bills for everything they buy .
"
Oh , we got tremendous feedback , absolutely incredible feedback .
They said , ` Wow , you people spent a lot of money . '
Yes , we did , " Foster said .
They hope the two - dollar gimmick will expose just how much money they bring into the Florida economy .
" They have money and they 're willing to spend it .
That 's the best customer there is .
They like to have a good time and good food , so I 'm excited , " said Harry Wright , Harry 's Bar - B - Que .
It is not the first time the nudists have launched a two - dollar bill campaign .
More than 25 years ago , they flooded local businesses with the unusual currency to demonstrate their buying power .
" We will take in a bunch of two - dollar bills .
You can count on it , " Wright said .
The nudist resorts have contacted local banks ahead of time and asked them to make sure they have a good supply of two - dollar bills on hand for their guests .

The Mystery of the Cocaine Mummies
In the 21st dynasty of the Pharaos , 3,000 years ago , there took place one night at a temple , the funeral of Henut Taui - the Lady of the Two lands .
Compared to the great rulers of Egypt , her burial was a modest affair .
But just like the Pharaos , she too was mummified , and her body placed in the depths of a desert tomb , in the belief it would give her immortality .
In an unexpected way , it has .
Her mummified body waited throughout recorded history - the Greeks and Romans , the Dark and Middle ages , the Renaissance and Napoleon , until in the early 19th century , her tomb was plundered .
The king of Bavaria bought the ornate sarcophagus with the mummy inside .
He gave it to a museum in Munich , where for another century , Henut Taui lay undisturbed .
Then four years ago a German scientist , Dr Svetla Balabanova , made a discovery which was to baffle Egyptologists , and call into question whole areas of science and archeology to chemistry and botany .
She discovered that the body of Henut Taui contained large quantities of cocaine and nicotine .
The surprise was not just that the ancient Egyptians had taken drugs , but that these drugs come from tobacco and coca , plants completly unknown outside the Americas , unheard of until Sir Walter Raleigh introduced smoking from the New World , or until cocaine was imported in the Victorian era .
It was seemingly impossible for the ancient Egyptians to get hold of these substances .
And so began the mystery - The mystery of the cocaine mummies .
It was in Munich , in 1992 , that researchers began a huge project to investigate the contents of mummies .
When as part of their studies , they wanted to test for drugs , it was no surprise that they turned to toxicologist Dr Svelta Balabanova for help .
As the inventor of groundbreaking new methods for the detection of drugs in hair and sweat , she was highly respected in her field .
Dr Balabanova took samples from the mummies , which she pulverised and dissolved to make a solution .
As she 'd done countless times before , she ran the samples through a system which uses antibodies to detect the presence of drugs an other substances .
Then as a backup the samples were put through the GCMS machine which can accurately identify substances by determining their molecular weight .
As the graph emerged with peaks showing that drugs were present , and as the printer spewed out the analysis of just which drugs , something seemed to have gone very wrong .
DR SVETLA BALABANOVA - Institute of Forensic Medicine , Ulm :
" The first positive results , of course , were a shock for me .
I had not expected to find nicotine and cocaine but that 's what happened .
I was absolutely sure it must be a mistake . "
NARRATOR :
Balabanova ran the tests again .
She sent fresh samples to three other labs .
But the results kept being confirmed .
The drugs were there .
So she went ahead and published a paper .
The reaction was a sharp reminder that science is a conservative world .
DR SVETLA BALABANOVA - Institute of Forensic Medicine , Ulm :
" I got a pile of letters that were almost threatening , insulting letters saying it was nonsense , that I was fantasising , that it was impossible , because it was proven that before Columbus these plants were not found anywhere in the world outside of the Americas . "
NARRATOR :
From toxicologists to anthropologists - everyone thought the same .
DR JOHN HENRY - Consultant Toxicologist , Guys Hospital , London :
" The first thing you think of is that this is just mad .
It 's wrong .
There 's contamination present .
Maybe there 's a fraud present of some kind .
You do n't think that cocaine can be present in an Egyptian mummy . "
NARRATOR :
Yet Balabanova herself had been worried about contamination .
First she checked all the lab equipment .
But being a forensic toxicologist , that was n't all she did .
Balabanova had learned her trade from working for the police , and had been trained in the methods they use for investigating a suspicious death .
She 'd been taught how vital it is when an autopsy is carried out to know wether the victim has consumed or been given any drugs or poisons .
And she had also been taught that a special forensic technique exists which can show that the deceased has consumed a drug and rule out contamination at the same time .
So , anxious to ensure that her tests on the mummies were beyond reproach , she used this very technique - it 's called the hair shaft test .
Drugs and other substances consumed by humans get into the hair protein , where they stay for months , or after death - forever .
Hair samples can be washed in alcohol and the washing solution itself then tested .
If the testing solution is clear , but the hair tests positive , then the drug must be inside the hair shaft , which means the person consumed it during their lifetime .
It 's considered proof against contamination before or after death .
DR JOHN HENRY - Consultant Toxicologist , Guys Hospital , London :
" The hair shaft test is accepted .
If you know that you 've taken your hair sample from this individual and the hair shaft is known to contain a drug , then it is proof positive that the person has taken that drug .
So it is accepted in law .
It 's put people into prison . "
NARRATOR :
The hair shaft test on a couple in Jersey [ Channel Is. ] , showed their two sons had drugged them before killing them .
And aside from the Newall case , the technique has been used in countless others over the last 25 years .
Since it 's also used for drugs tests on addicts , company employees and in sport , to suggest it could produce false results was for Balabanova unthinkable .
DR SVETLA BALABANOVA - Institute of Forensic Medicine , Ulm :
" There 's no way there can be a mistake in this test .
This method is widely accepted and has been used thousands of times .
If the results are not genuine , then the explanation must lie elswhere , and not in my tests , because I 'm 100 percent certain about the results . "
NARRATOR :
If the fault was not in the tests , what else could lie behind the impossibility of mummies containing drugs from coca and tobacco , from a continent not discovered until over 1,000 years after the end of the Egyptian civilisation ?
In search of an explanation , we went to one of the UK 's foremost authorities on mummies , a person who had spent years rummaging around in the bodies of ancient Egyptians , Rosalie David .
ROSALIE DAVID - Keeper of Egyptology , Manchester Museum :
" When I was informed that cocaine had been found in Egyptian mummies , I was absolutely astounded .
It seemed quite impossible that this should be the case . "
NARRATOR :
Sceptical of Balabanova 's results , Rosalie David decided to get some sampless from her own mummies and have them tested especially for ' Equinox ' .
ROSALIE DAVID - Keeper of Egyptology , Manchester Museum :
" What we shall do is to provide tissue samples and a hair sample from a number of mummies in the Manchester Museum collection .
I shall be very surprised to find they had cocaine in them . "
NARRATOR :
It would be a while before the results came back from the lab .
Rosalie David 's motive was not only to independently check Balabanova 's methods .
She also wanted to run the same tests but on different mummies .
For she had more than one idea about how Balabanova could have got a misleading result .
ROSALIE DAVID - Keeper of Egyptology , Manchester Museum :
" There were two ideas that sprang immediately to mind .
One was that possibly something in the tests could give a false result .
The second was that possibly the mummies that had been tested were not truly ancient Egyptian , that they could be some of these false , relativly modern mummies , and traces of cocaine could be in those individuals . "
NARRATOR :
What Rosalie David was referring to happened in Egypt in Victorian Times .
It was a gruesome operation to supply the antique dealers of Luxor .
When 19th century travellers went to Egypt in search of mummies and other valuables , the dealers might not have the genuine article available .
And so the crudely mummified body of a recently dead Egyptian might be procured instead .
For a shrivelled corpes would greatly increase the value of a genuine but empty sarcophagus .
Sometimes collectors would buy only limbs or other mummified spare parts .
These are doubly suspect for the trade in fake mummies , especially separate heads and limbs , has an even older origin .
Eating the flesh of mummies was a common 16th century practice in Europe .
People believed that mummies contained a black tar called bitumen , and so thought powder made from the ground up bodies would cure various illnesses .
This is the very origin of the word mummy , from the Persian for bitumen , mummia , and although it made people sick a roaring trade in powdered mummia grew , supplied from body parts and tissue shipped in bulk from Egypt .
The temptation to resort to fakes was high .
ROSALIE DAVID - Keeper of Egyptology , Manchester Museum :
" Very soon , the demand outstripped the supply and certainly in the 16th century a French physician undertook a study of this trade .
And he found that in fact they were burying bodies of convicted criminals in the sand .
They were producing mummies , and these then became a source for the medicinal ingredient . "
NARRATOR :
Could it be that the mummies Balabanova tested were fakes ?
Carbon dating on mummies often produces incorrect results , so archaeologists often rely on the provenance - knowing what tomb and excavation the mummy comes from and on examination of the mummification techniques .
So the only way for Rosalie David to check out here theory about fakes was to travel to Munich to see for herself the seven mummies that were the cause of all the fuss .
The Munich mummies as they are known , belong to the city 's Egyptian Museum , which is housed in the old palace of King Ludwig I of Bavaria , who started the collection .
Inside the museum , Rosalie David found the sarcophagus of Henut Taui - the Lady of the Two Lands .
She discovered from the museum catalogue that the coffin was bought by King Ludwig from an English traveller called Dodwell in 1845 .
There was no record of an exact excavation , but Henut Taui was said to have come from a tomb reserved for the priests and priestesses of the god Amun in Thebes .
But while being shown the other coffins Rosalie David discovered that apart from Henut Taui , most of the Munich mummies are of unknown origin , and some of the tested mummies turned out to be only detatched heads .
According to the museum , research had revealed inscriptions , amulets and complex embalming methods , which the museum claimed proved the mummies were ancient .
DR ALFRED GRIMM - Curator , The Egyptian Museum , Munich :
" The investigation shows clearly that the Munich mummies are real Egyptian mummies , no fakes , no modern mummies .
They come from ancient Egypt . "
NARRATOR :
The obvious way to prove this was to show the mummies to Rosalie David , but all the museum would let her see were empty sarcophogi .
DR ALFRED GRIMM - Curator , The Egyptian Museum , Munich :
" On grounds of religious respect we do n't show these mummies here in our galleries .
That 's one point .
The other is we do n't allow to film the mummies and to show them on TV . "
NARRATOR :
It was n't always so , for the mummies had already been shown on television .
But this German film [ film showing mummified bodies without wrappings ] announcing Balabanova 's results has caused quite a fuss .
And so now , even though giving access might defeat the accusation of harbouring bogus mummies , it seemed that the museum wanted nothing more to do with the research they politely pointed out was far from respectable .
DR ALFRED GRIMM - Curator , The Egyptian Museum , Munich :
" It 's not absolutely proven and I think it 's not absolutely scientifically correct . "
NARRATOR :
Rosalie had to make do with research papers and books from the museum .
Were the Munich mummies fakes ?
Despite her initial suspicions she decided that on balance , they probably were the real thing .
ROSALIE DAVID - Keeper of Egyptology , Manchester Museum :
" From the documentation and the research which has been carried out on the Munich mummies it seems evident that they are probably genuine because they have packages of viscera inside , some with wax images of the gods on them and also the state of mummification itself is very good .
I would say that the detatched heads we can't comment on , but the complete bodies probably are genuine . "
NARRATOR :
And if that was n't enough , it turned out that the results from the Munich mummies were not the only evidence from the dead .
The anthropologists who originally ordered the tests did n't continue the project .
But Balabanova , alongside her normal research into the metabolism of drugs started requesting samples of other ancient human remains from universities .
And it was then that she got more results from Egypt .
She tested tissue from 134 naturally preserved bodies from an excavated cemetery in the Sudan , once part of the Egyptian empire .
Although from a later period , the bodies were still many centuries before Columbus discovered the Americas .
About a third of them tested positive for nicotine and cocaine .
Balabanova was mystified by the presence of cocaine in Africa but thought she might have a way of explaining the nicotine .
As well as Egypt and the Sudan , she tested bodies from China , Germany and Austria , spanning a period from 3700 BC to 1100 AD .
A percentage of bodies from all these other regions also contained nicotine .
[ Graph showing presence of nicotine : Percentage of bodies with positive result - Egypt:89 % Sudan:90 % China : 62.5 % Germany : 34 % Austria 100 % ] DR SVETLA BALABANOVA - Institute of Forensic Medicine , Ulm :
" I continued to work on it because I wanted to be sure of my results , and after 3000 samples I , was absolutely certain that the tobacco plant was known in Europe and Africa long before Columbus . "
NARRATOR :
Far from being solved , the mytery that began in Egypt was spreading .
Balabanova was suggesting that an unknown type of tobacco had grown in Europe , Africa and Asia thousands of years ago .
But every schoolchild knows that tobacco was discovered in the New World .
She was asking for a substantial slice of botany and history to be completely rewritten .
Would anyone back her up ?
Dr Balabonova had told us that we might find the secret of the mysterious presence of nicotine and cocaine in Egyptan mummies in the ancient plants of Africa .
Perhaps there had been drug plants which the Egyptians had used but had vanished along with their civilisation .
This led to a much more basic question .
Were the Egyptians , the great Pharaos and pyramid builders really users and abusers of drugs ?
The clues can be found hidden in the walls of the grand temple of Karnak .
The entire building is covered depictions of the lotus flower from the tops of the vast columns to the pictograms on the walls .
Until recently , Egyptologists took this most commonplace Egyptian symbol to have only a religious meaning .
But according to some the true significance of the lotus has been overlooked .
ROSALIE DAVID - Keeper of Egyptology , Manchester Museum :
" The lotus was a very powerful narcotic which was used in ancient Egypt and presumably , was widespread in this use , because we see many scenes of idividuals holding a cup and dropping a lotus flower into the cup which contained wine , and this would be a way of releasing the narcotic .
" The ancient Egyptians certainly used drugs .
As well as lotus they had mandrake and cannabis , and there is a strong suggestion the also used opium .
" So although it very surprising to find cocaine in mummies , the other elements were certainly in use . "
NARRATOR :
So the Pharaos clearly indulged in drugs .
Hashish - which Balabanova also found in the mummies - is an Egyptian tradition which has survived for thousands of years , although nowadays , in public , pipes tend to be filled with nothing more than tobacco .
By contrast , the narcotic blue lotus flower , once so essential at parties , is now on the verge of extinction .
And if it could disappear , why not other drug plants ?
We decided to persue Balabanova 's unusual theory that an ancient species of tobacco might once have grown in the Old World .
Small amounts of nicotine are present in a wide variety of plants and foods , but the high concentrations sought by smokers can only be found in tobacco .
[ Graph showing quantities of nicotine : Concentrations in bone samples - Modern Smoker in nanograms / gram : c40ng China : c55ng Germany : c65ng Sudan : c45ng Egyptian Mummies : Off screen !]
The idea of a lost species of tobacco came to Balabanova because the concentrations in the bodies from Asia and Europe were similar to modern day smokers .
But one thing had puzzled her .
At 35 times the dose for smokers , the amounts of nicotine she had found in Egyptian mummies were potentially lethal .
But first , Balabanova was baffled , but then she had a thought .
The high doses of nicotine in Egyptian bodies could be explained if the tobacco - as well as being consumed - had also been used in mummification .
Over their 3000 year history the Egyptian preists kept the recipe of spices and herbs used to preerve the thousands of people and millions of animals they mummified a closely guarded secret .
The high levels of nicotine in tobacco can kill bacteria .
Could it have been one of their secrets ?
Balabanova looked through old literature about the bodies of the great Pharaos and queens themselves .
No longer under the care of the preists the fragile royal mummies are now kept in strict atmospheric conditions in the Cairo museum .
But Balabanova discovered a story from the days when scientists could still tamper with them - a story that had almost been forgotten .
Ramses II died in 1213BC , a few hundered years before Henut Taui .
When he was mummified , every possible skill and every rare ingredient was used by the embalmers to try to preserve his body for eternity .
For where Henut Tuai was only a preistess , Ramses was arguably the mightiest of all the Pharaos .
His imposing image adorns most of Egypts famous sites for he presided over the Golden Age of it's civilisation , and as a skilled military commander , won the conquests that made it into a powerful empire .
What interested Balabanova was what happened to Ramses 3000 years later , when he went on his final royal visit .
" Les chercheurs francais ont realise de nouvelles descouvertes en etudient la momie du pharon Ramses II . "
[ Excerpt from TV France ]
On september 26th , 1976 , amid all the pomp and circumstance - due a visiting head of state - French TV cameras recorded the arrival of the mummy of Ramses II at an airport in Paris .
An exhibition about him at the museum of mankind was planned .
But the body was found to be badly deteriorated , so a battery of scientist set about trying to repair this damage .
The bandages wrapped around the mummy needed replacing , so botanists were given pieces of the fabric to analyse what it was made of .
One found some plant fragments in her piece , and took a closer look .
Emerging on the slide , according to her experience , were the unmistakable features - the tiny crystals and filaments - of a plant that could n't possibly be there .
DR MICHELLE LESCOT - Natural History Museum , Paris :
" I prepared the slides , put them under the microscope and what did I see ?
Tobacco .
I said to myself , that 's just not possible - I must be dreaming .
The Egyptians did n't have tobacco .
It was brought from South America at the time of Christopher Columbus .
I looked again , and I tried to get a better view and I thought , well , it 's only a first analysis .
I worked feverishly and I forgot to have lunch that day .
But I kept getting the same result . "
NARRATOR :
Amid a storm of publicity .
people alleged - just as they did with Balabanova 's results - that this must be a case of contamination .
It 's a view shared today by Ramses ' keeper at the Cairo museum , who suspects there is a straightforward explanation .
PROF NASRI ISKANDER - Chief Curator , Cairo Museum :
" According to my knowledge and experience , most of the archeologists and scientists , who worked on these fields , smoked pipes .
And I myself have been smoking pipes for more than 25 years .
Then maybe a piece of the tobacco dropped by haphazard or just anyway and to tell this is right or wrong we have to be more careful " NARRATOR :
To combat the allegations of careless smoking Michelle Lescot extracted new samples from deep inside the body of Ramses ' mummy and took care to document it with photographs .
And as far as she was concerned , these samples again gave the same result - tobacco .
So was Lecot 's discovery the proof Balabanova needed for an ancient species of tobacco ?
For a second opinion , we went to the herbarium at the Natural History Museum to find an expert on tobacco who had seen Lescot 's published work .
She argued that Lescot 's evidence would only identify the family from which tobacco comes , and not the specific plant .
DR SANDY KNAPP - Natural History Museum , London :
" I think that they had a certain amount of evidence , and they took the evidence one step farther than the evidence really allowed them .
Sometimes you can only go so far down the road towards telling what something is , and then you come against a wall an you can't go any farther , otherwise you start to make something up . "
NARRATOR :
Sandy Knapp thought the plant from Ramses was more likely to be another member of the tobacco family , which is known to have existed in ancient Egypt , such as henbane , mandrake or belladonna .
DR SANDY KNAPP - Natural History Museum , London :
" I think it is very unlikely that tobacco has an alternative history , because , I think we would 've heard about it .
There 'd be some use of it present in either literature , temple carvings , somewhere there would 've been evidence to point and say ' Ah , that 's tobacco ' , but there 's nothing . "
DR MICHELLE LESCOT - Natural History Museum , Paris :
" I 'ts true that the official theory is tobacco originates in South America .
It 's also true that there are species in Australasia and the Pacific Islands .
There could have been other varieties , ancient varities that once existed in Asia .
Why not Africa ?
Varieties that have now disappeared so it's not sacrilege to challenge the official theory . "
NARRATOR :
The jury was still out on the vanished species of tobacco though Michelle Lescot was convinced that her identification had been correct .
But she could n't help with the cocaine , for it seemed not even one botanist believed in a disappearing coca plant .
DR SANDY KNAPP - Natural History Museum , London :
" Finding cocaine in these Egyptian mummies - botanically speaking - is almost impossible .
I mean , there is always a chance that there might be some sort of plant there , but I think there is some sort of mistake .
There is something wrong there .
I can't explain it from a plant point of view at all . "
NARRATOR :
For thousands of years people in the Andes have been chewing coca leaves , to get out the cocaine with it 's stimulant , anaesthetic and euphoric properties .
There are actually species of the coca family which grow in Africa , but only the South American species has ever been shown to contain the drug .
Since cocaine is not in any other plants , Balabanova was completely mystified , but she thought she might have just one possible idea .
DR SVETLA BALABANOVA - Institute of Forensic Medicine , Ulm :
" The cocaine of course remains an open question .
It 's a mystery - it 's completely unclear how cocaine could get into Africa .
On the other hand , we know there were trade relationships long before Columbus , and it 's conceivable that the coca plant had been imported into Egypt even then . "
NARRATOR :
An ancient Egyptian drug trade stretching all the way across the Atlantic Ocean ?
This was an idea so far - fetched it could only be considered once all the others had been eliminated , the idea that the Egyptians had been able to obtain imports from a place thousands of miles away from a continent supposedly not discovered until thousands of years later .
Was it possible that coca - a plant from South America had been finding it's way to Egypt 3,000 years ago ?
If the cocaine found in mummies could not be explained by contamination , or fake mummies or by Egyptian plants containing it , there appeared to be only one remaining possibility ...
An international drug trade who 's links extended all the way to the Americas .
To obtain incense , myrrh and other valuable plants used in religious ceremonies and herbal medicines , it 's true , the Egyptians were prepared to go to great lengths .
Even if traders , like today , made all sorts of exotic claims for the source of their products , there is , nevertheless , clear evidence of ancient contats as far east as Syria and Iraq .
The extended north into Cyprus , south into Sudan and Somalia and west into Lybia , but America ?
To the majority of archeologists , the idea is hardly worth talking about .
PROF JOHN BAINES - Egyptologist , Oxford University :
" The idea that the Egyptians were travelling to America is , overall , absurd .
I do n't know of anyone who is professionally employed as an Egyptologist , anthropologist or archeaologist who seriously believes in any of these possibilities , and I also do n't know anyone who spends time doing research into these areas because they 're perceived to be areas with any real meaning for the subjects . "
NARRATOR :
But on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean , where the moving current of the Gulf Stream arrives in Mexico directly from the west coast of Africa , there is a professionally - employed anthropologist who does seriously beleive in such possibilities .
PROF ALICE KEHOE - Anthropologist , Marquette University :
" I think there is good evidence that there was both trans- atlantic and trans - pacific travel before Columbus .
When we try to talk about trans - oceanic contact , people that are standard archeologists get very , um , skittish , and they want to change the subject or move away .
They suddenly see a friend across the room - they do n't want to pursue the subject at all .
They seem to feel that it 's some kind of contagious disease they do n't want to touch , or it will bring disaster to them . "
NARRATOR :
Why was the mere contemplation of voyages before Columbus or the Viking crossings to America , thought to be some sort of curse ?
It was in 1910 that some early antropologists began to theorise that the stepped pyramids in Mexico might not have been the invention of the American Indians .
Could the technology have come from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean , from Egypt , where there were also stepped pyramids ?
After spotting other trans- atlantic similarities , anthropologists began to argue that all civilisation was ivented in Egypt and later handed down to what they regarded as primitive societies .
The implication that Old World culture was superior was thought acceptable at that time .
But the arrival of modern dating techniques showed that the similarities were far more likely to be independant developements .
For example , the Egyptians abandoned pyramids with steps in favour of smooth ones 2,000 years before the first stepped pyramids occur in the Americas .
What 's more , the suggestion that American Indians could n't build their own civilisations became highly unpopular .
Despite a breif revival in the 1970's when anthtropologist Thor Heyerdahl crossed the Atlantic in a primitive reed boat , research into ancient contact with America was frowned on , even if connected with theories of cultural superiority .
But the idea that the ability of the ancients to cross the oceans might have been underestimated continues to be quietly whispered about .
Over the years evidence has grown which suggests it might be time to look again at such voyages .
To imagine that the Egyptians , who apparently only sailed up and down the Nile or into the Red Sea , might get as far as the Americas perhaps sounds fantastical .
But in science , what is one day thought absurd , can next day become accepted as fact .
[ Picture of a Norse settlement in Newfoundland ]
One senior academic thinks it 's important to remember that before the discovery of this Norse settlement in Newfoundland in 1965 theories about Viking voyages to America were dismissed as nonsense .
PROF MARTIN BERNAL - Historian , Cornell University :
" What we 've seen is a shift from the idea of Viking landings in America being seen as completely fantastic or partisan , to being accepted by every scholar in the field . "
NARRATOR : The fact that evidence of the Viking crossings was hidden has encouraged Martin Bernal to contemplate even earlier voyages that are likewise dismissed as impossible .
PROF MARTIN BERNAL - Historian , Cornell University :
" I have no reason to doubt that there were others - but what they were , and how much influence they had on American society is open to question .
But that trans - oceanic voyages are possible - or were possible - seems to me to be overwhelmingly likely . "
NARRATOR :
A likelihood Bernal believes is reinforced by some Roman jars found in 1975 in a place called the Bay of Jars in Brazil .
It 's been suggessted that a Roman galley could be buried under the sea .
But he interpretation of such finds is heavily disputed .
PROF JOHN BAINES - Egyptologist , Oxford University :
" They would fit the possibility that there was the odd ship that by mistake ended up on the other side of the Atlantic .
What they 're not going to fit is the idea of sustained two way contact , because there is a huge amount of historical evidence from the Roman world , but there is nothing to suggesst such contact existed . "
PROF MARTIN BERNAL - Historian , Cornell University :
" They can't have been planted because the bay was known as the Bay of Jars since the 18th century , so that Roman jars had been turning up , and this links up with indirect Roman documentary evidence of contact . "
NARRATOR :
The Bay of Jars is only one of several oddities claimed as evidence of trans-atlantic contacts .
Also in Brazil , there is an inscription said to be in an ancient Mediterranean language .
Meanwhile , in Mexico , there are 3,000 year old figurines with beards , a feature unknown in native Americans plus colossal statues that are said to look African , and an apparent picture of a pineapple - an American fruit - has been found in Pompeii .
But if tobacco from Mexico or coca from the Andes was carried across an ocean , it apparently need not have been the Atlantic .
According to Alice Kehoe , a number of other American plants mysteriously turn up outside the " sealed " continent .
But they are found on the other side of the Pacific .
PROF ALICE KEHOE - Anthropologist , Marquette University :
" The one that absolutely proves trans - pacific vaoyaging is the sweet potato .
There are also discoveries of peanuts more than 2,000 years ago in western China .
There is a temple is southern India that has sculptures of goddesses holding what looks like ears of maize or corn . "
NARRATOR :
And if American maize might have got as far as India , why could n't tobacco or coca have reached Egypt ?
They could have come across the Pacific to China or Asia and then overland to Africa .
The Egyptians need not have travelled to America at all , or known where the plants had originated , but could have got them indirectly , through a network of world trade .
But any ancient trade route that includes America is unacceptable in archeology .
PROF JOHN BAINES - Egyptologist , Oxford University :
" I do n't think it is at all likely that there was an ancient trade network that included America .
The essential problem with any such idea is that there are no artefacts to back it up that have been found either in Europe or in America .
And I know that people produce examples of possible things , but they 're really very implausible . "
NARRATOR :
Yet discovery of minute strands of silk found in the hair of a mummy from Luxor could suggest the trade stretching from Egypt to the Pacific .
For silk at this time was only known to come from China .
Martin Bernal argues that it would be a pity to replace earlier cultural arrogance with an arrogant belief in progrss .
PROF MARTIN BERNAL - Historian , Cornell University :
" We 're getting more and more evidence of world trade at an earlier stage .
You have the Chinese silk definitely arriving in Egypt by 1000 BC .
I think modern scholars have a tendency to believe rigidly in progress and the idea that you could only have a worldwide trading network from the 18th century onwards , is our temporal arrogance - that it 's only modern people that can do these things . "
NARRATOR :
The evidence for ancient trade with America is limited , and most of it is disputed , but it can't be completely ruled out as explaining the apparent impossibility of Balabanova 's results , results that at first seemed so absurd many thought they would be explained away by a simple story of a botch - up in a lab , results that still without firm explanation continue to crop up in unexpected places .
For in Manchester , the mummies under the care of Rosalie David , the Egyptologist once so sure that Balabanova had made a mistake , produced some odd results of their own .
ROSALIE DAVID - Keeper of Egyptology , Manchester Museum :
" We 've received results back from the tests on our mummy tissue samples and two of the samples and the one hair sample both have evidence of nicotine in them .
I 'm really very surprised at this . "
DR SVETLA BALABANOVA - Institute of Forensic Medicine , Ulm :
" The results of the tests on the Manchester mummies have made me very happy after all these years of being accuesed of false results and contaminated results , so I was delighted to hear nicotine had been found in these mummies , and very , very happy to have this enormous confirmation of my work . "
NARRATOR :
The tale of Henut Taui shows that in science facts can be rejected if they do n't fit with our beleifs while what is believed proven , may actually be uncertain .
Little wonder then , that a story that began with one scientist , a few mummies and some routine tests , in no time at all could upset whole areas of knowledge we thought we could take for granted .

Water once flowed through fractures in layered rocks
Enlarge Image
Shots of the deep valley Candor Chasma show light coloured areas of rock where water could have flowed .
These " haloes " surround fractures in the martian bedrock which provide a promising target in the search for evidence of past life on the planet .
The images , published in the journal Science , were taken by a camera aboard Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
" It lends support to the idea that a substantial body of groundwater existed on Mars in the past and may still persist to the present day , " said Professor Stephen Clifford of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston , Texas .
" The fact that there is such persuasive evidence of joints and fractures in the crust also suggests that this groundwater had the ability to flow enormous distances . "
Huge rift
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRise ) camera started its surveys in November 2006 , eight months after Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) entered orbit around the Red Planet .
It is best known for capturing stunning images of Nasa 's robot explorers Spirit and Opportunity as they surveyed the planet from the ground .
Clay - like minerals are found in the Red Planet 's Mawrth Vallis region

The newly analysed images were taken last year .
They show a snapshot of conditions in Candor Chasma , an area of the great Martian rift valley Valles Marineris .
This deep gash , the length of the United States , is up to seven times deeper than the Grand Canyon in places .
The images show a hilly landscape composed of alternating bands of light and dark coloured rock , suggesting the layers were deposited by regular cycles of water , wind or volcanic activity .
MARS RECONNAISSANCE
ORBITER Reached Mars in March 2006
Two - year primary mission HiRise images are the clearest pictures of Mars Two detectors on the camera have developed problems
Writing in Science , the University of Arizona team said that similar features on Earth were " a clear indication of chemical interactions between fluids circulating within the fracture and the host rock " .
Likely fluids include water , liquid carbon dioxide or a combination of the two , and may have flowed up from deep underground reservoirs .
Protected habitats
Previously , Europe 's Mars Express mission had detected the signature of minerals altered by water in the Candor Chasma area .
The washed - out features , which have been " cemented " by minerals contained in the fluids , now stand proud from the valley walls .
They have been exposed by millions of years of erosion .
However , the fact that they were once underground has important implications for their ability to support life .
" The overlying areas of rock would have acted as a buffer against any harsh environmental conditions on Mars at that time , " said Dr Chris Okubu of the University of Arizon and one of the authors on the paper .
" These areas would be nice protected areas for any biological processes to occur . "
Erosion has uncovered rocks that were altered by the action of fluids

Last year , Nasa 's Mars Global Surveyor ( MGS ) spacecraft spotted gullies and trenches thought to have been recently carved by outpourings of water or liquid carbon dioxide .
Other features , including dried - up lake beds , springs and river valleys , lend further weight to the theory that the planet was once awash with water and could therefore have supported life .
Nasa is examining all of these sites as possible targets for future ground - based robotic missions .
However , the space agency says that if it has a chance of finding evidence of life on the planet , it must broaden its search .
" Following the water is a central aspect of exploration but the habitability issue also requires addressing the source of energy for life , " said Dr David des Marais of the Nasa Ames Research Center .
Possible future targets include areas of the planet where the building blocks of life , such as carbon , can be found .
" We not only need to follow the water but we also need to follow the energy , " said Dr des Marais .
The MRO findings were presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) annual meeting in San Francisco , US .
On March 21 , 2000 , Jive Records released No Strings Attached , the much - anticipated second album from NSync .
The album debuted strong .
It sold 1.1 million copies its first day and 2.4 million in the first week , making it the fastest - selling album ever .
It went on to top the charts for eight weeks , moving 10 million copies by the end of the year .
The music industry had cracked the commercial code .
With NSync , a pop-idol boy band fronted by the charismatic Justin Timberlake , Jive had perfected the elusive formula for making a hit .
In retrospect it was so obvious :
What worked for the Monkees could now be replicated on an industrial scale .
It was all about looks and scripted personalities .
The music itself , which was outsourced to a small army of professionals ( there are 60 people credited with creating No Strings Attached ) , hardly mattered .
Labels were on a roll .
Between 1990 and 2000 , album sales had doubled , the fastest growth rate in the history of the industry .
Half of the top - grossing 100 albums ever were sold during that decade .
But even as NSync was celebrating its huge launch , the ground was shifting .
Total music sales fell during 2000 , for only the second time in a decade .
Over the next few years , even after the economy recovered , the music industry continued to suffer .
Something fundamental had changed .
Sales fell 2.5 percent in 2001 , 6.8 percent in 2002 , and just kept dropping .
By the end of 2005 ( down another 8.3 percent ) , album sales in the US had declined 20 percent from their 1999 peak .
Twenty - one of the all - time top 100 albums were released in the five - year period between 1996 and 2000 .
The next five years produced only two – Norah Jones ’ Come Away With Me and OutKast ’s Speakerboxxx / The Love Below – ranking 79 and 91 , respectively .
It ’s altogether possible that NSync ’s first - week record may never be broken .
The band could go down in history not just for launching Timberlake but also for marking the peak of the hit bubble – the last bit of manufactured pop to use the 20th century ’s fine - tuned marketing machine to its fullest before the gears were stripped and the wheels fell off .
Music itself has n’t gone out of favor – just the opposite .
There has never been a better time to be an artist or a fan , and there has never been more music made or listened to .
But the traditional model of marketing and selling music no longer works .
The big players in the distribution system – major record labels , retail giants – depend on huge , platinum hits .
These days , though , there are not nearly enough of those to support the industry in the style to which it has become accustomed .
We are witnessing the end of an era .
What caused a generation of the industry ’s best customers – fans in their teens and twenties – to abandon the record store ?
The labels cried piracy : Napster and other online file - sharing networks , along with CD burning and trading , had given rise to an underground economy of stolen music .
Of course , there ’s something to that .
Despite countless record - industry lawsuits , traffic on the peer - to - peer file - trading networks has continued to grow , and about 10 million users now share music files each day .
But technology did n’t just allow fans to sidestep the cash register .
It also offered massive , unprecedented choice in terms of what they could hear .
The average file - trading network has more songs than any music store – by a factor of more than 100 .
Music fans had the opportunity for limitless choice , and they took it .
Today , listeners have not only stopped buying as many CDs , they ’re also losing their taste for the blockbuster hits that used to bring throngs into record stores on release day .
If they have to choose between a packaged act and something new , more and more people are opting for exploration .
Technology also gave consumers a new way to buy music .
Rather than having to purchase an entire album to get a couple of good tracks , they can buy songs à la carte for 99 cents each .
The online music industry is primarily a singles business , which depresses album sales further .
Meanwhile , the music marketing machine has lost its power .
When consumers were buying mainly from record stores , prominent in - store displays could drive tremendous demand , which is why the labels paid so much for them .
But now most of the largest record store chains , from Tower Records to Sam Goody , are either in bankruptcy or emerging from it with greatly diminished clout .
MTV does n’t play much music anymore , and money - losing Spin magazine was just , well , spun off for a fire - sale sum .
When it comes to lost marketing power , nothing compares to the decline of rock radio .
In 1993 , Americans spent an average of 23 hours and 15 minutes per week tuned to a local station .
As of summer 2005 , that figure had dropped to 19 hours and 15 minutes .
Time spent listening to the radio is now at a 12 - year low , and rock music is among the formats suffering the most .
Since 1998 , the rock radio audience has dropped 26 percent .
What ’s killing rock radio ?
A perfect storm of competition .
Start with the 1996 Telecommunications
Act , which added more than 700 FM stations to the dial .
This fragmented the market and depressed the economics of the incumbents .
At the same time , the limits of ownership in each market were relaxed , which led to a nationwide rollup by Clear Channel and Infinity , whose operating efficiencies included bringing cookie - cutter playlists to once - distinctive local stations .
Then came the cell phone , which gave people something else to do during their commutes .
And finally , the iPod , the ultimate personal radio .
With 10,000 of your favorite songs on tap , who needs FM ?
Practically every other sector of mass media and entertainment has witnessed a similar shift away from hits .
Last year the Hollywood box office take fell 6 percent , continuing a decline in attendance per capita that started in 2001 .
The average top 25 blockbusters in any given year so far this decade have accounted for 5 percent less of the total box office gross than in the 1990s , even as they ’ve cost 57 percent more to make .
Network TV ratings continue to fall as viewers scatter to cable channels ; since 1985 , the networks ’ share of the TV audience has dropped from three - quarters to less than half .
Ratings of the top TV shows have fallen dramatically since the 1960s .
Today ’s top-rated show , American Idol , is watched by just 18 percent of households .
During the ’70s , American Idol would n’t even have made it to the top 10 with that kind of market share .
Collectively , the hundreds of cable channels have now surpassed the networks in total viewership .
No single one dominates .
Even television mega-events have lost their allure .
In 2005 , the World Series had its worst TV ratings of all time , 30 percent lower than the previous year .
Ratings for the NBA playoffs last year reached record lows as well , down 43 percent from 2004 .
The ratings for the Grammy Awards in 2006 were down 31 percent from two years ago .
And the Winter Olympics this year had their lowest ratings in 38 years , down 36 percent from the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City .
The trend holds for other media .
Just 52 percent of Americans read a daily newspaper , compared with 81 percent four decades ago .
Magazine newsstand sales are at their lowest level since 1970 .
And the number of weeks the average best - selling novel remains at the top of the list has fallen by half over the past decade .
Before you shed too many tears for the declining hit , remember that the era of the blockbuster was an anomaly .
Before the Industrial Revolution , culture was mostly local – niches were geographic .
The economy was agrarian , which distributed populations as broadly as the land .
Distance divided people , giving rise to such diversity as regional accents and folk music , and the lack of rapid transportation and communications limited the mixing of cultures and the propagation of ideas and trends .
Influences varied from town to town , because the vehicles for carrying common culture were so limited .
There was a reason the church was the main cultural unifier in Western Europe :
It had the best distribution infrastructure and , thanks to Gutenberg ’s press , the most mass - produced item ( the Bible ) .
But in the early 19th century , modern industry and the growth of the railroad system led to a wave of urbanization and the rise of Europe ’s great cities .
These new hives of commerce and hubs of transportation mixed people like never before , creating a powerful engine of new culture .
All it needed was mass media to give it flight .
In the mid- to late 19th century , several technologies emerged to do just that .
First commercial printing technology improved and went mainstream .
Then the new “ wet plate ” technique made photography popular .
Finally , in 1877 , Edison invented the phonograph .
These developments led to the first great wave of pop culture , carried by such media as newspapers and magazines , novels , printed sheet music , records , and children ’s books .
Along with news , newspapers spread word of the latest fashions from the urban style centers of New York , London , and Paris .
Then , at the end of the 19th century , the moving picture gave the stars of stage a way to play many towns simultaneously and reach a much wider audience .
Such potent carriers of culture had the effect of linking people across time and space , effectively synchronizing society .
For the first time , it was a safe bet that not only did your neighbors read the same news you read in the morning and know the same music and movies , people across the country did too .
We are a gregarious species , highly influenced by what others do .
And film was a medium that could not only show us what other people were doing but could endow it with such an intoxicating glamour that it was hard to resist .
It was the dawn of the celebrity age .
The arrival of broadcast media – first radio , then TV – homogenized our adulation even more .
The power of electromagnetic waves is that they spread in all directions essentially for free , a trait that made them as mind - blowing when they were introduced as the Internet would be some 60 years later .
Broadcast emerged as the best vehicle for stardom ever .
From 1935 through the 1950s , the Golden Age of Radio led to the rise of national broadcast celebrities like Edward R. Murrow .
Then television took over .
By 1953 , an astounding 72 percent of TV households watched I Love Lucy on Monday night .
This marked the peak of the so - called water - cooler effect , the buzz in the office around a shared cultural event .
In the 1950s and 1960s , nearly everyone you worked with had seen Walter Cronkite read the news the previous night , and then tuned in to whatever top program followed : The Beverly Hillbillies , Gunsmoke , The Andy Griffith Show .
Throughout the ’70s , ’80s , and ’90s , even as more channels arrived , television continued to be the great American unifier .
Nearly every year , TV advertising set a new record as companies paid more and more for prime time .
And why not ?
Prime - time TV defined the mainstream .
Then came the great unraveling .
A new medium arose , one even more powerful than broadcast , and its distribution economics favored infinite niches , not one - size - fits - all fare .
The Internet ’s peer - to - peer architecture is optimized for a symmetrical traffic load , with as many senders as receivers and data transmissions spread out over geography and time .
In other words , it ’s the opposite of broadcast .
It will take decades for our entertainment industries to internalize the lessons of this shift .
If your goal is to make a hit movie – but not necessarily a good movie – you must follow the Hollywood rules .
Do pay as much as you can for the biggest - name star you can lure to the project .
Do n’t try to be “ too smart . ”
Do have a happy ending .
Do n’t kill off the star .
If it ’s an action movie ( and , all things being equal , it probably should be an action movie ) , more effects are better than fewer .
Certainly it ’s possible to break these rules and still have a hit , but why take chances ?
After all , you ’re investing a lot of money .
This hit - driven mindset has leaked out of Hollywood boardrooms and into our national culture .
We have been conditioned by the economic demands of the hit machine to expect nothing less .
We have internalized the bookkeeping of entertainment risk capital .
This is why we follow weekend box office results like we do professional sports – to keep score and separate the clear winners from the seemingly obvious losers .
Fixated on star power , we follow the absurd lives of A - listers with attention that far exceeds our interest in their work .
From superstar athletes to celebrity CEOs , we ascribe disproportionate attention to the very top of the heap .
We have been trained , in other words , to see the world through a hit - colored lens .
If it ’s not a hit , then it ’s a miss .
It has failed the economic test and , therefore , never should have been made .
This Hollywood mindset is now how we allocate space on store shelves , fill time slots on television , and build radio playlists .
It ’s all about allocating scarce resources to the most “ deserving , ” which is to say , the most popular .
Ultimately , our response to hit culture is to reinforce hit culture .
The world of shelf space is a zero- sum game :
One product displaces another .
Forced to choose , each link in the entertainment industry naturally selects the most popular products , giving them privileged placement .
By putting our commercial weight behind the big winners , we amplify the gap between them and everything else .
Economically , this is the same as saying , “ If there can be only a few rich , let them at least be super - rich . ”
But now the audience is turning to a distribution medium that does n’t favor the hits alone .
We are abandoning the tyranny of the top and becoming a niche nation again , defined not by our geography but by our interests .
Instead of the weak connections of the office water cooler , we ’re increasingly forming our own tribes , groups bound together more by affinity and shared interests than by broadcast schedules .
These days our water coolers are increasingly virtual – there are many different ones , and the people who gather around them are self - selected .
The mass market is yielding to a million minimarkets .
Hits will always be with us , but they have lost their monopoly .
Blockbusters must now compete with an infinite number of niche offerings , which can be distributed just as easily .
Justin Timberlake still makes albums , but today he has thousands of bands on MySpace as rivals .
The hierarchy of attention has inverted – credibility now rises from below .
MTV and Tower Records no longer decide who will win .
You do .

Footage of a friendly fire incident in which a British soldier died in Iraq will not be shown in open court at his inquest , the coroner investigating the death said today .
The Oxfordshire assistant deputy coroner , Andrew Walker , said he had made a " pragmatic " decision not to show the cockpit video , taken from one of two US A - 10 planes that attacked a British convoy , killing Lance Corporal Matty Hull .
He added that the decision had been taken to ensure continued US cooperation with the inquest .
It comes despite the leaking of the tape to the Sun newspaper last week .
The footage has since been shown repeatedly on television , and transcripts of the tape have been published .
The footage will instead be brought to the court by a ministry of defence official and shown in private to the coroner and Lance Corporal Hull 's family .
" I can say quite categorically that if it were not for the potential delay and distress this would cause the family , I would not be willing to be bound by an agreement with the US as to use of evidence that I consider crucial to this inquest , " Mr Walker told the pre-inquest hearing prior to the full inquest , which begins on March 12 .
" I would be wrong to accept that the US are correct in seeking to bind the hands of the coroners ' court in this way .
" But in these circumstances I feel that , in order to make progress and provide the family with closure , it seems to me that I must act in this way as far as the copy of that video is concerned . "
Lance Corporal
Hull died in a burning armoured vehicle in March 2003 , three days before his 26th birthday , after the US planes opened fire on a Household Cavalry Regiment patrol near Basra , in southern Iraq .
Four other British soldiers were injured .
The soldier 's family have said they were initially told no such footage of the incident existed .
It first came to light when Mr Walker said he had been handed a copy and wanted to play it before the hearing .
At today 's hearing , he was told by Leigh - Ann Mulcahy , an MoD lawyer , that the US government had authorised the transcript of the video to be presented in open court .
However , the footage itself - which is of poor quality and shows little of what is happening on the ground - could not be shown in public , she said .
The coroner asked whether he could get the video analysed or enhanced , but was told he did not have US authorisation .
The lawyer representing Lance Corporal Hull 's widow , Susan , said the video was crucial evidence and there was " an artificial situation in discussing these conditions when the video has been displayed and is available around the world " .
" I would say there is a lack of cooperation on behalf of the US government , " Geraldine McCool said .
She added that the Hull family would rather the coroner cooperated with the US to ensure further information , such as transcripts of the US investigation into the pilots ' training hours , was received .
Mr Walker , who has repeatedly criticised the MoD over the issue of the tape , again spoke of his frustration today .
" It seems to me that this inquest creeps forward step by step , " he said .
" Each time I hear something new , I have to approach the MoD to seek clarification about that point .
" The time has come where I should be entitled to see all the material and form a judgment on what I have seen .
I 'm not unreasonable , I shall be fair but this investigation needs to be thorough .
" I just want to know , and I 'm sure the family want to know , why this happened , in as much detail as possible . "
The tape shows the two A - 10 pilots , both later identified as reservists with no previous combat experience , attacking the British convoy despite seeing orange panels on the roofs of vehicles - an indicator of friendly forces during the invasion of Iraq .
" I 'm going to be sick , " one says on being told that the attack has killed a soldier .
He adds : " We 're in jail , dude . "
I must be slow – it just looked like a random street picture to me at first .
A friend had to point out the folks in the upper right .
I wonder how they walk sideways like that ?
Thanks to Walton ’s mention , I ’ve been spending quite a bit of the weekend looking at reddit , and comparing it to digg .
Both sites are a step forward from the old classics , Slashdot and Kuro5shin , as well as the much newer de.licio.us ( which as I ’m sure everyone who follows it knows , has just been bought by Yahoo ) .
digg and reddit both allow their users to directly determine the content that appears on the site .
However , they have a significantly different voting system .
digg is older ( being launched in November 2004 ) , and has a very simple voting system .
A registered user submits an article , and it immediately appears in a queue of new posts .
Users can then dig the article ( a positive vote ) .
If it receives enough positive votes within a certain time period ( I ’m not sure exactly how the algorithm works ) , it will be promoted to the main site .
The more positive votes in the shortest space of time , the higher it appears .
It works well , and is an innovative democratic advance over a site such as Slashdot , where posts are approved by the editors .
I stopped visiting Slashdot a while ago .
They do have interesting posts , and I still visit occassionally , but I get sucked into reading inane comments such as fisrt post , or ya gotta be kiding , M$ sucks , and getting depressed about the state of humanity .
I ’m sure those exact comments exist multiple times 🙂 .
With the limited number of eyes approving article s , there ’s a significant delay , and the number of posts appearing on the site is relatively small .
I revisited it , just for the comparison , and found I spent a lot more time on digg .
digg has its problems , in particular with repeat posts , such as when a new wave of users resubmit an article that ’s already dropped off .
This is probably one of the reasons for the important difference in reddit ’s voting system .
reddit launched in July 2005 , and allows both negative and positive votes .
So the top ranked articles are not just those that are popular amongst a significant portion of the users , but those that achieve some sort of consensus .
Repeat posts can therefore be voted down by older users , and are less likely to be ranked highly .
A user also accumulates karma , which is dependant on the success of stories they submit and vote upon .
As far as I know karmas only rewards it accumulators with bragging rights , although I have a vague , probably mistaken memory of reading somewhere that it also affects the weighting of the vote .
Its an interesting concept – the secrets of the algorithm are kept secret , and one downside is the phenomonen of so - called karma whores , who vote for stories they know will be popular in order to improve their own karma , doing nothing for the overall variety .
If digg tends to suffer from repeats , reddit tends to suffer from a lack of variety , and potentially divisive articles may not rate highly .
Anything by Paul Graham , one of the founders ( and who presumably has lots of karma according to the system ) seems to shoot up the charts , and there ’s a few legacy topics ( such as Lisp ) that achieve strange success .
Perhaps this is what lead me to think that karma plays a role in the weighting of a vote .
I found some excellent articles on both sites , and will be using them both extensively in future .
I can relate to the sentiments of one reddit commentator , who said that he will never visit another site as he feels that anything worth reading will appear on it .
Both also have a great interfaces , with reddit ’s being fantastically simple , and digg not far behind .
It warms my heart to see more sites with such great design , cottoning on to the fact that complicated intefaces with multiple choices puts people off – compare your first impression of digg or reddit to say CNN .
Perhaps I have n’t yet made enough use of the friends or customisation features , but I found myself getting ideas about implementing a similar concept with a focus on local topics .
reddit had a large number of articles about the Bush / Cheney horror show , and while it ’s heartening that more Americans are waking up to how they ’ve been duped , the American demographic bias does result in a limited variety .
Give me well - written articles about Mbeki / Zuma ( they must exist somewhere ) , or an in - depth analysis into the Western Cape ANC ’s infighting ( being even more wishful here ) .
Let me see the pick of Tectonic , Commentary , the Mail and Guardian , IOL , News24 and ITWeb .
Introduce me to those niche bloggers with the monthly pearls of wisdom I may never otherwise come across .
I ’m sure we ’re going to see even more variations of the idea appearing , and I wait with interest to see how well these ones will age as their communities change , and what else will appear .

The internet has given the individual unprecedented power to reach out to millions but some governments are cautious , even hostile , to giving their citizens free access to ideas they deem too democratic and dangerous .
Bloggers can face harsh penalties from some regimes
Cuba , Egypt , Tunisia : they are all popular with holiday makers but they also censor and even lock up journalists and bloggers .
This is why the media rights group , Reporters Without Borders , has published The Handbook for Bloggers and Cyber - Dissidents .
" There is another side to the picture post - card , " said Robert Menard , secretary general , Reporters Without Borders .
" There are around 100 people in jail in Tunisia and the entire media is controlled by the powers that be and there are bloggers who have been locked up just for criticizing the Tunisian president . "
In many countries a journalism student covering a demonstration of school children would be commended for his initiative .
In Syria , student Mesud Hamid posted photos on the net of Kurdish pupils demanding equal rights .
He was arrested while taking an exam at university .
" I was tortured , " he said .
" For one year and three months I was held in a cell measuring one metre by two .
I did n't see the sun or sky for all that time . "
Mr Hamid has since fled to France .
Remaining anonymous
So what do you do if you want to escape detection from authorities who might not like your work as much as you do ?
The Handbook for Bloggers and Cyber - Dissidents is pretty technical but it also contains some simple tips , so you can say what you think without having to worry the censors or cyber - police too much .
If you want to protect your anonymity you can use a proxy , using a proxy is very simple .
Anybody can do it even if you 're not a geek
Julien Pain , Reporters Without Borders
" The first thing is do n't write anything under your real name , " said Julien Pain of Reporters Without Borders .
" Even if you are using a pen name , then you have to be careful because the authorities can track you down on the internet . "
You might be tight - lipped about who you are , but your computer is screaming your presence all over the net .
All net - connected computers get assigned an IP address - which ensures that they data you request is sent to the right place .
It can let people know which websites you have visited , which e-mails you have sent and which articles you have posted .
But if you are clever you can cover your tracks .
" If you want to protect your anonymity you can use a proxy , using a proxy is very simple .
Anybody can do it even if you 're not a geek , " said Mr Pain .
Now there are two ways you can do this .
An open proxy is essentially a computer , based elsewhere on the web , through which you can surf , send e-mails or post articles anonymously .
You have to change your IP address to one listed on various sites and , in principle you should be able to work anonymously .
" In principle " , because open proxies can also be used by hackers , so administrators often block them after a few days .
Another option might be a web - based proxy site abroad like Anonymouse or ProxyLord .
They are going down well among surfers and bloggers in China .
China 's censorship machine blocks information in various ways
" The authorities would not be able to trace the IP because you 're doing this through a proxy site , and that 's probably the most efficient way now for the readers in China now to visit officially blocked websites , " explained Xiaorong Li , a research professor at the University of Maryland .
Proxies have their drawbacks as they can be blocked .
But for a very effective , albeit technical way of staying anonymous you could use The Onion Router ( TOR ) .
This is so called because the data it sends between computers is encrypted in successive layers like an onion .
The data also takes an unpredictable path through all the proxies making up the TOR network .
Each proxy peels off a layer of encryption , revealing the next proxy it has to go to .
Intercept the message at any point and the identities of both sender and recipient are protected .
Not until it arrives , can the message be read .
Firewall of China
There are less technical ways of avoiding censorship .
In China filters seek out specific words that the authorities consider contentious .
The mere mention of Tiananmen Square would be enough to get you noticed .
But you may , however , be able to fox the filters .
" If you want to put the words June 4th , you put a comma or a period in between June and 4th , so they are not one phrase and that enables this word to evade detection through the filter , because the filter works by phrases : June 4th or 1989 , " explained Xiaorong Li .
" If you put some kind of punctuation between the words they become not a phrase but readers can perfectly understand what you are saying . "
There is no sure - fire way of staying anonymous on the web and avoiding detection .
But if you are careful about what you do , you can cut down your chances of being caught up by the cyber - police .
At his confirmation hearing yesterday for an ambassadorship to Belgium , nominee Sam Fox got grilled by Senator Kerry for the $ 50,000 contribution he gave to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , the same group that spread lies and attacked Kerry 's decorated military service during his 2004 Presidential run .
Needless to say , Kerry had some business to take care of .
It 's rather surreal to hear a major swift boat funder tell Kerry that he 's a hero for his military service .

Bob Geiger weighs in and has a partial transcript .
AP covers the story too .
While it 's nice to see Senator Kerry finally get some satisfaction , this is what he should have been doing back in 2004 .
The SBVT lies were transparent and easily debunked -- by official Navy records no less .
Although he did n't get much help from the media who refused to call out the blatant lies , inconsistencies and discrepancies , he could have defused this easily .
Instead he ignored and , in turn , validated them .
The structure is described in the form of a vast matrix
Mapping the 248 - dimensional structure , called E8 , took four years of work and produced more data than the Human Genome Project , researchers said .
E8 is a " Lie group " , a means of describing symmetrical objects .
The team said their findings may assist fields of physics which use more than four dimensions , such as string theory .
Lie groups were invented by the 19th Century Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie ( pronounced " Lee " ) .
It 's as complicated as symmetry can get
David Vogan
" What 's attractive about studying E8 is that it's as complicated as symmetry can get " , observed David Vogan from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the US .
" Mathematics can almost always offer another example that 's harder than the one you 're looking at now , but for Lie groups , E8 is the hardest one . "
Professor Vogan is presenting the results at MIT in a lecture entitled The Character Table for E8 , or How We Wrote Down a 453,060 x 453,060 Matrix and Found Happiness .
Fundamental force
Conceptualising , designing and running the calculations took a team of 19 mathematicians four years .
The final computation took more than three days ' solid processing time on a Sage supercomputer .
Lie groups were invented by the Norwegian Sophus Lie
Each of the 205,263,363,600 entries on the matrix is far more complicated than a straightforward number ; some are complex equations .
The team calculated that if all the numbers were written out in small type , they would cover an area the size of Manhattan .
In addition to facilitating further understanding of symmetry and related areas of mathematics , the team hopes its work will contribute to areas of physics , such as string theory , which involve structures possessing more than the conventional four dimensions of space and time .
" While mathematicians have known for a long time about the beauty and the uniqueness of E8 , we physicists have come to appreciate its exceptional role only more recently , " commented Hermann Nicolai , director of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics ( the Albert Einstein Institute ) in Germany .
" Yet , in our attempts to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces into a consistent theory of quantum gravity , we now encounter it at almost every corner . "

The sentencing of Egyptian blogger Kareem Nabeel Sulaiman to four years in prison for articles he wrote in his personal blog may have come as a shock to many around the world , but for Egyptian bloggers the lesson is just too close to home for comfort .
Kareem was sentenced by an Alexandria Court to four years in prison – three for blasphemy against Islam and one for insulting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
For blogger Ala'a Abdulfattah , who was himself imprisoned last year for his political activism , it is the one year Kareem was sentenced for insulting the President that struck a raw nerve .
عبد الكريم خد 4 سنين حبس 3 سنين على تهمة ازدراء الأديان و سنة على تهمة اهانة السيد الرئيس بيقولك مرة واحد قرر يرشح نفسه رئيس الجمهورية، مسكوه بتوع أمن الدولة و قالولوا أنت عبيط ولا ايه، قالهم هو شرط؟ الناس اللي كانت بتشجع محاكمة و حبس عبد الكريم، يا ريت تركزوا شوية على حتة سنة حبس على تهمة اهانة الرئيس دي، يا ريت تاخدوا بالكم كويس من معناها .
و تفكروا كويس دي لما تعدي بالساهل كده ممكن تستخدم ثاني ضد مين و ضد كام حد في مصر .
فكروا كويس في عاقبة حبس الكافر الزنديق الكخة بتهمة اهانة الرئيس .
“ Abdulkareem has been sentenced to four years behind bars , three years for contempt against religion and one for insulting the president .
They say that one day someone decided to run for president .
The secret police caught him and asked him whether he was stupid .
The man replied : Is that a must ?
I had just hoped that the people who were rallying for Abdulkareem 's trial and imprisonment had focused just a little on this small part which says that he will be spending a year in prison for insulting the president .
I hope you will pay attention here with me .
I hope that you will think that when a sentence like this is passed without a fuss just like that , against how many other people in Egypt will this excuse be used again .
Think again of the consequences of imprisoning the dirty infidel for insulting the president , ” he writes .
Another blogger , Freedom for Egyptians , agrees with Abdulfattah 's analysis that now that Kareem has been imprisoned , others in Egypt are not immune .
“ This morning , I checked the news of Egyptian Blogger Abdel kareem Nabil Soliman Amer and as expected he was sentenced to four years in prison .
I did not expect the four years but a prison sentence .
There is still the appeal procedure but who knows ….
It is really sad !
Egypt is setting a dangerous precedent for trying and sentencing internet writers and bloggers when other countries are working on raising the ceiling of freedom of expression .
And the biggest disaster that it is not the issue to agree or disagree with Kareem Amer 's blog , but the real disappointment is that many people are supporting jailing Kareem , including his family .
They do not know that regardless where do they stand on politics or religion , their turn is coming ….
I am not shocked but sad , ” she writes .
After reviewing some of the comments made by international organisation and human rights groups , another Egyptian blogger Ibn Al Dunya adds his two cents to the situation .
“ It ´s also a reminder of how some of the great sons and daughters of Egypt have gone through the same odd experience with al Azhar , albeit with different outcomes , that Kareem has been through for the last 16 months .
The likes of Ali Abd al Razeq , Taha Hussein , Naguib Mahfouz , Youssef Chahine , Farag Fouda , Alaa Hamid , NasserHamid Abu Zeid , Louis Awad and Nawal as Saádawi have all been under the scrutiny , and been jugded as not up to par with the high standards of the much acclaimed institution .
For at least four of them , this has had enourmous consequenses , Mahfouz was stabbed 35 years after he wrote Awlad Haratna( Children of Gabalawi ) , the perpetrator using al Azhars deccision as the reason for commiting the act .
Farag Fouda was killed in the street after SheikhMuhamed al Ghazali had declared him an apostate .
Nasser Hamed Abu Zeid was stripped of his position at Cairo University , and unvillingly divored from his wife , Iqbal Younis and both of them forced into exile .
And now Abd al Karim Nabil Sulaiman… , ” he writes .
Ibn Al Dunya also argues that religions are protected and cannot be tarnished by the writings or thoughts of one person or another .
“ What people perceive as a defence for religion or a defence for the image of Egypt , is not a good thing , it´s a sign of weakness , the religions ( Islam or Christianity alike ) need not be protected by the people .
Religion in itself is larger than anyone of us combined and both of the two religions has outlived worse times than this .
It ´s us that need´s religions not the other way around , and Islam is not threatened as a religion or civilization by al Qaida , Denmark , Salman Rushdie the Pope or any of the abovementioned authors , and certainly not by a single blogger like Kareem , just as Christianity is not threatened by the writings of Muhammad Emara or the pictures of the monk , etc , ” he writes .
Meanwhile , blogger Yasmeen Amin tells us exactly what Kareem has written and what has landed him in prison .
“ The last entry on his unfortunate blog dates back to October 28 , 2006 where he mentions that he received a summons to appear at the police station for an investigation .
The charges against him , he writes , are the ghost of Al Azhar haunting him , despite him receiving his dismissal paper from Al Azhar university already .
He mentions other luminaries and intellectuals that were touched by Al Azhar ’s curse , as he calls it , and who were forced to either abandon their ideas or flee the country or paid with their life , such as Nasr Hamed Abu Zeid , Dr. Ahmed Sobhy Mansour , Nawal El Saadawi or Ahmed El Shahawy and the late Farag Fouda .
He writes that this only strengthens his courage and resolve .
Since that last entry he has been arrested and detained and has no doubt gone through hell .
We have all seen enough videos on YouTube of what goes on in Egyptian Police Stations to know that his detention there was probably a nightmare – to say the least .
Visits from his family and lawyers were forbidden .
The charges against Karim were those of insulting Islam , harming the peace and insulting President Hosni Mubarak , ” she writes .
Amin says Kareem wrote about love and the use of religion to suppress women in all spheres of life .
Kareem also “ objects to not educating girls , of not allowing them to work in certain professions and fields .
He condemns female circumcision and genital mutilation as yet another form of repression .
He criticises marrying off girls at an early age and is very passionate about discontinuing domestic violence .
All his criticism has been dealt with before by Al Azhar and the Grand Mufti . ”
“ I went through the entire blog .
It took me a couple of days , but I seriously read each and every blog entry .
I had to find out why he will be robbed of four years of his life .
Why he was denied the right to complete his education .
Why he was dismissed from University .
Why he was silenced and used as an example to perhaps frighten other bloggers into silence , ” she explains .
Amin does a marvelous job summing up Kareem 's posts , giving us a dateline of all that the jailed blogger has written about .
In conclusion , she says :
Telescope sees ' Mountains of Creation ' By Robert Roy Britt
SPACE.com
Spitzer image of the Mountains of Creation , or W5 , in infrared .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) Astronomy or or Create Your Own ( SPACE.com ) --
Giant clouds of gas and dust harboring embryonic stars rise majestically into space in a new picture from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
The image , dubbed the Mountains of Creation by astronomers , reveals hotbeds of star formation similar to the iconic Pillars of Creation within the Eagle Nebula , photographed in 1995 by the Hubble Space Telescope .
In both cases , the finger - like features are cool clouds of gas and dust that have been sculpted by radiation and fast - moving winds of charged particles from hot , massive stars .
Spitzer records heat , or infrared light , which penetrates the dusty clouds and allows a view of the star birth inside .
In the largest finger , hundreds of embryonic stars not seen before are revealed .
Dozens of stars - to - be are visible in one of the other fingers .
The Spitzer image shows the eastern edge of a region known as W5 , in the Cassiopeia constellation 7,000 light - years away .
A massive star outside the frame lights the scene .
The pillars are more than 10 times the size of those in the Eagle Nebula .
Over the past decade , thanks in large part to the 1995 Hubble image and subsequent investigations of the Eagle Nebula and similar stellar cradles , astronomers have learned that intense outflows from massive stars actually help birth more stars .
Such appears to be the case in the new Spitzer image .
" We believe that the star clusters lighting up the tips of the pillars are essentially the offspring of the region 's single , massive star , " said Lori Allen , lead investigator of the new observations from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
" It appears that radiation and winds from the massive star triggered new stars to form . "
Visible - light images of this same region show dark towers outlined by halos of light .
They are not as dramatic because the clouds block the light coming from the embryonic stars .
The researchers think W5 started out as thick and turbulent clouds of gas and dust .
Stars , some more than 10 times the mass of the Sun , were born in groups .
Then radiation and winds from these massive stars forced material outward , leaving the dense pillar - shaped clumps .
Many astronomers think our Sun was formed in a similar setup , then later migrated away from the clump .
The Spitzer picture also reveals blue stars , which are older and sit in cavities within the clouds .
They are thought to have been born around the same time as the massive star outside the frame that was responsible for the whole scene .
" With Spitzer , we can not only see the stars in the pillars , but we can estimate their ages and study how they formed , " said Joseph Hora , also from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .

$ 219 for 60 days of access to the " Ziinet Bankruptcy Engine , " described on the websites like this :
Ziinet is an expert system and knows the law .
Unlike most bankruptcy programs which are little more than customized word processors the
Ziinet engine is an expert system .
It knows bankruptcy laws right down to those applicable to the state in which you live .
Now you no longer need to spend weeks studying bankruptcy laws .
Reynoso entered his personal information , debts , income , assets and other data into a series of dialog boxes , and the program generated a complete set of bankruptcy forms , including an affidavit for Reynoso to sign claiming he ’d done all the legal research on his own .
( Yes , like meat - lawyers , the Ziinet Bankruptcy Engine knows how to gild the lily a little . )
When a bankruptcy trustee noticed errors in the forms , Reynoso blamed his computerized counsel , and
Ihejirika joined the party in federal court .
A bankruptcy judge ruled that Ihejirika had committed fraudulent , unfair , or deceptive conduct through his computer program , and had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law .
Ihejirika was fined , enjoined from offering the same service in the future , and ordered to give up the fees he ’d collected from nine customers in Northern California .
He appealed , and last week the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling .
The software did , indeed , go far beyond providing clerical services .
It determined where ( particularly , in which schedule ) to place information provided by the debtor , selected exemptions for the debtor and supplied relevant legal citations .
Providing such personalized guidance has been held to constitute the practice of law . ( … ) ( The ) system touted its offering of legal advice and projected an aura of expertise concerning bankruptcy petitions ; and , in that context , it offered personalized
— albeit automated — counsel . …
We find that because this was the conduct of a non-attorney , it constituted the unauthorized practice of law .
Ihejirika had a human lawyer for his defense .

Here ’s how the President described the enemy in Iraq at his press conference last week .
“ The violence is being caused by a combination of terrorists , elements of former regime criminals , and sectarian militias . ”
“ Elements of former regime criminals , ” aka “ bitter - enders , ” aka “ Saddamists . ”
The “ sectarian militias ” may have been a relatively recent add - on , but this is essentially the same list , the same sort of terminology the President has been using for years .
In the last two weeks , however , rumblings of discontent , the urge for a change of course ( or at least a mid-course correction ) in Iraq have been persistently bubbling to the surface of already roiling Washington .
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner recently returned from Iraq to rattle the Bush administration by saying that policy there was “ drifting sideways ” and if it did n’t improve , “ all options ” should be on the table not long after the mid-term elections .
Suggestions are rife for dumping the President ’s goal of “ democracy ” in Iraq and swallowing a little of the hard stuff .
Washington Post columnist David Ignatius , for instance , reported last week ( as did Middle Eastern expert Robert Dreyfuss at Tompaine.com a week earlier ) that in two desperate capitals , Washington and Baghdad , rumors about possible future Iraqi coups are spinning wildly .
People of import are evidently talking about the possibility of a new five - man “ ruling commission , ” a “ government of national salvation ” there that would “ suspend parliament , declare martial law and call back some officers of the old Iraqi army . ”
Even the name of that CIA warhorse ( and anti-neocon candidate ) Ayad Allawi , who could n’t get his party elected dogcatcher in the new Iraq , is coming up again in the context of the need for a “ strongman . ”
This was , of course , the desire of the elder George Bush and his advisors back at the end of Gulf War I , when they hoped just such a Sunni strongman — one who could work with them — would topple a weakened Saddam Hussein .
Dreams , it seems , die hard .
And , as if on cue , who should appear but former Secretary of State and Bush family handler James A. Baker III , a Bush Elder kind of guy .
While on the talk - show circuit for his new book , he also spent last week plugging ( but not revealing ) the future findings of the Iraq Study Group , a bipartisan commission he co-heads whose aim is to suggest to a reluctant President new policy possibilities in Iraq .
They too are putting “ all ” options on the table ( as long as those options involve “ continuing the mission in Iraq ” ) .
The group , according to a leak to the New York Sun , has , however , ruled out the President ’s favorite option , “ victory . ”
One option it is considering , according the Sun , involves skipping “ democracy , ” minimizing American casualties , and focusing “ on stabilizing Baghdad , while the American Embassy should work toward political accommodation with insurgents . ”
A political accommodation with the insurgents ?
Curious how word gets around .
Sometimes a small change in terminology speaks volumes for future mid-course corrections .
The other day , Gen. George Casey , commander of U.S. troops in Iraq , gave a press briefing with Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon .
As part of his prepared introductory remarks ( not in answer to some random question ) , he offered this list of “ groups that are working to affect [ the situation in Iraq ] negatively ” :
“ The first , the Sunni extremists , al Qaeda , and the Iraqis that are supporting them .
Second , the Shi’a extremists , the death squads and the more militant militias .
In my view , those represent the greatest current threats in Iraq .
The third group is the resistance , the Sunni insurgency that sees themselves as an honorable resistance against foreign occupation in Iraq . ”
“ The resistance ” ?
“ An honorable resistance against foreign occupation in Iraq ” ?
Where did those bitter - enders , those Anti-Iraq Forces go ?
Take it as a small signal — noticed , as far as I could tell , by not a single reporter or pundit — of things to come .
Of course , all of this has brought to the surface a lot of hopeful “ withdrawal ” talk in the media ( and the online world ) , in part because the Baker group seems to have been floating “ phased withdrawal ” rumors .
Before you think about genuine withdrawal possibilities though , note the announcement by Army Chief of Staff Gen .
Peter Schoomaker last week that he was now planning for the possibility of maintaining present force levels in Iraq ( 140,000 + troops ) through 2010 ; that Casey at that press briefing left the door wide open to ask the President for even more troops after the election ; and that the build - up on the ground of permanent bases ( not called that ) and our vast , nearly billion - dollar embassy in the heart of Baghdad is ongoing .
Below , Michael Schwartz considers the latest in military mid-course corrections and explains why such corrections can no longer hope to plug the gaping holes in Iraq ’s political dikes .
Similarly , Warner , Baker , Casey , Senator Joe Biden ( with his “ three - state solution ” ) , and so many others can all promote their own mid-course corrections , suggest them to the President , bring them to the new Congress , promote them among military figures , but as long as that embassy goes up and those bases keep getting hardened and improved , as long as the “ mission continues ” ( in Baker ’s phrase ) , changing troop levels , tactics , even governments in Baghdad ’s Green Zone , not to speak of “ policy options ” in Washington will solve nothing .
Wherever that “ table ” is sooner or later all options will really have to be displayed on it .

The More Force You Use , the Less Effective You Are
By Michael Schwartz
Recently , the New York Times broke a story suggesting that the U.S. Army and the Marines were about to turn the conceptual tide of war in Iraq .
The two services , reported correspondent Michael R. Gordon , “ were finishing work on a new counterinsurgency doctrine ” that would , according to retired Lt. Gen.
Jack Keane , “ change [ the military ’s ] entire culture as it transitions to irregular warfare . ”
Such strategic eureka moments have been fairly common since the Bush administration invaded Iraq in March 2003 , and this one — news coverage of it died away in less than a week — will probably drop into the dustbin of history along with other times when the tactical or strategic tide of war was supposed to change .
These would include the November 2004 assault on the city of Falluja , various elections , the “ standing up ” of the Iraqi army , and the trench that , it was briefly reported , the Iraqis were planning to dig around their vast capital , Baghdad .
But this plan had one ingenious section , derived from an article by four military experts published in the quasi-official Military Review and entitled “ The Paradoxes of Counterinsurgency . ”
The nine paradoxes the experts lay out are eye - catching , to say the least , and so make vivid reading ; but they are more than so many titillating puzzles of counterinsurgency warfare .
Each of them contains an implied criticism of American strategy in Iraq .
Seen in this light , they become an instructive lesson from insiders in why the American presence in that country has been such a disaster , and why this ( or any other ) new counterinsurgency strategy has little chance of ameliorating it .
Paradox 1 : The More You Protect Your Force , the Less Secure You Are
The military experts offer this explanation : “ [ The ] counterinsurgent gains ultimate success by protecting the populace , not himself . ”
It may seem like a bland comment , but do n’t be fooled .
It conceals a devastating criticism of the cardinal principle of the American military in Iraq : that above all else they must minimize the risk to American troops by setting rules of engagement that essentially boil down to “ shoot first , make excuses later . ”
Applications of this principle are found in the by - now familiar policies of annihilating any car that passes the restraint line at checkpoints ( because it might be a car bomber ) ; shooting at pedestrians who get in the path of any American convoy ( because they might be trying to stop the vehicles to activate an ambush ) ; and calling in artillery or air power against any house that might be an insurgent hiding place ( because the insurgents might otherwise escape and / or snipe at an American patrol ) .
This “ shoot first ” policy has guaranteed that large numbers of civilians ( including a remarkable number of children ) have been killed , maimed , or left homeless .
For most of us , killing this many innocent people would be reason enough to abandon a policy , but from a military point of view it is not in itself sufficient .
These tactics only become anathema when you can no longer ignore the way they have made it ever more difficult for the occupying army to “ maintain contact ” with the local population in order “ to obtain the intelligence to drive operations and to reinforce the connections with the people who establish legitimacy . ”
Paradox 2 : The More Force You Use , the Less Effective You Are
Times ’ reporter Gordon summarizes the logic here nicely : “ Substantial force increases the risk of collateral damage and mistakes , and increases the opportunity for insurgent propaganda . ”
Considering the levels of devastation achieved in the Sunni city of Falluja ( where 70 % of structures were estimated to be damaged and close to 50 % destroyed in the U.S. assault of November 2004 ) and in other Sunni cities ( where whole neighborhoods have been devastated ) , or even in Shiite Najaf ( where entire neighborhoods and major parts of its old city were destroyed in 2004 ) , the word “ substantial ” has to be considered a euphemism .
And the use of the word “ propaganda ” betrays the bias of the military authors , since many people would consider such levels of devastation a legitimate reason for joining groups that aim to expel the occupiers .
Here again , the striking logic of the American military is at work .
These levels of destruction are not , in themselves , considered a problem — at least not until someone realizes that they are facilitating recruitment by the opposition .
Paradox 3 : The More Successful Counterinsurgency
Is , the Less Force That Can Be Used and the More Risk That Must Be Accepted
Though not presented this way , this paradox is actually a direct criticism of the American military strategy in the months after the fall of the Saddam Hussein ’s regime in 2003 .
In those early days , active resistance to the occupation was modest indeed , an average of only six violent engagements each day ( compared to 90 three years later . )
But American military policy in the country was still based on overwhelming force .
American commanders sought to deter a larger insurgency by ferociously repressing any signs of resistance .
This strategy included house - to - house searches witnessed by embedded reporter Nir Rosen and described in his vivid book , In the Belly of the Green Bird .
These missions , repeated hundreds of times each day across Iraq , included home invasions of suspected insurgents , brutal treatment of their families and often their property , and the indefinite detention of men found in just about any house searched , even when U.S. troops knew that their intelligence was unreliable .
Relatively peaceful demonstrations were forcibly suppressed , most agonizingly when , in late April 2003 , American troops killed 13 demonstrators in Falluja who were demanding that the U.S. military vacate a school commandeered as a local headquarters .
This incident became a cause clbre around which Fallujans organized themselves into a central role in the insurgency that soon was born .
The new counterinsurgency strategy acknowledges that the very idea of overwhelming demonstrations of force producing respectful obedience has backfired , producing instead an explosion of rebellion .
And now that a significant majority of Iraqis are determined to expel the Americans , promises of more humane treatment next time will not get the genie of the insurgency back in the bottle .
Paradox 4 : Sometimes Doing Nothing
Is the Best Reaction
This paradox is , in fact , a criticism of another cardinal principle of the occupation : the application of overwhelming force in order to teach insurgents ( and prospective insurgents ) that opposition of any sort will not be tolerated and , in any case , is hopeless .
A typical illustration of this principle in practice was a January 2006 U.S. military report that went in part : “ An unmanned U.S. drone detected three men digging a hole in a road in the area .
Insurgents regularly bury bombs along roads in the area to target U.S. or Iraqi convoys .
The three men were tracked to a building , which U.S. forces then hit with precision - guided munitions . ”
As it turned out , the attack killed 12 members of a family living in that house , severely damaged six neighboring houses , and consolidated local opposition to the American presence .
This example ( multiplied many times over ) makes it clear why , in so many instances over these last years , doing nothing might have been better : fewer enemies in the “ hood . ”
But the developers of the new military strategy have a more cold - blooded view of the issue , preferring to characterize the principle in this way : “ If a careful analysis of the effects of a response reveals that more negatives than positives might result , soldiers should consider an alternative . ”
That is , while this incident might well be an example of a time when “ doing nothing is the best reaction , ” the multiple civilian deaths that resulted could , under at least some circumstances , be outweighed by the “ positives . ”
Take , for a counter example , the killing of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the head of al - Qaeda - in - Mesopotamia , in an air strike that also caused multiple civilian deaths .
Paradox 5 : The Best Weapons for Counterinsurgency Do Not Shoot
The Times ’ Gordon offers the following translation of this paradox : “ Often dollars and ballots have more impact than bombs and bullets . ”
Given the $ 18 billion U.S. reconstruction budget for Iraq and the three well - attended elections since January 2005 , it might seem that , in this one area , Bush administration efforts actually anticipated the new counterinsurgency doctrine .
But in their original article the military strategists were actually far more precise in describing what they meant by this — and that precision makes it clear how far from effective American “ reconstruction ” was .
Money and elections , they claim , are not enough : “ Lasting victory will come from a vibrant economy , political participation and restored hope . ”
As it happened , the American officials responsible for Iraq policy were only willing to deliver that vibrant economy , along with political participation and restored hope , under quite precise and narrow conditions that suited the larger fantasies of the Bush administration .
Iraq ’s new government was to be an American ally , hostile to that axis - of - evil regional power Iran , and it was to embrace the “ opening ” of the Iraqi economy to American multinationals .
Given Iraqi realities and this hopeless list of priorities ( or inside - the - Beltway day - dreams ) , it is not surprising that the country ’s economy has sunk ever deeper into depression , that elected officials have neither the power nor the inclination to deliver on their campaign promises , and that the principle hopes of the majority of Iraqis are focused on the departure of American troops because of , as one pollster concluded , “ the American failure to do basically anything for Iraqis . ”
Paradox 6 : The Host Nation Doing Something Tolerably Is Sometimes Better Than Our Doing It Well
Here is a paradoxical principle that the occupation has sought to apply fully .
The presidential slogan , “ as the Iraqis stand up , we will stand down , ” has been an expression of Bush administration determination to transfer the front - line struggle against the insurgents — the patrols , the convoys , the home invasions , any house - to - house fighting — to Iraqi units , even if their job performance proved even less than “ tolerable ” compared to the rigorous execution of American troops .
It is this effort that has also proved the administration ’s most consistent and glaring failure .
In a country where 80 % of the people want the Americans to leave , it is very difficult to find soldiers willing to fight against the insurgents who are seeking to expel them .
This was evident when the first group of American - trained soldiers and police deserted the field of battle during the fights for Falluja , Najaf , Mosul , and Tal Afar back in 2004 .
This led eventually to the current American strategy of using Shia soldiers against Sunni insurgents , and utilizing Kurds against both Shia and Sunni rebels .
( Sunnis , by and large , have refused to fight with the Americans . )
This policy , in turn , has contributed substantially to the still - escalating sectarian violence within Iraq .
Even today , after the infusion of enormous amounts of money and years of effort , a substantial proportion of newly recruited soldiers desert or mutiny when faced with the prospect of fighting against anti-American insurgents .
According to Solomon Moore and Louise Roug of the Los Angeles Times , in Anbar province , the scene of the heaviest fighting , “ half the Iraqi soldiers are on leave at any given time , and many do n’t return to duty .
In May , desertion rates in some Iraqi units reached 40 % . ”
In September , fully three - quarters of the 4,000 Iraqi troops ordered to Baghdad to help in the American operation to reclaim the capital and suppress internecine violence there , refused deployment .
American officials told the LA Times that such refusals were based on an unwillingness to fight outside their home regions and a reluctance to “ be thrust into uncomfortable sectarian confrontations . ”
As the failed attempts to “ stand up ” Iraqi forces suggest , the goal of getting Iraqis to fight “ tolerably ” well depends upon giving them a reason to fight that they actually support .
As long as Iraqis are asked to fight on the side of occupation troops whose presence they despise , we cannot expect the quality of their performance to be “ tolerable ” from the Bush Administration point of view .
Paradox 7 : If a Tactic Works This Week , It Will Not Work Next Week ; If It Works in This Province , It Will Not Work in the Next
The clearest expression of this principle lies in the history of improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) , the anti-occupation weapon of choice among Iraqi resistance fighters .
Throughout the war , the occupation military has conducted hundreds of armed patrols each week designed to capture suspected insurgents through house - to - house searches .
The insurgency , in turn , has focused on deterring and derailing these patrols , using sniper attacks , rocket propelled grenades , and IEDs .
At first , sniper attacks were the favored weapon of the insurgents , but the typical American response — artillery and air attacks — proved effective enough to set them looking for other ways to respond .
IEDs then gained in popularity , since they could be detonated from a relatively safe distance .
When the Americans developed devices to detect the electronic detonators , the insurgents developed a variety of non-electronic trigger devices .
When the Americans upgraded their armor to resist the typical IED , the insurgents developed “ shaped ” charges that could pierce American armor .
And so it goes in all aspects of the war .
Each move by one side triggers a response by the other .
The military experts developing the new strategy can point to this dilemma , but they can not solve it .
The underlying problem for the American military is that the resistance has already reached the sort of critical mass that ensures an endless back - and - forth tactical battle .
One solution not under consideration might work very well : abandoning the military patrols themselves .
But such a tactic would also require abandoning counterinsurgency and ultimately leaving Iraq .
Paradox 8 : Tactical Success Guarantees Nothing
This point is summarized by Gordon of the Times this way : “ [ M] ilitary actions by themselves cannot achieve success . ”
But this is the smallest part of the paradox .
It is true enough that the insurgency in Iraq hopes to win “ politically , ” by waiting for the American people to force our government to withdraw , or for the cost of the war to outweigh its potential benefits , or for world pressure to make the war diplomatically unviable .
But there is a much more encompassing element to this dictum : that guerrilla fighters do not expect to win any military battles with the occupation .
In the military strategists ’ article , they quote an interchange between American Colonel Harry Summers and his North Vietnamese counterpart after the U.S. had withdrawn from Vietnam .
When Summers said , “ You know you never defeated us on the battlefield , ” his adversary replied , “ That may be so , but it is also irrelevant . ”
A tactical victory occurs when the enemy is killed or retreats , leaving the battlefield to the victor .
In guerrilla war , therefore , the guerrillas never win since they always melt away and leave their adversary in charge .
But in Iraq , as in other successful guerrilla wars , the occupation army cannot remain indefinitely at the scene of its tactical victories — in each community , town , or city that it conquers .
It must move on to quell the rebellion elsewhere .
And when it does , if the guerrillas have successfully melted away , they will reoccupy the community , town , or city , thus winning a strategic victory and ruling the local area until their next tactical defeat .
If they keep this up long enough and do it in enough places , they will eventually make the war too costly to pursue — and thus conceivably win the war without winning a battle .
Paradox 9 : Most of the Important Decisions Are Not Made by Generals
Because guerrilla war is decentralized , with local bands deciding where to place IEDs , when to use snipers , and which patrols or bases to attack , the struggle in different communities , provinces , or regions takes very different forms .
Many insurgents in Falluja chose to stand and fight , while those in Tal Afar , near the Syrian border , decided to evacuate the city with its civilian population when the American military approached in strength .
In Shia areas , members of Muktada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army chose to join the local police and turn it to their purposes ; but Sunni insurgents have tried , instead , to disarm the local police and then disband the force .
In every city and town , the strategy of the resistance has been different .
The latest American military strategists are arguing that what they call the “ mosaic nature of an insurgency ” implies the necessity of giving autonomy to local American commanders to “ adapt as quickly as the insurgents . ”
But such decentralization cannot work if the local population supports the insurgent goal of expelling the occupiers .
Given autonomy under such circumstances , lower level U.S. military officers may decide that annihilating a home suspected of sheltering an insurgent is indeed counterproductive ; such decisions , however , humane , would now come far too late to convince a local population that it should abandon its support of a campaign seen as essential to national independence .
There may have been a time , back when the invasion began , that the U.S. could have adopted a strategy that would have made it welcome — for a time , anyway — in Iraq .
Such a strategy , as the military theorists flatly state , would have had to deliver a “ vibrant economy , political participation , and restored hope . ”
Instead , the occupation delivered economic stagnation or degradation , a powerless government , and the promise of endless violence .
Given this reality , no new military strategy — however humane , canny , or well designed — could reverse the occupation ’s terminal unpopularity .
Only a U.S. departure might do that .
Paradoxically , the policies these military strategists are now trying to reform have ensured that , however much most Iraqis may want such a departure , it would be , at best , bittersweet .
The legacy of sectarian violence and the near - irreversible destruction wrought by the American presence make it unlikely that they would have the time or inclination to take much satisfaction in the end of the American occupation .
The Best of Tom Engelhardt
There are some things which are so self - evidently right and good that it's hard to imagine how anyone could disagree with you .
The " open access " academic journal movement is one of those things .
It is a no -brainer .
Academic literature should be freely available : developing countries need access ; part - time tinkering thinkers like you deserve full access ; journalists and the public can benefit ; and most importantly of all , you have already paid for much of this stuff with your taxes .
They are important new ideas from humanity , and morally , you are entitled to them .
But with old school academic journals , unless you have an institutional subscription , you have to pay to read them .
Here is a not - so - fun example : an article called " Impediments to promoting access to global knowledge in sub-Saharan Africa " , about how difficult it is to get access to medical literature in developing countries , and how lack of access to knowledge represents a barrier to economic development and a further advantage for the rich west ( http://qurl.com/7933p).
Get your credit card ready , this single study will cost you $ 25 ( £ 13 ) plus tax to read .
Two online , open access publishing organisations have led the fight against the absurdity : one is Plos , from a Californian campaigning perspective , and the other is Biomed Central , run as a money - making empire ( relax , there is nothing wrong with making money from publishing ) .
They both give readers access for free , but they have not had an easy time of it .
Firstly , they can't get journalists to directly link to their studies .
I suspect newspapers like to fantasise that they are mediators between specialist tricky knowledge and the wider public , but I would n't be so flattering .
In fact , if you have access to the original journals , you can see just how rubbish things can get .
I could n't write this column without my institutional login .
Sometimes I have even had to go to the library to get information into my brain instead of using the internet .
But meanwhile , the old school , pay - for - access journals are so worried about open access that they 've hired Eric Dezenhall , the famous American " pitbull of PR " , and author of Nail ' Em ! Confronting High - Profile Attacks on Celebrities and Businesses , to aggressively promote their interests , and undermine open access .
These closed journals are hardly the kind of people whose pockets you would want to line .
Reed -Elsevier , for example , is one of the largest academic journal publishers in the world - they even own the Lancet - and they are the same company that runs the DSEI international arms fair in London , at which vile weapons are sold to murderous regimes for cash profit extracted from very real suffering and pain , in countries you will never visit on holiday .
These people do not deserve our charity , and I will be very pleased to see you outside DSEI later this year , 300th copper from the left : because when you are so wrong you need police , security , wire fences , and the pitbull of PR to defend you , then you know you 're in trouble .

Most octopi squirt thick clouds of black ink to confuse predators .
This video from a Japanese TV quiz show , however , shows a type of Tremoctopus , or blanket octopus ( murasakidako in Japanese ) , employing a different technique .
The video explains that when threatened , the octopus unfurls a giant sheet of webbing that trails behind like a cape .
The webbing breaks apart rather easily when attacked -- much like a lizard 's tail -- and it gets wrapped around the predator 's face , giving the octopus a chance to flee .
Body Language :
In state of flirting
Researches have found that there is a direct relation between the states of feeling that we experience and our gestures .
For example if you felt happy then your body will take certain gestures that are different than the gestures it will take if you were feeling sad .
So If you managed to know the gesture associated with a certain emotional state you will be able to detect the presence of this emotional state .
The same goes for flirting because it ’s just an emotional state , if you knew the body posture and the body language changes associated with the state of flirting you will easily know if someone is trying to flirt with you .
Flirting Signs and Gestures
Whether you find them strange or whether you find it hard to believe in them still they are clear signs of flirting .
These signs does not represent my opinion about flirting body language but they are proven facts .
I am not asking you to believe in them without testing them but all I 'm asking you is to test them and see for yourself .
Here the body language flirting signs :
Pupil size :
When someone sees something or someone that he likes his pupil size gets bigger !!
I know that this is a bit hard to notice but by training you will be able to detect these slight changes in the pupil size and so know if someone likes seeing you .
: When someone sees something or someone that he likes his pupil size gets bigger !!
I know that this is a bit hard to notice but by training you will be able to detect these slight changes in the pupil size and so know if someone likes seeing you .
Playing with her hair :
This sign is for girls only .
When a girl wants to flirt with someone or when she finds him particularly interesting she may start to play with her hair ( twist it or flicker it ) .
This could happen once or several times during the conversation ; the more the sign happens the clearer the message is !!

This could happen once or several times during the conversation ; the more the sign happens the clearer the message is !!
Pointing towards you with his toes or feet :
If someone was interested in you and if he was n't sitting right next to you then he will point directly towards you using his feet or toes .
A clearer flirting sign is when he sits with his body totally facing you .
: If someone was interested in you and if he was n't sitting right next to you then he will point directly towards you using his feet or toes .
A clearer flirting sign is when he sits with his body totally facing you .
Seeing his / her teeth through the smile :
A smile should be wide enough to reveal at least the front teeth otherwise it may be a fake smile or a smile that has nothing to do with you .
: A smile should be wide enough to reveal at least the front teeth otherwise it may be a fake smile or a smile that has nothing to do with you .
Keeping you in his / her line of sight :
The person who is flirting with you will try to keep you in his line of sight
As a result you may find him taking a look at you every now and then or you may find him continuously orienting himself to be facing you even if he is standing with someone else .

Clothing :
The person will generally pick his favorite clothes and wear them if he believed that he will possibly see you .
You could ask him about his favorite colors and observe whether he wears them a lot when you 're around or not .
Body language and attractiveness
In my book , How to make someone fall in love with you i explained how you can use such signs to increase the chance of making someone fall in love with you .
By being able to read these signs then use other ones that can make you appear more attractive your chance of attracting someone is going to be much easier .
Many More Signs
The urge to flirt means that the person found you interesting and that ’s why I strongly recommend reading the section about the state of being interested .
In addition to the above signs you can use the signs of interest to make sure that the person really is flirting with you .
2 knowmyself is , without doubt , the only complete guide to body language on the entire internet .

Hundreds of Psychology Videos
I ’ve always loved reading the Google Zeitgeist report -- a cumulative snapshot of popular queries that reveal a bit about the current human psyche .
Elin Nordegren , the Swedish model who became Tiger Woods ’ wife , topped last week ’s list of the 15 top - gaining search queries , and this week it ’s none other than Dallas Cowboy Terrell Owens who ’s been all over the news lately .
Recently , we tried something similar with books from the Google Books Partner Program .
No Swedish supermodels or controversial wide receivers in sight .
Among the most viewed books are a translation of the Holy Qu’ran , a bestseller about geopolitics , a book on healing by a Nepalese spiritualist , and a textbook about how to build a robot .
For me , the most notable characteristic of our top 10 is that , aside from one title , the list bears little resemblance to bestseller lists .
Rather , it includes both current and backlist titles , reflecting the rich diversity of readers ’ interests .
So without further ado , here ’s our list of most - viewed English language books supplied by our publisher partners for the week of September 17th through 23rd :

The notorious Chupacabras may be back in the Everglades again reopening the debate over whether they are real , imagined , from outer space , heaven - sent harbingers of a New Covenant or did they augur an auspicious but erroneous omen for the Bears in Super Bowl XLI ?
At least one local astrologer thought so .
In Amazing Updates , a Hong Kong electronics heir ditches a run for the US Congress in order to pursue Britney Spears and On this Date in Amazing History Edna Everage misses her first chance to meet the Queen .
Allegedly first sighted in Puerto Rico in the summer of 1995 , no rumored creature in recent memory has caused quite as much stir and media hyperventilation ( in Latin markets at least ) as the notorious Chupacabra or goat - sucking demon .
Breathless reports about " beasts which drained the blood of goats " , made by the San Juan tabloid El Vocero , were quickly followed by similar manifestations in Mexico , the Florida Everglades and even Brazil .
The " creatures " were variously reported as walking on two - legs , having bat - like - wings and fearsome dentition or curved fangs .
Further accounts mentioned reptilian skin , spines or quills on the back , muscular arms , hands with three fingers and a thumb tipped by thick sharp claws , large red eyes , many sharp teeth and a long tongue or extractor .
CHUPACABRA by Ricardo Pustanio
Low - budget Mexican and US filmmakers , always on the look - out for fast - buck monsters , lost no time in transferring the " terrifying " beasts to the cinema and video screen , churning out a total of eleven productions since 1995 : Ataca el chupacabras ( 1996 ) ; El Chupacabras , ( 1996 ) ; Adventures Beyond : Chupacabra ( 1997 ) ; Guns of El Chupacabra ( 1997 ) aka " Chupacabra , El " - USA ( working title ) ; Legend of the Chupacabra ( 2000 ) ; Chupacabras ( 2000 ) ; El Chupacabra ( 2003 ) ; Bloodthirst : Legend of the Chupacabras ( 2003 ) ; Bloodthirst 2 : Revenge of the Chupacabras ( 2005 ) ; Night of the Chupacabra ( 2005 ) Chupacabra Terror ( 2005 ) aka " Chupacabra : Dark Seas " - USA ( TV title ) .
In most depictions , excepting a 1997 " documentary , " the chupas are clearly portrayed as a menace to humans , even slaughtering passengers on a ship .
Yet in the " real - life " testimonies and evidence compiled to date , the chupa victims have all been livestock or household pets .
Then again who would pay good money to watch a movie about a terrified goat or an imperiled parakeet ?
In his latest foray into the case , psychic detective Herschel Gomez once again called in his distinguished relative , Dr. Domingo Dombrowski , widely noted for being the first scholar to receive an advanced degree in Chupacabrology from Puerto Rico 's Instituto de Cryptozoologia de Caguas , 1974 ( formerly the Caguas College of Applied Phrenology ) .
Dombrowski , who now resides near Orlando , FL is the same researcher who solved the celebrated 1960 " Bat Monsters of Bayamon " controversy ( a hoax ) and the sensational 1963 case of the " Cataño Fairy " ( a runaway juvenile midget from the touring Nicaraguan side - show El Circo de Tacho ) .
He claims the earliest " chupacabra " sightings actually date back to the 1600s when Taino Indians still lived on Puerto Rico .
The name , he says , derives from a Spanish approximation of an Arawak dialect ( aboriginal ) appellation .

Together Gomez and Dombrowski first visited a West Everglades site in 1996 where four eviscerated goats were discovered over the Easter Weekend .
Dombrowski dismisses the notion that the chupacabras were either dogs ( the opinion of local zoo officials ) or creatures from outer space .
Nor does he believe that they have recently migrated to Florida from Puerto Rico .
" As stated in my 1974 work , The Chupacabra Chronicles of Las Casas , it is my firm opinion that these are hybrid creatures that have existed in the Caribbean basin since the earliest days of the Spanish conquest .
The Chupacabra , " affirms Dombrowski , " is probably a centuries - old cross between a now extinct species of South American lemur and a Malaysian flying fox ( fruit bat ) introduced to the region by Catalonian sailors previously stationed in the Philippines . "
Elsewhere this past year , the first chupacabra sightings were reported in Central Russia where the creatures were said to be feeding on turkeys .
In Turkey , where no chupas have turned up yet , turkeys are called hindi implying they come from India .
Although there have been no chupas reported on the sub - continent , some researchers now think the 2001 case of the Monkey Man of New Delhi bears renewed examination .
Meanwhile , fresh reports of Everglades sightings have excited Reverend Emiliano Chong - McGillicuddie , a South American clergyman who eleven years ago first proclaimed sightings of the chupacabras to be " apparitions intimately connected with world changes and the spiritual reawakening foretold by so many visionaries including Edgar Cayce and Madame Blavatsky . "
Chong - McGillicuddie , formerly Pastor of the Asemblea Espiritista Carismatica de Medellin , Colombia , had just announced that a new congregation -- Iglesia Adventista Chupacabrista -- was formed in the port city of Barranquilla to propound a revised cosmology in which the " divine chupas " were the heavenly harbingers of a New Order " in which the Lion shall not only lie down with the Lamb but the Goat shall hang out with the Bat . "
Chong -McGillicuddie spent three days in Virginia Beach in December 1995 pouring over the Cayce archives for possible references to the chupacabra apparitions .
Based on his research -- correlating certain Cayce readings with six key Nostradamus quatrains -- the pastor had concluded that the chupacabra phenomenon signaled the New Advent of Planetary Salvation .
Rev. Chong notes that the letters in " Chupacabrista " easily form " CabraChrista " ( Christ - goat ) .
He plans to lead a party of his followers to the Everglades later this Spring in hopes of a revelatory sighting .
Finally , Herschel Gomez 's young nephew Hamish Gomez insists that the most recent chupa appearances were also an omen for the SuperBowl XLI being played in a stadium not far from the Everglades itself and where livestock - devouring creatures were first reported in 1996 .
" Look , " says Hamish , an avid astrologer like his uncle , " the Bears secured their conference title earlier this month under Capricorn , the Sign of the Goat .
Chicago is a city famous for its stockyards and it was once burned to the ground by a cow ! "
" Not only that " , adds Hamish , " if you rearrange the letters of the Spanish word " Chupacabrismo " ( meaning Chupacabra - ness more or less ) you get " Chicapo B'ars " .
" Close enough , even for Nostradamus maybe .
But not for Peyton Manning as it turned out much to young Hamish 's considerable embarrassment .
Uncle Herschel also pointed out that the Colts won their conference title under the Goat as well .
The Chupacabras , for their part , have no comment .
And those unfortunates who bet heavily on Chicago turned out to be the biggest suckers of all .

Paul Krugman exposes the theocratic infiltration of the Bush administration :
Today , Regent University , founded by the televangelist Pat Robertson to provide “ Christian leadership to change the world , ” boasts that it has 150 graduates working in the Bush administration .
Unfortunately for the image of the school , where Mr. Robertson is chancellor and president , the most famous of those graduates is Monica Goodling , a product of the university ’s law school .
She ’s the former top aide to Alberto Gonzales who appears central to the scandal of the fired U.S. attorneys and has declared that she will take the Fifth rather than testify to Congress on the matter .
The infiltration of the federal government by large numbers of people seeking to impose a religious agenda — which is very different from simply being people of faith — is one of the most important stories of the last six years .
It ’s also a story that tends to go underreported , perhaps because journalists are afraid of sounding like conspiracy theorists .
But this conspiracy is no theory .
The official platform of the Texas Republican Party pledges to “ dispel the myth of the separation of church and state . ”
And the Texas Republicans now running the country are doing their best to fulfill that pledge .
So much have what we 've been saying gets dismissed as just conspiratorial thinking .
But , we 've been right .
It 's happening with the theocrats .
And , they do want to impose their religious agenda .
Anyone who criticizes them is deemed anti-religious , but that 's not true .
The theocrats want to control our lives .
They hate , but are yet oddly obsessed with , gay people .
They want to prevent contraception .
Yes , birth control .
That 's not a whacked out conspiracy ... it's a frightening reality .

If you are physically attractive and dress in such a way to grab the attention of attractive males , you will also grab the attention of us unattractive males .
I 'm sorry you 're attractive though I am not .
Believe me , it is probably as hard for me as it is for you .
It is n't like I did n't sometimes wish I was some hot dude with whom you would make out at some shitty party with bad music .
But just so you know , you were showing a lot of cleavage on the escalator at Barnes and Noble today and even though I was n't the guy you wanted to attract , I like boobs just like he does .
Now do n't get me wrong , I 'm not the creepy guys .
I know how to look at some boobs without staring or showing up in your driveway , but if you catch me checking you out please do n't look so pissed off .
What if I knew some hot dude and was about to point him in your direction but changed my mind because now you seem like a bitch ?
Bet you did n't think of that while buying that short skirt did you ?
Please do n't think I 'm asking you to become the chick in the bar who is a little ugly and past her prime who wants any and all guys to stare at her and have endless conversations about sexuality like that one time in college when she totally made out with some chick at a party and a whole bunch of frat guys got boners .
I 'm just saying , if you go fishing do n't get mad if you catch a boot , or a tin can , or even maybe some seaweed .
It ’s normally not a good idea , while driving your car merrily down the freeway , to shoot at someone in another nearby vehicle just because they kinda pissed you off .
Let ’s just say it ’s not good form .
But that ’s exactly what a Detroit woman did here recently , apparently because she was being tailgated and was scared the guy was trying to drive her off the road .
At least that ’s what she says and , to be honest , I do n’t have that much reason to doubt her .
I ’ve been driving in Detroit for going on 15 years , and after having driven for lengthy periods of time in two other crazy driver cities ( Los Angeles , Fort Lauderdale ) I can say with confidence that we are much better at scaring the hell out of each other on the road .
For this to be the city that introduced the mass - produced vehicle to the world , it always amazes me that we still have n’t learned how to drive the damned things yet .
We just step on the gas and expect MFs to move out our damned way .
If you do n’t know how to ‘ bogart ’ in Detroit , you wo n’t last long .
But back to this woman .
OK , so she decides it ’s OK to fire a loaded weapon on a freeway to get a guy off her tail .
I can respect her fear , especially as a woman alone in a vehicle wondering what some crazy male has in mind .
A woman does have to be careful , and a woman definitely needs to know how to protect herself out here .
It ’s not the Wild Wild West as some would like to portray it , but it is still a big city , even if we are shrinking at the speed of light .
But self - protection has its limits .
There are rules for just about everything .
Rule # 1 : If you feel your life may be in danger , do n’t take out everybody in the surrounding area .
Assuming that this woman is not a professional hitwoman or a heavily - decorated military sharpshooter , it ’s terrifyingly easy to imagine a potential could - have - happened - instead disaster where the woman misses and the bullet crashes through someone else ’s passenger - side window and kills a young child .
Somebody tell me how she will explain this ‘ accident ’ as justifiable to the grieving mother ?
Or what if someone else saw the gun – or flash of gunfire – panicked , swerved reflexively , and caused a massive car crash that results in numerous deaths and injuries ?
Once again ; where is the script for the acceptable “ this is why Mommie wo n’t be coming home for dinner ” explanation ?
Here ’s the thing , and it ’s really not that complicated ; if we ’re going to live together in this city , we need to keep our fear factor in check .
It ’s OK to be afraid , and it ’s Basic Urban Intelligence 101 to stay on your guard , but there ’s no need to hunt bunny rabbits with machine guns , you know what I ’m sayin ’ ?
Let ’s just take a deep breath , keep things in proportion , and dial it down a bit , all right ?
We ’re cruising into summertime , festival season is about to kick into gear , the weather is like one big kiss on the cheek , and we need to squeeze every livin ’ drop of enjoyment out of this if it kills us .
OK .
Bad choice of words .
But you get my point , right ?
Look , I know reports are coming out saying we ’re about to slide off the face of the earth , nobody can get a job , and those who have jobs are losing them .
But believe it or not this is n’t the time to panic .
This is the time to become more calm than we ’ve ever been because being calm , thoughtful , analytical , and methodical is the only way we ’re going to get through this .
So do n’t ride all up on that car ’s bumper ( like I usually do ) , and do n’t pull a gun on somebody just because that fool cut you off and he ’s driving an ugly car ( which I do n’t usually do but have seriously considered once or twice ) .
It ’s time to expel winter , breathe summer , and cherish each and every opportunity to smile while we figure out how to create many more such opportunities .
And always remember : survival in Detroit is a growth industry .

Jobs ,
Dell share stage
Last week it was the music labels , this week it was teacher unions .
Apple cofounder and CEO Steve Jobs on Friday spared no words in criticizing the state of public schools and the teacher unions , saying that schools were never likely to improve until principals could fire bad teachers .
The Associated Press notes that Jobs shared the stage with rival CEO Michael Dell to deliver their vision of technology in classrooms .
Jobs , who is known to be quite intolerant of what he calls incompetence at his own company , touted a text - book free classroom , but reiterated that no amount of technology in the classroom would improve public schools until principals could fire bad teachers .
The report says that Jobs ' words were quite strong , noting that the Apple and Pixar CEO " lambasted " teacher unions and likened schools to businesses with principals serving as CEOs .
Teacher unions , he said , that the unions have directly contributed demise of public education .
" What kind of person could you get to run a small business if you told them that when they came in they could n't get rid of people that they thought were n't any good ? " he asked .
" Not really great ones because if you 're really smart you go , ' I can't win . ' "
Jobs ' comments reportedly drew loud applause during an education reform conference , but while Jobs ' comments seemed to be drawing support from the crowd , Dell 's CEO , who has previously taken swipes at Apple , sat quietly with his hands folded in his lap .
Jobs , however , continued despite the potential repercussions faced the Cupertino - based company when negotiating future California contracts .
" I believe that what is wrong with our schools in this nation is that they have become unionized in the worst possible way , " Jobs said .
" This unionization and lifetime employment of K - 12 teachers is off - the - charts crazy . "
" Apple just lost some business in this state , I 'm sure , " Jobs admitted .
Dell , who recently took back the reins as CEO of Dell , responded that unions were created because " the employer was treating his employees unfairly and that was not good .
" So now you have these enterprises where they take good care of their people .
The employees won , they do really well and succeed . "
The report says Dell also blamed problems in public schools on the lack of a competitive job market for principals .
Previously , Jobs outlined his vision for textbook - free schools in the future , the report said .
Textbooks , he claimed , would be replaced with a free , online information source that was constantly updated by experts , much like the online encyclopedia Wikipedia .
" I think we'd have far more current material available to our students and we'd be freeing up a tremendous amount of funds that we could buy delivery vehicles with - computers , faster Internet , things like that , " Jobs said .
" And I also think we'd get some of the best minds in the country contributing . "
Comcast has decided to challenge the Federal Communications Commission 's " unofficial " cap on cable system ownership .
In a filing earlier this month , Comcast criticized the FCC 's 30 percent horizontal ownership cap , saying that limits on how many subscribers a given cable operator can service are no longer necessary .
In 1992 , the FCC tweaked its cable - ownership regulations in response to a law passed by Congress .
Concerned that cable networks would have too few distribution outlets if there was insufficient competition among cable providers , the FCC ruled that a cable company could serve no more than 30 percent of homes passed by cable companies in the US .
Later that decade , the FCC changed its measurement metric , deciding to drop the homes - passed measurement and decreeing that no single cable operator could serve over 30 percent of all cable subscribers in the US .
The FCC 's limit was challenged in court , and in 2001 , a federal court overturned the limit and directed the FCC to come up with a new set of metrics .
Instead of coming up with new criteria , however , the FCC has continued to enforce the 30 percent limit for mergers .
Comcast is hit hardest by the FCC 's rules , as its 26.2 million subscribers account for just over 28 percent of the 96.8 million US residents with cable or satellite TV service .
Comcast : Times have changed
As required by the 1996 Telecommunications Act , the FCC is currently reviewing its media ownership rules .
Those rules cover not only cable systems , but TV stations , radio stations , and newspapers as well .
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin has indicated that he might be willing to spin off discussion of cable providers into a separate track .
In its filing , Comcast says that the rationale for limiting ownership no longer applies .
Calling it a " relic that cannot be justified , " Comcast says that " continuing , rapid development of competition in the video marketplace " obviate the need for ownership caps .
The cable company points to the proliferation of video services on the Internet , over mobile phones , peer - to - peer , and video - on - demand services , as well as multicast TV broadcasters as evidence that cable , satellite , and broadcast networks have several means available to reach viewers .
" These new sources of video content have two major effects on the marketplace , " Comcast argues .
" First , they represent sources of fierce competition to cable operators .
Second , and most importantly for this proceeding , they represent massive growth in the number and type of available platforms for the distribution of video programming , which have the effect of unleashing an unprecedented ' flow of video programming ' to consumers . "
Is TV like broadband ?
The bigger question is whether further consolidation of the cable industry would benefit consumers .
So far , the FCC 's moves towards deregulation have arguably had a negative impact on consumers , especially when it comes to broadband .
With the deregulation of DSL and cable Internet , consumers now have fewer choices for broadband .
As a result , the US badly lags behind many western European and Asian countries when it comes to broadband availability , speed , and price .
Can the same be said of television ?
As is the case with broadband , competition is between modes of service ( e.g. , cable vs. satellite ) than between providers themselves .
In most US towns and cities , cable providers have exclusive franchise agreements that give them the exclusive right to offer programming within municipal boundaries ( or in some cases , neighborhood boundaries ) .
As a result , customers who want something more than over - the - air television programming can choose between a single cable provider and sometimes two satellite providers .
That situation is slowly changing for some people in Verizon and AT&T 's service areas as they roll out their fiber networks and begin offering television programming , but the two telecoms will be hard pressed to pass 30 million homes with their new services by the end of the decade .
There are some important differences between broadband and television , however .
As Comcast pointed out , consumers have other means of accessing TV programming .
Fans of Desperate Housewives and other ABC shows can now view episodes online after the shows have aired .
Shows are also available for download from the iTunes Store and other places online and some TV fans have succeeded in " replacing " cable TV with broadband , BitTorrent , and a media center PC .
It 's apparent that the cable television industry faces new challenges from the Internet and other areas .
That said , it is not clear how giving a big thumbs - up to consolidation in the cable industry will benefit consumers in the slightest .

( The classical electron diameter is bigger than the proton diameter because the proton 's size was measured in the nucleus , where it is trapped in a very deep , narrow potential well .
The electron is in a comparatively wide , shallow well , so it takes up much more space .
Talking about the sizes of subatomic particles is fairly meaningless anyway ; in one sense , electrons and protons are point particles , with no size .
And in quantum mechanics , we can only talk about the probability of finding a particle at a particular point , and cannot specify ( or define ) the exact position and size of a particle .
The " classical electron radius " tells us little about the actual physical size of the electron .
In short , I 'm oversimplifying things . )

Nice or Cold ?
Being very nice one day and ignoring you the other day is one of the strongest sings of attraction .
The logic behind this is very simple , at the beginning the person treats you very nicely because he likes you but when he realizes that he has done too much effort without receiving a response he starts to pull back .
This person might say to himself something like " Oh my God , I showed lots of signs today that shows that i am interested in her but I still did n't get a response , tomorrow I should totally ignore her " .
So when you find someone being nice one day and cold the other day then know that the positive signs he showed resulted from the positive emotions he has towards you and that the negative signs were given just to cover his tracks

Where Are You ?
Finally the person who loves you will try to keep you within his line of sight and each now and then he will take a look at you to make sure that you are still there .
This sign can work the other way too if you kept looking someone in the eye for extended periods of time you might let him fall in love with you .
In my book How to make someone fall in love with you i said that falling in love is experienced when certain hormones are released into the body , if you managed to force the release of these hormones in someone 's body then he might be fooled into thinking that he actually loves you .
And guess what , looking into his eyes for extended periods can do this !!

A place for me to vent only slightly less pointless than in the comment sections of other blogs .
i.e .
[ T] hree Republicans — Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , Olympia Snowe of Maine and Mike DeWine of Ohio — are expected to join with the Democrats on the committee to vote to demand more information about the secret eavesdropping program from the White House and intelligence agencies .
The Intelligence Committee ’s meeting on March 7th presents an important credibility test for Senator Frist and Senator Roberts .
If both are serious about their desire to let this committee perform its duties , Chairman Roberts will keep his word and permit the committee to conduct a vote on Senator Rockefeller ’s reasonable proposal to review the Administration ’s controversial domestic spying program .
. . . .
Attorney General Gonzales ’ letter to the Senate yesterday is the latest demonstration of how the Administration ’s shifting rationale for this program has raised concerns that are causing members on both sides of the aisle to request a full and complete investigation .
I understand that the Chairman has reversed himself again , and has promised a vote for March 7th .
This vote will be a critical test of whether this Republican - controlled Congress can conduct critical oversight of the Bush Administration , the intelligence community , and a Bush Administration surveillance program that has raised many legitimate concerns .
While I appreciate the Chairman ’s commitment to this vote occurring on March 7th , further procedural maneuvers to delay or prevent reasonable and thorough oversight by the Intelligence Committee on the Administration ’s handling of pre-war intelligence or the NSA matter would be a troubling development that would require the attention of the full Senate .
I am increasingly concerned that the Senate Intelligence Committee is unable to its critically important oversight and threat assessment responsibilities due to stifling partisanship that is exhibited by repeated calls by Democrats on the Committee to conduct politically - motivated investigations .
. . .
I would propose that we meet with Senators Roberts and Rockefeller as soon as possible .
The Committee was established and structured to reflect the Senate ’s desire for bipartisanship , and to the maximum extent possible , nonpartisan oversight of our nation ’s intelligence activities .
If attempts to use the committee ’s charter for political purposes exist , we may have to simply acknowledge that nonpartisan oversight , while a worthy aspiration , is simply not possible .
If we are unable to reach agreement , I believe we must consider other options to improve the Committee ’s oversight capabilities , to include restructuring the Committee so that it is organized and operated like most Senate Committees .
Created pursuant to S. Res. 400 , 94th Congress : to oversee and make continuing studies of the intelligence activities and programs of the United States Government , and to submit to the Senate appropriate proposals for legislation and report to the Senate concerning such intelligence activities and programs .
In carrying out this purpose , the Select Committee on Intelligence shall make every effort to assure that the appropriate departments and agencies of the United States provide informed and timely intelligence necessary for the executive and legislative branches to make sound decisions affecting the security and vital interests of the Nation .
It is further the purpose of this resolution to provide vigilant legislative oversight over the intelligence activities of the United States to assure that such activities are in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States .
Rule 6 actually permits the vice chairman to authorize a committee investigation .
Rule 7 actually permits the vice chairman to issue a subpoena .
Rule 8 actually permits the vice chairman to authorize witness interrogation by committee staff .
Rule 11 requires staff members brief both majority and minority members , which means there are no secrets from the minority .
These authorities and privileges enjoyed by the vice chairman illustrate clearly the unique nature of this committee and the importance of these authorities in maintaining its nonpartisan nature .
The unique bipartisan nature of this committee is its greatest strength and is essential to the ability of the committee to develop a consensus product and to avoid all of the politics of our Nation 's intelligence activities .
. . .
The legislative record reflects that the Senators who really created the Intelligence Committee believed -- this is so important -- that the less partisan nature of the committee would serve to make the intelligence community more willing to keep the Congress fully and currently informed of highly sensitive intelligence activity .
For a quarter of a century , this has permitted the committee to fulfill its primary responsibility :
Oversight of the intelligence activities of the United States Government .
My 6 years on the committee tell me that is absolutely true .
What was the rationale for the necessity of the secret order ?
If the actions in the secret order were believed to be necessary , why was there no request to change the existing statutory law or for a new law ?
What limitations , if any , on spying on U.S. citizens were included in the secret order ?
What was done with any information collected on U.S. citizens pursuant to such secret order ?
Are there any other secret orders relating to spying on U.S. citizens ?
UPDATE
UPDATE II
House Republican leaders tightened their control over the ethics committee yesterday by ousting its independent - minded chairman , appointing a replacement who is close to them and adding two new members who donated to the legal defense fund of House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( R - Tex . ) .
Rep. Joel Hefley ( R - Colo. ) , who clashed with DeLay so often that they barely spoke and was considered wayward by other leaders , was replaced yesterday with Rep. Richard Hastings ( R - Wash . ) .
Hastings has carried out other sensitive leadership assignments and is known as a favorite of Speaker J. Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) , who made the decision .
Hefley said in an interview yesterday that he believes he was removed because he was too independent .
He said there is " a bad perception out there that there was a purge in the committee and that people were put in that would protect our side of the aisle better than I did . "
The Senate Intelligence Committee was created in 1976 and , from the beginning , it has been unique in its structure and operation .
Due to the urgency of ensuring that our country has nonpartisan and non-politicized oversight over the Government ’s intelligence activities , the Intelligence Committee is structured so that -- unlike every other Senate Committee -- the majority is unable to dominate the Committee ’s operation and agenda , and the minority has much greater powers than it does on any other Senate Committee .
With the March 7 vote looming on Sen .
Rockefeller ’s motion for the Committee to finally hold hearings to investigate the scope and nature of the Administration ’s NSA warrantless eavesdropping on American citizens -- and with several Committee Republicans indicating their intent to vote for hearings -- Majority Leader Bill Frist threatened the Committee yesterday and warned it not to hold any hearings .
Frist specifically threatened that if the Committee holds NSA hearings , he will fundamentally change the 30 - year - old structure and operation of the Senate Intelligence Committee so as to make it like every other Committee , , controlled and dominated by Republicans to advance and rubber - stamp the White House ’s agenda rather than exercise meaningful and nonpartisan oversight .
Yet again , Republicans are threatening to radically change long - standing rules for how our government operates all because they cannot manipulate the result they want .
From redistricting games to changing the filibuster rules , when Republicans are incapable ( even with their majorities ) of manipulating the political result they want , they use their majority status to change how our government works in order to ensure the desired political outcome .
While Frist ’s threat here is , in one sense , of a piece with those tactics , it is actually quite extraordinary and motivated by a particularly corrupt objective .
The whole purpose of the Senate Intelligence Committee – the only reason why it exists – is to exercise oversight over controversial intelligence activities .
Whatever else one might want to say about the NSA warrantless eavesdropping program , it is controversial on every front .
There is no conceivable rationale for the Intelligence Committee not to hold hearings .
It would be an extraordinary abdication of the responsibility owed to Americans by the Intelligence Committee for it not to investigate the Administration ’s warrantless eavesdropping program – a program which scores of prominent politicians and scholars from across the political spectrum have condemned as being legally dubious at best , and which polls show a majority of Americans oppose and believe is illegal .
This is what happened :
After publicly pledging to hold NSA hearings , Committee Chair Pat Roberts refused to allow a scheduled vote to take place on February 16 because , according to reports , at least two and perhaps three Committee Republicans ( Snowe , Hagel and DeWine ) were prepared to vote for Sen .
Rockefeller ’s motion to hold hearings .
As Newsweek reported before the scheduled February 16 vote : The vote was pushed off until March 7 , and it now appears highly likely that Rockefeller ’s motion has the support of a majority on the Committee .
As a result , Bush Congressional allies are in high gear trying to do anything -- and the right word is " anything " -- to block these hearings .
On March 1 , Harry Reid wrote a letter to Bill Frist , which was released by Reid ’s office yesterday , demanding that Sen .
Roberts allow a vote on Rockefeller 's motion to hold NSA hearings and threatening to bring the matter to the full Senate if Roberts again blocks an up - or - down vote on the motion ( h/t Metarhyme ) :
In response , Sen .
Frist yesterday wrote a truly amazing letter ( .pdf ) to Reid expressly threatening to radically re-structure the Senate Intelligence Committee if the Committee votes to hold NSA hearings :
These are truly desperate and extreme measures to block an investigation of the President ’s conduct .
Sen .
First is literally threatening the Committee not to exercise oversight over the President ’s warrantless eavesdropping on Americans .
The Senate Intelligence Committee was created 30 years ago to perform exactly this oversight function – to investigate our government 's intelligence activities .
Here is how the Committee itself describes its purpose Since the Committee ’s inception , a consensus has existed among both parties that the unique rules of the Committee – which provide a much greater balance of power between the majority and minority in order to ensure that intelligence oversight is not politicized – is critical to the Committee ’s ability to exercise meaningful oversight .
That – meaningful oversight – is what Frist is threatening to abolish unless the Committee caves in to Frist ’s thuggish demands that the President ’s warrantless spying on Americans not be investigated .
Here is Pat Roberts himself , in a speech on the floor of the Senate on January 14 , 2003 , detailing the unique balance in Committee Rules between the parties and emphasizing the critical importance of this structure for the Committee 's fulfillment of its oversight duties :
Marvel at the desperate and truly radical means which Frist is invoking in order to block an investigation into the Administration 's warrantless eavesdropping program .
To threaten to abolish the 30 - year - old consensus for how the Senate Intelligence Committee functions – all in order to protect the Bush Administration from scrutiny and oversight – is truly extraordinary , and is unquestionably the conduct of individuals who are seeking to prevent scrutiny in order to conceal wrongdoing .
Such threats are particularly unfathomable in light of the fact that the motion for hearings will pass According to Committee Member Barbara Mikulski , the questions which the Committee ’s hearings would explore include : Especially in light of the retractions via " clarification " by Alberto Gonzales of significant portions of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee , and in light of the increasingly compelling evidence that there are other warrantless eavesdropping programs aimed at Americans , what possible rationale could exist for the Intelligence Committee not to have hearings on these questions ?
How can there be any action taken by the Senate with regard to NSA issues unless it knows the answers to these basic questions ?
And how can Americans possibly assess the propriety of our Government ’s eavesdropping activities if we do not even know what the scope and purpose of these programs are ?
And should n’t our country ’s journalists be reporting on Frist ’s extraordinary threats , and should n’t they be finding out why Bill Frist would go to such extreme lengths in order to block this investigation ?
For an Administration with nothing to hide on this NSA scandal , these certainly are rather extreme efforts being exerted to block an investigation . :
The ineptitude , sloth and confusion of our national journalists is sometimes so extreme that it 's actually hard to believe .
Here is an AP article , published by CBS News ( h/t David Shaughnessy ) , which reports on the exchange of letters between Reid and Frist but never even mentions , let alone highlights , the only newsworthy aspect of the exchange -- that Frist threatened to re-structure the Intelligence Committee to block the NSA hearings .
Instead , the AP and CBS simply copy the claim in Frist 's letter , base the headline on it , and then blindly recite it as the lede .
Thus , the headline of the article is " GOP : Politics Blocking Survey of Spy Units . "
And the first paragraph of the article simply copies Frist 's point and " reports " as follows : " Stifling partisanship is preventing the Senate Intelligence Committee from overseeing the nation 's spy agencies , the Senate 's Republican leadership says . "
Frist 's purported concern over the way in which " politics " is preventing the Committee from engaging in meaningful oversight is nothing short of hilarious .
There is no oversight from the Intelligence Committee because Pat Roberts uses it to rubber - stamp everything the Administration does .
And Frist is trying to block meaningful oversight by preventing NSA hearings designed to investigate the eavesdropping program -- hearings that have bipartisan support on the Committee .
That 's just obvious ( but not mentioned in the article ) .
Frist 's claim that he wants to block the NSA hearings in order to ensure that the Committee can engage in meaningful oversight is as Orwellian an example of up - is - downism as you will find .
But you certainly would n't know that from the AP article or from CBS News , which " neutrally " mold the article 's headline and first paragraph to fit Frist 's facially deceitful claim , and then worse , never even mention the only newsworthy part of the whole episode . :
Several people have raised the question of what mechanism Frist would have to use in order to " re-structure " the Committee .
Presumably , the full Senate has the power to change the Rules of the Committee , since it enacted those Rules in the first place .
But an additional option is simply to change the composition of the Committee by removing the dissident GOP members ( Snowe and Hagel ) and replacing them with more cooperative Senators who will helpfully vote against an investigation .
From what I can discern from the rather cryptic Rules ( .pdf ) for Senate Committee Assignments ( see page CRS - 7 for " non - A Committees , " which includes Intelligence ) , membership assignments are at the discretion of the Majority Leader .
Lest anyone believe that removing Committee members is too extreme a step to take , let us recall this little sordid episode Bush allies are in desperation mode for covering - up their eavesdropping conduct .
No reasonable person could doubt that something like this would be beyond what Frist is considering when he says he " must consider other options to improve the Committee ’s oversight capabilities , to include restructuring the Committee . "
According to Fox , Psychic Sylvia Brown told Shawn Hornbeck 's parents he was dead one month after he was kidnapped .
This makes the second high profile case she has blundered recently .
Hornbeck 's parents claim Brown was trying to bilk them out of money to continue the search .
Imagine that .
A Funny Little Story About The Media
Some time ago , while witnessing the blathering about Valerie Plame , Karl Rove , Judith Miller , Matt Cooper , etc. , Digby asked this :
... is it normal that members of the press know the answer to a major mystery but they withhold it , as a group , from the public ?
Based on my own experience , I 'd say the answer to Digby 's question is : yes .
I grew up in the Washington area and went to school with lots of children of government and media types .
Then I went to Yale , which is also full of such offspring .
What I saw was that the corporate media — places like the New York Times , Washington Post , the networks , etc. — and government figures are blatantly , brazenly in bed with each other .
And not just metaphorically ; it 's often literally true .
There 's Andrea Mitchell & Alan Greenspan ; James Rubin & Christiane Amanpour ; Judith Miller & a cast of thousands ; and so on .
In any case , whoever they 're shtupping , they share a mindset : the government and corporate media self - consciously see themselves as a governing elite that runs things hand in hand .
That 's why Nicholas Kristof is anxious that if hoi polloi keep calling George Bush a liar , it may make America " increasingly difficult to govern . "
And it's why Katherine Graham famously said this , in a speech at the CIA to new recruits :
" There are some things the general public does not need to know and should n't .
I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets , and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows . "
William Greider explained the perspective of people like Graham and Kristof and their political cuddlebunnies in his book Who Will Tell the People :
In many private quarters of Washington , Alexander Hamilton 's derisive dictum — " The People !
The People is a great beast ! " —has become an operating maxim .
Survival in office requires a political strategy for herding " the beast " in harmless directions or deflecting it from serious matters it may not understand .
Now and then , to the general dismay of political elites , Hamilton 's " beast " breaks loose and tramples the civility of the regular order , though this usually occurs on inflammatory marginal issues that have little to do with the real substance of governing .
Weirdly , in fact , the media may be more invested in the status quo , and more concerned about " the people " going berserk , than actual politicians .
Officeholders come and go , but the Washington Post is eternal .
So anyway , here 's a funny little story illustrating all this :
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen came to talk at Yale in 1988 , just after I arrived .
Following schmancy
Yale tradition , he had tea with a small group of students and then ate dinner with an even smaller group .
I weaseled my way into attending .
Gary
Hart had recently flamed out in the ' 88 presidential race because of Donna Rice .
And at dinner Cohen told all us fresh - faced , ambitious , grotty youths this :
The Washington press corps had specifically tried to push Hart out of the race .
It was n't because Hart had had extramarital affairs — everyone knew this was the norm rather than the exception among politicians .
So Hart was n't at all unusual in this respect .
Instead , Cohen said , it was because the press corps felt that Hart was " weird " and " flaky " and should n't be president .
And when the Donna Rice stuff happened , they saw their opening and went after him .
( I wish I remembered more about what Cohen said about the specific gripe of the press corps with Hart , but I do n't think he revealed many details . )
At the time , I remember thinking this :
1 . How interesting that the DC press corps knows grimy details about lots of politicians but only chooses to tell the great unwashed when they decide it 's appropriate .
2 . How interesting that the DC press corps feels it 's their place to make decisions for the rest of America ; ie , rather than laying out the evidence that Hart was weird , flaky , etc. , and letting Americans decide whether they cared , they decided run -of - the - mill citizens could n't be trusted to make the correct evaluation .
3 . How interesting that Cohen felt it was appropriate to tell all this to a small group of fresh - faced , ambitious , grotty Yale youths , but not to the outside world .
And how interesting that we were being socialized into thinking this was normal .
Now , this does n't mean Gary Hart was n't weird and flaky .
I assume he was .
To me , the desire to be President of the United States in itself means you 're a psychopath who should never be President of the United States .
Unfortunately , of course , this desire is a job requirement .
You have to be Catholic to be Pope , and you have to be dangerous and sick to be president .
But the point is the powerhouse media and their politician lovemates truly do feel there are things normal , grubby Americans simply can't handle .
Moreover , it has nothing to do with political parties .
Everything I 've seen in my life confirms that , with few exceptions , they feel this way across the ( extremely narrow ) political spectrum .
If you 're not part of their little charmed circle , believe me , all your worst suspicions about them are true .
They do think you 're stupid .
They do lie to you .
They do hate and fear you .
Most importantly , they think you can't be trusted with the things they know — because if you did know them , you 'd go nuts and break America .
They are Thomas Jefferson 's aristocrats :
Men by their constitutions are naturally divided into two parties : 1 . Those who fear and distrust the people , and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher classes .
2 . Those who identify themselves with the people , have confidence in them , cherish and consider them as the most honest and safe , although not the most wise depository of the public interests .
In every country these two parties exist , and in every one where they are free to think , speak , and write , they will declare themselves .
Call them , therefore , Liberals and Serviles , Jacobins and Ultras , Whigs and Tories , Republicans and Federalists , Aristocrats and Democrats , or by whatever name you please , they are the same parties still , and pursue the same object .
The last appellation of Aristocrats and Democrats is the true one expressing the essence of all .
Interestingly , in my endless years of school , this Jefferson quote was never once part of the assigned reading .
The Israeli government came under increased pressure today with the publication of a newspaper poll showing that for the first time a majority want Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to resign over perceived failings in his handling of the war with Hizbullah .
A poll in the mass - circulation Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper showed 63 % want Mr Olmert to go .
The defence minister , Amir Peretz , appears even more vulnerable with 74 % calling for his resignation , while 54 % want the chief of staff , Lieutenant General Dan Halutz , to resign as well .
The poll reflects growing disillusionment within Israeli society about the 34 - day conflict with Hizbullah and the fact that the country emerged without any clear victory over the Lebanese militia .
The two Israeli soldiers whose capture triggered the conflict are still not free .
The war claimed the lives of more than 1,100 people in Lebanon , and 157 Israelis , mostly soldiers .
Hundreds of protesters , many of them waving Israeli flags , gathered at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem to call for Mr Olmert 's resignation .
Among them were military reservists who have led criticism of the war as well as Moshe and Riva Moskal , whose son Rafael , a 21 - year - old staff sergeant , was killed in the fighting .
" We think this country deserves better leadership , " said Mrs Moskal .
" The north was bombed and they did n't do anything .
They failed there , they failed here , " she said .
" We feel lost .
We feel there is no leadership and we feel as parents that we lost the most precious thing we had .
" We believe it was our duty to raise a voice of protest .
This beautiful Israeli nation is strong but has values which seem to have been lost in the last few years . "
The crowd at the cemetery gathered around the grave of Golda Meir , the Israeli prime minister forced to resign in April 1974 after a wave of much larger protests over the Yom Kippur war a year earlier .
Some reservists have already held days of demonstrations in Jerusalem , setting up a protest tent close to the Israeli parliament , the Knesset .
Dressed in a T - shirt that read : " Olmert , Peretz , Halutz : take responsibility " , one of the leaders of the protest , 27 - year - old Nir Hirshman , said their complaint was not about shortages of food and water on the battlefield , but strategic questions over the war itself .
" We do n't care about food or water , we care about responsibility , the government 's responsibility , " he said .
" We believe Israel 's strength is in its democracy , its morality .
" The reservists protesting here believe that the battle fought by Israel in Lebanon continues here .
We want the prime minister to resign and then a state commission of inquiry to determine responsibility . "
The test the protestors face is whether their demonstrations will grow large enough to force a change in the government .
Mr Olmert believes he can stay in office and has resisted the idea of a state commission of inquiry to investigate the handling of the war , though he was expected to consider the issue again at a cabinet meeting on Sunday .
The newspaper poll suggests , however , that many Israelis are looking elsewhere for new leaders .
Politicians from the right , like Binyamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman , were some way ahead of Mr Olmert in a list of those considered most suitable to be prime minister .
The responses show the rightwing Likud party would probably come out top in an election now and Mr Olmert 's centrist Kadima party would slip back .
A total of 74 % of those polled rated Mr Olmert 's war - time performance as " not good " .
" Ladies and gentleman : an upheaval , " the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper wrote in a report about its poll .
" Upheaval is not the word .
Earthquake would be more suitable to describe the condition of the Olmert government 110 days after its term of office began . "

Fourteen
It 's the 14th anniversary of this blog , so here 's my annual navel - gazing post marking the day .
I do n’t believe in new year ’s resolutions .
People set themselves all kinds of unrealistic challenges beginning January 1st , mostly about lifestyles or diets or exercise , and so little of this is sustainable or achievable ( or even , a good thing to do … ) .
I also do n’t partake in the annual ‘ This is what I am grateful for ’ lists that many seem keen to share .
Forgive me , I just find them pretentious and performative .
Say private thank yous to the people that matter , not announce your general love of the world on social media …
Anyway , maybe I ’m just grouchy about it because I ’m so crap .
At life , I mean .
I ’m stuck in a place I do n’t want to be , both figuratively and metaphorically , and I feel like I ’ve not managed to move on in ways that make me happy , or even content .
Depression , and its close friend anxiety , are daily uninvited gatecrashers to the party that is my mind ; whilst I generally do a good job in hiding my suffering in public , privately I ’m struggling with it , and these impact my ability to get stuff done .
This is nothing unique to just me , I know .
terrified about that , but I will put one foot in front of the other and hope for the best …
I contine to run to help with mental health stuff , though 2017 was filled with illness and multiple health issues , and these impacted my ability to keep up regular training , or even just gentle running for the joy of it .
I feel out of shape , and unfit , and my pace is back to being incredibly ( and frustratingly ) slow , and this is n't really helping ease my black cloud .
But still I run , and luckily I have good muscle memory and structure in my legs , so whilst my lungs are n’t yet working at full capacity , my thighs are able to power me on .
I ’m doing my first ever half - marathon in March ( you can sponsor me here , if you wish - all proceeds go to Brook , the young people ’s sexual health charity ) , and I ’m genuinelyabout that , but I will put one foot in front of the other and hope for the best …
But that ’s not to say there is n’t light in my life , because there is , and I greatly value even the small things which give me joy ; it ’s just that I ’d like ( and need ) more of them .
If I extend the Punchdrunk analogy further , I guess I understand that I need to find my own cue light outside : I need to strike out and make my own rainbows happen .
Be daring .
Take risks .
Be bold .
That ’s what I am telling myself right now : be bold , in everything that I do .
Yesterday , I reset my daily phone alarm to say just that in its wake - up message :
Be bold ( and a heart emoji to remind myself to be kind ) .
I need a reminder that it ’s not one big thing that you do , but the small things daily which allow bravery - and joy - to flourish .
So I need to be bold and create more opportunities for myself , from love and sex through to my work .
They say build it and they will come , and there ’s a bunch of things I want to do this year , which I ’m scared about , but I know I need to put them out there .
If I do n’t risk failure , then I ’m not allowing the possibility of success either .
Right ?
My main objective , for 2018 , is to create a lot of content , and for this , I ’m launching a
I ’m soft - launching my I often feel like I ’m grasping for things in my life a little too late , like I ’ve arrived at the tail - end of a movie and missed the main story .
Or , as if I ’m in the middle of a Punchdrunk immersive theatre production , and everyone else instinctively knows how to follow the action , but I ’m completely lost , wandering around alone in the dark , when the cue lights have dimmed and the performers long gone , wondering where the story is and feeling lost .
Ironically though , when I ’ve actually been to a Punchdrunk show , I ’ve taken risks I never thought I would , chased after things I would be too nervous to in the outside world , and thrown myself headfirst into creating my own narrative .
I ’ve been rewarded with joy I never thought possible , neverending glee of childish excitement , and feeling that my world has been enriched by art so intense it ’s drawn rainbows across my heart .
The greyness of my day to day life feels profound by comparison ; its lack of colour almost mocks me .
But that ’s not to say there is n’t light in my life , because there is , and I greatly value even the small things which give me joy ; it ’s just that I ’d like ( and need ) more of them .
If I extend the Punchdrunk analogy further , I guess I understand that I need to find my own cue light outside : I need to strike out and make my own rainbows happen .

Right ?
My main objective , for 2018 , is to create a lot of content , and for this , I ’m launching a Patreon .
Yes , I know everyone and their dog has one ...
The thing is , I have pieces of writing which have no home , because they do n’t fit here ( though some of them are about sex ) and they ’re not right for a national paper .
And I really miss daily blogging and engaging directly with readers , and this blog ’s - ahem - one - track content does n’t really allow for me to experiment at all ( and the comments are broken ) .
I want to test out new ideas , and I ’d like to offer snippets of those with people who enjoy my writing .
In addition , I will shortly be setting up a regular podcast ( on film , art , theatre , sex , and objectification ) , as well as a few other fun activities planned ….
so I want to expand out from text - based things , and offer different creations to those who might be interested .
I ’m soft - launching my Patreon here first ( for the few people who still read blogs … ) , and will publish some content in the coming days prior to a proper announcement later this week .
If you ’ve ever enjoyed my writing , I hope you might consider being a Patron : every person subscribing will help me to create more , and in return you ’ll get first - look at drafts of my projects , and also locked content not published elsewhere .
I wo n’t be updating this blog anymore , but I will be blogging over at Patreon .
So , come find me there ?
If you fancy it , that is - and if you do n't , well , see you here this time next year .

Thirteen
It 's that time again .
That stupid bloody day where everyone 's talking about turning over a new leaf , and how they have great plans and resolutions for the upcoming year , and it 's annoyingly also the same day as this blog 's origin date .
Happy blog birthday to me .
13 years : blimey .
I posted something on Twitter just now , about how I feel wordless , that I have nothing to say about this anniversary , and I suppose that 's not entirely true : I do have things to write about , I just do n't feel they 're worthy enough to be noted here - or they 're too self - wallowing in pity to be shared publicly .
But you know me : never one to not overshare ...
I 've no fascinating news about my life , either personal or professional , that I want to note here .
I 've had a hard year - but who has n't ?
There 's been tough family stuff , but that 's private and I only confide in friends about that .
I 've had a constant black cloud threatening to hang over me - but I keep it just out of reach by running regularly , and every day I 'm grateful for this giving me the strength to carry on .
Running has provided a reassuring foundation on which to build myself up , so even though I 've had many lost days ( and weeks ) to illness and injury this past year , knowing I can return to running and fitness keeps my spirit high .
Mostly , anyway .
Striving for personal bests - competing with myself - continues to drive me forward and some days that 's all I feel I have to go on .
It may not be much , but it feels like a huge accomplishment just getting out of the house on a bad day and forcing myself to run ; some days that 's all I am capable of .
Reading the above , it 's clear I have been down quite a bit .
2016 was , I think , also a lonely year for me .
I really miss the companionship of being in a loving relationship .
I miss someone laughing at my stupid jokes and my terrible clumsiness .
I miss playing boardgames , and watching silly telly and making meals for two , not one .
I miss being at a social event as a couple ; it 's horrible feeling like you 're some kind of social outcast because you 're the sole single person there .
People talk about ' couple privilege ' - that couples have a s ocietal advantage over single people - and I mostly think that 's bollocks ( and single person 's envy ) , but I do think it 's true that people who are coupled up forget how tough it can be , being single , when most of your friends are married and have kids .
Or as in my other social circle , where everyone is polyamorous and partnered up with multiple people , what it might feel like to be to be on the outside periphery looking in .
Not that nice .
gle a while and I have managed .
It 's what I do : plod on and try not to think about it .
But I miss being in a relationship .
I miss cuddling a lot .
I miss it more than I miss sex , though thankfully my life is not entirely lacking the latter ; i t's just the meaning that goes with a deep loving connection is absent .
I found myself agreeing with and relating to , and having someone who loves you caress you and stroke your h air and kiss your forehead is hugely underrated .
That shit is aw e some .

I found myself agreeing with and relating to this recent piece about missing physical intimacy , even down to how I 've mocked ' cuddle parties ' in the past , and thought they must be for sad pathetic people .
Maybe I am sad and pathetic ?
I do n't know , I just know I 'm bored of being single
I 'm not sure I am ready to trust someone else with my heart again , but this hesitancy must surely be holding me back .
I 'm a believer in putting your all into things ( which is how my blog and book happened and also how I got my heart broken ) , so I 'm sure that the only thing I can do is try to be bold , try to be strong , and push forwards in the belief that good things will come if I strive for them .
I need to let go a little - because to reap rewards , you have to be willing to take risks - and I 'm scared , but I have no other choice really .
So this year , I 'm going to try to push past my comfort zone and pursue the things I want .
I have some work I want to make happen , there is a running goal I plan to achieve , and I hope to try to m aybe remove one brick from the wall of defence I 've built up to protect myself and let someone else in .
It seems only fitting , I guess , to end this with R oc ky . 💜

Twitter 10
Ten years ago today , I joined Twitter .
When I signed up , on December 22nd 2006 , my life was a roller coaster .
It was just a few months after the Sunday Times outed me as the author of Girl with a One Track Mind , and it 's fair to say I was still traumatised .
I 'd become mistrusting of everyone in my life ( because I did n't know how the press found out my identity - I still do n't ) and I had hidden myself away , barely going outside .
But what I still trusted were my online friendships - people I 'd met through this blog - and those were connections I cherished .
They 'd supported me when my world had turned to shit and to this day are some of my dearest friends .
So when Meg and Troubled Diva and Diamond Geezer and Sasha got accounts and said they were trying out this new service , I did so too .
As early adopters of blogs ( them , more than me ) , it was natural to give some new tech a go and Twitter 's basic question , " What are you doing ? " was something that resonated with us all .
As ( mostly ) personal bloggers , sharing insights into our daily lives , it was natural to post content that to many people seemed mundane ( we did n't care : we were n't writing to impress , or to sell ourselves , or to make money ) ; offering a brief snippet of that was appealing .
And the platform itself was an interesting challenge : we were used to editing our blog posts into 300 - 1000 words , generally , and Twitter 's limit of just 140 characters seemed fun .
What better way to shape and craft our writing , than to only be able to post a few words ?
It offered an interesting restriction and one we all enjoyed .
But Twitter for me , back then , also offered something which I found immensely pleasurable : being able to write openly , sharing my thoughts and feelings , but only have a few people able to read what I had said .
The first account I opened on Twitter , back in 2006 , was locked - private to only those I had allowed to read it - and remains so to this day .
The 13 people who follow me are the people I met and know from my old school blogging days .
This privacy was of paramount importance to me then : my private life was in tatters , following all the media attention , and every Tom , Dick and Harry could read about my life - and all my oversharing - on this blog .
Sure , I could have deleted it , and I know other bloggers have chosen to do that , for privacy reasons ( or perhaps book sales ... ) , but that felt so dishonest to me .
I was n't ashamed about my sex life , and removing all the content here - shit writing and all - seemed to me like giving up .
I wanted to maintain an air of pride and confidence , even if privately I was suffering , so this blog stayed .
And Twitter , for me , became the only space I could continue to voice my thoughts without feeling vulnerable and exposed to strangers .
It was kinda fun , back then .
It seemed this silly geeky thing would never catch on , and us nerds who were on there were a very limited few .
There were no @ replies - what you said was to all your followers : it was n't possible to direct it to one person in particular - there was no retweet button , no hashtags , no " share this via " option .
It was just posting a sentence or two out there into the internet , and no one necessarily responding .
Fast forward to March 2008 and I 'm in Austin , Texas , at the annual geek fest that is SXSW .
Twitter had just hit the town - you literally could n't avoid it : all evening events were shared solely on Twitter - and everyone there was signing up in order to find out where things were taking place .
And there you have the change .
Whereas it was once about posting what you were doing , it then became about reading what was happening .
It 's a subtle difference , but it 's important : it was an instant , direct , content - rich medium for others to consume - and later , to respond to .
I had to sign up , again , in order to connect with others in SXSW .
This time I did so with a public account .
Twitter 's username limit prevented me from having @girlwithaonetrackmind , so @girlonetrack I became .
( I kinda hate the name , but I 've stuck with it . )
Having a public profile on Twitter seemed like the most logical step forwards because whilst I was no longer sharing much of my personal life , I was writing and book promoting and doing telly stuff , and being able to post publicly was a benefit to me then .
And in the intervening years , between then and now , I 've enjoyed it immensely .
I 've watched the service change and adapt and expand ; I 've made friendships on it , I 've got work through it ; I 've used my reasonably - sized platform to try to help good causes and promote Sex Appeal , the comedy benefit event I run for the charity Brook .
And I 've of course had some lovely flirtations sliding into my DMs , too .
All this has been fun .
But its changing has so many downsides – too many to list .
People get abused , become the targets of attack , get harrassed and threatened .
It 's pretty horrid .
And what makes this unique , I suppose , is the format of the medium itself : anyone can @ anyone ; anyone can abuse anyone , celebrity or not .
With blogs , at least with mine , you can have commenting set up so that only you can publish the comments , and you can ensure hateful stuff is n't posted .
Sure , the blog author will still see that - and I can tell you it was never , ever nice receiving rape and death threats this way - but you still have the power to a ) delay seeing those comments , and b ) not ever giving the arseholes who wrote them the platform on which they would be published .
Delete , block IP , fuck off .
Done .
Not so with Twitter .
I think one of the most awful things about it - which ironically is also one of its best features , and what has made it continue and expand for so many years - is its immediacy .
You can tweet someone and they can see your communication instantly .
Brilliant !
Or not .
Having hundreds ( or even thousands ) of people ' pile on ' to you because they believe you need to be put in your place ( for whatever reason ) is fucking horrible .
It 's enough to give people anxiety and panic attacks .
I know , I 've been there .
I do n't want this to be a post about Twitter , the company , and their failings , though arguably they have been very poor in addressing abuse , particularly of women and people of colour , and other oppressed minorities , on their platform , and they still need to do far more to challenge the awful hateful behaviour of some of their users .
But I suppose I 'm trying to express that I feel quite conflicted about the service and , like my friend Mike decided to recently , I have considered leaving it .
I 've experienced too much crap thrown at me and I find the performative , marketing , self - promoting aspect of it quite dull .
It 's great for breaking news - and I follow some fantastic journalists - but then it's also full of fake news being shared , and stress - inducing information overload is there every time you scroll down the timeline .
I still have my locked account , and I still enjoy the privacy that gives me , but my public one is much less enjoyable .
I 'm sure no one has noticed how little I now post there - and how I share almost nothing about my own personal life - and I 'm sure no one would miss me if I deactivated .
But , for now , I think I 'll stay , because I think professionally I need to - and I also value the connections I have made over the years .
Oh , and if you 're wondering about the pic below - which was my first tweet - the answer is yes : I still leave my tax return to the last minute .
I guess some things never change .
[ C omments are n't working , ironically .
Please @ me on Twitter if you want to respond to this post .
Thanks . ]

Race
I 'm running a
When I ran this same race a year ago , I achieved my
However , since that race last September , I 've had a series of physical setbacks - fracturing my foot ; ripping my calf muscle ; multiple chest infections ; ongoing joint issues with my hypermobility - all of which have severely impacted my training .
Over the last 12 months , I ’ve been practically couch - bound for weeks at a time , so running consistently has been a challenge .
It 's only really been in the last six weeks or so that I 've felt anywhere close to the level of fitness I had this time last year , but I 'm still not quite there yet .
So today I 'm forced to accept that beating my PB is near on impossible .
Indeed , even running at all carries some risk given my back injury ( sciatica ) from 13 years ago resurfaced a fortnight ago and I 've had to be very careful just going about my daily activities .
This means I ’ve also had to accept that I probably wo n’t get close to my PB , or even be able to run 10 k in under an hour , which disappoints me hugely .
All this is making me upset and anxious .
I want to prove to myself I can get better ( both in body and in mind ) and I can set myself targets that I can smash .
I still want to do well ; I want to beat myself .
I will be so upset if I do n’t - even given the above physical issues .
To not win tonight , to not achieve what I want to , feels like defeat ; it seems like I will lose all the momentum I have built , and the pride I have earned , in what I have managed to accomplish so far .
I know I 'm fighting a battle with no one other than me and my ego and I am aware it sounds stupid : I ’ll run the race and just doing it is a win , right ?
I never thought I would be someone who ( boringly ) talks about PB race times , and running training , and time targets , but I ’ve found something I love and which I am passionate about , and it means a huge amount to me to be able to do it well , rather than just ‘ do it ’
So my body ’s nervous state - I feel * so * sick right now - is a response to me struggling with accepting that failure * is * an option ; I do n’t want it to be , I want to win , damn it .
Quietly , I will admit that here ’s a glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that I manage to achieve what I hope I can do tonight , but if I do n’t , I hope I wo n’t be too hard on myself .
I ’m my own worst enemy , sometimes .
And there ’s always another race , in which to improve , I guess …
I 'm running a 10 k race this evening and am stupidly nervous - to the point of feeling like vomiting .
This is not because I 've have n’t done this distance before - I 've run three 10 k races in the last year - but because I 'm so scared of failing and being disappointed .
My body is shaking with nerves .
When I ran this same race a year ago , I achieved my personal best time and was very proud of my accomplishment , particularly because I ’d run another 10 k race eight weeks prior and managed to beat that time by over 6 minutes .
So I was looking forward to running tonight ’s race again , because it clearly was a good omen for me ; I was determined to again beat my previous PB by repeating this race , and felt sure I would .
However , since that race last September , I 've had a series of physical setbacks - fracturing my foot ; ripping my calf muscle ; multiple chest infections ; ongoing joint issues with my hypermobility - all of which have severely impacted my training .

It ’s so strange to me to feel the confidence that I currently have .

To look in the mirror and be proud to see the outline of muscles I have * earned * .
To feel the rewards of my hard work by being able to run for almost two hours straight - and be buzzing with joy at the end of it .
To run free , with just a bra , and give zero fucks .

So if you see a woman drenched in sweat , panting away , as she pounds the pavement in her bra and brightly coloured shorts , give her a smile and nod : it may well be me .

Proposal
We ’d arrived in New York a few days prior .
He ’d never visited the city ; for me , on the other hand , I called it my second home : somewhere I ’d been visiting since I was a baby ;
He ‘ got ’ New York .
He witnessed its beauty , he experienced the excitement I always talked about ; he fully understood why the city ’s vibrancy energised me and made me so happy .
We did some magical things there : we saw New York band
But it was n’t all roses .
I remember having a huge row and then us sitting apart in silence in Bryant Park , mutually seething with fury .
I ca n’t recall what we argued about , but that coldness between us I ’ll never forget .
At the time , looking at all the seemingly happy people in the park going about their normal business , I felt so sad , and wondered if fighting like that was normal ; whether other people argued with such anger that silence was the only possible way to cope .
After a while , though , we both apologised and had fantastic make - up sex when we got back to our tiny rented apartment ; a couple of days later , I proposed to him .
It was something I had been pondering for a while .
When we booked the trip to New York , a thought occurred to me that it would be the perfect place to propose .
We had talked about growing old together , starting a family , building a life .
Why not get married ?
Seize the day .
On our final evening in the city , he finally met my closest friend , whom I ’ve known my whole life and is like an older brother to me , and after some drinks , he and I walked to Brooklyn Bridge from the Promenade in Brooklyn Heights .
What could possibly be more romantic than walking over Brooklyn Bridge and then asking someone to marry you , as the sun sets over Manhattan ? , I excitedly thought to myself .
My heart was racing the entire walk and I was flush with anticipatory worry .
He was n’t perfect - but then neither was I .
We both had flaws and baggage and things that were difficult to deal with : we ’re just human .
We fuck up , we behave like arseholes , we hurt people with our stupidity , tunnel vision and inability to compromise .
But we also nourish and cherish and care and that ’s what makes relationships possible ; you have to give love to feel loved .
So any momentary doubts I had paled into comparison with the love I felt for him right then .
I knew it was the right thing to do : I wanted to spend my life with him .
As we approached the midpoint of the bridge , we stopped to marvel at the view , and I posed the question .
“ I know you do n’t believe in it , ” I began , which was n’t perhaps the most romantic way to start a marriage proposal , but he ’d often voiced his dislike of marriage as an institution , so I needed to accommodate that .
“ I know you do n’t believe in it , but I ’d like to spend my life with you , so would you , um , marry me ? ”
He was silent for a moment .
As anyone on the asking end of this equation will tell you , a second ’s silence seems like five minutes .
Time expands , rapidly , when your heart is on the line .
I do n’t know how long he was quiet for , but he finally grinned , and said “ Yes , of course I will ! ”
Later , he told me that he paused to think ; that he wanted to give my proposal proper thought , to explore any conflicting feelings he had , so as not to just instinctively respond , but to genuinely do so with heart and mind in sync .
We kissed and then walked over the bridge to Manhattan with our feet light as clouds .
It was lovely .
I ’m glad I can look back at this with warmth .
He ’s no longer in my life in a meaningful way , but my thoughts of him are mostly fond .
There is some pain there : it did n’t work out , which is sad , and today reminds me of that .
I miss him - particularly the companionship we had , because we were best friends for years , and I still feel the loss of that closeness now - but I can see now that we were n’t right for each other in a relationship .
Love is n’t enough if you ca n’t make each other happy day to day and also in the long term , though we tried our best .
I do n’t regret proposing .
It ’s perhaps the boldest thing I ’ve ever done .
Opening your heart to someone that way is scary , for sure ; I wo n’t be able to do that again in a hurry , I do n’t think .
But living a life without emotional risk , is , to me , not one really worth living .
You have to experience pain to be able to value the flip side , which is joy ; you have to put yourself out there , and face possible rejection , to be able to find someone with whom you deeply connect .
Fear eats the soul , but love nourishes it .
I hope to one day again find the sort of love which time wo n’t fade , but instead will fill it with colour .
Here ’s to making rainbows and enjoying sunsets with someone else in the future .
Today marks four years since I asked someone to marry me .
It was such a huge moment in my life , possibly the most exciting and terrifying thing I have ever done .
We ’d arrived in New York a few days prior .
He ’d never visited the city ; for me , on the other hand , I called it my second home : somewhere I ’d been visiting since I was a baby ; my first true love .
What better place to take him to , then , than the city which filled my heart with joy ; I so wanted him to experience that with me .
He ‘ got ’ New York .
He witnessed its beauty , he experienced the excitement I always talked about ; he fully understood why the city ’s vibrancy energised me and made me so happy .
We did some magical things there : we saw New York band LCD Soundsystem ’s documentary on its opening release in downtown Manhattan ; we had front row seats at the The Daily Show taping where Jon Hamm was a surprise guest ; we sat in a tiny theatre and watched fellow Brit comic Simon Amstell perform to a confused , but adoring , local crowd .
I took him to my favourite cocktail hangouts and dive bars for Martinis , Manhattans and sake .
We ate the best burgers and salt ( corned ) beef sandwiches , and stuffed ourselves with cheap sushi .
We met with my oldest , dearest friends , and drank mimosas over lazy brunch .
We wandered all over Manhattan , just soaking in the atmosphere , both of us laughing at his disbelief of how pretty everyone looked .
We ran hand in hand through the most torrential downpour I have ever witnessed - puddles up to your ankles in minutes - and laughed till we were choking because we were so drenched : far too wet to sit in a restaurant .
I have so many memories of that trip , so much laughter ; it was a joy to be with someone I love in the city I love .
But it was n’t all roses .
I remember having a huge row and then us sitting apart in silence in Bryant Park , mutually seething with fury .
I ca n’t recall what we argued about , but that coldness between us I ’ll never forget .

I do n’t regret proposing .
It ’s perhaps the boldest thing I ’ve ever done .
Opening your heart to someone that way is scary , for sure ; I wo n’t be able to do that again in a hurry , I do n’t think .
But living a life without emotional risk , is , to me , not one really worth living .
You have to experience pain to be able to value the flip side , which is joy ; you have to put yourself out there , and face possible rejection , to be able to find someone with whom you deeply connect .
Fear eats the soul , but love nourishes it .
I hope to one day again find the sort of love which time wo n’t fade , but instead will fill it with colour .
Here ’s to making rainbows and enjoying sunsets with someone else in the future .

Many Palestinian children in Israeli Telmond Prison are being exploited by “ forced labor in which they must work eight hours for a few shekels , ” as reported by the Prisoners Information Center .
One of the children made a statement after his release .
“ The prison administration has forced all prisoners in Telmond Prison to work eight hours for very low wages . ”
He went on to say , “ The Israeli soldiers come to the chambers at seven and force us to go with our legs tied with chains . ”
The child added that his job was to stand under guard and pack plastic spoons in boxes .
Even injured political prisoners are forced to work , according to Friday ’s Nablus - based report .
A former prisoner stated , “ I had a broken bone but the soldiers forced me out of my cell to work anyway , without any consideration for the pain . ”
There are approximately 375 Palestinians in Telmond Prison , with most of them being children .
The oldest Palestinian in Telmond is 22 years old .
The child laborers are given two meals per 24 hours , one at 11:00 pm and another at 6:00 am .
Israeli prison officials also attempt to extract information from children regarding members of the armed resistance and engage in frequent psychological abuse
According to the Information Center there are 200 children less than 16 years old in Israeli prisons begin subjected to some of the worst forms of exploitation and humiliation .
A total of 376 Palestinian children are currently imprisoned in Israeli prisons and detention camps .

Every spring Simanto receives a care package from New York City .

Simanto uses the matzos , grape juice and oil sent by New York ’s Afghan Jewish community to conduct the Seder , a meal eaten on the first evening of the Passover holiday to commemorate the enslavement of the Jews in ancient Egypt and their later escape into freedom .
Jack Abraham , the president of Congregation Anshei Shalom , the only Afghan synagogue in the United States , says he started sending the Passover packages to Kabul in 2003 after hearing that Simanto had no matzo for Passover .
Abraham says he sends the packages “ to keep our presence in a land we were in for over a millennium . ”
He bought the food from a kosher grocery in New York ’s Queens borough and sent it by courier UPS .
The 60 - pound ( 132 - kg ) package cost about $ 650 to ship , he said .
He plans to send this year ’s package within the week to arrive in time for Passover , which begins on April 2 .
Until the middle of the 20th century there were about 10,000 Jews living in Afghanistan but all but Simanto , 45 , have fled because of religious persecution .
When the Taliban fell in 2001 , Simanto and one other Jew were found in living in a crumbling building in Kabul , apparently locked in an intractable dispute over a 500 - year - old Torah that had been taken by the government in 1999 .
Following the death of his elderly neighbor in 2005 , Simanto is believed to be the last member of Afghanistan ’s Jewish community .
Abraham , who keeps in contact with Simanto , recalled a home video of the synagogue Simanto uses for prayers .
The floors were cracked , the windows were taped up and walls were black from smoke .
“ I said , ‘ Wait a minute , ’ ” Abraham recalled .
“ ‘ This is the synagogue my father helped build ? ” ’
He sent money to have the synagogue repaired and its door fixed so Simanto would not have to climb through the window .
Elephant mothers had to be trained to sit next to the scanners , and cameras were inserted into the womb to take clearer pictures .
At 16 weeks , the foetus begins to look like an elephant as it develops a trunk .
Two weeks later it is seen exercising its trunk and legs , and ears that already detect sound start to grow .
By 12 months , the foetus is a replica of what will emerge 10 months later £ except it is just 45 centimetres long .
Animals in the Womb , which also focuses on the early life of a dolphin and a dog , was made by the same team that produced Life Before Birth , about the growth of a human foetus .
The filmmakers used digital technology to help produce the images .
Producer Jeremy Dear , of Pioneer Productions , said : " These kinds of images have never been seen before ...
The film underlines some fascinating facts about our evolutionary heritage and you can't help but be moved by each of our animal 's journey towards birth , " Dear said .
" It offers a pretty extraordinary window on this previously unseen world .
" One incredible thing about the early images is how the animal embryos are very similar to human ones .
It shows we humans share a common mammalian ancestry early on in life , " he said .
Watching the animals in the womb gives a fascinating peek at evolutionary history .
The dolphin's development gives a nod to its land - dwelling ancestors as tiny leg - like buds come and go in the first month .
The bone structure of its fins bears a startling resemblance to human hands .
Conversely , the elephant could have once lived in the sea .
Scans on the four - month - old elephant embryo reveal kidney ducts that are more commonly found in freshwater fish and frogs .
" We worked with dozens of zoos and animal sanctuaries across the world .
There were a lot of different challenges .
But it has been worth it , " Dear said .
Of the sequence following the development of the elephant , he said : " When it is finally born there is not a dry eye in the house . "

After learning how to read and interpret body language you will understand the statement :
" Body Language ; where you 'll see the same thing in a way you 've never seen before "
Body language uses
Body language can help you read people 's emotions and understand their feelings with an accuracy that is close to 100 % .
Body language does n't only allow you to read people 's emotions but it can also help you give the impression you want to people .
For example if you took the body language confidence gestures you will be able to give people the impression that you are a confident person .
In my book How to make someone fall in love with you i explained how you can use body language to attract someone by letting him to form an amazing impression of you .
For example if that person always wanted to be with someone who is confident then you can use the body language confidence gestures to appear confident and so he will find you more attractive .

1 . We know beer – you do n’t .
I do n’t know who labeled your dishwater “ beer ” , but it ’s misleading .
When you order a beer in Germany – do n’t expect it to be ice cold .
And yes , the foam is intended to be there .
2. The Autobahn
This much is true :
On the autobahn no speed limit sign actually means no speed limit .
3 . Soccer is not for chicks .
Well , not only .
In Germany most women do n’t care about soccer .
Men do .
Combine the American fondness for football , basketball and baseball , and you have an idea what soccer means to us .
4 . When you want to see people wearing “ Lederhosen ” – go to Bavaria .
Bavaria is the German Texas .
People speak in a funny way , wear strange things and the rest of the country makes fun of them .
The Bavarian “ Lederhosen ” are like the Texan cowboy hats .
5 . Sundays are for relaxation , not for shopping .
The same goes for holidays – and we ’ve got lots of them .
Yes , Germans like rules and this is one most foreigners do n’t understand .
Shopping of all kind is done weekdays from 8 am to 9 pm ( every shop has different times , but most open in this timeframe ) .
The only exception : Gas stations .
That ’s why some of them look like small grocery stores .
6 . Do n’t expect us to smile .
We ’re not at Wal - Mart .
In the 90s Wal - Mart spent billions to become a big shot in Germany ’s retail market .
Greeting customers , smiling , being friendly , suppressing unions – the whole package .
In 2006 they sold their stores and left .
We ’re not big at smiling for no reason .
7 . Do n’t speak German ?
Try English .
Most Germans , age 40 and below , speak English .
Maybe their English is not perfect , but you should get by .
Oh , and should you feel the urge to laugh about their accent – Try to speak German .
We like a good laugh now and then , too .
8 . When you hear “ Volksmusik ” – RUN !
It ’s like an endless polka of hell .
Although I do n’t have scientific proof , I am sure that Volksmusik can melt your brain .
9 . Yes , we have a public transportation system .
With the exception of tiny villages you can go nearly everywhere without a car .
If you do n’t understand why this is important to us , fill up your gas tank at a German gas station and look at your bill .
And we tend to be environmentalists .
10 .
You do n’t like to see two men kissing ?
Look the other way ( And do n’t go to Cologne ) .
Like I said in another post – unless we want to be involved , we do n’t care about other people ’s sexuality .
Oh , and Cologne is like the gay capital of Germany .
11 . I do n’t care what you have heard about European liberality when it comes to sex and drugs – This is not Holland !
No coffee shops , no legal drug supply .
When it comes to drugs , Germany is not much different from the US .
12 . If you do n’t want to see nipples , do n’t turn on the tv .
I ’m serious .
Especially the program of the private stations at night can be a series of phone sex commercials .
13 .
It ’s not pessimism when you know that everything is bad .
One day god told the people : “ The world is going to end . ”
The Germans were pissed and went home .
Then he continued : “ It will take a couple of billion years . ”
The Americans were happy .
Okay , I ca n’t proof it , but I guess that ’s how it happened .
14 . Should you travel with kids age 16 or older :
Watch them .
They are legally allowed to drink beer and wine .
No hard liquor , though .
15 . No math needed .
Our stated prices include taxes .
I never understood why you put price tags on products , that do n’t state what you have to pay .
16 . Do n’t wait to be seated .
Look , there is an empty nice table .
Have a seat .
Easy concept .
17 . Tips are nice , but not mandatory .
In Germany a waiter ’s salary is enough to get by .
It ’s not much , but makes a tip not mandatory .
In Germany it is a pure sign of gratitude for a good service .
18 . We use 220/230 V instead of 110 V . Buy an adapter .
Seriously , you would n’t believe how many tourists come here unprepared .
19 .
The nazi - times are long gone .
But that does n’t mean that there are not some leftovers .
If someone looks like a Skinhead , shouts like a skinhead and smells like a skinhead – trust your judgement and try to avoid him .
Especially in Eastern Germany .
20 .
Do n’t believe everything you read on the web .
Not even this list .
It ’s a generalization .
Most people you meet in a German city are not that much different than the ones at home .
We can be friendly and funny and very hospitably .
Home / Taxes / Small Business Tax Tips for Rookie Entrepreneurs
Small Business Tax Tips for Rookie Entrepreneurs
I just formed my first small business at the end of last year and spent the last few days putting together my inaugural business tax return for my eBay and blogging income .
Here are some things I learned :
1 ) Make Friends with a CPA
One of my good friends is a tax guy and he put up with several questions over the last few days .
I was n’t actually aware that 3/15 was the deadline for filing until he recently reminded me , thanks to him I wo n’t have a late penalty .
2 ) Keep Consistent Records Year - Round
It was 1 AM on 3/15 and I was digging through receipts and taking inventory .
If I ’d have done a better job of organizing and entering data as I went along then doing the taxes would ’ve been much easier and I would n’t be so stinkin tired .
3 ) eBay Accounting Assistant Rocks
If you ’re an eBay seller , use the eBay Accounting Assistant to move your data into QuickBooks .
You can import your sales and fees and save tons of time .
4 ) Use QuickBooks Report Center
I ’m just learning how to use QuickBooks .
I foolishly do n’t like to read manuals so I normally poke around until I find what I need .
I stumbled across the report center in QuickBooks and realized it was the dashboard I was looking for .
5 ) Use Certified Mail
I could n’t eFile because I did everything last minute and my electronic filing was n’t setup .
If you send your tax return through the mail , it ’s worth the extra buck or two to send your return by certified mail .
6 ) Do n’t Procrastinate
Do n’t wait until the night before the tax deadline to do your taxes .
I am guilty of waiting too long but since I at least had a few days there was time to research questions and bug my CPA buddy .
7 ) Know Your Deadlines
As I mentioned , I almost foolishly missed the deadline for my 1120S .
I ’m sure over time you ’ll get to know the important tax dates but when you ’re starting out it ’s smart to keep a list .
The next date I have to worry about is the payment of estimated taxes by 4/15 .
Hmmm , a date I ca n’t wait to keep !

この文書を書いた動 機
ソースコードを読みなさい、あるいは読んでいく、という話題は
わりとあるけども、どう読んだらいいか書いたものは見たことがない。
プログラマならプログラムの読みかたは当然わかっているものだということなのだろうか。
しかし自分には人の書いたプログラムを読むことがそんなに簡単な
ことだとは思えない。プログラムを書くのと同じくらい、読むことに
だって技術や定石があるはずだし、必要だと思う。そこで、コードを
どう読むべきか、とりあえずは
C 言語を前提として、無意識のうちに やっていることを明示的に整理してみる。
方針の決 定
読むプログラムが決まった。さてどうするか。なんの方針もなくただ
ただ main から読んでいってもコードが言おうとしていることは理解 できないだろう。まずコードを読む目的を明確に決め、それにだけ 集中するようにする。全てを読まなければいけないときでも、パスを 分けて部分ごとに読む 。
解析の手 法
大雑把に言って解析手法は静的な手法と動的な手法に分類できる。
静的な手法とは、ソースコードそれ自体を読むこと。
動的な手法とは、デバッガなどを使って実行時の動きを追うことだ。
基本的に解析は動的解析から始めるのがよい。
静的解析とは、多かれ少なかれ、プログラムの動作を予想することである。
対して動的解析で見るのは事実である。 まず事実を見ておいたほうが方向付けがしやすいし、間違いも減る。
最適化する前にプロファイルを取れ、というのと似ているだろうか。
事件解決はまず現場から、というのでもよい。
静的な解 析
対象プログラムを使う これがなければ始まらない。そもそもそのプログラムがどういうものなのか、 どういう動作をするのか知っておく。 ドキュメントを読む これも前項と似ていて、まず仕様を知っておこうということ。 また内部構造を解説したドキュメントが付いていたらそれもぜひ見ておきたい。
「 HACKING 」 「 TOUR 」などという名前のファイルがあったら要チェック。
ディレクトリ構造を読む どういう方針でディレクトリが分割されているのか見る。
そのプログラムがどういう作りになっているのか、
どういうパートがあるのか、概要を把握する。
それぞれのモジュールがどういう関係にあるのか確かめる。
ファイル構成を読む ファイルの中に入っている関数(名 ) も合わせて見ながら、 どういう方針でファイルが分割されているのか見る。 ファイル名は衰えないコメントのようなものであり、注目すべきである。 また関数名の名前付けルールについてもあたりをつけておきたい。
C のプログラムなら extern 関数にはたいていプリフィクスを 使っているはずで、これは関数の種類を見分けるのに使える。また オブジェクト指向式のプログラムだと関数の所属情報がプリフィクスに 入っていることがあり、貴重な情報になる。( 例： rb_str_push ) 略語の調査 わかりにくい略語があればリストアップしておいて早めに調べる。 例え ば 「 GC 」と書いてあった場合、それが garbage collection なのか graphic context なのかでずいぶん話が違ってしまう。 英語だと単語の頭文字をとるとか、母音をなくすとかが多い。 特に対象プログラムの分野で有名な略語は問答無用で使われるので あらかじめチェックしておく。 筆者の記憶にある中から一つ例を挙げよう。 とある Lisp 処理系で、 プログラム全体 で 「 blt」というプリフィクスが使われているのだが、
これが何を表しているのかわからなくて困ったことがある。
これは実は built - in function ( 組み込み関数 ) のことであった。 わかってみると単純なことだが、これがわかるのとわからないのでは ずいぶん難易度が違う。 データ構造を知る プログラムなんて、データ構造がどうなっているのか分かれば もう半分勝ったようなものだ。コードを書くときも、 コードに逐一コメントを付けるよりデータ構造 ( だけ ) を 解説するほうがはるかに役に立つ。 ( と、何かの本に書いてあったんだけど、なんだっけ？ ) ※ 追記：『プログラム書法』だった。以下、同書の p.168 より引用する。 「 プログラムに解説をつけるための、もっとも効果的な方法の一つは、
単にデータの割り付けかたをくわしく説明する、というものである。
おもな変数について、その値としてはどんなものが可能かを示し、
それが変って行くようすを説明すれば、それだけでプログラムの解説は、
ずいぶん進んだといってよい。」
ちなみにこの本の原書は 1974 年に出版されている。 ※ 追記2：『Cプログラミング診断室』でも似たようなコメントを発見した。 以下、同書の p.78 より引用する。 「 フローチャートは禁止しましょう。フローチャートは、
制御の流れを「もろ」に書けてしまうのでよくありません。
プログラムは、データを処理するためにあり、データの違いによって
制御の流れが変更されます。あくまでも、データが主体です。
変数、引数などのデータをどう定義するかで、プログラムの組みやすさは
大幅に改良されます。データ構造がどうなっているかの図のほうが、
フローチャートよりはるかに役立ちます。データの意味だけは、
しっかり書きましょう。 」 閑話休題。 C でデータ構造を作るならもちろん struct か union を使うはずだ。 そういう重要構造はヘッダファイルで定義されていることが多い。 もちろん内部構造は .c で定義されることもあるし動的に構築される
データ構造もあるので、最終的には関数を読んでいかないとわからない。
それでもまずはヘッダファイルを読むべきだろう。ヘッダファイルを
読むときにもやはりファイル名は重要である。例えば言語処理系で frame.h というファイルがあったら、たぶんスタックフレームの定義だ。
データ構造を予測する時は構造体メンバに注目する。構造体の定義中に next というポインタがあればリンクリストだろうと想像できる。
同様に、parent・children・sibling と言った要素があれば十中八九 ツリーだ。 関数同士の呼び出し関係を把握する 関数名の次に重要な情報。 特に関数の数が多い場合はこれが重要である。
このへんはツールを活用したい。 図にしてくれるツールがあればそれが一番いいが、
なければ特に重要な部分だけでいいので自分で図を書いておくといい。
図に凝る必要はないので、裏紙にざっと描けば十分だろう。
ちなみにこのこの呼び出しの関係を図にしたもののことを
コールグラフ ( call graph ) と言うことがある。 ソースコードに書いてある呼び出し関係を そのまま図にしたのが静的なコールグラフ ( static call graph ) で、 実際に動作させたときに呼び出した関数だけを書いた図が 動的なコールグラフ ( dynamic call graph ) である。 ただ、検索した感じでは、日本語の文章だと 「 コールグラフ 」 は暗黙のうちに dynamic call graph を指し、 static call graph は 「 関数呼び出し関係 」 と言うことが多いようだ。 だが static と dynamic で対になっているほうがわかりやすいので 筆者は動的コールグラフ・静的コールグラフと呼ぶことにしている。 関数を読む 動作を読んでいく。関数関連図を見て、パートごとに読んで理解していくのが いい。古典的なトップダウン式プログラムなら main から読むのがいいだろう し、GUI みたいにメインループに入ってぐるぐる、なプログラムならコールバッ クを順番に把握していくのがいいだろう。このへんはとにかく関数がどういう 関係で構築されているかによる。 またここでもシンボルの定義位置を調べたりするためにツールを活用する
( 後 述)。また前述のとおり、関数や変数が定義されているファイル名それ自体も、
カテゴリを示してくれるので重要な情報である。
それと、読んでいくときはまず「何を読まないか」を考えたほうがいい。
どんなに工夫しても全部を全部読むのでは時間がかかりすぎる。
エラー処理や不要な分岐、あまり使われない場合分けなどは全部飛ばすようにする。
ガード文がうまく使われているとこのステップが非常に楽である。
逆に言うと、こういうところを楽にするために例外だとかガード文を使うのだ。
好みに書き換えてみる これは 「この段階でやる」という類のものではなくて手法の一つである。
人間の頭というのは不思議なもので、できるだけ身体のいろんな場所を
使いながらやったことは記憶に残りやすい。パソコンのキーボードより
原稿用紙のほうがいい、という人が少なからずいるのは、単なる懐古趣味ではなく
そういうことも関係しているのではないかと思う。
そういうわけで、単にモニタで読むというのは非常に身体に残りにくいので、
書き換えながら読む。そうするとわりと早く身体がコードに馴染んでくることが 多い。気にくわない名前やコードがあったら書き換える。わかりずらい略語は メモるだけでなく省略しない語に置換してしまってもよい。 ただし、当然のことだが書き換えるときはオリジナルのソースは別に残し、 途中で辻褄が合わないと思ったら元のソースを見て確認すること。でないと 自分の単純ミスで何時間も悩む羽目になる。 書き換えて動かす 前項と似ているが、こちらは実際にプログラムを動かしてみる。例えば 動作のわかりにくいところでパラメータやコードをちょっとだけ変えて 動かしてみる。そうすると当然動きが変わるから、コードがどういう意味 なのか類推できる。 これまた言うまでもないが、オリジナルのバイナリは残しておいて 同じことを両方にやってみるべきである 。
名前の大切 さ
ここまで書いてきて気付いたのだが、ソースコードの読解とは
「名前」の調査であるようだ。ファイル名・関数名・変数名・型名・
メンバ名など、プログラムは名前のかたまりだ。名前はプログラムを
抽象化する最大の武器なのであたりまえと言えばあたりまえだが、
この点を意識して読むとかなり効率が違うのではなかろうか。
歴史を読 む
プログラムにはたいてい変更個所の履歴を書いた文書が付いている。
例えば GNU のソフトウェアだと必ず ChangeLog というファイルがある。 これは 「 プログラムがそうなっている理由」を知るのには最高に役に立つ。
また CVS や SCCS のようなバージョン管理システムを使っていて しかもそれにアクセスできる場合は 、ChangeLog 以上に利用価値が高い。 CVS を例に取ると、特定の行を最後に変更した場所を表示する cvs annotate 、指定した版からの差分を取る cvs diff などが便利だ 。
さらに、開発用のメーリングリストやニュースがある場合はその過去ログを
入手してすぐに検索できるようにしておく。変更の理由がズバリ載っている
ことが多いからだ。もちろん Web 上で検索できるならそれでもいい。
動的解析用ツー ル
動的解析ではデバッガやオブジェクトインスペクタを使って解析する。
例えば、実際にコードがどこを通ってどういうデータ構造を作るか、
なんていうことは、頭の中で考えるよりも実際にプログラムを動かして
結果を見るほうが早い。総合的なツールとしては次のようなものが使える。
他に、printf デバッグは非常に原始的な動的解析である。
また DDD ( data display debugger ) を使うとデータ構造を絵にして見せてくれる。 DDD は各種デバッガのフロントエンドとして構築されていて、
GUI を提供するのと同時に、いろいろなものを視覚化できるのである。 例え ば
http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/all.jpg
を見るとリンクトリストが視覚化されていることがわかる。
一般的には、テキストで書き出してから 後述の graphviz などを使って絵にするのがよいだろう 。
また関数呼び出しの追跡 ( プログラムのトレース ) については ctrace というツールがある 。
Linux では ltrace というのもあり、共有ライブラリ関数の呼び出しを追跡できる 筆者は未確認だが 、Solaris 用の同様のツールで sotrace というものもあるそうだ 。
特にシステムコールに限るなら strace , ktrace , truss も挙げられる 。
Linux だと strace 、BSD だと ktrace 、Solaris だと truss だ。
ctrace http://www.vicente.org/ctrace/
ltrace http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/ltrace.html strace http://www.liacs.nl/~wichert/strace/ ktrace ( OS 添付 ) truss ( OS 添付 )
さらに、トレースはテキストで出力するだけでなく視覚化もできる、
という意見をいただいた。詳しいことは以下の本にのっているとのこと。

この話が載っているの は p145 4.4「駆動は入れ子になった存続期間を持つ」のあたり。
「駆動木」という名前で動的コールグラフの話が出てくる。
「 駆動木 」 は activation tree の訳らしい 。
静的解析用ツー ル
使ってみた感じは global が一番汎用的に使えてよさそうだ。 ビューアは変に独自のを作られるより HTML を出力してもらって ブラウズはウェブブラウザに任せるのが便利だと思う。
gonzui http://gonzui.sourceforge.net
様々な言語に対応しているソースコード検索エンジン。
ファイル内のインクリメンタル検索、ソースブラウズなどが可能。 global http://www.gnu.org/software/global/
C 言語用。 クロスリファレンス、関数定義元の検索など、高機能。 同梱ツール htags を使うと HTML で出力できる。 不満なところ。グローバル変数と関数ポインタについても定義元を 示してほしい。あと htags で HTML を出力するとき予約語にタグを つけたりできるんだけども、ここでタグを直接出力するのではなく
CSS を使って指定できるようにしてほしい。手元ではそのように 改造して使っている。グローバルに定義されている文字列定数を 書き変えるだけで変更できた 。( ただし CSS 名は決め打ち ) さらに言えばマクロの中で定義された関数とかローカル変数まで
カバーしてくれると完璧なのだが、そこまでやるとほとんど
C コンパイラと同じかそれ以上の解析が必要になってしまうので 無理は言わないことにする。 cscope http://cscope.sourceforge.net
C/C++/Java 用。 Curses ベースのソースコードビューア。独自コマンド体系なのが どうも面倒くさい。 そういうわけであんまり真面目に使ってないが、機能はかなり豊富だ。 global より cscope のほうが便利という人も多いようである。 ctags
http://ctags.sourceforge.net 基本的に C 言語用。vi のためのタグファイルを生成してくれる。 タグファイルというのは、関数や変数の位置を記録して、 そこに一発でジャンプするためのログのこと。 ちなみに、御存知だと思う が
、Emacs 用の類似ツールは etags と言う。 lxr http://lxr.sourceforge.net
Linux のソースコード読みを支援するために開発されたツール。 名前は Linux Cross Referencer から来ている。CGI として使うもの。 スタンドアロンツールが欲しかったのであまり真面目に使わなかったが、 これはこれでなかなか便利そうだ。 doxygen
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
基本的にはドキュメント生成ツール。コメントにドキュメントを書いておくと
それを取り出して各種フォーマットで出力してくれる。
ソースコードを HTML
などで出力できる機能もあり、それがわりと高機能だ。 ただしソースの HTML 化だけに使うには設定があまりに面倒である。 cxref
http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/cxref/
C cross referencing & Documentation tool、の名前のとおり クロスリファレンスとドキュメント生成のためのツール。それ用の
コメントを付けとかないとドキュメントは生成されない。基本的には
これはドキュメント生成のツールであって、クロスリファレンスは
そのオマケみたいなもの。ソース読みが目的なら上記のどれかを使うほうがいい。 cflow http://wh58-508.st.uni-magdeburg.de/sparemint/html/packages/cflow.html 昔から UNIX に付いてるツール 。 C 言語の関数の呼び出し関係をテキストで表示してくれる。 今となってはメチャクチャ便利というものではないが、 シンプルだし、パイプへの出力に使えるので持ってて損はない。
また Fortran 用の静的解析ツールをまとめたページを 教えていただいたのでリンクしておく 。

余談： コールグラフの視覚化につい て
コールグラフを図にしてくれるツールが なかなか見付からなかったのだが、つい先日情報をいただいた。
SXT http://sxt.freeservers.com
単体で関数の関係を視覚化できる。 対応言語は C、dBASE 、Fortran 、Java、Lisp。 筆者が求めていたものにはこれが一番近いようだ。 VCG http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/users/sander/html/gsvcg1.html
簡単な記述言語みたいなものを渡すとグラフを描いてくれるツール。
最近の cflow や bison だとこの VCG 向けの言語を直接吐いてくれる。 つまり、全自動で関数や構造体や規則の関係を視覚化できる。 graphviz http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/
dot という言語でグラフを表現したものを渡すと、グラフを描いて
様々なフォーマットで出力してくれる。( PostScript , png , jpeg などなど ) これを使って実験的に作ってみたグラフが以下のもの。 ruby インタプリタの中心部だ 。
ところで、この文書の以前の版ではコールグラフ視覚化の
トピックにこだわりすぎていたように思う。
確かに、コールグラフを視覚化すると時によっては
それ一発で動作が理解できるようなこともあるのだが、
必ずしも役立つとは限らない。 コールグラフが効果を発揮するのは、関数の数がそれなりにあり、
しかも関数呼び出しが深いときだ。逆に言うと、そういうときでないと役立たない。
Conspiracy theories again run rampant as users accuse Slashdot Editors of being in cahoots with scam artists .
Sounds like just a normal day at the office for me .
Except that I 've decided to say a few words on Slashdot article selection process and users who try to abuse it .
Read on for my rant .
Let 's talk about Beatles Beatles .
For the uninitiated he 's just some dude who submits a lot of stories .
He actually happens to get a lot of them accepted .
We have a number of users like this .
Looking at the hall of fame shows you a number of the most successful ones .
Now the motivation for getting a Slashdot story accepted ( besides fame , glory and sexy women who start IMing you naked pictures of themselves mere seconds after a story goes live ) is a return link to the website of your choosing .
Your creds .
Your ' Reward ' for sharing a cool URL with a half a million Slashdot readers .
It 's not hard to figure out what sorts of stories Slashdot likes .
We have a format , and a subject matter .
A persistent user can simply start spamming the bin with a submission about everything he finds that comes even close .
If he does it enough , he 'll get a few through .
Especially if he manages to get something reasonable in at 11 pm when there 's little else to choose from .
Now there is no conspiracy .
There is some Roland guy who 's last name i can't spell who submits stuff all the time and people thought for awhile he was Timothy .
Lately there is a Beatles Beatles user who conspiracy theorists now think is Scuttlemonkey .
We do n't know these people .
They are not aliases for us .
They are n't paying us .
3 months from now it will be somebody else .
Now these submitters each have their problems .
In Roland 's case , he likes to link to his personal blog where he writes mediocre summaries of stories that add nothing to the original .
In BBs case , he just cuts and pastes paragraphs from linked pages .
Both use their return link to link a web page which is , in my opinion , pretty worthless .
Now technically speaking , we could add a nofollow to their URLs .
Or strip them entirely .
But that puts me into the position of editing not just the submission , but the submittor , and i really do n't think that this is " Right " .
Part of the Slashdot Editor 's job is to make a submission " Presentable " .
Usually this means moving a few URLs around .
I 'd guess a good half of story submissions use the word ' here ' or ' article ' or something equally stupid as their anchor text .
I prefer relevant words to be linked .
There are other minor things tho , like taking off extra intros like " Hi guys I read Slashdot every day and thought you would like this " .
We want the Slashdot story to be mostly distilled down to the essentials .
Just the key 3 - 4 sentences .
Should part of this process be checking the URL of the submitter to make sure that it is legitimate ?
Does that really matter ?
Should we add a nofollow tag to those URLs ?
My opinion is no .
Those URLs are what you get for submitting a story to Slashdot .
We selected it .
The submission braved the Gauntlet .
A hundred submissions died , and this one made the cut .
I do n't think it 's fair that we strip creds from someone just because they choose to squander that URL on something stupid .
Who am I to judge that after all ?
Now the real problem with this is what it does to the discussion .
Last night a nice story was posted .
It came from one of our " Problem " users .
And dozens of comments were posted about this user .
The conspiracy theories .
The hostility .
Now a lot of this is normal Slashdot Forum Faire .
Thats fine .
But the problem is that often when this occurs , it swamps out the real discussion .
The messenger becomes the story .
I think this sucks .
The story is not about Roland or Beatles Beatles or whatever other random user is submitting a lot of stuff this week .
I encourage moderators to use their points to mod these discussions down when they see them .
As a moderator , your job ought to be to steer the discussion on - topic .
The submitter is almost never the topic !
The catch - 22 kills me .
I might have a URL in the bin worth sharing .
Something a half a million of you might enjoy .
But because a user with a " Reputation " submitted it , I know that posting it will spawn a giant forum cesspool .
I could strip attribution and take away incentive for a user to submit .
Or just throw away the article and forget it .
Or I could post the story and watch as half of the discussion is simply about the submitter and not the URL that i wanted to share in the first place .
Damned if I do , damned if I do n't , right ?
I 'm seriously looking for feedback here .
What should I do with a good submission from a reader with a reputation ?
And moderators , use those offtopic mods to steer the discussion towards the subject of the article , not the flavor of the month conspiracy theory about story selection .
As a side note , I 'm really going to try to write more articles addressing Slashdot matters on to Slashdot .
But please understand that doing so is tremendously time consuming - this article will generate hundreds of pieces of mail and forum posts that I want to read and reply to .
But there are only so many hours in the day .
I would like to request that the forum try to stay on - topic here .
Let 's talk specifically about the issues i addressed above .
We can talk about digg or moderation or whatever issues are of most interest next week .
Update a dozen or so users have made the same point : Simply wait for the same story to come from another user .
If that was possible , I would do so .
I 'm really talking here about stories that are submitted just by one person .
Part of why these users are successful is that they submit enough stories that they get a handful that only THEY submitted .
I can't simply wait for someone else .
That will never come !
update Allright it 's been about 300 hours .
I 've read every comment posted so far , and replied to many .
Even managed to whore myself a couple dozen upmods ;)
I think we will add a nofollow to the submittor link .
Several users raised good points and they ultimately convinced me that since the focus of the story is the submission , not the submittor , any link that detracts from the focus is less relevant .
This will probably reduce some kinds of abuse in the future , but of course not all .
There 's a lot of really good discussion in there .
Some really good feedback .
I have n't touched my inbox yet , but I see a lot of messages in there as well that I 'll try to get to .
I 'll try to post again in another week or 2 on some other subject matter .
If you have ideas on what that should be , you 're welcome to email and suggest topics .
We 'll try to make it , if not regular , a frequent thing on Slashdot .
1 . While a boon to Midwestern corn farmers and big ethanol producers like Archer Daniels Midland ( see chart above : ADM vs. SP500 ) , ethanol has been bad news for the driving public .
Ethanol costs more than gasoline , so adding it to gasoline increases fuel prices at the pump .
2 . There is a 51 cent per gallon tax credit to ethanol producers .
Other incentives include payments to corn farmers and subsidies for small ethanol producers .
These add up to $ 5.1 billion to $ 6.8 billion per year — roughly $ 1.00 per gallon of ethanol .
( " Ethanol is made by mixing corn with tax dollars . " )
3. Ethanol lowers fuel econ­omy because a gallon of ethanol has only two - thirds of the energy content of a gallon of gasoline .
4. Ethanol ca n’t be sent in an energy - efficient way through pipelines like gasoline can , because it would be contaminated by moisture .
Ethanol must be shipped instead by trucks , barges and railroads , which uses lots of fossil fuels .
So the more ethanol we move , the more fossil fuel we use .
5 . Ethanol use at current levels has also led to sky­rocketing corn prices as the available supply is split between food and fuel uses .
This has led to higher prices for corn products and things such as corn - fed meat ( see chart above ) .
6 . The current ethanol mandate will supplant only 1.1 % of petroleum imports by 2012 , without taking into account the petroleum inputs in ethanol production and use .
Once these inputs are taken into account , that figure falls by half to about 0.5 % .
7. Eliminating tariffs and regula­tory barriers to lower - cost sugar ethanol imports from Brazil and other produers would expand access to global sources , thereby lowering prices .
Predictably , such proposals have provoked strong opposition from the domestic corn lobby .
Despite all of these problems with ethanol , what is the political solution ?
More ethanol .

Live Earth To Be Carbon Neutral , Model of Sustainable Entertainment
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
One of our readers , CPL , left a comment on a previous post pointing out what appears to be some dramatic green initiatives on the part of Live Earth organizers to make this event a massive model of sustainability .
This is not your father ’s concert event .
We ’re talking wild and wacky green all around .
Here ’s what we know :
First off , John Picard , the award - winning sustainability expert and former member of President Clintonâ€™s Green White House task force , is leading the SOS team of sustainability experts .
SOS ( Save Our Selves ) is the green group behind the entertainment at Live Earth .
Anyways , their job is to follow the waste streams of this concert , and as I mentioned previously , cover their tracks with green sustainable offsets .
We ’re may even likely see the first concert powered entirely from the garbage of the people attending .
You can read more about this type of technology here .
Second , all electricity powering the event will be from renewable sources .
From bio - diesel to solar to wind .
All concession stands will be directed to use biodegradable plastics ( corn - based ) and waste will efficiently reduced through organized on - site recycling .
CFL and LED lighting will reign supreme from on - stage to the performers ’ trailers .
In fact , any hotel wishing to accommodate Live Earth staff , must switch out any inefficient lights with either CFL or LED alternatives .
Additionally , non -toxic cleaners will be used for cleaning , and recycle bins provided for each room .
All air travel for Live Earth will be offset with carbon credits .
Pretty impressive , right ?
Organizers are hoping that such improvements create a new LEED certification for entertainment venues .
I ’m psyched ; and based on comments here and around the web , a lot of other people are too .
Are you planning on attending ?
Check out the Live Earth site for more information — and also hit up the unofficial site , Live Earth Concert , for news from around the web on the event .
Rock on !
Rock Green !

America , and the American democracy , is perhaps weaker today than at any time in living memory because the rampant corruption of the George W. Bush " administration " has so thoroughly destroyed the credibility of the United States Department of Justice that virtually all cases of alleged public corruption being prosecuted anywhere in the country today are suspect .
According to a study published by communications professors Donald C. Shields and John F. Cragan ( available at ePluribus Media ) , nearly 80 % of all federal investigations undertaken by the Bush DoJ and targeting elected officials or candidates were aimed at Democrats , with under 18 % targeting Republicans .
Around the country , that 's 298 investigations of Democrats versus just 67 investigations of Republicans .
Shields and Cragan theorize :
We believe that this tremendous disparity is politically motivated and it occurs because the local ( non-state - wide and non-Congressional ) investigations occur under the radar of a diligent national press .
Each instance is treated by a local beat reporter as an isolated case that is only of local interest .
Anyone who 's had even the most passing interest in almost any public corruption investigation knows that the first line of defense for the accused is to claim to be the target of a " partisan witch hunt . "
It 's a dusty old saw , but the bizarre and frankly sickening tale of systemic corruption unfolding within the highest ranks of the Bush " administration " has given it new life , and new validity .
The Attorney General 's effort to limit the scope of this scandal by framing this as a failure of communication in which " incomplete information " was transmitted to Congress fails to grasp the larger disaster involved , which goes well beyond the issues of what information was or was n't shared .
At a minimum , this massive breach of public trust is going to require wholesale firings from the top ranks of the Department of Justice , and a serious investigation into the political practices of the Bush White House .
There 's now virtually no way the DoJ can creditably police public corruption cases anywhere in the United States given what we 've learned in the past few days , especially when coupled with the numbers exhibited in the Shields , Cragan report .
The Department of Justice , as it is now constituted , cannot be relied upon to protect Americans from the corrosive effects of real public corruption , due to their own outrageous politicization and overreaching .
In some cases , no doubt , years of serious investigative work by honest and thoroughly professional federal investigators is going to be cast in doubt by the Bush " administration 's " criminality .
In an age in which we are constantly reminded of the dangers we face from the threat of international terrorism , few things could deal such a direct and damaging blow to national security -- especially in light of the simultaneous discovery of rampant abuses at the FBI -- than the revelation that the Department of Justice itself is being run like a Nixonian boiler room operation .
There is , once again , a cancer on the presidency .
Because of my past life as an on and off rockcrit , I still get asked to vote in various music polls .
And it seems like I get asked earlier and earlier every single year .
It ’s difficult to come up with a list when you are still digesting music : for example , the new Tom Waits does n’t make my list because I have n’t heard it enough times .
( And no spoilers ! ! )
One of the more interesting things to note is that in an era where the album has been eclipsed by the single ; the single has actually been eclipsed by the song .
One of the trends that has been growing but has reached its tipping point this year with all of the various polls is that they mostly are n’t ranking singles anymore , but rather “ songs ” or “ downloads ” or “ tracks . ”
Sure , there are now , and will always be what we used to think of as “ singles : ” people still have to have something upon which to focus — noone who ventured into any public space or airwaves this year could avoid “ Crazy ” — but not always .
I think that this reflects the post - millenial randomization of how we immerse ourselves in music .
I ’m no different : all I ever wanted from a radio station was some kind of mix of things I already loved ; things I was getting to love ; and new discoveries which I could love .
Or not , as the case may be .
And now that I can do that in nearly every situation , I have .
One of the things that has become evident is that digital music has changed my listening habits for the forseeable future : while I still buy CDs , I do n’t really listen to albums as albums that much any more .
Albums have become buckets of songs .
Or directories , actually .
And the directories that are filled with the highest percentage of songs that I love the most are — by definition — the best albums .
What does this mean in English ?
It means that my list of favorite records is going to be drawn from a wider — but not deeper — pool .
It means that records that tell stories , where every song makes the songs around it better , might get lost in the shuffle .
It means that a great set - up track to an even greater follow - up track could be just a few minutes of lost opportunity .
I do n’t know what to do about that , though ironically some of my favorite recent records have been concept-y albums that break through in their entirety — Separation Sunday , American Idiot , Southern Rock Opera — which suggests that there is a part of me that misses putting 5 CDs on the changer and letting it go in order .
Of course , that would mean that I would have to do it all over again in a few hours and who wants that when I can just point the Slimserver to a hard drive , select “ Random ” and hit play and it will pretty much never run out of music . . .
And still not come close to finding everything out there .
It just ai n’t possible anymore , folks .
In any event , the following are my favorite 10 albums , CDs , records , downloads , directories –whatever you want to call them — as well as songs that I loved & my favorite reissues .
This list — as always — is highly subjective , and likely to change over the rest of my life .
Hell , it may change by the time I end up voting in the Pazz & Jop poll .
If I do this year .
And as always , it ’s also skewered wayyy too Indie , as that ’s essentially my niche .
I know that these are n’t the best albums of the year , just the ones I like the most .
Top 10 Albums
The Hold Steady – Boys and Girls in America ( Vagrant ) : Craig Finn and Tad Kubler opened up their music this year , and so instead of riffs with rants that were part of a larger storyline , we got an album full of , well , just fucking great songs .
Now , I happened to love those riffs with rants —
I ’m still not over “ The Swish ” or “ Banging Camp ” — but pound - for - pound , this is their best album .
From “ Stuck Between Stations ” to “ You Can Make Him Like You ” to “ Southtown Girls , ” there is n’t a bad song here , and just when you think that a song is n’t going anywhere , it ’s redeemed by some telling detail in the words or a sing - along chorus , like for example “ Gonna walk around gonna walk around gonna walk around and drink , ” which is both .
I think that this is their third straight winner in in three years .
And would like to point out that the last time the same band made my # 1 record two years in a row was The goddammned Clash in 1979 - 80 , back before many of these boys and girls in these songs were born , and I was just beginning to live a lot of these stories .
The Long Winters – Putting The Days to Bed ( Barsuk ) – Big epic pop songs , full of ringing guitars and memorable choruses .
Never , ever will there be anything wrong with that .
Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am , That ’s What I ’m Not ( Domino ) – Yes , the hype became almost unbearable , but over the year , the songs kept getting stronger even as the hype mutated into backlash .
Bollocks to the hype and to the backlash : it ’s just purely modern two - guitar post - Britpop that is either the beginning of something all - time or a fondly - remembered one - off .
Upcoming song title : “ Sometimes The Hype Given Something Is Actually Well - Deserved , So Shut Up , Already ” Yo La Tengo – I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass ( Matador ) – Welcome back Ira , Georgia and James , all is forgiven .
Thanks for not just the album title of the year , but leading off with “ Pass The Hatchet , I Think I ’m Goodkind , ” which is n’t just the psychedelic noise - guitar jam of the year , but quite possibly the first time that The Velvet Underground has loved them back .
Drive - by Truckers – A Blessing and a Curse ( New West ) :
You just get the impression that Patterson , Jason & Mike could do this every year : walk into the studio and crank out a dozen or so near - perfect rock ‘ n ’ roll songs .
This year , the songs seemed a bit more personal , as announced by the ( criminally ignored ) single , the unironic love / hate song “ Feb 14 ” and sealed by the closer “ World of Hurt , ” where Patterson Hood — the writer of some of some of the best death songs ever — declares “ it ’s good to be alive . ”
Robyn Hitchcock & The Venus 3 – Ole Tarantula ( Yep Roc ) :
An unexpected return to form after what seems like a decade ( some might say two , but they ’re wrong ) of wandering in the wilderness .
Of course , for Robyn , that wilderness is his own brain , which was still good for a couple - three strong songs per album .
This time around , he gives us nearly a full record ’s worth in what is by now his classic , highly personal style .
If you ever liked him in the past quarter - century , you ’ll like him again .
Let ’s only hope that his most famous bandmate was paying attention .
Bob Dylan – Modern Times ( Columbia ) :
If I do n’t think that his first # 1 album ever is n’t quite as good as his last two albums — neither as startling as Time out of Mind nor as epic as “ Love and Theft ” — that ’s on me , because other Zim fans think this is the best of his latest trilogy .
Where he goes from here , not even he knows .
Just as long as he keeps going .
The Concretes – In Colour ( Astralwerks ) :
On some songs , great gobs of color ; or others , just little dabs where needed .
Neil Young & Crazy Horse – Live at the Fillmore East 1970 ( Reprise ) : Sure , it could have been longer .
And sure , “ Winterlong ” and “ Wondering ” are nice rarites , but hardly essential ( except for pointing out how little he was really trying on Everybodys Rockin ) , and “ Downtown ” is n’t all that different from the take on Tonight ’s The Night , then what ’s to recommend this ?
Oh yeah , the amazing extended takes on “ Cowgirl in the Sand ” and “ Down By The River , ” each of which I ’ve heard 35 zillion times in the past 35 years , yet both of which sound fresh and new because — oh yeah — they were .
Also just missing this list : Living With War , where Neil single - handedly rassles the Prez to the ground .
Sonic Youth – “ Rather Ripped ” ( Geffen ) : As per entires on Yo La Tengo and Robyn Hitchcock , a long - time fave returning to form .
If you love the form , you ’ll love this record .
I do , and I do .

Reissues :
Lockheed 's shiny new F - 22 Raptor stealth fighters may have owned a few war games , but crossing the International Date Line left them as helpless as a carrot in a rabbit trap , with multiple system crashes causing an emergency detour en route from Hawaii to Okinawa , Japan .
Communication , fuel subsystems , and navigation systems were rendered useless and repeated " reboots " were of no help .
Luckily , the fleet had clear skies and refueling tankers to guide them back to Hawaii .
If they had separated from the tankers , " they would have turned around and probably could have found the Hawaiian Islands .
But if the weather had been bad on approach , there could have been real trouble , " states Retired Air Force Major General Don Shepperd .
The voyage suffered a two - day delay on account of the system failures -- " a computer glitch in the millions of lines of code , somebody made an error in a couple lines of the code and everything goes . "
What should have been a showy parade of $ 125 + million super fighters quickly turned to disaster for Lockheed who would 've had a lot of explaining to do , had this happened during combat .

Professors James Gwartney ( Florida State University ) , Richard Stroup ( Montana State University ) and Dwight Lee ( Georgia University ) , three longtime colleagues of mine , have recently published " Common Sense Economics . "
It 's a small book , less than 200 pages , that addresses a serious economist dereliction of duty : making our subject understandable to the ordinary person .
Public misunderstanding of basic economic principles leaves us easy prey to political quacks , charlatans and assorted hustlers .
Part I of " Common Sense " focuses on 10 key elements of economics that I 'll only briefly describe .
The first is incentives matter .
During the 1970s , gasoline prices rose dramatically .
Immediately , people did more carpooling and eliminated unimportant trips .
Gradually , they shifted to more fuel - efficient cars .
During the 1980s and 1990s , gasoline prices fell .
Again , people altered their behavior by buying more SUVs and more powerful cars .
Incentives matter under socialism , too .
In the former USSR , managers and employees were compensated by the number of tons of glass they produced .
Factories produced glass so thick one could hardly see through it .
The rules were changed so that compensation was made according to square meters of glass produced .
Factories produced glass so thin that it broke easily .
The second element is there 's nothing that 's free .
Politicians talk about " free education , " " free medicine " or " free housing , " but that 's nonsense .
Resources are required to produce each of them .
Of course , some people received these goods at a zero price , but that does n't mean they did n't cost someone , usually a taxpayer , something .
Their third element is we do n't make all - or - nothing decisions such as choosing between eating or wearing clothes , that is , dining in the nude so we can afford food .
Instead , we choose between having a little more food at the cost of a little less clothing .
Their fourth element is that trade promotes economic progress through encouraging specialization .
That 's true whether the trade is between individuals , regions or countries .
Specialization and trade make us dependent upon one another , but not to worry .
The world 's poorest people are far more independent than we .
Check out Darfur .
You might see families building their own shelter , gathering their own food and heating supplies , and making their own clothing .
The flip side of the idea that trade promotes progress , and their fifth element , is the idea that obstacles to trade stymie progress .
Among these political obstacles are taxes , licenses , regulations , price controls , tariffs and quotas .
Elements six and seven are related .
Profits direct resources to their highest value uses .
Losses free misused resources for higher value uses .
People earn income by serving their fellow man .
This link between serving others and income gives us incentive to develop talents and skills and become highly valued .
Elements eight and nine address the other keys to progress : Investment , better ways of doing things , sound economic institutions , and Adam Smith 's idea that market prices direct buyers and sellers toward activities that promote the general welfare .
Their tenth element is crucial .
We should n't ignore the secondary and long - term effects of an action .
For example , trade restrictions on foreign sugar that result in higher prices for domestically produced sugar save jobs in our sugar industry .
Because of those higher prices , major candy manufacturers such as Wrigley and Brach 's moved to Canada and Mexico to take advantage of lower sugar prices .
That resulted in more U.S. jobs lost than were saved by the sugar trade restrictions .
" Common Sense , " subtitled " What Everyone Should Know About Wealth and Prosperity , " contains a wealth of information about the major sources of economic progress , economic progress and the role of government , and important elements of practical personal finance .
The latter contains finance principles on how to invest your money , using the principles of compound interest and how to get more out of your money .
There 's nothing in the book that goes beyond common sense , something rare these days .
So why do I need to start by commenting on my age ?
Well it is because I can remember the smogs of England before the Clean Air Act came in , I can light not only a coal fire ( piece of cake ) but also a coke fire ( you try ! ) , I have lain on my back to hand - load coal in a seam that was , at the time , some 20 inches high , I have “ black - leaded ” a stove , and holystoned a curb after shoveling coal into the “ coal hole ” .
Which made reading the book , by Barbara Freese , to some degree a voyage down Memories Lane .
And , I must admit , that , not having learned my lesson , this will be , not only a book review , but also a comment on where I think folks are making a bit of a mistake in remaining complacent about the future of the world energy supply , particularly as it relates to the old King of the fuel business .
I must begin by stating that I really do n’t think I am that old !
Why , you might ask , do I need to say that ?
Well , I have just finished reading “ Coal – a Human History ” , which , as I mentioned at the time , was recommended by Tim Appenzeller during his talk on coal , at the Emerging Technologies Summit in Santa Barbara last month .
The presentations for which have now been posted , and the DVD ’s will follow soon .
Since I have also just finished Big Coal by Jeff Goodell , and Time had an article on Chinese coal it seemed a good time to revisit the subject .
Particularly since there were a couple of papers at the Summit that spoke to one of Jeff Goodell ’s issues .
It is interesting to look with the view from today , back on the contemporary comments as coal progressed from individual use into the power source that it has become .
In , Barbara Freese quotes the first observers of locomotives in 1830 as seeing “ a huge monster in mortal agony , whose entrails are like burning coals . ”
Well , having seen a replica of Locomotion # 1 ( 1825 ) toddling around the track at the Beamish museum it seemed like a small , almost toy - like artifact , so much has perspective changed .
However we also no longer have the open carriages where , as she notes , “ some of the more safety conscious railways had their passengers travel with buckets of sand in their laps to pour on each other after they caught fire . ”
This was from the flying embers landing in the carriages as the train reached speed .
Beamish lies in the lands of the Prince Bishops , and , as the book notes , much of the early development of mining in the UK was under church control .
The NCB film Nine Centuries of Coal begins with women gathering coal that has washed ashore along the Northumbrian Coast , and carrying it to Tynemouth Priory , hence the name “ sea coal ” .
Although the passage of time shifted ownership to the Crown .
King Charles the Second , for example , allowed the Duke of Richmond to charge a shilling ( 20 shillings to a pound , and this was before the time of dollars ) per chauldron ( 28 cwts ) on all the coal shipped from Newcastle .
From the beginning coal use was a hard choice between the pollution that it generates , and the heat and power that it provides .
The smogs and fogs that came with its widespread use persisted into the 1960 ’s and I can remember being in one so thick I could not see my hand in front of my face .
But it also powered the Industrial Revolution , and provided an industry that , in the end , brought people through the initial traumas of the early industrial cities into the more healthy conditions of today .
That passage was not without many struggles , the book notes that a study had shown that it takes about an hour a day to tend a coal stove properly on the one hand , and there were the much greater social upheavals that embroiled nations in the conflicts between labor and management on the other .
It was , I think in this latter aspect that I was a little disappointed that more was not made of the struggles that occurred .
The stories of the Molly Maguire , The Ludlow Massacre and the social hardships of running families in small communities might have been more fully covered in a book that includes – a human history – in it ’s title .
In the latter regard , for example , my Great Grandmother had not only her husband , but also six sons work in the mine on shifts , and so throughout the week , she would be constantly getting one up , preparing his sandwiches , cooking for his supper , cleaning his gear , and helping with his bath , all at intermittent hours of the day , in an overlapping cycle so that she slept in the chair by the fire , and only saw her bed at weekends .
My father said that she died of overwork .
It was a common lifestyle of the time .
The book does , however , speak to the difference between coal and oil .
It differentiates between the glamour of oil , and the “ bleak images of soot - covered coal miners trudging from the mines , supporting their desperately poor families in grim little company towns . ”
Coal has never had much respect as a fuel , and the book , in its evolution of the history , recognizes the impact that this has had , not just on the fuel , but also those that mine it .
Big Coal , on the other hand , is a more contemporary story , with the author visiting some of the mines , both the underground in the East , and the large open pit mines of Wyoming .
He has the most fun riding the trains that carry Western coal out of the mining district and up onto the High Plains , as they carry the coal all across the country .
But he also saw the pride and camaraderie that exist among miners .
The spirit that can enliven a group struggling together in a physically demanding job , day after day , with the always - present danger of something going wrong .
He describes some of the problems that led to the Quecreek Disaster and that it was one of those miners whose spirit so caught his attention .
Big Coal goes beyond just the mining however , to look also at the politics both of marketing the fuel , and of sustaining the share that coal has in the fuels portfolio , by looking at the politics of the power generation .
And here there is some information from the Summit that is pertinent .
In discussing the big problems of the gases and particles that come from a power station stack , he notes the difficulties in cleaning up the stack gases .
Frank
Alix discussed the use of ammonia as a means of getting not only the SO2 , the NOX , the PM and Hg from the stack , but also in removing the CO2 , in a form that can then be sequestered .
Unfortunately , in a dash of reality ( and as I commented at the time ) while he can remove the gas at $ 15 a ton , Sally Benson also had done the cost calculations that showed that the sequestration costs could almost double electricity costs , and this led to some discussion in the audience , as to whether this would be publically acceptable , the consensus seeming to be not .
Both authors write about the problems that greenhouse gases are creating for the environment .
Jeff Goodell is , however , willing to acknowledge the existence of the Oregon Petition signed by 17,000 “ scientists ” questioning the impact of GHG on global warming .
However , he quickly points out that a check by Scientific American showed that only perhaps 200 of them were climate researchers .
That in itself is a bit of a relief , since I was beginning to think that dissent on this topic had been banned by Papal Bull .
I would however quibble that if , as is the case , there is geological evidence ( the ice cores mentioned in the National Research Council Report on Surface Temperature Reconstruction that show that Greenland was over one deg C warmer a thousand years ago ; historical documents – Bardson ’s contemporary comments about wheat growing in Greenland ; and archaeological records where they are digging though the permafrost to uncover the homes of the Greenland Vikings .
and that just last week the Telegraph had a story that polar bears seem to be thriving as the arctic warms up , that this , collectively , seems to suggest that perhaps the discussion is too restricted if only confined to climate scientists .
The information from those with expertise in the above disciplines might have a pertinent and valid point of view .
The exact cause of the polar bear increase seems to be of some debate , conservationists feel that they should get some of the credit , but it is at the point that the Alaskan government is questioning their being put on the endangered species list and where their hanging onto iceberg shards has been recognized to be a standard practice while they look for lunch – as might have been known when the photo was used .
However , in dealing with numbers , there is a much more critical one that the book brings up , and that will likely lead to a more detailed post of how true they are ( closer than you might like ) and that relates to the actual coal reserves that exist .
The book notes that the first survey of coal reserves was in 1909 when 2 USGS employees estimated the US held about 3 trillion tons of which about 2 trillion was considered mineable .
This study was not superseded until 1974 when Paul Averitt , also of the USGS , did a more detailed study , that brought the practical number down to 483 billion tons of “ reserve base ” with about 50 % of that being recoverable .
However , in 1986 the USGS did a detailed study of the Matewan coalfield in south - eastern Kentucky and looked in more detail at the geological constraints that would better define true reserves .
From this they concluded that the amount that could be recovered was more likely no more than 30 % of the base .
In 1989 this study was updated with the help of the US Bureau of Mines ( the agency that was eliminated in the last Administration ) who brought a more realistic cost evaluation , from which it was concluded that the more realistic recovery percentages would be in the 5 – 20 % range , and that , for places such as the Powder River Basin ( where all the coal is currently strip mined for supply as low - sulfur coal to much of the US ) may ultimately recover only 11 % - given that most of the reserve base lies underground where it can no longer be easily stripped ( in much the same as the oil sands of Alberta must ere too long also go underground ) .
These are worrisome numbers since , regardless of whether the GHG issue is resolved , there has always been this sense that if we gulped hard and accepted the cost ( either in health , global warming or clean - up ) there would be enough coal to get us through until the magic real answer arrived .
Perhaps that is not going to be true , and the limitations of government to control some of these issues is becoming clearer .
Both the authors had been to China , and commented on the primitive nature of the coal mines outside the large industrial sites .
Barbara Freese has a very good chapter on how mining arose in China and her visit to a small mine in the Ordos region of Inner Mongolia .
Jeff Goodell was in Unumqi , in Xinjiang also in Western China but down closer to the India border but was more involved with the carbon capture theme by that time in the book .
Both however tell an engrossing tale about the growth of Chinese mining .
It is underlined , with an indication of the problems that the government of that country has in managing the coal industry , by last week ’s Time article .
Noting that 5,000 miners died in accidents in that country last year , officially , the problems go back to those with which I began this post .
Whether in the mines of America and Europe early in the last century , or in China today , the power of the coal owners , and the dreadful working conditions that they impose on their miners , has not changed much .
The need for the coal , and the money that can be made does not improve the conditions for many of the small , often illicit mines in the hinterland , and only the owners and the local and bribed officials get rich .
It is a condition that the central government cannot , as yet change , but which takes time .
In the United States the laws have been changed to significantly improve mine working conditions and to enforce good practice , and in the main , the industry has benefited well from this .
It is however critical that regulations to ensure that the mines are run well , and that the land is properly reclaimed after use , be in place and enforced .
This means that an educated workforce and management be in place .
Jeff Goodell notes that in 2004 there were less than 100 mining graduates in the Universities of the United States , and 65,000 who graduated with a law degree .
So I suppose that we will get the laws and regulations , the problem is getting those that are useful and pertinent .
Chris Bise , who provided the information to him on the Mining Schools has just moved to West Virginia to take over the Department there , as the previous head retired .
The number of experienced faculty is getting significantly lower , as his generation start to retire , and one occasionally wonders where the technologies that we will soon need to expand the reserve base beyond that low number might come from .
But as I said , that is likely the topic for another post , and ultimately maybe a change in the name of this site to The Coal Bin , or some such , within the decade .

Firing ranges can have more wildlife than national parks .
Explosions in military training sites can actually provide habitats for some species .

Military exercises are boosting biodiversity , according to a study of land used for US training manoeuvres in Germany .
Such land has more endangered species than nearby national parks .
The land is uncultivated , but also churned up by tank tracks and explosions .
This creates habitat both for species that prefer pristine lands and those that require disturbed ground , explains ecologist Steven Warren of Colorado State University in Fort Collins .
Military land can host more species than agricultural land , Warren told a meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Montreal .
What 's more , its biodiversity can also exceed that of natural parks , where species that need disturbance cannot get a foothold .
Warren and his colleague Reiner Büttner of the Institute of Botany and Landscape Ecology in Hemhofen , Germany , surveyed two US military bases at Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels in the southern state of Bavaria .
Although the bases represent less than 1 % of the state 's area , they contain 22 % of its endangered species , Warren told the meeting .
The national parks cover a similar area but host fewer endangered plants and animals , Warren says .
Nature 's army
" Some people are very anti-military , " Warren says .
" They assume that there 's nothing the military can do that will be beneficial , particularly with relation to ecology . "
Warren , who does n't work for the army , used to assume the same himself .
" Twenty years ago I looked at military activities as an ecologist and thought ' they need me ' .
But I guess that 's not really so . "
Warren and Büttner studied several species to try and understand the benefits of military ground .
One , the natterjack toad , breeds in water - filled ruts created by tank tracks , they found .
The tendency when setting aside a nature reserve is to prevent disturbances such as periodic flooding , says Warren .
But this can inadvertently remove some habitats .
" [ Tanks ] replace to some degree the processes that have been stopped , " Warren says .
The same goes for fires caused by bombing .
" We 've trained generations of people that fire is bad , " he says , " but in fact it 's crucial for ecosystems . "
Trial by fire
The number of species on former Soviet training camps around Berlin has dropped since the fall of the Iron Curtain , Warren says , supporting the idea that military activity is good for biodiversity .

" But some military chiefs worry that endangered species may begin to obstruct their exercises . "
The US Marine Corps has previously complained that the US Endangered Species Act threatens to turn its Camp Pendleton beach in San Diego County , California - home to 18 threatened species - into a nature reserve rather than a training facility .
Warren hopes that conservationists could learn from the military , and provide disturbances to help endangered species .
One trial project at Tennenlohe , near Nuremberg in Germany , involves cutting up land using an agricultural tool called a ripper in a bid to mimic tank tracks .

Katrina and Security
I had an op ed published in the Minneapolis Star - Tribune today .
Toward a Truly Safer Nation
Published September 11 , 2005
Leaving aside the political posturing and the finger - pointing , how did our nation mishandle Katrina so badly ?
After spending tens of billions of dollars on homeland security ( hundreds of billions , if you include the war in Iraq ) in the four years after 9/11 , what did we do wrong ?
Why were there so many failures at the local , state and federal levels ?
These are reasonable questions .
Katrina was a natural disaster and not a terrorist attack , but that only matters before the event .
Large - scale terrorist attacks and natural disasters differ in cause , but they ’re very similar in aftermath .
And one can easily imagine a Katrina - like aftermath to a terrorist attack , especially one involving nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .
Improving our disaster response was discussed in the months after 9/11 .
We were going to give money to local governments to fund first responders .
We established the Department of Homeland Security to streamline the chains of command and facilitate efficient and effective response .
The problem is that we all got caught up in “ movie - plot threats , ” specific attack scenarios that capture the imagination and then the dollars .
Whether it ’s terrorists with box cutters or bombs in their shoes , we fear what we can imagine .
We ’re searching backpacks in the subways of New York , because this year ’s movie plot is based on a terrorist bombing in the London subways .
Funding security based on movie plots looks good on television , and gets people reelected .
But there are millions of possible scenarios , and we ’re going to guess wrong .
The billions spent defending airlines are wasted if the terrorists bomb crowded shopping malls instead .
Our nation needs to spend its homeland security dollars on two things : intelligence - gathering and emergency response .
These two things will help us regardless of what the terrorists are plotting , and the second helps both against terrorist attacks and national disasters .
Katrina demonstrated that we have n’t invested enough in emergency response .
New Orleans police officers could n’t talk with each other after power outages shut down their primary communications system — and there was no backup .
The Department of Homeland Security , which was established in order to centralize federal response in a situation like this , could n’t figure out who was in charge or what to do , and actively obstructed aid by others .
FEMA did no better , and thousands died while turf battles were being fought .
Our government ’s ineptitude in the aftermath of Katrina demonstrates how little we ’re getting for all our security spending .
It ’s unconscionable that we ’re wasting our money fingerprinting foreigners , profiling airline passengers , and invading foreign countries while emergency response at home goes underfunded .
Money spent on emergency response makes us safer , regardless of what the next disaster is , whether terrorist - made or natural .
This includes good communications on the ground , good coordination up the command chain , and resources — people and supplies — that can be quickly deployed wherever they ’re needed .
Similarly , money spent on intelligence - gathering makes us safer , regardless of what the next disaster is .
Against terrorism , that includes the NSA and the CIA .
Against natural disasters , that includes the National Weather Service and the National Earthquake Information Center .
Katrina deftly illustrated homeland security ’s biggest challenge : guessing correctly .
The solution is to fund security that does n’t rely on guessing .
Defending against movie plots does n’t make us appreciably safer .
Emergency response does .
It lessens the damage and suffering caused by disasters , whether man-made , like 9/11 , or nature - made , like Katrina .

Etopia News – Asked about the bill ’s prospects on the New Mexico State Senate floor , Mr. Brown said , “ If we can get all the Democrats to show up , I think it has a reasonable chance of passing . ”
He said ( at around 1 pm PST ) that it should be known “ in a few hours ” where the bill will be heard tomorrow .
Mr. Brown also provided these points of contact for those interested in weighing in on the question of the impeachment of George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney :
“ If they just want to put their name down in support on the list , they can call 505-986-4380 . ”

Google Reader is a great webware RSS feed aggregator , but it is n’t without its fair share of flaws .
Search : ability to search through your feeds like you can in Gmail .
The fact there are two methods currently available to add a search feature to Google Reader should be justification enough for the demand for such a feature .
Same Story Consolidation : Google News does this , it would be a natural addition to Google Reader in order to root out redundancy amongst your RSS feeds .
New Story Notifications :
Many software based RSS aggregators allow for pop -up notifications to alert their user to news that was just published .
Why could n’t Google Reader do the same thing with their webware based RSS aggregator much in the way they do in Gmail with Gtalk IM notifications ( though this would certainly require the ability of user customization ) .
Furthermore many users want to see the integration of the Gmail and Google Reader services , as there are also two methods created to combine these two great services together .
It would also seem a logical enough of a move for Google to create standalone Greader software application that does the same thing , but has the benefits that come with a software application .
Aggregation Speed Increase : Google Reader has issues with speed when it comes to delivering your content to you via RSS .
Often there can be a regular 1 to 2 hour delay in receiving your content via RSS , from when it is actually published .
Solve Overflow Memory Leak Problems :
The ability to auto - refresh or just manually refresh your RSS feeds in Google Reader is a great feature , but the downside is you will find all those feeds build up in your session , and if your running Firefox , this can cause some serious memory leaks , if you use it frequently .
The application of these 5 features and fixes for Google Reader could make it formidable contender in the RSS reader market .
· Talk about bad science here
· Where were we ?
Oh yes .
" Dr Gillian McKeith ( PhD ) " , who has a peaktime Channel 4 series on " clinical nutrition " , got her PhD from a non-accredited correspondence school in America and has never published any properly evaluated scientific research .
· Several of you are fans of Ms McKeith , and wrote to express how upset you were that I had childishly attacked her reputation , and not her theories .
Well .
Let 's pick a quote at random .
Chlorophyll is " high in oxygen " .
And the darker leaves on plants are good for you , she explains , because they contain " chlorophyll - the ' blood ' of the plant - which will really oxygenate your blood . "
Here we run into a classic Bad Science problem .
It may be immediately obvious to you that this is pseudoscientific , made up nonsense ( and from the TV personality the Radio Times described as " no nonsense " , no less ) .
If it 's not obvious nonsense to you , then , OK , just this once : the real science .
Chlorophyll is a small green molecule that uses the energy from light to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen .
Plants then use this sugar energy to make everything else they need , like protein , and you breathe in the oxygen , and maybe you even eat the plants .
You also breathe out carbon dioxide .
It 's all so beautiful , so gracefully simple , yet so rewardingly complex , so neatly connected , not to mention true , that I can't imagine why you 'd want to invent nonsense to believe instead .
But there you go .
That 's alternative therapists all over .
· It 's very dark in your bowels .
There is no light there .
Nor are there gills in your bowels .
Even fish do not have gills in their bowels .
Consequently the chlorophyll will not create oxygen , and even if it did , even if Dr Gillian McKeith PhD stuck a searchlight up your bum to prove a point , you would not absorb any even slightly significant amount of oxygen with your bowel .
And in case you think I 'm being selective , and only quoting her most ridiculous moments , there 's more : the tongue is " a window to the organs - the right side shows what the gallbladder is up to , and the left side the liver . "
Raised capillaries on your face are a sign of " digestive enzyme insufficiency - your body is screaming for food enzymes . "
Thankfully , Gillian can sell you some food enzymes from her website .
" Skid mark stools " ( she is obsessed with faeces and colonic irrigation ) are " a sign of dampness inside the body - a very common condition in Britain . "
If your stools are foul smelling you are " sorely in need of digestive enzymes " .
Again .
Her treatment for pimples on the forehead - not pimples anywhere else , mind you , only on the forehead - is a regular enema .
Cloudy urine is " a sign that your body is damp and acidic , due to eating the wrong foods . "
The spleen is " your energy battery " .
· Now will somebody please explain to me how this woman can be on television , every week , wearing a white coat , talking authoritatively about " treating patients " , sticking irrigation equipment into people 's rectums , and coming out with sentences like " each sprouting seed is packed with the nutritional energy needed to create a full grown healthy plant " which are just simply wrong ( the plant gets the energy from sunlight , using chlorophyll , like we said earlier ) .
She is a menace to the public understanding of science , and anyone who gives her a platform should be ashamed of themselves .

Scientists have used quantum physics to zap an encrypted message more than 140 kilometres between two Spanish islands .
Professor Anton Zeilinger from the University of Vienna and an international team of scientists used ' spooky ' pulses of light to send the message .
They say this is an important step towards making international communications more secure .
Zeilinger described the study this week at the Australian Institute of Physics meeting in Brisbane .
The photons they sent were linked together through a process known as quantum entanglement .
This means that their properties remained tightly entwined or entangled , even when separated by large distances , a property Einstein called spooky .
The group 's achievement is important for the emerging field of quantum cryptography , which aims to use properties such as entanglement to send encrypted messages .
Research groups around the world are working in this field .
But until now they have only been able to send messages relatively short distances , limiting their usefulness .
Zeilinger 's team wants to be able to beam the messages to satellites in space , so they could theoretically be relayed anywhere on the planet .
To test their system , the team went to Tenerife in the Canary Islands , where the European Space Agency operates a telescope specifically designed to communicate with satellites .
Instead of pointing the telescope at the stars , Zeilinger says , the scientists turned it to the horizontal and aimed it towards a photon sending station 144 kilometres away on the neighbouring island of La Palma .
" Very broadly speaking , we were able to establish a quantum communication connection , " he says .
" We worried a lot about whether atmospheric turbulence would destroy the quantum states .
But it turned out to work much better than we feared .
" The results suggest it should be possible to send encrypted photons to a satellite orbiting 300 or 400 kilometres above the Earth , he says .
" This is our hope .
We believe that such a system is feasible .
" The next step is to try the system out with an actual satellite , a project which is likely to involve the European Space Agency and others .
" This is about developing quantum communications on a grand scale , " Zeilinger says .
His team expects to publish its results soon .
“ It was like Communist Russia , ” said Rabbi Konikov , who said his grandfather had fled the Soviet Union to escape religious oppression .
He has continued to hold services in his home .
“ It was very satisfying to see that , at the end , our Constitution and our American values and freedoms came through for us . ”
Other zoning challenges , all invoking the 2000 law , have been filed by a Sikh society that wants to build a temple in a low - density residential area of Yuba City , Calif . ; a Hindu congregation seeking permission to expand its temple and cultural center on a busy highway in Bridgewater , N.J. ; and a Muslim organization that has been trying for years to build a mosque on land that the local government in Wayne Township , N.J. , now wants to buy for open space .
Seeking a Protective Balance
Critics of the 2000 law argue that the First Amendment itself has long prohibited religious discrimination in zoning , and that such zoning decisions could have been challenged just as successfully in the courts if the law had never been passed .
When Congress considered the law , “ what was actually being discussed was ‘ How do we make sure churches do n’t get discriminated against , ’ ” said Marci A. Hamilton , a law professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in Manhattan and the author of “ God vs. The Gavel : Religion and the Rule of Law ” ( Cambridge University Press , 2005 ) , which calls for closer scrutiny of some religious exemptions , especially those affecting land use and family law .
“ Unfortunately , the answer was to give such an expansive remedy that not only are they not getting discriminated against , but they are now capable of discriminating against all other landowners , ” added Professor Hamilton , who is advising Boulder County in its case .
The financial stakes in the Boulder lawsuit are large .
Under the 2000 law , if the county loses , it will have to pay not only its own legal bills but also those of the church .
If the church loses , it will sacrifice the money it has spent on legal , architectural and public relations fees , but it will not be required to pay the county ’s legal bills .
And unlike the county , it could seek free legal help from various religious advocacy groups , although it has not yet done so .
While a county victory might provide other local governments with a template for defending against similar challenges , some lawyers fear that if Boulder County , with its long history of careful land - use planning and its environmentally demanding voters , cannot successfully argue that preserving open space is a “ compelling public interest , ” few local governments could .
The house in Mahmudiya where the rape and killings took place
Sgt Paul Cortez will no longer face the death penalty and has agreed to co-operate in the trials of three other men , his lawyer said .
A fifth man , Spc James Barker , pleaded guilty in November and was sentenced to life in prison .
The case is one of several in which US troops are accused of killing Iraqis .
Prosecutors say the five plotted the attack on the girl and her family .
Several cases
The soldiers are accused of breaking into the girl 's home , raping and murdering her , and then killing her parents and her six - year - old sister .
" Sgt Cortez is going to go in and accept the responsibility for his part in what occurred , " his lawyer William Cassara said .
Sgt Cortez is going to go in and accept the responsibility for his part in what occurred
Lawyer William Cassara
" Our version of events is that he knew what was going to take place and participated as an observer . "
He is expected to officially enter his plea on 20 February in a hearing at Fort Campbell , Kentucky , home of the 101st Airborne Division which all five soldiers belonged to .
Two other soldiers - Pvt Jesse Spielman and Pvt Bryan Howard - are facing court - martial proceedings on charges related to the attack .
Former soldier Steven Green has been charged in a civilian court in Kentucky with murder and sexual assault .
He has denied the charges .
The Mahmudiya case is one of several involving accusations of US attacks or abuses against Iraqi civilians .
A marine , Cpl Trent Thomas , has pleaded guilty to the murder of an Iraqi man in the town of Hamdaniya .
Cpl Thomas is one of seven marines and a navy medic charged in the April , 2006 kidnapping and killing of 52 - year - old Hashim Awad .
Petty Officer Melson J Bacos was sentenced to 10 years in prison last October but is expected to spend one year in jail after agreeing to give evidence against the seven marines charged with the murder .
The news of Mr. Randall ’s late fatherhood — and that of other celebrity SODs around the same time — evoked a fair amount of tut - tutting .
Some joked that these creaky specimens would n’t be able to head off their tykes as they marred the walls with crayon or played in traffic .
Others thought SODs inherently selfish , knowing they might die before their new children were grown .
“ To intentionally deprive a child of a father is an awful sin , ” one reader wrote in reaction to my article .
Under the circumstances , it seemed natural to check in with some of the same fathers 10 years later to see how they are faring in their eighth or even ninth decade .
Mortality is the issue paramount in most of their minds , although whether it is more so compared with other men their age is difficult to say .
A decade ago , Sy Coopersmith , a psychotherapist who lives in Great Neck , N.Y. , told me that his young daughter , Andie , “ wants to know if I ’m going to live , and I say , ‘ I hope so — until you ’re a grown woman . ’ ” So far , so good .
Andie is 16 , and Mr. Coopersmith is 75 .
That he could die before his daughter reaches adulthood “ is a reality that I live with , ” he said .
“ When we got married , my wife had me promise that I ’d give her at least 10 years . ”
Mr. Coopersmith could be reasonably confident about keeping that promise : when Andie was born , he was just shy of 60 .
At that age , according to the National Center for Health Statistics , the average American man can expect to live 20.5 years longer .
Many well - known figures have lately joined the SOD ranks .
Among them are Rod Stewart , who had a son when he was 60 ; Paul McCartney ( a daughter at 61 ) ; and Kenny Rogers ( identical twin boys at 65 ) .
In 2004 , at 63 , the actor George Lazenby had a son ; a twin boy and girl followed in 2005 .
Julio Iglesias , 63 , is expecting his wife to give birth shortly .
NASA Shows Future Space Telescopes Could Detect Earth Twin
Three simulated planets -- one as bright as Jupiter , one half as bright as Jupiter and one as faint as Earth -- stand out plainly in this image created from a sequence of 480 images captured by the High Contrast Imaging Testbed at JPL .
A roll - subtraction technique , borrowed from space astronomy , was used to distinguish planets from background light .
The asterisk marks the location of the system 's simulated star .

Pasadena CA ( JPL ) Apr 12 , 2007
For the first time ever , NASA researchers have successfully demonstrated in the laboratory that a space telescope rigged with special masks and mirrors could snap a photo of an Earth - like planet orbiting a nearby star .
This accomplishment marks a dramatic step forward for missions like the proposed Terrestrial Planet Finder , designed to hunt for an Earth twin that might harbor life .
Trying to image an exoplanet - a planet orbiting a star other than the sun - is a daunting task , because its relatively dim glow is easily overpowered by the intense glare of its much bigger , brighter parent star .
The challenge has been compared to looking for a firefly next to a searchlight .
Now , two researchers at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , have shown that a fairly simple coronagraph - an instrument used to " mask " a star 's glare - paired with an adjustable mirror , could enable a space telescope to image a distant planet 10 billion times fainter than its central star .
" Our experiment demonstrates the suppression of glare extremely close to a star , clearing a field dark enough to allow us to see an Earth twin .
This is at least a thousand times better than anything demonstrated previously , " said John Trauger , lead author of a paper appearing in the April 12 issue of Nature .
This paper describes the system , called the High Contrast Imaging Testbed , and how the technique could be used with a telescope in space to see exoplanets .
The lab experiment used a laser as a simulated star , with fainter copies of the star serving as " planets . "
To date , scientists have used various techniques to detect more than 200 exoplanets .
Most of these exoplanets are from five to 4,000 times more massive than Earth , and are either too hot , too cold or too much of a giant gas ball to be considered likely habitats for life .
So far , no one has managed to capture an image of an exoplanetary system that resembles our own solar system .
Scientists are eager to take a closer look at nearby systems , to hunt for and then characterize any Earth - like planets - those with the right size , orbit and other traits considered friendly for life .
In the lab demonstration , the High Contrast and Imaging Testbed overcame two significant hurdles that all telescopes face when trying to image exoplanets - diffracted and scattered light .
When starlight hits the edge of a telescope 's primary mirror , it becomes slightly disturbed , producing a pattern of rings or spikes surrounding the major source of light in the focused image .
This diffracted light can completely obscure any planets in the field of view .
To address this problem , Trauger and his colleagues at JPL fashioned a pair of masks for their system .
The first , which resembles a blurry barcode , directly blocks most of the starlight , while the second clears away the diffracted rings and spikes .
The combination creates enough darkness to allow the light of any planets to shine through .
" Mathematically , and sort of magically , this coronagraph blocks both the central star and its rings , " said Wesley Traub of JPL , co-author of the new paper and Terrestrial Planet Finder project scientist .
Scattered light presents the additional hurdle .
Minor ripples on a telescope 's mirror produce " speckles " - faint copies of a star , shifted to the side , which can also hide planets .
In the High Contrast Imaging Testbed , a deformable mirror the size of a large coin limits scattered light .
With a surface that can be altered ever so slightly by computer - controlled actuators , this mirror compensates for the effects of minor imperfections in the telescope and instrument .
" This result is important because it points the way to building a space telescope with the ability to detect and characterize Earth - like planets around nearby stars , " Traub said .
For their next steps , Trauger and Traub plan to improve the suppression of speckles by a factor of 10 , and extend the method to accommodate many wavelengths of light simultaneously .
W hy I passed up the chance to work at Apple
~ 21 February 2006 ~
I ’ve oft quoted Michael Porter ’s strategy maxim in recent months :
“ The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do . ”
Never did I expect those words to hit so close to home .
Only recently was all of this — “ this ” being the chance to work at Apple — laid to rest , ending several months of talks and bringing a close to the toughest challenge , by far , of my career to date .
Following is an account of how it started , and yes , how it ended .
For years I ’ve literally dreamed of working at Apple .
Who has n’t ?
For a designer , it ’s the holy grail of aesthetic accolade .
Through a series of related events , a recruiter at Apple contacted a certain high - level person in the industry .
This person then asked me if I wanted my name in the collective applicant hat , which eventually produced a call from the recruiter .
To ALA ’s credit , this all happened shortly after “ Good Designers Redesign , Great Designers Realign ” was published ; the article in which I extol the virtues of redesigning based on need rather than want , with a pinch of Apple iLife branding thrown in to support my arguments .
The timing could n’t have been better given the position they were looking to fill .
( The article was mentioned on several occasions in our discussions . )
And what was the position for , you ask ?
Well , to protect Apple ’s right to secrecy , I wo n’t disclose too many details .
But suffice it say I would have been managing the design of a certain place within their site where they showcase a lot of product .
The Interview (s )
On the heels of a few successful phone conversations , I was flown out on a cold November evening .
Interviews with several members of the team were to be held the next morning .
And yet here I was in a lush hotel room , almost pinching myself to be certain this was really happening .
“ Am I really here in Cupertino ?
Am I really about to interview with Apple tomorrow ?
No way . ”
Yes way .
The following morning I endured 6.5 hours — yes , I said 6.5 hours — of interviews .
Straight through .
Even lunch was an interview .
The only breaks I enjoyed were spent in the men ’s room .
Interviewing with several members on a team is n’t unusual these days , especially at the likes of Google , Yahoo , and a host of other tech companies .
Needless to say , however , fielding questions and selling yourself for nearly a full day is quite exhausting .
But I thoroughly enjoyed it , and the team members were both fascinating and brilliant .
Two of the designers I would have been working closely with were particularly savvy .
The interviews concluded , I returned home , and in the ensuing weeks Suzanne and I discussed it at length .
And I mean at length .
The pros .
The cons .
The once - in - a - lifetime opportunity .
The sacrifices .
Let it be said that the chance to work at Apple , the prestige that comes from doing so , and the challenge of working with a highly talented team was undeniably attractive .
But regrettably , it was the other parts of the equation that were n’t , well , quite as attractive .
Weighing Pros and Cons
Amidst a sea of pros and cons , two factors weighed heavily on the decision we ’d end up making : cost of living and flexibility of schedule .
Having grown up in the Bay Area and still in touch with family and friends , it came as no surprise that housing is ridiculously expensive .
One can talk all day about the economics of supply and demand and how the market is merely working towards equilibrium , but when the same humble home I have now in Utah is priced at five times the cost in Cupertino — nearly a million dollar home —
I ’m left only to wonder where the buck will stop .
Or in this case , where it does n’t .
Further , housing in the area is n’t kind to a 6 - member family .
Being a sole provider of income for that same 6 - member family is n’t a kind proposal either .
On top of all this , we were considering scenarios which reduced commute time , limiting ourselves to homes closer to Apple headquarters , and therefore driving the overall cost of living even higher .
But enough about money .
How about the intangible pros and cons ?
Flexibility of schedule ?
Time with family ?
Freedom to speak at conferences , author articles , and the like on the clock instead of off ?
Knowing I ’d have to dedicate myself 100 % at Apple , this would have resulted in nearly a total reduction in blogging , conference speaking , and the like .
I did the work - a - long - day - go - home - to - hours - of - side - work thing for years before going solo , and the daily grind took its toll on me physically and mentally .
And the family , too .
Needless to say , I ’m done robbing hours from the wife and kids .
While work is going quite well and showing no signs of slowing , I do n’t know that I ’ll bring in more revenue freelancing this year than I would have at Apple .
But increased time to be with family , pursue hobbies , and live a life a bit less hectic is n’t exactly something you can pin a dollar amount to .
Do n’t get me wrong —
Suzanne and I both agreed at the outset of making the leap to full - time freelancing that we ’d probably be back on the clock at some point .
It seems inevitable and probably welcomed if the right opportunity comes along .
But we felt it was too early to resume a corporate lifestyle right now .
The Decision
The final decision ?
Well , it ’s obvious at this point .
You probably wo n’t see me gracing the streets of Cupertino tomorrow or even dining with Paul Nixon or Dunstan Orchard at Caffé Macs .
Also , it ’s only fair to state that there was never a formal offer on the table .
But it ’s probably safe to say that was because we could n’t come to an agreement on a few key terms of the deal , most notably those mentioned here .
Call it a “ mutual parting of ways ” that occurred just a couple of weeks ago .
Funny thing is , I ’m still not 100 % certain I made the right decision by not making myself more available .
I do n’t know that I ’ll ever be .
Yet Suzanne and I said the very same thing back when we made the leap to full - time self - employment , and somehow it turned out to prove we were wiser than we thought .
Thus , with fingers crossed , I suppose all I can say is this :
Here ’s to low cost of living and flexibility of schedule .

A Game Grammar
by Stéphane Bura
Introduction
This is a reaction to Raph Koster 's GDC 2005 presentation : A GRAMMAR OF GAMEPLAY : Game Design Atoms , Can Games Be Diagrammed ?
Raph 's work has often been a source of inspiration to me , so I hope to give a little bit back with this .
The goal of this document is to present a grammar enabling game designers to describe games in a useful manner .
By useful , I mean that this grammar should allow us to :
Communicate the underlying principles of a game :
How are the different parts of the game linked ?
What kind of interaction is there between the players ?
Are there winning strategies or exploits ?
Etc .
Doodle a game on a napkin , as Raph puts it .
After working on the problem a bit , I came to the conclusion - as Raph posits - that a useful game grammar would mostly describe constituative rules , as defined by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman in Rules of Play :
The constituative rules of a game are the underlying formal structures that exist " below the surface " of the rules presented to players .
These formal structures are logical and mathematical . [...]
Working at this level also requires some assumptions , such as assuming that all the players follow the implicit rules ( etiquette ) .
For instance , in a competitive game , all players must play to the best of their abilities to win .
This article mostly talks about how I came up with a diagram for Checkers , since it 's the example used in Raph 's talk , but you 'll find diagrams for other games as well therein .
This grammar could benefit from more research in order to become a generic tool .
This is only a first step and I welcome feedback .
Grammar elements
The proposed grammar is heavily influenced by my experience with Petri Nets and cybernetics .
Non-standard Petri Nets ( with colored tokens and inhibitors ) can describe complex processes and system states with very few elements .
It 's also very easy to jot down a messy representation of a system just by describing it verbally - using natural language - and associating token and places to resources or states and transitions to " stuff the system does " .
A basic understanding of cybernetics also helps with managing the feedback loops that give structure to almost all balanced games .
Because of this heritage , the game diagrams end up looking like flowcharts .
However , they are not flowcharts of games or rules .
They 're closer to data - flow representations of processes .
This first iteration of the grammar is composed of the following elements :
Resource box
Link
Transition
Resource tokens
Source
Sink
Inhibitor link
" If empty " link
Variable link
End state
Diagram elements
The four most common elements are resource boxes ( hereafter , boxes ) and tokens , links and transitions .
A box holds tokens .
Links are oriented and can only exist from a box to a transition , from a transition to a box , but not from a box to a box or from a transition to a transition .
A transition consumes tokens from all the boxes linked to it and generates tokens in all the boxes linked from it .
The amount of tokens consumed or generated is specified by each link .
In this article , a thin link denotes a small amount of tokens , a thick one , a large amount [ we wo n't need more precise measures for our examples . ] .
A transition can only be triggered if there are enough tokens to " pay the cost " of each inbound link .
Note :
In this article , resource boxes are depicted by actual " boxes " in order to emphasize the downward flow of tokens .
Any shape can be used instead .
Petri Nets use circles .
It 's easier to think in terms of consumption and generation instead of imagining that tokens are somehow transformed from one resource into another , since the latter metaphor breaks down in the second and third examples below .
Basic transitions
A few " A " tokens and a lot of " B " tokens are needed to trigger the transition in order to generate a lot of " C " tokens
Most of the time , transitions denotes actions in the game .
In the following examples of game diagrams , I 've tried to find an isomorphism between the atomic transitions and the actions permitted by the operational rules ( the rules of the game proper ) , but I did n't let myself be limited by that , as we 'll see in the abstraction section below .
However , transitions represent discrete game state changes caused by a player 's choice .
A source continuously generates tokens at a rate specified by its outbound link ( number of tokens per time unit ) .
Sources are usually linked to boxes but can sometimes be directly linked to transition , for simplicity , as it's the case in the Decay of preparation in a skill - based game ludeme below .
A sink consumes tokens .
It 's just an aesthetic element to avoid having transitions with no outbound links .
Source and sink
An inhibitor link links a box to a transition .
If the stated amount of tokens is consumed , the transition cannot be triggered during the same time unit .
An inhibitors link is denoted by a circle at its end .
An " If empty " link originates from a box .
It generates its specified amount of tokens each time unit said box is empty of tokens .
An " If empty " link is denoted by a diamond at its origin .
The amount of tokens specified by a variable link can change each time unit according a function ( often a random law ) that must be defined or by events outside the magic circle .
A variable link is denoted by a dotted line .
An end state is an element that can only have inbound links .
It usually is linked to a transition but can also be directly linked to a box for simplicity .
When one of its inbound links transfers token ( s ) , the game ends .
The nature of the end state defines the outcome of the game ( victory , stalemate , etc. ) .
An end state is denoted by a circle .
The " If empty " link is mostly used for victory conditions or in situations like the one in diagram A below ( if empty then inhibit ) , which is shorthand for diagram B .
Here 's an example for a simple game .
In this game , the player plays against the house .
Each turn , he throws a P - sided die and adds the number he gets to his score , which starts at zero .
If his score reaches or exceeds a target number in N turns or less , he wins .
Otherwise , the house wins .
This game diagram is :
Notes : " D.U.D . ( 1..P ) " stands for discrete uniform distribution for a set of integer values from 1 to P , i.e. what a fair die generates .
Colors are used to differentiate the players ( blue for player , red for the house ) .
This game is not very interesting :
The lonely transition indicates that there are no choices for the player to make .
Conceptual Tools
Abstraction
If we look at the example above , we might think that this grammar is well suited for describing operational rules .
There even is an isomorphism between the rule elements of the game and its diagram 's elements .
Actually , it 's a mistake to think that way and , I believe , a mental block that has prevented game notations from flourishing up till now .
If we were to try to describe Checkers operational rules with such a grammar , we 'd end up with an unwieldly diagram , too complex because we'd have to represent within it the mechanisms for movement , capture , promotion , etc .
Furthermore , the operational rules do n't cover what we really need from such a diagram : the tactical and strategic elements ( the concept of sacrifice , preparing multiple captures , showing that Checkers is a game of skill , etc. ) .
So , instead of mapping our diagram elements onto the ones described by the operational rules , we 'll use abstract elements created specifically for each diagram .
We 'll see that some of these elements can be re-used from one game to another , especially the elements related to " Skill " , " Luck " and " Preparation " resource tokens .
How far can we go with abstraction ?
Fairly far .
For instance , here 's an abstracted view of Blackjack :
Abstract Blackjack
Let 's take a moment to understand how this diagram works and what it means .
Fisrt off , we see no mention of cards , hitting , standing , 17 or 21 .
What 's going on and how can this diagram explain the constituative rules of blackjack ?
This diagram is not meant to teach us how to play Blackjack well at the hand level .
It deals with how Blackjack works over a longer period of time .
It shows that ( for the player ) Blackjack is a game of resource and risk management .
Blackjack , like all non-competitive casino games , is about one thing only :
Can the player beat the odds ?
So , almost naturally , the relevant resources become Skill and Money ( the measure of success ) for the player and Luck for the house .
The amounts of money a player brings to a game , gains or loses vary widly .
Money operates outside the magic circle : the player stops playing when he feels he has won or lost enough .
This is represented by the values of the links to the end states ( P and M ) that the player can dynamically set himself ( during the course of the game ) .
If he leaves with a profit , he wins .
If not , the house wins .
The player " spends " his skill to gain money and avoid risk .
The house spends its luck to prevent player gains and to cause him losses .
Time is also abstracted here .
There are no turns or hands depicted in the diagram .
Resources flow continuously from the sources and are spent simultaneously by both players .
Blackjack gives choices to the player because he usually does n't have enough skill to spend on both transition all the time .
He must gamble that when he does n't inhibit the risk transition , the house 's luck has run out .
We see that , apart from the sources and the resources names , the diagram is symmetrical regarding both opponents ( I could have made that clearer by using a box for the house 's money instead of a sink ) .
So , if the house wants to win more often than the player , it just has to make sure that , over time , its source produces more tokens than the player's .
Casinos achieve this by carefully choosing the random laws for their sources and by capping the flow of players ' skill sources ( for instance , by forbidding card counting ) .
As said above , this diagram is not very helpful in describing how the actual game plays .
If needed , the actual hand playing diagram can be described elsewhere , as a sub - game to the main game ( beating the odds ) .
The corresponding sub - diagram would have sources and sinks that represent tokens spent and generated in the main diagram .
Such a sub - diagram is n't the detailed description of a transition .
Here , for instance , it would describe both transitions at once .
Note : Depending on the actual link values and random law , the above diagram can be used for most non-competitive casino games .
Diagram folding in symmetrical games
Colored Petri Nets can represent very complex symmetrical processes ( such as the exchanges between two computers , alternatively client and server ) with only one instance of the symmetrical part , using a technique called " folding " .
I 'll use a similar idea here for diagrams of games assigning symmetrical roles to each player ( Checkers , Chess , Parcheesi , etc. ) or symmetrical roles at the constituative level : I 'll represent the game as seen from the point of view of one of the players .
The representation of other players ' elements is only necessary when resources are transferred from one to another .
Thus , such a game diagram is only part of the complete picture :
One needs as many diagrams as there are players to describe a game state .
But you need only one to fully describe the process .
Here 's an example for the " Rock - Paper - Scissors " game :
Folded RPS diagram
Again , there 's no mention of turns or of circular relative order of symbols .
These rules have little to do with how the game is played : it 's a bluffing game ( thin Skill links ) with a strong random component ( thick Luck link ) .
If the player is more skilled than his opponent , his " bluff " transition will sometimes trigger ( if the Skill tokens flow of his opponent is not high enough to always inhibit the transition ) .
There is only one end state .
The first player to reach his , in his own diagram , wins .
Incidentally , the RPS diagram hints at the best strategy :
Be lucky and play randomly , as bluffing is not very cost effective .
Another option is to use the metagame to begin the game with some tokens in the Preparation box ( " Rock is strong ! " ) .
This folded diagram contains the skill sources of both players .
Thus , the player represented here also has his skill source in his opponent 's diagram , linked with an inhibitor to his opponent 's bluff transition .
This means that there is a choice where to allocate the skill tokens .
In RPS , it represents how seemingly predictable a player tries to be before springing a trap .
The opponent 's luck is included to signify that both players can't be lucky at the same time .
If we admit this as a general rule , we can dispense from including the opponents ' luck hereafter .
We can then replace the upper right part of the diagram with a thick variable link from the player 's luck source :
Revised " Rock Paper Scissors "
Preparation
The Preparation box in the RPS diagram does not reflect the number of games won by the player .
It 's an abstract resource .
Preparation is one of the " ingredients " of Raph 's grammar :
Territory
Preparation
Core mechanic
Range of challenges
Choice of abilities
Skill required
Variable feedback
Dealing with the Mastery Problem
Cost of failure
Preparation stands for logical connections between atomic transitions and prior choices made that influence the next atomic transition .
In a simplified version of a diagram , all the preparation tokens go into the same box where they are differentiated by color .
A more comprehensive diagram should have one preparation box for each color .
This is helpful when gameplay relies on a lot of small preparations of different natures :
What is lost and gained when a played jumps in a FPS ?
What is the difference between a standard block and a low block in a combat game ?
Etc .
Using colors for the preparation tokens and the transitions that generate and consume them let us describe high - level processes : Chaining ( plot sequence , combos ) , recursion ( multi - level resources combination in crafting ) , or parallelism ( attack & defense , skill trees and stats ) .
Yet , for the purpose of producing napkin diagrams , treating preparation as one resource is often enough .
In a purely skill - based game , the player with the highest skill must win more often than his opponent ( s ) - if no alliances between weaker opponents are possible .
How do we convey that ?
The players accrue preparation tokens using skill and atomic transitions .
Those tokens are needed to trigger a victory condition transition that leads to a Victory end state :
Simplified diagram for a skill - based game
Ludeme : Decay of preparation in a skill - based game
However , victory of the most skilled player is not automatic .
He can make bad choices ( which give preparation tokens to his opponent ) , focus too much on defense or fail to act at the right time .
The sub - diagram below reflect this .
It is part of all diagrams for skill - based games ( even non-symmetrical ones ) .
Ludeme : Decay of preparation in a skill - based game
Note : this ludeme can easily be adapted for more than two players .
Risk - Free Transitions
A risk - free transition earns preparation tokens to a player without costing him anything beyond the time it takes to execute it .
Risk - free transitions are often reversible .
They look like this in a diagram :
Risk - free transition
Note :
The dotted line - inhibitor link clumsily represents that , sometimes , special conditions are required for a risk - free transition to become available .
Another way to show that could be to expand the grammar with conditional transition or , probably better , add a layer to the diagram for the operational rules .
The transitions in that layer could link from and to all the boxes in the diagram , would have priority over those in the constituative rules layer , and trigger automatically when their inputs are valid .
For instance , outside of combat , avatar movement in an MMOG is a risk - free transition .
Checkers
Here the folded diagram for Checkers :
Checkers - the napkin version
A player wins when his opponent can no longer make a legal move .
The relevant resource is then Moves , the only box containing tokens at the beginning of the game .
The player uses Moves tokens to generate preparation tokens .
This reflects the rule that normal pieces can only move forward , thus decreasing the number of potential moves each time they do .
The dotted line from the opponent 's Moves box means that some default move sometimes block the opponent 's pieces .
However , the most efficient way to make him lose Moves tokens is through capture , that is made easier through sacrifice , which itself costs a lot of Moves tokens .
A king move in checkers is very close to a risk - free transition .
Since it produces preparation tokens and can lead to victory , playing with one 's kings would clearly constitute an exploit if there were n't rules to counter - balance it .
The first one of these rules is that kings can be captured .
The second one addresses the fact that since a king move does n't cost Moves tokens , this could lead to infinite games .
Thus , the rules of Checkers specify that a given board configuration cannot be repeated more than a limited number of times ( this operational rule is not represented in the diagram ) .
Conclusion
This is only an early stab at the game diagramming problem .
If this model seems to be adequate for communicating about simple games , more complex ones would prove too problematic at this time .
Furthermore , since it does not take into account the operational rules of the game , one cannot reverse - engineer changes to a game diagram to find corresponding changes in the game rules .
To improve the grammar , we 'd need rules about how to break down a game into sub-diagrams , a library of ludemes with agreed upon inputs and outputs , some knowledge about what the relevant resources are for different categories of games , a way to represent overall difficulty , techniques to link operational and constituative rules , etc .
Baring that , this grammar will remain a simple descriptive tool instead of an analytical or even a design tool .
So , if you have ideas about improvements , let me know .
March 2006
Sunday Discussion Group
I ’ve been thinking a lot this week about whether we ’re in the midst of a sea-change when it comes to the role of blogs in driving the political discourse .
Granted , it ’s been happening slowly for a while .
The Plame scandal has always struck me as the first turning point .
Between July 14 , 2003 and September 26 , 2003 — the 10 weeks between the original publication of Bob Novak ’s now - infamous column to the day MSNBC first reported that the CIA has asked the Justice Department for a formal criminal investigation , blogs were the only sources of information about the controversy .
In that time , the NYT ran just one news item on the story ( on page A8 ) .
The WaPo ran five paragraphs on the story at the end of an unrelated article , which was published on A20 .
Over those same 10 weeks , progressive bloggers immediately realized the story ’s significance and offered near - blanket coverage .
Marshall , Yglesias , and Kleiman ran five posts each , Drum did nine , I wrote seven , etc .
When the story finally hit the front pages after the DoJ investigation started , Slate ’s Jack Shafer wrote that reporters were caught flat - footed .
An above - the - fold piece in the Post , Shafer said , sent “ the rest of the press corps to the blogosphere … to catch up ” on the details .
Shafer ’s piece was lost in the shuffle , but that sentence struck me as quite an admission .
Professional political reporters in DC , who are supposed to be covering stories like these , had no idea what was going on — so they had to rely on blogs .
The major traditional news outlets had ignored the story ; we did n’t .
Bloggers frequently rely on traditional outlets for news coverage , but in this case , the tables were turned .
It was the start of a trend .
Most notably , when it comes to the prosecutor purge scandal , it was Josh Marshall who connected the dots .
In December , Josh Marshall , who owns and runs TPM , posted a short item linking to a news report in the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette about the firing of the U.S. attorney for that state .
Marshall later followed up , adding that several U.S. attorneys were apparently being replaced and asked his 100,000 or so daily readers to write in if they knew anything about U.S. attorneys being fired in their areas .
For the two months that followed , Talking Points Memo and one of its sister sites , TPM Muckraker , accumulated evidence from around the country on who the axed prosecutors were , and why politics might be behind the firings .
The cause was taken up among Democrats in Congress .
One senior Justice Department official has resigned , and Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales is now in the media crosshairs .
How significant is this shift ?
Time ’s Jay Carney acknowledged this week that he and his colleagues simply did n’t appreciate what the blogs thought was obvious .
Josh Marshall at TalkingPointsMemo and everyone else out there whose instincts told them there was something deeply wrong and even sinister about the firings , and who dug around and kept writing about them while Iglesias decided whether to talk to the press or go quietly on to his next job , deserve tremendous credit .
When this story first surfaced , I thought the Bush White House and Justice Department were guilty of poorly executed acts of crass political patronage .
I called some Democrats on the Hill ; they were “ concerned ” , but this was not a priority .
The blogosphere was the engine on this story , pulling the Hill and the MSM along .
But traditional media skepticism about “ blog stories ” has hardly disappeared .
Digby noted the other day , after watching Hardball , that a there ’s still a little “ beltway reflexive dismissiveness of anything ‘ the left ’ finds important . ”
After noting new revelations that Bush may have blocked a Justice Department investigation on the NSA wiretap program in order to protect Gonzales , Digby wrote :
This is all part of a very large mosaic of government secrecy , political backstabbing and abuse of power .
Those of us who were screaming about this until we are hoarse were dismissed out of hand when we argued that no administration should be allowed to seize such unchecked power and the assumption among the establishment was that it was just more of our “ unhinged ” hysteria .
It was n’t .
This stuff happened and it ’s likely only the tip of the iceberg .
If the press can get past their loathing of the dirty hippies for five minutes they will see that not only have we been right , we have been flogging some amazingly good stories for the past six years that had they bothered to report them would have been journalistic coups .
We really are n’t that nuts — and the Bush administration really is that bad .
Are traditional media outlets beginning to agree ?
FireDogLake ’s coverage of the Libby trial was must - read content for reporters covering the case .
TPM has made the purge scandal what it is today .
It ’s getting increasingly difficult to dismiss the blogosphere ’s “ dirty hippies ” as wrong and irrelevant .
Is n’t it ?
Promiscuity is common among female rodents , leading to competition between the sperm of rival males over who fertilizes the eggs .
It now seems that possessing a longer penis may give males an advantage in this competition , according to new research to be published in the March issue of The American Naturalist .
Dr. Steve Ramm , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Liverpool , UK , compared the relative size of the penis bone in several mammal groups : " The data for rodents seem pretty clear cut .
Species where sexual competition between males is most intense also tend to have the longest penises .
But , interestingly , a similar pattern was not detected in either primates or bats . "
Understanding the reasons for these differences will require a better understanding of the precise mechanisms through which male rodents benefit from longer penises , something which comparative data alone cannot address .
Overall , the rodent with the longest penis bone relative to its body size in the study was the Western harvest mouse , Reithrodontomys megalotis .
" Everything 's relative of course , " explains Dr. Ramm , " so although big for its body size the penis bone in R. megalotis is still only 7 to 8 mm long .
I do n’t think the phrase ' hung like a harvest mouse ' will be catching on any time soon . "
The study of genitalia has a long history in evolutionary biology .
Because genitalia evolve very rapidly compared to other body structures , they are often the only means through which scientists can tell two closely related species apart .
Since their primary function is essentially the same in all animals , this great diversity in genital structure has been something of a puzzle .
The new research in mammals adds to a growing body of evidence that sexual selection – competition between males and potentially also choice by females – is the driving force responsible .

A new hydrogen bond magnet which is stable up to 200 degrees Celsius .
Credit : University of Oxford
A team of scientists from the US , the UK and Germany has been the first to make a magnetic material constructed from nature 's strongest known hydrogen bond .
Hydrogen bonds are responsible for many of the properties of water and for holding together the DNA double helix .
However , hydrogen bonds are normally rather weak but the new compound contains the bifluoride ion in which a hydrogen atom is tightly bound to two fluorine atoms .
This leads to the new magnet being stable up to 200 degrees Celsius .
The work is published in the latest issue of the journal Chemical Communications , where it features on its cover .
The magnetic properties of the material were measured using muons by a team at Oxford University , headed by Stephen Blundell , Professorial Fellow in Physics at Mansfield College .
He said : ‘ Muons are tiny , sub-atomic particles which can be implanted into materials .
They behave like tiny gyroscopes and spin round when they experience a magnetic field . ’
Using this method , which is uniquely sensitive to magnetism in these types of magnetic material , the researchers found that there is no overall magnetism at room temperature ; however , as the temperature is lowered , copper magnetic moments begin to align , producing a microscopic magnetic field visible to the implanted muons below a temperature of 1.54 Kelvin .
These experiments were performed at ISIS , the world 's most intense source of pulsed muons , located in Oxfordshire , UK .
The team hopes that the magnetic studies will help them understand to what extent bifluoride units and their hydrogen bonds influence the spin arrangement on neighbouring magnetic centres .

2014年度からついに日本に上陸したChromebook。すでに米国では着実にシェアを広げており、その勢いは日本にも迫ろうとしている。
Chromebook とは一体何か。そしてそれがなぜ日本でも注目されているのか。ここではChromebookの概要をおさえつつ、注目が集まる原因について見ていこう。
Chromebookとは？
Chromebookとは、Googleが開発したLinuxベースの独自OS 「 Chrome OS 」 を搭載したノートパソコンのこと。「 Chrome OS 」 がWindows OS やMac OS と大きく異なるのは、それがブラウザベースで動作するOSであるという点だ。
例え ばWindows やMac では、データは通常ローカルドライブに保存するのが一般的だが、「 Chrome OS 」 ではデータはクラウド上に保存するのが基本となっている。
アプリケーションはブラウザ上で動作するものを使うため、ローカルドライブにインストールすることはない。
また 、「 Chrome OS 」 の場合、常に最新のOSに無料で自動更新されるようになっている。Windows OSのように最新のOSを購入するコストはかからず、Mac OSのように手動でOSをバージョンアップする手間もかからない。
Chromebookの魅力とは？
米国 でChromebookが人気となったのは、アップルのiPadよりも安い価格設定にあったと言えるだろう。アップルのiPadが500ドル程度で販売されているのに対してChromebookは200〜300ドル程度で販売されている。
また、最新のOSに切り替えるときにかかる費用が必要かからないことを考えると、低価格のWindows OSを搭載したノートパソコンと比べても割安な感がある。
さら にChromebookの場合、アプリケーションはブラウザベースのものを無料でインストールできる。そのため、WindowsやMacのようにアプリケーションを有料で購入するコストが一切かからない。特にセキュリティ対策として導入するコストを浮かすことができることは、企業や教育機関では大きなメリットとなるだろう。
Chromebookの魅力は、本体価格だけではなく、OSやアプリケーションのコストがかからないところにあると言えそうだ。

Just because someone in the Bush administration does n't mean it 's true -- even if that Bush administration official is under oath :
A Justice Department e-mail released today shows that the former chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales proposed replacement candidates for seven United States attorneys nearly a year before those prosecutors were fired , in contrast to testimony last month in which the aide said that no successors were considered before the firings .
The e-mail written by D. Kyle Sampson , who resigned last month as the top aide to Mr. Gonzales , provides the first evidence that the Justice Department wanted to appoint its own candidates , despite the insistence of Justice Department officials in recent weeks that the eight prosecutors , with one exception , were removed in December 2006 for performance reasons , without regard to who might succeed them .
Now , again , reporters wo n't say that Sampson lied .
But , we will .
He lied .
He lied under oath .
So , to the media : you 're now seeing that Bush officials routinely lie .
They lie even when sworn to tell the truth .
That means they 've been lying to you , too .
Just an FYI .
Andrea Harner blogs her thoughts and shares a persuasive video on 3/30/2007 :
The other weekend we started talking about circumcision at the end of a dinner party and with the help of Wikipedia we studied just the very superficial differences in the photos provided .
We also talked about whether we would have our sons ( assuming we give birth at some point to a son or two ) circumcised .
A blogger who describes herself as " a stay at home mother of 4 , navy wife , and midwifery student " on 3/30/2007 wants to give Baby Talk magazine a piece of her mind on her blog Belly , Breast and Baby about poor guidance on circumcision in their latest edition :
Now this is n't exactly a very informative piece , and it is not exactly giving balanced information , which I am sure you can agree .
Kamie on 3/28/2007 blogs about seeing Penn & Teller 's TV episode about circumcision :
Within the first 5 minutes of the show you see a newborn circumcision take place .
HOLY SHIT HOLY FREAKING SHIT !!!!!!
It was the most barbaric thing I have ever seen done to a newborn .
EVER !
First , the baby boy is placed in a molded plastic tray where his legs and arms are strapped down .
Then a local anesthetic is applied which obviously does NOTHING because when they showed the foreskin being cut off the baby was SCREAMING ... and not the " I'm a little hungry " scream the " STOP CUTTING OFF ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE PARTS OF MY PENIS " scream .
It was horrible .
I 'm not even a mother and my heart physically hurt for the little baby .
Intactivist blogger
Tony writes about Virginia 's " Abraham's Law " on 2/26/2007 at his blog Rolling Doughnut :
A 14 - year - old is legally allowed to reject conventional medical treatment for a life - threatening illness .
This is wholly appropriate , in my opinion , when viewed with the reality that minors are not automatically incompetent and the perspective of Mr. Cherrix 's battle last year .
I 'm glad to see the General Assembly acknowledging such rights .
Looking forward , if a 14 - year - old can reject treatment in a life - threatening situation , how can we continue to assume that infants not facing a life threatening illness , or any illness at all to be more specific , should not be protected by default from circumcision ?
Essentially , the General Assembly seems to be saying that neither parents nor the state own the body of a minor .
So what gives ?
Clearly parental " rights " have limits .
Why is there a limit when there is a life - threatening illness but not when there is no illness ?
Blogger Joseph Froncioni posted a thorough dissertation on circumcision on 2/9/2007 ( emphasis mine ) :
My father refused to have me circumcised and for this I remain eternally grateful .
...
My interest in circumcision has been rekindled primarily by the recent media coverage female genital mutilation has attracted .
This latter practice , based as it is in ignorance and superstition , no doubt deserves all the attention it has garnered and no clear - thinking or fair - minded person can but vociferously support its complete abolition .
What puzzles me though is that among these clear - thinking and fair - mined individuals are those who would , as they decry female genital mutilation , show not one bit of hesitation at having their male children so mutilated .
Granted , the female version of this assault , and assault it is , I assure you , is much more harmful and disfiguring for the victim .
However , I intend to make the case that male infant circumcision , unless performed for true therapeutic indications , is nothing short of medical assault , constitutes a serious abuse of the infant ’s human rights , has no place in an enlightened society and should rightly be referred to as male genital mutilation .
...
Male circumcision is the only medically unnecessary surgery in the USA that is performed without obtaining consent from the patient .
In law , parental rights are derived from parental duty and exist only so long as they are needed for the protection of the person and property of the child .
Giving consent to medical treatment of a child is a clear incident of parental responsibility arising from the duty to protect the child .
This duty is clearly breached when the procedure in question is non-therapeutic , ablative and irreversible .
Joe. My. God. , an activist who blogs about gay culture , took a keen interest on 4/5/2007 in the possibility that New York City might encourage members ( so to speak ) of his community to separate themselves from their foreskins :
I 'll be very surprised if NYC 's black and Hispanic gay men do n't raise hell about this campaign , at least until there is some ( ahem ) hard data proving its worthiness for gay men .
and again , giving his interpretation of the retraction of the absurd and scientifically unfounded scheme days later :
Hoodies And Dockers Safe Again : " Oopsie .
Here 's your foreskin back .
Keep it in a warm dry place .
We 'll be happy to take it out of your hands later , if you are among the millions suffering from ESPS ( Excessive Sexual Pleasure Syndrome . ) "
Here 's what Junichi Semitsu had to say , less contemporaneously , in 2004 when he was considering the issues surrounding circumcision :
With a handful of my friends having children , I find myself revisiting the debate about whether to circumcise .
After years of waffling , I think I 've finally settled my position on this issue .
...
The hilarious history of circumcision in America speaks for itself .
Non-religious infant circumcision did n't become routine in the United States until the late 19th century .
The procedure became popular only because it was thought to control masturbation , which everyone considered to be a sinful act that engendered illnesses ranging from blindness to epilepsy to death .
By restricting movement of the penile shaft , circumcision was thought to reduce the propensity for males to shake hands with their governor .
...
the United States is the only country that routinely continues the practice of performing medically - unnecessary male genital mutilation , which was only popularized as a way of controlling the epidemic problem of masturbation .
As much as I consider myself an American patriot , I 'm going to have side with the rest of the world on this one .
So I 've reached my answer : it does n't make sense to circumcise .
My decision is final .
Tomorrow , I 'm going to go to my doctor and ask to get uncircumcised .
Jenna , " a mother of three ( 10 years , 3 years , 1 year ) " writes at her blog A Mom for All Seasons about circumcision on 3/5/2007 :
Routine newborn circumcision is wrong ... yes , ethically wrong .
I feel extremely strongly about this .
...
I am very concerned that doctors perform this procedure and that health insurance companies pay for it since it is NOT recommended by any medical association ( and it costs money ) .
I can't get a mole removed ... even though it has higher chances of getting cancer than my son's penis .
You wo n't bring in your daughter and ask to have her pinky toe removed .... they would call social services and psych .
But bring your son in and ask to have his penis cut and they say sure .
It is an ethics question .
Anna Olsen posts a long article she 's written about circumcision on her blog on 3/29/2007 :
On the subject of circumcision , I admit to a bias : I am opposed to the routine circumcision of baby boys .
I did n't always feel this way .
Twenty - seven years ago , I gave permission for my son to be circumcised because his father had been and my obstetrician said it was best done for hygiene reasons .
Then , a few years ago , when I was editor of The New Age Connection , an ad crossed my desk from ETHIC ( End the Horror of Circumcision ) .
Horror ?
What horror ?
My son did n't suffer -- did he ?
As I looked into the matter , I grew increasingly appalled that I had unthinkingly sacrificed my son to tradition and medical dogma .
As a result of my research , I wrote " Circumcision : Why fool with Mother Nature ? " which appeared in NAC in the spring of 1990 .
Now , as editor of The Aquarian I again hope to present convincing arguments to persuade parents to leave their baby boys intact .
...
Men who feel violated by circumcision are banding together in increasing numbers to try to halt what they see as child sexual abuse .
... ...
For most Jews , circumcision is a religious rights issue for adults , not a human rights issue for babies .
...
But even this fortress of Jewish tradition is being attacked by Jews who value the rights of the baby over the religious rights of the parents .
Edward Wallerstein was initially pleased that so many gentiles were adopting the Jewish practice of circumcision .
But when he looked into the subject , he changed his mind .
The book that resulted -- Circumcision : An American Health Fallacy -- is now a classic in the anti-circumcision literature .
Moshe Rothenberg is another Jew who is speaking out against circumcision .
A social worker for the New York City Board of Education , Rothenberg presented his arguments at an International Symposia on Circumcision in favour of revising the Jewish ritual of circumcision .
" Circumcision is child abuse .
It is medically unnecessary , " he wrote in the conference program .
... ... " Often the less there is to justify a traditional custom , the harder it is to get rid of it . "
Mark Twain ...
And when you consider the physical and mental suffering imposed on the baby though circumcision , I agree with Dr. Spock when he says , " I would leave the little penis alone . "
Shauna McCluskey from Mississippi blogs her delight on 2/27/2007 :
I am sooooooo happy .
I am a moderator on a birth board and a couple that recently had a son were having trouble deciding whether or not to circumcise him , they have decided to leave him intact .
Josh and I are vehemently against circumcision .
We feel it is a violation of a child 's right to bodily integrity and can be very sexually damaging .
Also I do n't say " uncircumcised " as I feel that this makes it sound like circumcised is the normal way and parents of intact children just have not got around to it yet .
Anyway , if anyone who happens across this blog would like the info on circ , here it is .
First and foremost I feel that all children have the right to bodily integrity .
Therefor I believe that it is not within my rights as a parent to permanently remove a portion of my childs body .
Finally , I bring your attention to Jason Paige , a musician who communicates his feeling about his own ( ritual ) circumcision not by blog , but by song , to the tune of Stevie Wonder 's " Superstition " :

Whether by name , pseudonym , or anonymously , the silence about circumcision is giving way to publicly available expressions of opposition to any male having his options cut off before he can choose for himself .
Many men who 've experienced it consider themselves genitally mutilated .
How many of them can be wrong ?
Support the right of every human to be physically whole .
No person deserves less .

READY or not — and some critics say not — the long - delayed Registered Traveler program is moving forward , with the single existing operator planning a succession of openings soon at four airports , while a competitor says it is about to join in .
Verified Identity Pass Inc. , which began the first Registered Traveler program at Orlando International Airport in July 2005 , is planning to open its second site , in Terminal 7 at Kennedy International Airport , with a target date of Dec. 19 , said Steven Brill , the chief executive of the company , which markets its version of the expedited security program under the name Clear .
He said the company , which has more than 30,000 members at Orlando , is processing applications with the Transportation Security Administration for Kennedy and for San Jose , Calif . ; Cincinnati ; and Indianapolis .
“ We have about 3,000 non-Orlando people signed up so far , ” he said .
“ We ’ve been sort of keeping it quiet because we find it much easier to talk about it once the lanes are open . ”
It must be tough being Tony Snow .
He literally has to stand there every day and defend the indefensible with a straight face .
Jon dissects SnowJob 's artful defense of the " generous offer , " or as they called it on Wednesday , the " reasonable proposal . "

On a personal note , we at C&L wish Tony the very best .
He 's having surgery today to remove a growth in his lower abdomen as a precautionary measure .
Tony overcame colon cancer back in 2005 and we wish him a successful surgery and speedy recovery .

Snuggling under her blankets at bedtime , Ella , 3 , gazed up at me and announced longingly , " I want a new mommy . "
Not even four years into my tenure as Mom and I was already being edged out of the job .
Even worse , Ella started announcing " I want a new mom " frequently , like whenever I failed to buy her a ring pop at the grocery - store checkout .
Some days , it was all I could do not to retort , " Yeah ?
Well , I want a new kid ! "
Developing the knack to verbally push your buttons is just part of your child 's linguistic and behavioral development .
The challenge is to teach her to be courteous while allowing her to assert herself ?
and do it without responding like you 're 3 years old .
What to say ( and what to skip ) in response to these gems :
" Mine ! "
Whatever 18 - month - old Weston Congdon has , his 3 - year - old brother , Addison , wants , even if it 's something that 's collected dust in the toy box for the past six months .
" What drives me crazy is that usually it 's a baby toy , like a teething ring , " says their mom , Sarah , of Ames , Iowa .
" I think , ' What are you gonna do with it other than take it away from your brother ? ' "
Now Weston , a beginning talker , walks around the house repeating " Mine , mine , mine " ad nauseam .
His frustrated mom has been known to retort , " Well , then , the couch is mine and you can't sit on it . "
A better way to respond :
As tempting as it is to give little ones a dose of their own medicine , it wo n't help them see the error of their ways , and it may confuse them .
Yet keeping your cool in the face of " Mine ! " can tax even the most Zen - minded mom .
" Ignoring the behavior is best , but even as a clinical psychologist , I can't , " admits Ray Levy , Ph.D. , a dad of one and the coauthor of " Try and Make Me ! "
" I 'd rather have something to say in response that I can depend on . "
His solution : Toss out a " brain - dead phrase " -- a short - and - sweet sound bite that lets a persistent child know he wo n't get his way .
With a child who insists that everything is his , simply keep repeating , " Sorry " or " It 's nice to want things . "
End of story .
Even if the empty phrase does n't completely shut down the whining , having something -- anything -- to say will keep you from saying something that you should n't .
" It 's not fair . "
Attempts to pry her 4 - year - old son away from one last episode of his favorite show usually turn into major bedtime battles for Anne Eide of Columbus , Mississippi .
" William will say , ' But it 's not fair ! '
Then he 'll cross his arms and stomp down the hall , come back again , and repeat , ' Mom , it 's not fair . ' "
That 's when Eide sometimes can't help but let loose with " Listen here , Mister , you either turn off the TV now or you wo n't watch it for a week ! "
A better way to respond :
On nights when she 's a tad more patient , Eide uses a kid- friendly example to explain why he does n't always get his way .
" I say , ' Daddy does n't want to be in school all the time , but right now he needs to . ' "
Translation : Even adults do n't get everything they want .
The approach usually works .
" He looks at me kind of like , ' Oookay . '
Then he goes and gets ready for bed , " says Eide .
Mary Sheedy Kurcinka , a mom of two and author of " Kids , Parents , and Power Struggles , " recommends asking your child to start over and try again with less irritating words , such as " Can we please talk about this ? " or " Mom , I do n't like that rule . "
Next time he complains that something 's not fair , you can say , " Remember , we talked about this before .
What words are you supposed to use instead ? "
Giving your child new ways to express himself makes him more likely to abandon the annoying ones .
" You 're not the boss of me . "
Eleanor Petersen of St. Louis , Missouri , wants to do everything herself .
So when her mom , Amy , was in a rush and buckled the car seat for her , Eleanor , 3 , declared , " You 're not the boss of me . "
Petersen had to bite her tongue to keep from answering , " You wanna bet ? "
A better way to respond : " As a mom , you have to try not to get caught up in the words and instead connect with the feeling underneath them , " says Kurcinka .
" You can ask , ' What 's going on here ?
What 's the need she 's trying to express , and how can I help her do it more appropriately ? ' "
In a calmer moment , Petersen realized that what her daughter really wanted was control .
When her mom gave her options ( like " Do you want to do the top buckle or the bottom buckle ? " ) , Eleanor was far more likely to cooperate .
You can even head off " You 're not the boss of me " by teaching your child to say , " I 'd like a choice , " instead .
" I want it now ! "
As I was starting to make dinner , my daughter asked for a cookie , and when I said she could have one for dessert , she launched a major whinefest .
" But I want a cookie right now ! " Ella demanded .
None of my attempts at reason dissuaded her .
She just kept insisting again and again and again .
Desperate for the " I want it now ! " noise to stop , I broke down and gave her the cookie .
A better way to respond :
Though I usually stand my ground , giving in once can set you back light - years when it comes to nagging , says Paul Coleman , a dad of three and author of " How to Say It to Your Kids . "
" That 's how slot machines work : Every tenth pull you get a reward .
It 's not a big reward , but it 's enough to keep you putting more money in the machine . "
Instead , he says , I should tell my daughter no once or twice , then ignore future requests and get her mind on something else , like a silly dance or a knock - knock joke .
The good news :
Such dogged persistence can be a plus in the real world .
" You can step back and say , ' When they grow up , at least they 're not going to be pushovers , ' " says Coleman .
" You never let me do anything . "
Carl Mowry , 10 , has been known to whine that he never gets to do what he wants .
His mom , Carla , has a take - no - prisoners response : " You know what ? " says the Omaha , Nebraska , mom .
" You 're right !
I will leave your life alone .
But I want $ 800 for the house payment , $ 200 for food .... "
Carl gets a full list , and he has to write it all down .
A better way to respond : Lecturing may shut down the grumbling , but it does n't get at the problem .
Find out what 's behind the whine by saying , " Is something wrong ?
I get the feeling you 're upset about more than just not getting to play at Brad 's house . "
Whether or not your child wants to confide in you , at least you 're opening the door to the conversation -- on his level .
" I do n't like you . "
I 'm certainly not the only mom whose feelings have been bruised by a kid who demands a mom swap or says , " I hate you ! "
Greyson Kreis , 6 , of Fairfax Station , Virginia , put in a request for a new mom when his mother , Kim , made him drop the latest Captain Underpants book to clean up his room and turn in early .
Unlike me , she had a quick comeback .
" I told him that he had better enjoy that night in his bed because the next day I would find him a new mom , and he could go live in her house -- but without his toys , " she says .
A better way to respond :
The unanimous chorus from experts :
Do n't take it personally .
Kids say these things when they 're frustrated or angry .
It does n't mean you 're a bad parent .
Of course , distancing yourself when your kid seems to be dissing your mothering skills is n't easy , but letting your child think that you 're all too happy to get rid of him -- or worse , that you hate him , too -- is n't okay .
Since the under - 9 set are literal thinkers , they wo n't detect the reverse psychology at work , and you might end up undermining your child 's trust .
To stay calm , try to pinpoint the real reason your kid is lashing out :
For 7 - year - old Shaun Herock of De Pere , Wisconsin , it was frustration and fatigue .
He snapped , " I do n't like you !
You 're not my friend ! " when his mom , Mia , refused to grab hamburgers on the way home from a two - hour football practice .
Her measured response : " That 's fine .
You 're entitled to feel that way . "
Shaun stewed for a while , but by the time they got home , the whole thing had blown over .
Herock recognized that her son only said " I do n't like you " when he was overtired , and that helped her keep her temper .
Easier said than done , of course , but if you 're upset , wait until you 've calmed down to say anything .
" When you get emotional , you lose 50 IQ points , " says Ray Levy .
" But later on you can say , ' It hurts my feelings when you tell me you hate me . '
Usually when kids are calm , they 're pretty remorseful . "
My daughter 's requests for a new mom have died down recently , but now she likes to say , " You hurt my feelings , " when I refuse yet another visit to her bedroom at night .
While most of the time I manage a response like , " Thanks for sharing , " I 'm not always as calm as I 'd like .
" We all lose it and say the wrong thing , " says Levy .
" But it 's good for parents to apologize or change their behavior , instead of thinking they have to be right or perfect all the time . "
In other words , it 's always okay to say " I 'm sorry " to your kids .
Melody Warnick is expecting her second daughter , who will no doubt want a new mom someday , too .

Albert Hubo
This Albert Einstein - inspired robot “ is the first ever walking robot with humanlike expressions . ”
Our Frubber material makes this possible , because it requires MUCH less force to move into facial expressions than do previous materials–less than 1/20th the force and energy than the softest animatronics materials , according to published tests .
This means that the Albert head can run for hours on AA batteries , so it can be mobile and mount on a walking robot body

Repliee Q1Expo
Japanese scientists have developed a life - like female android called “ Repliee Q1 Expo ” .
The Q1 Expo has “ 42 actuators in her upper body , powered by a nearby air compressor , programmed to allow her to move like a human . ”
She can flutter her eyelids and move her hands like a human .
She even appears to breathe .
Repliee Q1 has skin made from a silicon substance has 11 piezoelectric sensors embedded in it to detect if someone is touching her

Partner Ballroom Dance Robot
Researchers at Japan ’s Tohoku University have created a strange “ Partner Ballroom Dance Robot ” that features “ a woman ’s face [ and ] a sensor around its waist — [ it ] can move in all directions and comes in two colours : shiny blue and bright red . ”
As its partner takes steps , the robot analyzes his movements and figures out how to accompany him with its shoulders , elbows , waist and neck

Brain Controlled Robot
Researchers at the University of Washington have unveiled a “ brain - controlled ” robot — basically uses “ an electrode cap ( a non-invasive tool generating a noisy signal ) , mental powers commanded the robot to walk to a block , pick it up , and set it down in a designated area . ”
Because of the type of brain readings they ’re getting , the bot is semi-autonomous , using human control for making the decisions based on video cameras , but managing the actual mechanics of the motions on its own .
Right now the bot can only manage to pick up simple shapes and move them to another location , but the eventual goal is a human - controlled robot that can function in human environments , learn from its surroundings and perform meaningful tasks for its human masters

Baseball Batting Robot
Created by Robocross.de , this robot is capable of hitting baseballs thrown from the pitchers mound — though not very far , it ’s still an impressive piece of machinery none the less .
WASHINGTON , March 3 , 2007  -- President Bush has picked the manufacturing industry 's top lobbyist to lead the agency that guards consumers from defective baby cribs and exploding laptop batteries .
The Consumer Product Safety Commission , which regulates the safety standards of more than 15,000 consumer products , has been without a leader since last July .
If the White House has its way , Michael Baroody , executive vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers , will fill that void .
But the nomination felt like a slap in the face to Ann Brown , who held the same job under President Clinton .
" I just think it shows in what low esteem the Bush administration holds health and safety in this country , " Brown said .
" The National Association of Manufacturers has been the most active … in trying to undermine any of the powers of CPSC . "
Brown said that during her tenure , NAM " was always trying to undercut the powers of CPSC . "
" We knew when I was at CPSC that anything that NAM offered us was nothing that would enhance our performance , which would enhance our structure .
It was always something that would undercut CPSC . "
Rachel Weintraub , assistant general counsel at the Consumer Federation of America , said Baroody appears above board ethically , but his nomination raises serious concerns because he represents " positions that are in contradiction with what 's in the consumers ' interest .
" The issue is whether someone who has represented manufacturers can uphold the mission of the agency without a bias , without a predisposition to always think in terms of what 's good for manufacturers , " Weintraub said .
" There 's a conflict between manufacturers and consumers .
It 's really hard to imagine that he would be able to come to this position without a bias . "
In defending the nomination , which is subject to Senate confirmation , White House spokesman Tony Fratto said it 's unfair to presume Baroody would be biased just because of his current role .
" Where is the presumption that Mike Baroody does not have sympathy for the Consumer Product Safety Commission , " Fratto said .
" I mean , having an understanding of business and the work of manufacturers should not be an indictment of a candidate for this position .
I mean that 's just … absurd . "
The nomination comes at a tough time for the agency .
The acting head of the CPSC , Nancy Nord , faced a grilling about her agency 's shrinking staff at a House subcommittee hearing .
The agency will cut 19 positions this year , in what Consumers Union says is the third consecutive year of cuts at the agency .
The dwindling staff size prompted Consumer Reports to report on its
Web site that the agency no longer includes childhood drowning as a top strategic priority , though it is the No.2 accidental killer of children in the United States .
And critics say talented staff have been fleeing an emasculated CPSC that is beset by deep internal problems .
" What I have heard from people who have left and from some people who are still there , " Brown said , " is that there is not very much activity .
Nothing much is being done .
And instead of being very active , or proactive , they really have harassed the staff in many ways and created much busy work and reorganization , but not really any substantive advocacy on behalf of consumer safety . "
But Fratto asks , " Where have they failed to be active ?
They 've been forcing the recall of record amounts of products .
They have incredible tasks before them . "
Baroody faces a tough task as well , as Democrats who control the Senate promise they will challenge him to prove that he is ready to uphold the mission of the agency .
Asked whether the Senate ultimately would confirm Baroody , Fratto said , " We 'll see .
We 're hopeful . "
Japan has maintained ever since that human beings should be allowed to consume any animal as long as the fishing or hunting is sustainable .
To establish this point , Japan sends whalers all the way to the Antarctic ’s international waters , said Tetsu Sato , a professor of environmental science at Nagano University .
In a world of diminishing marine resources , establishing this principle is critical to Japan ’s long - term food security and natural resource management , he said .
“ Precisely because whaling attracts so much worldwide attention , Japan ca n’t afford to lose , ” said Mr. Sato , who supports whaling .
Last year , Japan killed 1,073 minke whales , which ended up in restaurants , supermarkets , school cafeterias or unsold .
Most biologists agree that certain species of whales , including the minke , have not only recovered but are now thriving .
Disagreement remains , however , about whether they can be harvested in a sustainable way or whether they are now so numerous that , as Japan asserts , they are threatening other marine animals .
But arguments about resource management do not resonate as much as those about culture .
“ I was afraid that our food culture was going to die , so that ’s why we began serving whale meat in school cafeterias , ” said Shigehiko Azumi , 80 , who served as mayor here when the ban went into effect .
Few deny that whaling is part of Ayukawa ’s culture .
But opinions divide over whether it is part of Japan’s .
Historically , fishermen in coastal towns , like Taiji in southwestern Japan , hunted whales in nearby waters .
But things changed after the Commodore Perry ’s so - called Black Ships forced an isolationist Japan to open up in the 1850s .
Back then , the United States used whale oil lamps , and part of Perry ’s mission to Japan was to secure the rights of American whalers in the Pacific .
As whaling became knotted with Japan ’s traumatic opening to the world and its subsequent drive to modernize , the Japanese adopted American and Norwegian whaling vessels and techniques .
Some coastal towns were transformed into whaling stations , including Ayukawa , when the Toyo Whaling Company started operating here in 1906 .
We all want our children to be happy and grow up to be emotionally well - adjusted and successful .
Being a successful parent means taking the time to understand what our kids need in order to be self confident , happy , and living a life of well - being .
Below are six tips to help you raise your children to the top levels of their needs .
We all want our children to be happy and grow up to be emotionally well - adjusted and successful .
Perhaps that is one of our biggest parenting challenges .
Being a successful parent means taking the time to understand what our kids need in order to be self confident , happy , and living a life of well - being .
Here are six tips to help you raise your children to the top levels of their needs .
1 . Hold your children , touch them , kiss them .
Be physical with your kids .
If they are loved by you then they will learn to love themselves .
They will learn to feel good about their physical bodies , feel attractive , and live without guilt .
2 . If you want your kids to be healthy , fit , attractive , and kind , then start living that way yourself .
Show them that the two most important people in their lives , Mommy and Daddy , share a life of health good eating , and loving communication .
Kids are proud to have attractive parents .
They love you to feel beautiful , so adopt a lifestyle in which you treat your mind , body , and soul with health .
3 . Open yourself to listening very attentively to your children .
Be both attentive and honest with your kids at all times .
By showing them that you have integrity and are respectful with honesty , then they will want to emulate that aspect of you .
Also , show them that you are genuinely interested in them .
4 . Get involved with the activities they are interested in .
Whatever their age may be , start to enthusiastically play with them during these activities .
Spend a few moments hand painting with them .
Throw around the ball each afternoon .
If you have teenagers then spend time talking about their interests .
Get involved as much as possible .
5 . Read books aloud with them at all ages of their life .
The most precious item that you can ever give your kids is your time .
If your child is younger , have them read their favorite stories to you .
Also , share your stories with them .
Share your adventures .
Talk about what Mommy and Daddy was like when you first met .
Giving this kind of attention to your children is a huge self - image booster for them
6 . Be open and friendly about their friends by encouraging them to hang out at your house .
Most parents are uptight , have too many rules , and do not allow other children to hang out at their houses .
Show them that their friends are welcome and that you see them as important .
If your children sees that you accept their choice of friends in the home then that sends a message of acceptance and trust of about their decisions .
If you believe in them then they will believe in themselves .
The Silent Epidemic of Botnets By Jim Hedger ( c ) 2006 If , as author Philip K. Dick wondered , robots dream of electronic sheep , their collectivist cyber- equivalents , botnets live for the fleece .
Used to enable or commit several types of fraud , including click fraud against PPC providers such as Google , Yahoo and the host of smaller pay - per - click programs , botnets are proliferating across the Internet at an alarming rate .
The only thing matching the increase in criminal use of botnets is the increasing sophistication of their operators .
" The level of sophistication that we 're seeing � and the speed at which new fraudster techniques are introduced � is tremendous , " says Keren Levy ( http://www.rsasecurity.com/node.asp?id=3006), director of the Online Threats Managed Services group at RSA Security ( http://rsasecurity.com/).
In June of this year RSA Security and Panda Software collaborated to detect and dismantle one of hundreds of botnets operating online , one that was specifically designed to commit click fraud .
" Botnets are a silent epidemic , " states Ryan Sherstobitoff from Panda Software ( http://www.pandasoftware.com/) as he ducks behind a row of trade - show booths to find a quieter place to speak .
" The botnet we recently helped dismantle with RSA had infected over 50,000 computers with the Clickbot .
A Trojan .
Imagine if each of those 50,000 computers made the botnet controller one dollar each day the system operated .
If it takes us a few weeks to shut him down , the operator makes millions . "
The actual people who operated the network of bots that RSA and Panda broke remain at large and anonymous .
They have not been identified and history suggests they will be back for more .
The folks who hack at this level are light years beyond the script - kiddies of yesteryear .
According to Sherstobitoff , the folks who hack at this level are organized , well paid , and very , very dangerous .
So are the people they work for .
" We 've traced a number of operations centers back to Eastern Europe , the former Yugoslavia , China , and even to North Korea " , said Sherstobitoff .
" There are multiple crime organizations doing this , some of which sell Trojans to each other and to outsiders . "
When we spoke , Sherstobitoff was at an education and IT trade show in Nashville Tennessee .
He has worked with Panda Software for three challenging years .
His business card says he is a Product Technology Officer for Panda Software U.S.A .
To be more accurate , Sherstobitoff has become Panda 's security evangelist .
His job has him traveling to trade shows , speaking at conventions and meeting with IT workers across the country preaching the mantra of tighter computer security .
Knowing that cyber - security experts have only seen the tip of the iceberg , Sherstobitoff emphasizes the importance of personal and corporate responsibility .
Botnets can be described as a cross between a computer virus and the Borg .
Where common viruses are designed to act independently , botnets are literally networks of infected computers that can be controlled by a master computer .
Infection comes in the form of malicious code or malware .
This code can get onto a system in a number of ways including email attachments , music or video downloads , and through open ports and flakey firewalls .
Most who have it will never know they are running it and that 's just the way the fraudsters like it .
Out of sight is out of mind is the axiom that online fraudsters rely on to take money out of the pockets of their victims .
According to the Panda Software website , over 20 % of all home , school or office computers in the U.S. are infected with malicious code and , just to hammer the point home , most of them will never know it .
This means that one in five computers in the U.S. might , at any time , turn into a higher - functioning zombie .
Though computers that become zombies appear to run normally , someone else is using part of their processing power .
That someone is likely doing illegal things .
A medium sized network like the one broken up by RSA and Panda is 50,000 computers strong .
Each zombie has its own IP address and each can be used to fully mimic human behaviours or to scan and record personal information when ordered to by its operator .
It is amazing how easily malicious files can be acquired and how much financial and social damage they can do .
These types of files come in all shapes and sizes .
Some burrow into a computer 's registry as a worm , some are invited in as Trojans , and some are attached to ID phishing attempts .
One noted example of ID phishing email containing a Trojan is referred to as the Barclays Bank letter ( http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/spam/ PhishingScamEmail ) .
Once inside a computer , malicious files can perform whatever functions they are programmed to do .
Some are even designed to accomplish multiple tasks from recording ID and keystroke information to using infected computers to mimic live visitors in click fraud schemes .
The bust Panda and RSA made involved a botnet built around the aptly named Clickbot .
A , which was specifically designed to commit click fraud .
Clickbot .
A is a Trojan file that registers itself as a browser helper object ( http://www.pandasoftware.com/ virus_info/glossary /#BHO ) so that whenever Internet Explorer is run it is automatically activated .
When active , Clickbot .
A is used to obtain , " ... financial profit from fraudulent clicks on advertisements sponsored by a certain company , which in return does not get any visits to its website . "
According to a Panda Software press release ( http://www.pandasoftware.com/about_panda/press_room/
Panda+Software+and+RSA+Security+dismantle+a+new+online+fraud.htm ) , the Clickbot .
A Trojan scam went down this way : "- Fraudsters set up a number of Internet addresses and posted a series of ( genuine ) syndicated search - engine advertisements .
-
The bot network - comprised of more than 50,000 zombie machines infected by Clickbot .
A � was programmed to access these Internet addresses and to register clicks on the syndicated advertisements .
-
The fraudsters received a slice of the ' pay per click ' advertising revenues even though the original advertisers did not receive any visits to their sites . "
The real victims of click fraud are PPC advertisers .
Both the perpetrators and the PPC advertising providers make money every time an advertiser pays for a fraudulent click .
If the fraudsters have been paid out by one of the PPC engines , it is a safe bet that engine has made money as well .
Though the search providers , most notably Google and Yahoo , already detect and delete a wide array of invalid clicks , the rapid proliferation of botnets is considered mute testimony to the success of the underworld endeavor .
As efficient as they are at automating fraud , botnets require human control and activation .
There is always a central controller .
The controller is not necessarily the person responsible for writing the malicious code .
The controller might not even be directly associated with the person or organization profiting from the scheme .
Controllers are often highly paid mercenaries who happen to be very , very good hackers .
There are hundreds , perhaps thousands of controllers out there .
They are extremely difficult to catch , even though they leave traces everywhere they go .
With the ability to manipulate a massive network of zombies , Controllers can shift their command centers from computer to computer , effectively masking the route back to their own locations .
When their networks are eventually detected and parts of the network dismantled , they can turn everything off and vanish into the ether of cyberspace .
The controller truly is the ghost in the machine .
Even if a controller happens to get caught , chances are that person has no idea who has paid them for their talents .
Running a botnet operation requires a number of unique skill sets .
Fake businesses with bank accounts need to be established to accept payments .
When paid out , click fraud revenues need to be laundered before the fraudsters can safely enjoy their ill - gotten gains .
Friendly bankers , more fake businesses and allied accountants are required in order to facilitate the fraud and keep difficult questions to a minimum .
As none of the players mentioned above are proficient enough hackers to build a better botnet , someone needs to write the malicious code or know someone who they can obtain a copy from .
This is n't a world where the script - kiddies play .
This is the world of slash and burn organized crime .
The criminals know what they are doing and time is truly on their side .
Sherstobitoff described the tension of living in what is becoming a fulltime Zero Day posture .
Zero Day , hour or minute is the term used to describe when a botnet or other cyber - security threat is detected .
Once detected , that threat needs to be dissected in order to learn how to destroy it .
Any one of those threats might have been active for days , weeks or months before being detected .
Cyber - security experts play the role of Tom to the hackers ' role of Jerry .
In the game of cat and mouse , the security cats are always a bit behind the curve of the eight ball and the hackers know and love it .
When a new virus is discovered , the malicious code writers make sure the security experts find a few thousand variants , just to keep them busy figuring out which variant is the real threat .
Finding and figuring out a fix might take hours or it might take a few days .
Once the actual threat is determined and a patch prepared to distribute through Norton , McAfee or other anti-virus software it can take between 8 � 16 hours to update computers around the world .
Zero Day for Variant
A is often the birthday of variants B , C , D , E , F , and Z. Everyday can be a Zero Day and some must feel like Groundhog Day .
Cyber - security experts are not really concerned about idle threats .
They have far too many real ones to deal with .
The threats posed by botnets are not limited to the personal or business finances of personal or business computer users either .
On December 1 , the US Attorney 's office indicted a 26 - year old Romanian hacker named Victor Faur on charges he hacked into over 150 NASA and US Navy computers .
According to the US Government , Faur leads a group of elite hackers known as the " WhiteHat Team " .
While Faur is said to have only used his exploit to open chat rooms for other WhiteHat members in order to prove he had cracked the most robust systems in the world , his accomplishments could earn him up to 54 years in an even more secure setting , a US federal prison .
On the same day Faur 's indictment was being read in a Los Angeles courtroom , the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning regarding a possible Internet attack on US banking and investment interests including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq markets .
Though the advisory was issued by HSD spokesman Russ Knocke , " as a routine matter and out of an abundance of caution , " it speaks to very real and persistent fears that such an attack is possible .
In May 2006 , a botnet was used to bring down approximately 10 - million TypePad blogs and LiveJournal communities in an overwhelming DDoS attack ( distributed denial of service ) on Six Apart .
Six Apart client , BlueSecurity.com was the actual target of the attack but the power of tens of thousands of zombie computers sending repeating requests to their servers crashed out their entire network .

It is remarkably difficult to catch the controller .
The fake businesses and the bank accounts attached to them can come and go as quickly as necessary .
In the blink of a few short months , a criminal organization can make a few million dollars .
According to Panda 's Sherstobitoff , very few of the operations detected and dismantled are actually caught , in a real - world sense of the word , a discouraging 2 � 5 % .
The sky is not falling but it is getting more expensive to keep it suspended every passing day .
Home computer users , education networks and corporate IT departments might be under constant attack but there are ways to deter , detect and disrupt the hackers .
Using standard anti-virus products is important , however , they do not cover the full spectrum of threats .
Most anti-virus software is also limited by the Zero Day concept and is therefore only as effective as its most recent update .
Products like ZoneAlarm ( http://www.zonelabs.com/) and AdAware ( http://www.lavasoftusa.com/) are good additions to home and business computers but Sherstobitoff strongly recommends the tightest security should come at the server and ISP level .
Sherstobitoff suggests ISPs and companies running web servers use anti-hacking software based on Host Based Intrusion Detection ( http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Host+Based+Initial+ Detection&btnG=Google +Search ) systems that perform deep packet inspection looking for common traits found in zombifing Trojans at the kernel level .
With a 20 % infection rate in the U.S. and similar rates around the world , the only real certainty for cyber - security experts is that there is a 1/5 chance the computer in front of you is being used to assist thieves .
That is a sad fact of life online .
While researching one of the few botnet cases that has been prosecuted , that of Jeanson James Ancheta , this LinuxForums botnet discussion ( http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/coffee-lounge/ 54066-botnets-how-many-jeanson-james-anchetas-exist.html ) from late January 2006 was found .

I happened upon DrySQL the other day and I was immediately interested .
DrySQL is an add - on to the standard ActiveRecord support in Rails that uses a lot more of the meta - data in the database to generated the model classes .
The standard ActiveRecord classes basically just use the column names to create accessor and modifier methods for the models .
DrySQL takes the idea of using the database schema definition as a source of information much further .
It figures out the primary key looking for the primary key column in the database , rather than a column named ‘ id ’ .
It setups up validations based on the data type of the columns in the database .
It defines joins based on the referential constraints .
So basically DrySQL is trying to make ActiveRecord what it should have been from the beginning .
I was really happy when I found that someone is working on improving ActiveRecord .
I have always been annoyed by in the inconsistencies of Rails ActiveRecord .
For example , Rails ActiveRecord requires some of the meta - data to reside in the DB and some to reside in the code has bugged me .
Even worse your are actually required to duplicate some of the meta- data by the standard ActiveRecord library , for example validations .
I use the past tense for my happiness because today I installed DrySQL and I am no longer all that happy .
It may well do exactly what it says , which I will just assume , but unfortunately I do n’t have time to really test it .
The reason I do not have time to test it is that it adds a least twenty four ( 24 ) seconds to the response time for every single request .
One of the simplest requests the application handles goes from
Completed in 0.18736
to
Completed in 24.24459
simply by adding require_gem ' drysql ' to environment.rb .
That twenty four seconds seems to be to build the User model .
Requests that instantiate other models incur even greater overhead .
This kind of performance hit is completely untenable .
While this overhead would be less of an issue in production because this generation will only be done once per model class it is still a complete show stopper for me , and I suspect for most other people .
Really , who can give up thirty seconds of their life every single request , even in their development environment ?
There is a possibility , and I really hope this is the case , that this is performance issue really just artifact of my environment .
I am running a fairly recent version of Edge Rails ( a couple of weeks old ) , postgres 0.7.1 ( installed as gem ) and postgresql - 8.1 all on Edgy .
I would love to hear about it if you see a problem with my setup ( or if you are using DrySQL without these issues ) .
Even though this version of DrySQL does not seem to work for today I remain hopeful .
DrySQL is definitely the way ActiveRecord should work and there is no reason generating the model class should take an excessive amount of time .
Perhaps the next version of DrySQL will be more performant .
These days I do a bit of pimping ( a.k.a. " quant headhunting " in polite company - a " quant " is a quantitative analyst doing high - value numerical analysis ) for expensive people at banks .
It may scare or delight you , but a lot of the financial markets are run off C++ with Excel VBA .
The first pass across the prospective intake is to check they are up to date , and have moved beyond MFC .
Sure , I respect those who've made this wretched confection of multiple inheritance , and intrusive base classes actually work , but they should have moved on .
STL ( Standard Template Library ; Dinkumware does multi platform STL implementations and licenses a version to Microsoft ) is a must and opens up opportunities for good deep interview questions .
Knowing about Boost ( which will probably be in the next C++ standard ) shows they are near enough to the state - of - the - art .
I like them enough to understand the problems of inheriting from STL classes and order ( N ) notation , and it does n't hurt to be able to write the declaration of a vector of linked lists of stacks , even if you never do it in real life .
However , many interviewers like to compose some stupidly complex declaration and ask what it means .
What it means , of course , is that they have low standards .
A large percentage of development , naturally , is debugging , so I have an array of code samples broken in obvious and subtle ways to ask about - and , yes , a couple of the bugs are my own foul - ups .
A modern C++ programmer needs to show s/he can happily work at three levels of abstraction , so I like to run discussions at three levels : the middle level is where C++ is n't really very different from Java or even Delphi ; you declare , loop and call until the job is done .
Many never get far outside this layer in either direction .
Below , we have the " physical " system of memory , CPU and operating system .
This is classical old style programming , and quite a few people never master it , which can lead to horrible errors .
Even if you do n't do much low level work , it 's important that you have a good " model " of what is happening to your code , even if it 's a simple one .
A good example of physical level programming is force fitting a class over a C struct , or perhaps extending a system data structure so C++ can handle it better .
Done properly you can convert a simple blob of memory to an elegant class with zero overhead .
Same applies to threads ; you need to combine the CompSci view of mutexes and semaphores with the understanding that the thread creation API does n't " really " take a function , but an address .
This is part of getting your code to work with other subsystems .
Given the percentage of project pain in that area , the more interfacing someone has done the better .
Going up , you need to communicate ideas and model the gross behaviour of your code , and these days that means patterns .
Good candidates will be able to work through all the Gang of Four stuff , and even an adequate candidate will be able to not only implement singletons ; blackboards etc , but also explain where they are useful .
Singleton is asked about in many interviews nowadays , as is MVC and , of course , factory .
The larger the project , the more important patterns become , so it is important that the people you hire are up to speed .
They may express their ideas in some form of UML ( Unified Modelling Language ) or the RUP ( Rational Unified Process ) , which is good even if you do n't use them yet .
Programmers who cannot communicate their ideas are n't just inefficient , they are often quite dangerous .
For completeness , I often chuck in questions about overloaded and virtual functions , though I do worry about people who are too good at them , since it implies their code may be too clever and fragile when others modify it .
A good programmer has a balance between the high and low level views .
I see too many people who sneer at low level stuff , only for it to bite them on the ankle later , in ways they simply can't understand .
But ultimately , interviews as such are far from ideal .
In recent times , I 've handed over a laptop and asked a candidate to write some code for a standard algorithm like quicksort or even just a hash table .
In fact , I 've found the best predictor of programming skill is actually the expression on their face when I do .
The bottom line , however , is not whether a programmer knows a particular syntax , or can list those operators which may be overloaded .
All this is in online help or the web .
More important is that s/he can make good decisions about what to use and can explain those decisions . ®

Many of the characters in Helvetica and Arial are very similar to each other , although none are quite identical .
Other characters are quite a bit different , and they are the key to telling which is which .
Here are some of the most obvious ones ( Grotesque 215 , Arial ’s ancestor , has also been included for comparison ) :
The “ a ” in Helvetica has a tail ; Arial does not .
Also , the bowl of the “ a ” flows into the stem like a backwards “ s ” ; the bowl of Arial ’s “ a ” simply intersects the stem with a slight curve .
( Interestingly , the Grotesque “ a ” has a tail , just like Helvetica .
The bolder weights of Helvetica have no tails , an inconsistency that bothers some people .
Maybe it bothered Monotype , too . )
Arial ’s “ a ” has always seemed a little badly drawn to me , but maybe it ’s just me .
The top of the Arial “ t ” is cut off at an angle ; the Helvetica “ t ” is cut off straight .
You can see clearly here how the x-height of Arial matches Helvetica’s .
This is one of the main things that makes Arial look like Helvetica at first glance , even though the details are different .
The ends of the strokes of letters like “ S ” and “ C ” are perfectly horizontal in Helvetica ; in Arial and Grotesque they are cut off at a slight angle .
The “ G ” in Helvetica has a spur at the bottom of the stem on the right side and the curve at the bottom of the “ G ” flows into the stem ; in Arial and Grotesque the “ G ” has no spur and the curve at the bottom meets the stem at an angle .
The tail of the “ R ” in Helvetica flows out from the bowl and curves straight down , ending in a slight curve to the right .
In Arial , the tail flows down and to the right from near the center of the horizontal bar and straightens out at an angle to the end .
It appears to be a compromise between the Helvetica “ R ” and the Grotesque “ R. ” This feature is very unusual for a “ grotesque ” design , and is more typical of “ humanist ” sans serifs .
It feels out of place here and is one of the more awkward design features of Arial .
Here is the same word set in all three typefaces :
In both fonts , the characteristics described here apply to all weights ( except , of course , the tail on the Helvetica “ a , ” which is dropped on the bolder weights ) .

Statement said attorney general acted in ' public interest capacity '
The injunction was obtained on Friday night at a hearing which lasted about two hours at the Royal Courts of Justice in London .
Lord Goldsmith 's office said he had acted " completely independently of government " on the matter .
The BBC said its reporting of the story was a matter of public interest .
BBC media correspondent Torin Douglas said it was understood to be the first injunction to be sought or granted in connection with the cash for honours investigation .
' Specific request '
The attorney general 's office and the Metropolitan Police issued a joint statement on the matter .
In it , they said the application for an injunction was made by Lord Goldsmith " at the specific request of and in co-operation with the police because of their concerns that the disclosure of certain information at this stage would impede their inquiries " .
That statement added : " The attorney general acted in this respect completely independently of government , and in his independent public interest capacity . "
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell told BBC Two's Newsnight that " the attorney general acts in the public interest , and in particular , he 's got an interest to ensure that no possible prosecution is prejudiced or that no possible defence to a prosecution is prejudiced " .
He added : " I think what one might be able to infer from the fact that he felt it necessary to seek this injunction is that he at least contemplates the possibility that a prosecution of some kind will follow . "
For this post , I set out to find people who started a blog and went on to do well ; and I asked them about their story .
What inspired them ?
What traits helped them ?
What circumstances helped them ?
The results of my search were interesting .
Many common themes emerged among their stories , and it reminded me of my own journey .

via The Gavel : During the 110th Congress , Republicans have repeatedly attempted to use motions to recommit with instructions to kill bills on the verge of passage .
The strategy is to institute a divisive change to the bill at the last moment , often unrelated to the original intent of the legislation , hoping that the altered bill can then be defeated on final passage .

The basic set of GNOME panel apps ranges from the practical , such as clocks and system monitors , to the mildly amusing , but apparently too traditional to dispense with , such as Fish .
However , in the last few years , an increasing number of GNOME applications are being designed to fit into the panel .
Since many of these recent apps are interesting but too minor to rate a full - length review , here 's a roundup of some that have caught my attention .
Although all of them are in early release , each hints at new functionality and levels of customization that might soon be available on the desktop .
AllTray
Alltray lets you dock applications into the notification area of the panel ( AKA the system tray ) .
When you open AllTray , you can capture an open application and dock it .
Later , if you click the application 's close button , it 's minimized back to the notification area .
Unfortunately , the contents of the notification area is n't preserved between logins in the current version .
I suppose , too , that as the name implies , the notification area is n't , strictly speaking , intended for this use .
Still , if you compulsively work with a dozen or so windows open and prefer not to use different work spaces , AllTray is a more convenient alternative than the panel 's Window List .
In addition to GNOME , AllTray also works with KDE , recent versions of XFCE , and window managers such as Fluxbox and WindowMaker .
Gimmie
Gimmie is essentially a way to make recently - used lists more accessible .
In its basic form , it takes the form of a bar with separate lists for applications , documents , chat sessions ( " people " ) and workplaces and basic system information and settings ( " computer " ) .
In the most recent version , each of these lists can be minimized on the panel .
You can drag and drop open windows to a list , and the window for each list includes a simplified menu of items that you might want to use with the list .
In its current version , Gimmie strikes me as an interesting but idiosyncratic idea .
I am not sure that arranging applications in windows rather than menus is any particular improvement .
And would n't a panel tray would work just as well for a simplified menu , or maybe a set of icons on the desktop ?
Moreover , while I hesitate to judge an app on its eye - candy , Gimmie 's pastels clash badly with default GNOME settings , to say nothing of my own color preferences .
Still , I have a soft spot for any application that represents an effort to rethink the desktop ( or any other aspect of computing , for that matter ) .
That alone puts Gimmie on my list of panel apps to watch .
The app is only at version 0.2.3 , so there is a lot of time for additions , as the project 's to - do list makes clear .
Sussen
At version 0.35 , Sussen is another early stage app .
It checks for security problems on your system , checking your current configuration settings against operating system and distribution - specific definitions of potential problems written in the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language .
You can read the results in a web browser .
You can also run scans from the command line , and create your own definitions and tests , assuming you have the expertise .
To be completely effective , Sussen needs two things : an active community willing to write definitions and keep them up to date , and an educational component like Bastille 's to explain the nature of any problems found and how to correct them .
Without either , Sussen is unlikely to catch on , and that would be a pity .
Any program that puts security on the desktop -- the environment in which security is frequently relaxed these days in the name of convenience ( as if there were any necessary conflict ) -- deserves encouragement and success .
Tomboy
Of all the apps mentioned here , Tomboy strikes me as the one most suitable for inclusion on the panel .
An alternative to the Sticky Notes found in GNOME 's default apps , and far more convenient than starting Evolution to write a note , Tomboy is rapidly shaping into the center for random ideas on the desktop .
You can lightly format notes , link to related notes or emails , and either search for notes or locate them through the Tomboy Table of Contents .
Support is also in the works for linking to Evolution task and to - do lists and to appointment calendars , as well as file and image previews .
By the time Tomboy reaches its full release , it may very well become an essential bridge between GNOME applications .
Final thoughts
Looking at these applications , a couple of questions occur to me .
First , while some panel apps are written in languages like Python , a growing number use Mono .
In fact , while Mono is being integrated into GNOME , at times its main purpose seems to be to serve as a scripting language for panel apps .
Yet I have to wonder whether panel apps -- which by definition are small and have limited functionality -- really need a language of their own .
Moreover , the use of Mono makes backwards compatibility to earlier versions of GNOME unnecessarily full of dependencies .
Second , a growing number of GNOME - specific programs seem to be conceived as panel apps these days .
Often , this choice makes sense , as with a small program like AllTray or one that links programs on the desktop , such as Tomcat .
Yet others , such as Sussen , raise the question of whether they belong on the panel at all .
After all , how often are security checks going to be run ?
Or , in the case of Debian and Ubuntu 's Update Manager , why should non-root users be disturbed by the frequent messages from the Update Manager ?
No matter how worthwhile a program might be in itself , some common - sense guidelines may need to be applied about when a program needs to be a panel app .
If a program is n't a basic utility or a customization of the panel , then probably it should n't be there .
I wonder if the main reason for panel app proliferation is n't that the choice is the fastest way to ensure integration in the default GNOME configuration .
Still , these points aside , GNOME panel apps continue to fascinate me .
Although often small in scope , they hint at new work - flows and concepts of the desktop that , even when you decide not to use them , implicitly challenge the conventions of GUI computing .
For this reason alone , I hope that the current burst of creativity in panel apps continues for years to come .
Note : Obviously , I 've hardly touched the subject of panel apps .
If you have a favorite GNOME or KDE panel app , let me know .
If I get enough suggestions , I 'll write a followup or two .

As we discovered in A Glimpse and a Hook , it ’s almost a miracle when the phone rings and a recruiter wants to set up a phone screen .
The fact is , someone , somewhere in the organization has successfully mapped you to an open position .
This is a really big deal because , in my experience , the chance that you ’ll get this job has improved logarithmically .
It ’s not 50 / 50 , but it ’s vastly better than when you were a random resume sitting on a desk .
There ’s a sense of relief when that phone call arrives and as soon as you hang up the phone with the recruiter , you ’re going to call your best friend , “ Hey , I got a interview with The Company ! ”
No , you did n’t .
You got a phone screen and a phone screen has little to do with an interview .
While your situation is n’t as tenuous as the 30 seconds you have to make an impression with your resume , you ’re still not in the building and nothing real is happening until you ’re in the building .
Like Glimpse , I ’m going to walk you through my precise mental process that I use as I walk through the phone screen , but first you ’ve got homework :
Stalk Your Future Job
Before you even talk to me , you ’re on a fact - finding mission .
You ’ve got a job description , and after the phone screen has been set up , you ’ve got my name .
You might also have an idea of the product or technology associated with this gig or you might not , but even without a product name , you ’ve got plenty of information to start with .
Do your research .
Google me .
Find out anything you can about what I do and I what care about .
This is n’t stalking , this is your career , and if I happen to be an engineering manager who writes a weblog , well , you can start to learn how I think .
Maybe I do n’t have a weblog , but I post to mailing lists .
That ’s data , too .
How is this going to help you during the phone screen ?
Well , I do n’t know what you ’re going to find , but anything you can gather is going to start to build context around this job that you know nothing about .
This helps with phone screen nerves as well .
See , I have your resume and you have nothing .
Are n’t you going to feel better about talking with a total stranger when you figure out from staring at my Flickr pages that I absolutely love Weimaraners ?
Is n’t it going to be reassuring to know I swear in my Twitters ?
A bit of research into who you are talking to is going to level the information playing field .
Similarly , if you have a product name or technology , repeat the same process .
What is the product ?
Is it selling well ?
What do other people think about it ?
I ’m not talking about a weekend of research here .
I ’m talking an hour or so of background research so that you can do one thing when the phone screen shows up : you need to ask great questions .
That ’s right .
In your research , you want to find a couple of compelling questions , because at some point during the phone screen I ’m going to ask you , “ Do you have any questions for me ? ” and this is the most important question I ’m going to ask .
Initial Tuning
Before I ask you the most important question , I need to figure out a couple of things early in our chat .
What I need to learn is :
Can we communicate ?
I ’m going to lead off with something simple and disarming .
It ’s either going to be the weather or something I picked up from your extracurricular activities .
“ Do you really surf ?
So do I !
Where do you surf ? ”
These pleasantries appear trivial , but they ’re a big deal to me because I want to see if we can communicate .
It ’s nowhere near a deal killer if the pacing of our conversation is awkward , I ’ll adjust , but how off is it ?
Are we five minutes in and we still have n’t said anything ?
Ok , maybe we have a problem .
One more softball .
My follow - up questions will now start to focus on whatever question your resume left me with .
I ’ve no idea what I ’m going to ask because it varies with every single resume , so my thought is that you should have your resume sitting in front of you because it ’s sitting in front of me as well .
It ’s my only source material .
Whatever these follow - up questions are , I ’m still figuring out how we communicate .
This means you need to focus on answering the questions .
It sounds stupid , but if it ’s not absolutely clear to you what I ’m asking , it ’s better to get early clarification rather than letting me jump in five minutes into your answer to say , “ Uh , that ’s not what I was asking . ”
See , you and I are still tuning to each other .
It ’s been ten minutes now , and if we ’re still not adjusted to each other ’s different communication styles , I ’m going to start mentally waving my internal yellow flag .
It does n’t need to be eloquent communication , but we should be making progress .
No more softballs .
We ’re past the softball phase of the interview and now I ’m going to ask a hard question .
This is n’t a brainteaser or a technical question ; this is a question that is designed to give you the chance to tell me a story .
I want to see how you explain a complex idea over the phone to someone you do n’t know and ca n’t see .
Again , who knows what the actual question will be , but you need to be prepared for when I ask the question that is clearly , painfully , open - ended .
I ’m not looking for the quick , clean answer ; I ’m looking for a story that shows me more about how you communicate and how you think .
Being an amazing communicator is not a part of most engineering jobs , I know this .
I ’m not expecting Shakespeare , but I am expecting that you can confidently talk about this question because I found this question in your resume and that is the only piece of data we currently have in common .
If we ca n’t have an intelligent discussion about that , I ’m going to start wondering about the other ways we are n’t going to be able to communicate .
Your Turn .
We ’re twenty minutes into the phone screen and now I ’m going to turn it over to you when I ask “ Do you have any questions for me ? ”
When I tell friends that this is my favorite question , the usual response is , “ So , you ’re lazy , right ?
You ca n’t think of anything else to ask , so you go for the path of least resistance . ”
It ’s true .
It an easy question for me to ask , but it is essential because I do n’t hire people who are n’t engaged in what they ’re doing .
And if you do n’t have a list of questions lined up for me , all I hear is : YOU DON ’T WANT THIS JOB .
A well thought out question shows me that you ’ve been thinking about this job .
It shows me you ’re already working for it by thinking about the job outside of this 30 - minute conversation .
Yeah , you can probably wing it and ask something interesting based on the last 20 minutes , but the impression you ’re going to make with me by asking a question based on research outside of this phone screen will make up for a bevy of yellow flags .
It shows initiative and it shows interest .
The Close
And we ’re done .
It went by pretty quick , but the question is , “ How ’d it go ? ”
Here ’s a mental checklist to see how you did :
Long , awkward pauses .
Were we struggling to keep things moving ?
Were there long silences ?
Well , we did n’t tune appropriately .
Again , not a deal killer , but definitely a negative .
Adversarial interactions .
What happened when we had different opinions ?
Did we talk through it or did we start butting heads ?
This happens more than I expect on phone screens , and it ’s not always a bad thing .
I ’m not interested in you telling me what I want to hear , but if we are on opposite sides of the fence , how do we handle it ?
If a candidate is willing to pick a fight in a 30 - minute phone screen , I ’m wondering how often they ’re going to fight once they ’re in the building .
How ’d it feel ?
This is the hardest to quantify , but also the most important .
Did we click ?
Did the conversation flow ?
Did we both learn something ?
Ideally , I ’m a decent representation of the culture of the team I ’m hiring for , so if the 30 minutes passed painfully , I ’m wondering what kind of pain hiring you might inflict on the team .
Specific next steps .
How did I leave it ?
Did I give you a song and dance about how “ we ’re still interviewing candidates and we ’ll be in touch within the next week ” ?
Well , that ’s ok , but what you ’re really looking for is a specific next step like “ I ’m going to bring you in ” or “ Let ’s have you talk with more of the team ” .
An immediate and actionable next step is the best sign of success with a phone screen .
If I do n’t give you this as part of the close , ask for it .
If I stall , there ’s a problem .
A phone screen is not a interview , it ’s a sanity check .
I already know you meet the requirements for the job by looking at your resume .
The phone screen is going to tell me whether you meet the requirements of the culture of my team .
Unlike your resume where you send your hope to an anonymous recruiting address , the phone screen gives you leverage .
The phone screen is the first time you get to represent yourself as a person .
It ’s still a glimpse , but it ’s the first time you can actively participate in your next job .
A well - shaven Jim Miller gave a talk at Brown today on introducing dynamic languages into the CLR .
I went because ( a ) they were giving away a free camera ( which I did n’t get ) , and ( b ) the talk seemed actually interesting .
Much more interesting than my last Microsoft talk , which was some interminably boring thing about webservices .
The talk was essentially an overview of the CLR , of the form , “ Do you think this is cool ?
Work for us ! ”
The focus was on IronPython ‘s genesis and growth .
Those kids love their Python .
I tried to ask him the following question : “ You ’ve talked a lot about getting basic interoperability between programs written in different languages — object - oriented , procedural , functional — but you ’ve said nothing about heterogeneity of styles .
How does the CLR cope with that ? ”
I asked because he said that an interface of an object included a way to create it , modify its insides , and so on — not necessarily how I define my datatypes .
But then he turned it around , and asked me for an example — the best I could come up with was Erlang ’s processes and single - assignment ( a red herring ) or Haskell ’s purity ( an academic joke ) .
Not what I was looking for .
The mismatch is more serious , but I could n’t adequately get at it on the spot .
I asked him a follow - up , about GUI programming style .
Would a GUI in IronPython need to be written in some bogus Windows Forms style , all callbacks ?
I did n’t want to compare the callback - GUI system to Flapjax ‘s , since that ’d be a bit wankerish of me .
I did n’t handle it well at all .
So : what did I mean to ask ?
On the one hand , my problem is this : the mismatch between the CLR and some paradigms is pretty clear .
If I wanted to work with Windows Forms in , say , F# , I would have to write in an all - ref style .
In other words , the CLR lets me program C# in the language of my choice .
On the other hand , how else would I write a GUI ?
Flapjax is the most viable FRP implementation I ’ve seen , but it ’s still extremely nascent .
When interfacing with the user , what is better than direct , mutative style ?
Python uses callback - based Tkinter and WxPython ; DrScheme uses the MrEd callback - based framework .
So what gives ?
I may be more comfortable in the FP world , and happier programming Scheme in Scheme , rather than C# in Scheme , or even worse , Scheme in C# — but it ’s becoming increasingly clear to me that my preference may be more related to my own experience than actual advantages .
In order to find out how one of the world ’s most devastating diseases overcomes state - of - the - art drugs , scientists led by Dr. Vineet KewalRamani at National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) are biohacking and re-engineering the HIV virus .
Dr. KewalRamani and his collegues have combined pieces of HIV and another virus to create a deadly new hybrid — a tenacious little microbe that knows all the tricks of its parent pathogens .
Discovering where , and how , HIV hides in the body will be a critical step towards a cure for the disease — or at least a better treatment .
The hybrid Frankenstein virus is still too different from HIV to be useful in finding the holy grail of AIDS research : an effective vaccine .

From a medical standpoint , what makes this viral Frankenstein special is that it possesses twin traits not found together in any other virus .
First , it can replicate in macaques — monkeys commonly used in medical research — causing an AIDS - like illness .
That ’s crucial , because macaques are ideal vessels in which to study how immune - compromising viruses do their dirty work .
Second , the new pathogen is susceptible to a full complement of antiretroviral drugs , the primary tools used to treat HIV - positive patients .
This means that , for the first time , researchers can both induce and suppress an ailment that mimics the defining aspects of human HIV infection .

About a year ago , my girlfriend bought an Epson CX3500 printer .
It caused many problems almost from day one :
The ink would ran out too quickly , less expensive re-fill ink would n't work right , the expensive ink would n't work well as well and so forth .
One particularly annoying behavior was the printer 's refusal to print grayscale / black & white documents when it 's color cartridges are empty .
Each time I hear about this problem I just go nuts .
It makes me want to throw the printer out to the street and buy another one .
It 's just completely incomprehensible to me that the developers / designers at Epson thought this can be considered as a reasonable behavior .
It 's not an online ink shopping website .
It 's not an ink commercial .
It should never refuse to print my documents unless it absolutely can't .
It should have no problem printing b/w documents if it has Black ink .
I have an HP psc at home .
I really disliked hp printers before but this one has just been great to me .
This hp also has a similar problem , but it 's less of a pain : it refuses to print anything if one of the cartridges is missing , but it will print a b/w document even if the color cartridge is empty .
Someone at Epson thought it 's reasonable to ask users to buy color printer cartridges to print black and white documents .
That someone is obviously wrong .

Hair harvested from Indian virgins in sacred temples is the latest must - have adornment .
But who are the real fashion victims ?
investigates :
When Victoria Beckham pushed her long glossy fingernails through her hair last month during the World Cup , attention was momentarily taken away from her ever shrinking frame and on to her scalp .
For under those thick tresses , it seemed , the commander - in - chief of the WAGs crowd was going bald .
Was this alopecia ?
Was the stress of the upcoming games getting to her ?
As it turns out , it was simply a hair malfunction .
For Mrs Beckham had not had time to replace her hair extensions .
Having learned not to let her standards slip while the world was watching , she flew back to the UK and , five hours later , she strolled down the street in a push - up bra and with £ 2,000 worth of imported human hair bouncing up and down on her shoulders .
Naturally , Colleen followed suit .
For the queen of grooming , hair is all .
So panicky was Posh that her locks would look less than luscious on her ' secret ' post - World Cup holiday , aboard designer Roberto Cavalli 's yacht with husband David Beckham , that she flew her hairdresser out for the duration of the trip .
But beauty comes at a price .
In the time it takes for a footballer 's wife to have human hair extensions added to her own scalp , across the globe in Northern India , thousands of women will be divesting themselves of their crowning glory .
They wait patiently in line on the cold stone floor of a temple in India to have their hair shaved off with a dry razor , leaving them completely bald .
Within a matter of weeks , their luscious locks will have been bleached , or ' high - lifted ' using ammoniated mercury , and then bonded on to the heads of rich Western women who want to imitate the latest red carpet fashion for wavy tresses .
In fact , at a minimum of £ 500 in exclusive salons all over the UK , you , too , can have real human hair bonded on to your own , thickening or lengthening it instantly .
' Temple hair ' is hugely popular with A - listers , such as Gwyneth Paltrow , Jennifer Aniston , J - Lo , Kate Beckinsale , and even John Galliano .
But while top hair salons enjoy the profits made from selling human hair , does anyone dare to ask where it comes from , or how much women abroad are being paid to donate their locks to fashion ?
The shocking truth is that not a penny is awarded to the women at the Indian temple who sacrifice their hair .
In fact , they are not even told that it is soon to be sold for profit .
All the money goes to the temple itself .
Perched on the hills of Tirupati , in India , the Hindu temple is the second richest religious site in the world after Vatican City .
Boasting up to 20 million pilgrims a year , the popular site costs $ 120 million a year to maintain .
Money mainly comes from donations .
The most prevalent source , however , is from the sale of human hair .
Every day , up to 4,000 women visit the temple to take part in this religious ceremony , called tonsuring , in which they shave off their hair as a sacrifice to the god Vishnu .
In particular , virgins before their wedding happily take part in this tradition , which is a sign that they are willing to give up their pride and vanity , and to thank the gods or ask them for health and happiness in the future .
So how does their humble sacrifice wind up draped over the shoulders of the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow ?
Lakshmi Srinivasan , a beautiful 21 - year - old girl , lives in Chennai , close to the temple .
From the tender age of 11 , she sat on the floor of a factory , sorting hair to export to the US .
" I worked for one of the distributors of the hair who would buy the cuts from the temple , then sort it , dye it and package it for the luxury market " , she says .
She began in the combing room , where bins of hair cut from the heads of devout women would be taken through and placed on to the floor .
Lakshmi's nimble fingers would then comb through the hair , taking out knots and sorting it into lengths .
" It does n't matter if it is from the same head , although that does help , " she says .
Even more than the back - breaking hours on the job , Lakshmi remembers the overpowering stench of the hair .
" Indian women rub oils into their hair to keep it soft and beautiful .
After a while in storage , it starts to stink .
But it is these oils and the care Indian women take of their hair which leaves it in such good condition .
Also , they grow it very long .
Our hair is a major source of pride and beauty . "
Lakshmi , coming from a poor family , needed to work to feed her parents , as well as to save for a dowry so she could marry .
But she had to make far greater sacrifices for their prosperity .
" When I was younger , I was made to have my own hair cut off at the temple , " she remembers .
" It shamed me .
I had to go back to school completely bald .
But my parents believed that it would bring us some luck , so I could not say no . "
Many poor families go to the temple to pray for good crops ; for poor farmers , the sacrifice of hair to Vishnu adds to their chances of having a good harvest .
The temple , of course , also benefits .
Lakshmi says : " We are encouraged to give donations to the temple , but some women are too poor .
Their hair is all they have . "
The tonsuring process Lakshmi remembers is designed to make sure that the hair is kept in perfect condition for selling .
The head is bowed forward and a dry razor blade is used to take the hair off at the roots , all at once .
" No creams are used , no scissors - it all comes off in one go .
That way , it is long and fresh for the factories , " she recalls .
' Sores on the scalp '
" It is uncomfortable and itchy , because of this , and you can get sores on your scalp .
But they have a lot of people to go through , " she shrugs .
" Thousands come every day to make their sacrifice . "
When the hair extension craze exploded five years ago , Indian hair was already popular .
It is very fine , but strong and durable as well as rich in pigment and easy to treat .
When the wasted tresses which covered the floors of the temple were brushed up , it amounted to tonnes of hair every year .
As most Hindu women never cut their hair , the locks are long .
Perfect for those trips down the red carpet thousands of miles away .
And in LA , where looks are everything , women will pay premium prices to get their hands on these virgin locks .
LA 's hottest shopping street , Melrose Avenue , is teeming with skinny blondes in designer clothes .
And among the top boutiques lies the one - stop shop for every starlet 's most vital accessory : hair .
Vered Hair Salon is not just another exclusive hair and nail spa ; this is where everybody who is anybody buys their luscious locks .
Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are huge fans , not to mention Playboy bunnies who pout seductively from framed photos on the wall of the salon .
The idea of ' temple hair ' , with all it 's spiritual connotations , has a special appeal in the city where religious fads are considered part and parcel of celebrity .
" We do have every colour , " explains the owner , Vered , " but this is LA , so obviously blonde is the most popular .
And the blonder it is , the faster it sells .
" Most of the hair , obviously , is used by people who want to be beautiful , plus spirituality is very ' in ' over here , so that kind of adds to the whole experience of getting temple hair . "
And where America leads , Britain is quick to follow .
" Indian hair really is the best quality , I find , " says a spokesman for Tyrone and Company , a London salon .
" It can be treated just like your own hair , it can be heated and curled , coloured and blow - dried , unlike acrylic . "
The look is also far more expensive .
" If you look at Chantelle , her hair is acrylic .
Compare it with the real thing , say , on Paris Hilton .
You can see the difference . "
There are now more than 50 salons in London alone which deal in Indian temple hair , and business is booming .
But as with anything in fashion , knockoff merchants are waiting in the wings to provide a cheaper version for the masses who want to copy them .
Just like fake Fendi or Chloe bags , temple hair merchants have to fight a flurry of Indian hair suppliers desperate to break into the market for hair extensions .
Now , up to 80 out of every 100 locks of human hair comes from this black market .
Shri E.V.K.S. Elangovan , an Indian trade minister , worries about the popularity of Indian human hair .
" Aside from the temple hair , we have no idea where the rest comes from , " he says .
" In many cases we fear women are being exploited .
There are no specific restrictions on the import and export of human hair .
This is obviously an environment that breeds illegality . "
Preying on desperately poor women in Indian villages , these suppliers cajole them into selling their hair for next to nothing .
The cost of a set of hair extensions in the West is enough to feed a family in India for six months .
It is the salons and the hair distributors , however , who recover the profits .
With the black market in human hair becoming more prolific as human sources are being found across Europe and China , too , is it ever possible to have luxury human hair extensions put in without having to worry about where they came from ?
Connect Hair Systems , which provides Victoria Beckham with her designer locks , claims that its business is a purely ethical one .
" We make sure that our benefactors are giving their hair through choice , " says the salon .
But with hair extensions in such hot demand , there would need to be a lot of women who are willing to sell their crowning glory to complete strangers - for profit or for free .
How can you ever be really sure that neither poverty nor desperation is a factor ?
After all , how much would someone have to pay you to donate your hair to Victoria Beckham ?

IS A regional war about to erupt in Somalia ?
Eyewitness reports on Monday October 9th suggested that “ several hundred ” Ethiopian soldiers , perhaps three battalions , had entered the small town of Burhakaba , well inside Somali territory .
There have long been reports of Ethiopian troops at the town of Baidoa , 65 km to the north , where a UN - recognised ( but not widely Somali - recognised ) transitional government sits .
And there have been regular and credible reports of Ethiopian military planes landing on dirt strips up and down the country .
Ethiopia has claimed , not very convincingly , that it has no soldiers inside Somalia .
In fact it seems that the soldiers were sent in as a response to an approach by Islamist forces , soldiers under the control of a de facto government in Mogadishu , known as the Islamic courts , to within 20 km of Baidoa late last week .
There has been no fighting , yet .
The Islamists were undermanned in the town and retreated without a shot being fired .
But such calm is unlikely to last .
Burhakaba is a strategically useful forward base for any attack on Mogadishu .
Islamist leaders have vowed to take back the town ; some unconfirmed accounts say they already have .
In any event , the Ethiopian involvement may have already triggered a conflict .
The Islamists have consolidated their remarkable hold over central and south Somalia by appealing to nationalist as well as religious sentiment .
By denouncing Ethiopia at every turn , the Islamists are reaching beyond the country 's divisive clan politics .
In response to the Ethiopian incursion , the Islamists in Mogadishu have declared a jihad , or holy war , against Ethiopia .
Particularly worrying , that declaration came from a leading moderate in the Mogadishu camp , Sheikh Sharif Ahmed .
Mr Ahmed had been involved in negotiations for a power - sharing deal with the transitional government in Baidoa .
That now looks very much in doubt .
A usually peaceful character , Mr Ahmed was seen dressed in combat fatigues and brandishing an AK - 47 as he declared war .
He told Somalis to “ await orders ” and announced the raising of a force to drive Ethiopians and foreign peacekeepers , including a few Ugandans , out of Somalia .
He denounced some members of the transitional government as traitors .
Some of this is undoubtedly bluster , designed to keep a fractious coalition happy .
Although they confiscated weaponry and armoured jeeps from the Mogadishu warlords routed earlier this year , the Islamists have no conventional army to speak of .
Intelligence reports suggest that Eritrea and shady Arab sponsors may have passed the Islamists heavy anti-aircraft guns and bits of other air defence systems made in Russia and Ukraine .
Should the fighting escalate , these may deter Ethiopian planes from striking at targets in Mogadishu .
In other respects the Islamists are ill - equipped to take on the larger Ethiopian force in conventional warfare .
Instead , radicals among the Islamists may respond to the Ethiopian incursions with terrorist strikes .
A bombing campaign inside Ethiopia , where a large Muslim population exists , or even attacks in Kenya , could prove devastating for the region .
It could also give weight to Osama bin Laden 's call for the Horn of Africa to become the world 's third jihadist front , after Iraq and Afghanistan .
Of particular interest to the jihadists is luring Ethiopia , an ancient Christian civilisation , into a war against Muslims .
Ethiopia 's motivation is mixed .
It worries that Eritrea , an old foe , is supporting the Islamists in Somalia .
It blames Somali Islamists for a number of bomb attacks in Addis Ababa , the Ethiopian capital , and elsewhere in central Ethiopia .
Ethiopia 's prime minister , Meles Zenawi , a former rebel leader himself , has promised a hard response to further bombings in an effort to put off any potential new rebel groups inside Ethiopia .
That is risky , but his government is worried by the threat from Mogadishu .
Mr Zenawi should know about that : he once sheltered in Mogadishu as a rebel fighter seeking to bring down the regime in Addis Ababa .
The only time Carolyn Kelley sits in her chair during this class is the minute it takes to set up the interactive whiteboard that 's linked to her computer .
On her desk sits the classic science room décor : a blankly staring skull .
But that 's it for bored looks .
Once Ms. Kelley takes her place in front of the 15 high school sophomores seated at tables in a " U " formation , there 's no lack of liveliness in the faces looking back .
" How many of you guys eat Mexican food ? " the biotechnology teacher asks as she introduces the test they 're about to conduct in the lab next door .
Just as people react differently to spicy foods , she explains , some bacteria produce acid after eating glucose .
If the organism turns red after the solution is added , the test is positive for acid .
After a quick round of questions , her charges suit up in white coats , goggles , and blue latex gloves .
Kelley says she takes " the new three - Rs approach " to education – " rigor , relevance , and relationship . "
It 's not just a slogan , which is why people here at the Seacoast School of Technology ( SST ) say no one was surprised she was named New Hampshire Teacher of the Year .
Described by colleagues as modest and by herself as " a lab geek , " the best reward for Kelley seems to be that her students learn to love science .
Everyone from CEOs to members of the National Governors Association is clamoring for better science education to prepare the future workforce for a high - tech world .
Last year 's release of science scores on the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress did n't bode well :
While fourth - graders had improved since 1996 , eighth - grade scores were stagnant , and 12th - graders ' declined .
As policymakers seek the formula for improved results , they might do well to take a peek into classrooms like Kelley's .
She grabs students ' attention by connecting her lessons with daily news revolving around biotech issues such as stem cells and forensics .
The classroom – inhabited by fish tanks , pictures of exotic frogs , and an inflated green alien sporting a lab coat – practically vibrates with energy .
Above each student hangs a unique squiggly model of the protein that represents his or her name translated into DNA code .
" Unfortunately , a lot of students get turned off of science in elementary and middle school , and you just do n't see a lot of American students going into science and engineering , " Kelley says .
" If you can show students how science is so relevant to their lives , they really grasp onto it .
I 'm graduating students every year that go on to science careers . "
They come to her from six regional high schools , spending 90 minutes a day doing work that can earn them college credits .
Kelley applied for grants to create a lab that rivals those at research universities .
When Kelley started biotech at SST in 2001 after working in private industry , it was the first of several high - tech programs that turned around an enrollment slump , says Principal Nancy Pierce .
With about 99 percent of her students going on to four - year colleges , Kelley has helped eliminate out - of - date perceptions that career and technical schools ( formerly known as vocational ) are for kids who lag academically .
" The kids just adore her , and she does n't make it easy on them , " Ms. Pierce says .
" She does n't have to give lots of quizzes to check on their knowledge , because she makes it so urgent that they know they need to learn this in order to do what they want to do . "
Sharing a lab bench with three classmates , Kaila Phillips pours half of a yellowish liquid into a second test tube .
From across the room , Kelley calls out a reminder to pour over the sink , and Kaila quickly moves to comply .
" In the beginning , I honestly thought that I was n't going to like this class , " Kaila says , " but about a week into it , I 'm like , ' Wow , this is really cool ! '
I 'm all science -y now . "
She thinks she 'll be either a nurse or a pharmacist .
Across the bench , Sean Kelley ( no relation ) says his teacher " keeps everything exciting and new .
She 'll put up slide shows of current events , so she relates everything that 's going on in the world right now to what we 're doing in the lab . "
When the nation 's attention was fixed on E. coli in spinach , " we had it in Petri dishes in front of us , " he says .
" She trusts us . "
The organisms are attenuated and safe for student use , Kelley explains , but to the kids , it 's still a motivator .
" It makes you grow up just a little bit quicker , " says Samantha Pettipost .
The responsibility is paired with a relaxed attitude .
" She is really friendly and bubbly and probably the most fun teacher I 've ever had , " Kaila says .
She makes jokes , " sometimes corny ones , " adds Kaila 's lab partner , Jessor Baugh .
" I would n't give anything to the students to work on that I would n't enjoy doing , " Kelley says .
" If you love science , which I do , it 's just so easy to make it interesting and pass on that enthusiasm . "
Kelley drives home the relevance by involving students in the community .
For one project , they met with families affected by Alzheimer 's and put together an educational handbook .
Another time , they created a biotech exhibit for children at Boston 's Museum of Science .
The teens also choose individual research projects .
Kaila is surveying local vets about feline leukemia , which has affected her cat .
Samantha loves fish , so she 's testing their memory with a routine of turning tank lights on before they 're fed .
Students at SST also do summer internships to check out potential career paths .
People who host Kelley 's students frequently tell her that their skills outshine those of many college students .
She 's recently put up a " Wall of Fame " outside her classroom , showing what former students did for internships – everything from studying genetics to tracing suicide trends with the medical examiner 's office – and what they 're now studying in college .
Two SST biotech interns have worked with Vaughn Cooper , an assistant professor of microbiology and genetics at the University of New Hampshire in Durham .
One , a freshman at UNH , still works in Mr. Cooper 's lab .
" He 's one of our best students , " Cooper says by phone .
In high school , " he was a good student but not one of those blinding all - star students ... but it 's clear that the experience he got in [ Kelley 's ] classes ... really lit a fire under him .
When he showed up in my lab he started to swim right away . "
Marilyn Kellogg , the career adviser at SST , says such internships are integral .
" It makes students much more motivated – they have a better sense of what they need to know , " she says .
Kelley was called into a surprise assembly at SST last fall to be named the state 's teacher of the year , based on a committee 's review of nominations from students , teachers , and administrators .
Everyone from the superintendent to her husband was in the audience as she was awarded a $ 3,000 grant .
She 's already used part of it to buy new equipment for the lab .
She 'll use her bully pulpit to boost science education in lower grades .
Matthew Kramer was in Kelley 's first class at SST .
Now he 's a junior at UNH , double majoring in microbiology and business .
" The unique thing about what she 's doing ... is that she starts teaching a lot of high - level procedures that you probably would n't learn till you 're a junior in college , " Mr. Kramer says by phone .
He 's ahead of his classmates in the lab because of that , he says , and he found that classes like organic chemistry made a lot more sense because he could see how the information would be applied .
" You absorb the knowledge a lot better . "
Kramer hopes someday to start his own biotech company .
If he does , you can be sure that fact will be up on Kelley 's Wall of Fame faster than you can say " DNA . "

This photo of the Arctic tundra is a good example of treeline advance ; all of the trees in this image date to the period of rapid establishment ( 1925 - 1950 ) .
Rising temperatures fueled by global warming are causing forests of spruce trees to invade Arctic tundra faster than scientists originally thought , evicting and endangering the species that dwell there and only there , a new study concludes .
Tundra is land area where tree growth is inhibited by low temperatures and a short growing season .
In the Arctic , the tundra is dominated by permafrost , a layer of permanently frozen subsoil .
The only vegetation that can grow in such conditions are grasses , mosses and lichens .
Forests of spruce trees and shrubs neighbor these tundra areas , and the boundary where they meet is called the treeline .
In summer , the permafrost thaws , and the tundra becomes covered in bogs and lakes , allowing a unique habitat for plants .
Climate change , meanwhile , has extended the summer warming season and promoted tree growth , causing the treeline to encroach on the tundra .
By looking at tree rings , researchers reconstructed a 300 - year history of tree density and treeline position .
The results show trees can creep up on the tundra faster than previously thought .
“ The conventional thinking on treeline dynamics has been that advances are very slow because conditions are so harsh at these high latitudes and altitudes , ” said Ryan Danby of the University of Alberta .
“ But what our data indicates is that there was an upslope surge of trees in response to warmer temperatures .
It ’s like it waited until conditions were right and then it decided to get up and run , not just walk . ”
While in many places the idea of more trees is a good one , this Arctic takeover endangers species like caribou and sheep that thrive in the tundra , as well as the native people who depend on these species for their survival .
The details of the study are published in the March issue of the Journal of Ecology .
Danby plans to continue his research as a part of the International Polar Year research effort .

Good Greek What A Good Olympics !
When the dust settles on the Athens Olympics - that is if dust ever settles in Athens - we 'll be looking at a pretty good few weeks I reckon .
If we can get the whole shebang in London for 2012 , I for one will be a happy chappy .
You can bet they 'll be farming out the crap sports to the provinces , mind .
I can just see the Olympic Inflatable Dinghy and Coracle Championship on the River Tees .
Still , here 's me thoughts on the one just gone ....
Best Olympic Moment

Followed by immediate self - doubt .
Followed by joy and tears and all that stuff .
I know the Olympics are supposed to embrace all sorts of sports but , be honest , it does n't really kick off till the running , the jumping and the chucking starts .
Worst Olympic Moment

Horrible .
Maybe they should change the name of that hell - hole of a race to Snickers .
Maybe she'd have won the Snickers .
Top Blubbering
Pinsent .
Man Mountain in an avalanche of tears .
I do n't think men should cry in public , but then again , I 've never been as tired as that man was .
He 's Britain 's favourite toff .
Good on 'im .
Oh dear , how sad - never mind
Most Enjoyable Failure
Maurice Greene .
When a big mouth flops , you just want to punch the air with delight .
Him and his stupid prowl and his go - faster slaphead hairstyle .
That Greatest Of All Time tattoo is going to hurt when he lasers it off .
Most Surprising Success
Well it has to be the Men's 4 x 100 relay .
A bunch of under - achievers over - achieve !
And I swear Mark Lewis - Francis ' roaring celebration was aimed to the man two lanes to his right .
Maybe they should carry a baton when they run in the individual event from now on , just to remind themselves of what they are capable of .
Most Incomprehensible Sport
It 's not Champion the Wonder Horse you know !
The Modern Pentathlon .
The whole thing seems fair enough to me until they get to the horsey bit .
Then the poor saps get to sit on a horse that has hardly been five minutes off the prairie .
I mean , for God 's sake , what 's the point of swimming and shooting and fencing if you end up having your chances ruined by some nag who thinks he 's Champion the Wonder Horse ?!
A nonsense .
Then again there 's the rhythmic gymnastics .
Flouncing about with a ribbon and a ball and a pair of clubs .
Hell fire .
Since when did a ballet class for four - year olds constitute a sport ?
Dopiest Contribution
The judges .
Who decides who 's qualified to do that job ?
Whether it was the triple jump , the gymnastics , the canoeing or even the taekwondo ( and what a joke that is - it's like watching two mad March hares going at it in crash helmets ) , the judges seemed to be on another planet .
Nowadays on the jumping events , they can measure how far behind the line the athletes take off from using a computer .
So let the computer tell us how far the jump is .
Why have the bloody plasticine when all that means is some arthritic twerps get to wave flags around like some porter on a village steam railway ?
Still , if you need judges to decide who wins then the sport in question has some problems .
I mean why not make Crufts part of the Olympics ?
Or even the growing of leeks ?
( At least you 'd have a guaranteed gold medallist from the North - East in that one . )
Sports to Go
Lets hope the Chinese takeaway the following from Beijing 2008 :
Football - why is it there ?
No one wants it , especially the players .
Tennis - same again .
Hey you averagely good millionaires !
Fancy a medal ?!
Did n't think so .
A Mini Clubman - for those under 40
Synchronised Anything -
They even have solo synchronised swimming you know .
Who are they synchronising with exactly ?
One more bunch of water babes mincing poolside , with the nose - clips making them look like a group of lycra - clad rodents , and I 'll go mad .
Weightlifting - I 've never liked this .
First of all they need to stop loading the bar with heavy discs cos that does n't mean owt to the average Joe .
Put a Mini Clubman on either side , well that 's a different matter .
" Crikey ! " yells the crowd , " that bloke lifted two minis , and he 's back to lift the two Allegros next . "
Secondly , there seems to be a lot of competitors who are as familiar with the syringe as the clean and jerk .
So let 's send them off to the circus where these freaks belong , eh ?
The Hosts
Well I 've always loved the Greek hospitality .
And they were grand here .
Shame they had to go all defensive about Kenderis and the precious 200 m ( shame too that the bustiest athlete in the Games was winning a man 's race ) .
But apart from that - and the rugby tackle in the marathon - they held a grand tournament .
And if they can get everything finished in time , surely we can .
Go on , Rogge !
Do n't let the French have it .
Give us the Games !!!
Google is committed to giving away some of its money
Its new philanthropic division , named Google.org , will fund social investment projects in the developing world .
Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are devoting 1 % of Google 's stock and profits - almost $ 1bn ( £ 573 m ) - to the new charitable venture .
The first beneficiaries include projects to improve water supplies in rural Africa and anti-poverty works .
The charity is the outcome of a pledge made by the California - based company at the time of its initial stock market flotation last year .
Mr Page and Mr Brin said they would set up a Google Foundation to do " good things for the world " .
Progressive
The foundation will start with an initial endowment of about $ 90 m ( £ 51.5 m ) .
In addition , a further $ 175 m will be invested outside the foundation over the next three years , with the aim of aiding " socially progressive " private companies as well as non-profit organisations .
Among the first causes to benefit are :
The Acumen Fund , which will receive $ 5 m to fund anti-poverty and healthcare schemes in the developing world
A research project in Kenya run by economists from Harvard University and the University of California , which will get $ 400,000 for efforts to improve rural water quality
US - based organisation Technoserve will get $ 500,000 for a competition to find and fund business start - ups in Ghana .
Google 's vice - president of operations and advertising Sheryl Sandberg - who is in charge of Google.org - said the company wanted to provide sustainable solutions to the problems of poverty , energy and the environment .
" It 's not a lot of money in the face of the world 's problems , so we want to make sure to get the most out of it , " she said .
Nanotechnology offers tremendous potential benefits in medicine , materials and manufacturing , and Australian nanotech firms are hoping to claim their share of the emerging market .
Hence this week ’s nanotechnology forum at Melbourne ’s Crown Promenade Hotel — Healthy Opportunities from Small Technologies — which features experts in the field from around the world .
Under discussion will also be micro , bio and info technology , but nano is the star attraction .
In the new sciences of the 21st century , big is no longer beautiful .
It is hard to fathom just how small the nanoscale is — one - to - 100 nanometres ( a nanometre is a billionth of a metre ) .
If the one - millimetre interval on your ruler was scaled up in size to a kilometre , the nano range would be equal to the width of your hand or smaller .
At this scale you can , in theory , build things out of individual atoms .
It is seriously tiny .
But smaller , as scientists have discovered , also means faster , cheaper and lighter .
Nanotechnology will pave the way for a host of products , some already with us , that will transform our world .
And , as alluded to in Crichton ’s novel , there are concerns over the safety of nanotechnology — though its advocates argue that such dangers will never occur anywhere other than in the realm of science fiction .
One of the conference visitors will be Craig Cuddeback , vice - president of the US - based nanotech magazine Small Times : “ It ’s already in the market .
It ’s included in sunscreen products , it ’s in encodings for lenses and glasses , they ’re using it in building materials . ”
Cuddeback says glass has been coated with nano - structured wax particles to create self - cleaning windows .
Nanoglass can also be designed to better trap heat .
But his favourite existing nanoproducts are the pants and shirts made by such firms as the US - based Nanotex , where the fabric is coated with nanoparticles .
“ There ’s no stain or wrinkles .
I ’ve had a couple of shirts now for over a year and washed them every week and I still have n’t put an iron to them or had a stain on them .
And they feel just like cotton . . . you ca n’t tell the difference . ”
Sunscreen is another example .
Zinc cream is a very visible white coating , unlike a nano - zinc cream such as “ Megan Gale Invisible Zinc ” , which has just hit the market .
“ The zinc particles are so small you ca n’t see them .
It ’s more effective , too . ” Mercedez - Benz , says Cuddeback , have built cars with nanotech scratchproof finish .
Japanese researchers are using nanotech “ buckytubes ” that will allow high - resolution , flat - panel television .
Energy is another field ripe for nanotech takeover .
“ They ’re using nanotech for application to flat panel lights , where there are walls of light to replace light bulbs . ”
He ’s also predicting a future full of nanotech .
In 2020 , he says we will be drinking desalinated water purified through nanofilters ; nanowiring may be fine enough to connect severed nerves in an injured spine , restoring partial movement for quadraplegics and paraplegics ; biosensors with nanodetectors will protect cities from gas or viral attack .
In defence , soldiers will wear T - shirt - weight material that can stop a bullet ; nano - engineered explosives will be vastly more powerful ; lightweight tanks will have superstrong nanoarmour .
Meanwhile , by 2018 , the US company Liftport , with NASA ’s backing , is aiming to build the first space elevator , in essence a superstrong cable stretching from an orbiting satellite to the ground .
Mechanised “ lifters ” will hoist themselves up the cable and carry payloads into orbit .
But the only material that ’s strong enough to build such a cable — albeit produced so far only in short lengths — is a nano - engineered material called carbon nanotubes .
While nanorobots , or nanobots , may remain fantasy , there is no doubt that nanotechnology will enable mechanical devices to become far smaller than they are now .
A prime example is “ lab - on - a - chip ” , one of the fastest - growing fields in nanotech , where a full - scale laboratory is shrunk to the size of your hand .
A blood test that used to take between four and 48 hours could be done in just 30 to 40 minutes .
The same lab could provide on - the - spot testing for water contamination or bacterial infection of meat .
“ A lot of the things that you went to a pathologist for , you ’ll be able to do at home , ” says Terry Turney , the director of CSIRO ’s Nanotechnology Centre .
“ You ’ll be able to download that information to the GP so when you walk into the GP ’s office he or she will have all the information they need for a good diagnosis . ”
Nanoengineering is also the only way computing speed will continue to increase as current chip technology approaches its limits .
“ We ’re going to reach the point where we ca n’t keep on miniaturising transistors , ” says Turney .
“ In 2020 I would hope that we ’ve sorted out how to make molecular transistor devices , which will mean that we ’ll get very much higher processing power . ”
The nano future , then , looks set to deliver macro rewards .
How , then , can Crichton and critics including Sun Microsystems founder Bill Joy predict nano doom ?
By 2020 , we may well have transistors built out of molecules .
Some believe we may go further and build “ nanomachines " — fully autonomous , self - replicating devices able to build endless copies of themselves out of molecules and atoms from normal materials .
Hence the talk of “ nanobots ” zipping around our bloodstream , as in the film Fantastic Voyage , curing diseases .
Or a swarm of nanobots repairing the ozone layer , or cleaning up oil slicks , or attacking an invading army .
American scientist K. Eric Drexler invented the nanobot concept in his landmark 1986 book Engines of Creation : The Coming Era of Nanotechnology .
Drexler remains a champion of the concept and is the founder of the non-profit Foresight Institute , which funds development of these “ molecular self - assemblers ” .
But Drexler ’s book also warned that a swarm of out - of - control nanobots replicating themselves exponentially could swiftly turn the entire planet into a mass of “ grey goo ” .
This now infamous term remains the worst - case scenario for nanotechnology .
Crichton ’s book , although not about grey goo , details a similar threat to mankind from self - replicating nanobots .
But nanobots are a long way from , say , nano - engineered DVDs that can store 500 times the data of a current disc .
And it ’s one thing to have material coated in nanoparticles or pricked with nanoholes but it ’s quite another to have working machines that size , although Drexler remains convinced they can be built .
“ Not in our lifetime will we have little motors running around in our bodies curing cancer , ” says Thomas Wyrobek , president of US nanotech firm Hysitron .
Turney agrees .
“ Most scientists believe there are very sound scientific reasons why construction of a totally inorganic nanomachine is going to be , if not impossible , then very very difficult . . . it ’s decades , if not many decades , away before we can solve some of these problems .
“ In order to create machines of that size , you ’ve got a problem with self - repair .
There ’s very few atoms involved in some of the features at that level and they tend to break up very readily .
They ’re very fragile . ”
While the advent of marauding swarms of nanobots are highly unlikely , nanotechnology still has its critics .
Prince Charles , writing in the British newspaper The Independent in July , said nanotechnology could offer “ similar upsets ” to thalidomide , a reference that many British scientists felt was inappropriate .
While the prince acknowledged that nanotechnology was a “ triumph of human ingenuity ” and that “ some of the work may have fundamental benefits to society , such as enabling the construction of much cheaper fuel cells , or new ways of combating ill - health ” , he also asked “ how are we going to ensure that proper attention is given to the risks that may . . . ensue ? ”
However , he denied using the expression “ grey goo ” , adding “ I do not believe that self - replicating robots , smaller than viruses , will one day multiply uncontrollably and devour our planet .
Such beliefs should be left where they belong , in the realms of science fiction . ”
The same month , a study commissioned by the British Government recommended that free nanoparticles , or those that could come into direct contact with humans through the air or the skin , be subject to fresh regulatory controls , as their impact is uncertain .
“ We are concerned with this one area , ” said Ann Dowling , chair of the working group behind the study .
But the report she oversaw generally gave nanotechnology a bill of clean health .
“ Almost all nanotechnology poses no risk , ” she said .
Bluntness , for example , is a virtue .
Saying to a child , “ Would you put your toys back in the box , please ? ” turns a command into a question .
Saying , “ Let ’s put your toys back in the box , ” implies collaboration .
An unadorned “ Put your toys back in the box ” is clearer for everyone , psychologists say , especially so for a child who is highly distractible .
However it is dressed up , family therapy like this teaches parents to provide what many critics say children these days are missing — discipline .
But therapists make a careful distinction between corrective action and cruelty , between firmness and frostiness .
Overly punitive parents increase the likelihood that a child will develop mood problems , some studies suggest .
So parents learn not to become scolds , but to bring their children into line without demeaning them .
In some programs , parents play - act situations in front of their peers , who critique the performance for emotional tone and the clarity of parents ’ statements .
As a result , the parents say , they become immediately more deliberate at home .
“ You end up constantly saying things like , ‘ That ’s not an appropriate behavior , ’ using this unnatural language , ” said Ms. Popczynski .
“ But the point is you do n’t get into it with them .
The first thing I noticed was that I was n’t yelling all the time .
The house got a lot quieter right away . ”
Their instructions to Peter and Scott became more precise , as well .
Saying “ Clean your room ” is too vague and covers a half - dozen tasks , Roman Popczynski , the boys ’ father , said .
Peter might wonder where to start , or just decide it was too much to worry about , and give up , his father said .
“ Put your laundry in the hamper ” is much more likely to get results , he said , and lead to the next clear step , like “ Put your toys where they belong . ”
Multiple commands are also confounding : “ Put away your crayons , clear away the table , and organize your homework , please ” leaves a child wondering which to do first , and whether it is too much work to finish .
“ It overloads a kid , and then he feels like he ’s failing , which only makes it worse , ” said Mr. Popczynski , who is a UPS driver .
Starting Slowly
Like most who try to use behavior modification techniques , the Popczynskis relied on a daily report card to keep a running tally of Peter ’s specific problem behaviors , like wandering attention , ignoring commands or defiance , and his efforts to correct them .
For instance , at the beginning , Peter , then 7 , would get a check mark every time he ignored more than two commands to do his homework , put away his toys or brush his teeth , but he would earn immediate praise if he got started .
He received check marks when he slid off his chair at dinner , and earned approval if he stayed seated .
A nationwide campaign is under way in Cameroon to discourage the widespread practice of " breast ironing " .
This involves pounding and massaging the developing breasts of young girls with hot objects to try to make them disappear .
Statistics show that 26 % of Cameroonian girls at puberty undergo it , as many mothers believe it protects their daughters from the sexual advances of boys and men who think children are ripe for sex once their breasts begin to grow .
The most widely used instrument to flatten the breasts is a wooden pestle , used for pounding tubers in the kitchen .
Heated bananas and coconut shells are also used .
Student Geraldin Sirri recounted her painful experience .
" My mother took a pestle , she warmed it well in the fire and then she used it to pound my breasts while I was lying down .
She took the back of a coconut , warmed it in the fire and used it to iron the breasts .
" I was crying and trembling to escape but there was no way . "
Another woman from Mamfe in south - west Cameroon told me she ironed her own breasts as a girl so that she would not be forced into early marriage as is the practice in her village .
" I wanted to go to school like other girls who had no breasts , " Emilia said .
' No regrets '
Many mothers have no regrets about ironing their daughter 's breasts .
" Breast ironing is not a new thing .
I am happy I protected my daughter .
I could not stand the thought of boys spoiling her with sex before she completed school , " one woman explained .
" Unfortunately , television is encouraging all sorts of sexual immorality in our children . "
Anthropologist Dr Flavien Ndonko says that breast ironing is not an effective method of preventing early sex and pregnancies because many of the girls still become pregnant .
He recommends plain talking between parents and their daughters .
" What you have to really do is talk about the issue of sexual reproductive health with the child .
So that she is aware about what it means growing up and having breasts or having periods , " he says .
With the help of sponsors , a group of teenage girls called the Association of Aunties has produced a television campaign to expose the problems of breast ironing .
" Massaging the breasts of young girls is very dangerous .
This is harmful to health ...
Do not force them to disappear or appear - allow them to grow naturally , " one of the adverts says .
Prison
So far , no research has taken place on the medical effects of breast ironing .
However , Prof Anderson Doh , a cancer surgeon and director of the state - owned Gynaecological Hospital in Cameroon 's capital , Yaounde , says the practice is dangerous .
" There are structures in the breast made of connective tissue .
Now if you over iron the breast , if you use very hot objects , if you pound on the breast at this tender age when the structures are developing of course you could also cause damage , " he says .
The victims do have protection under the law , as long as the matter is reported within a few months , lawyer Buba Ndefiembu says .
If a medical doctor determines that damage has been caused to the breasts , then the person responsible can go to jail for up to three years .
This does not always deter mothers who see their daughters hitting puberty earlier and earlier thanks to better living standards .
But the Association of Aunties hopes their campaign will start to change attitudes and spare other girls future physical and emotional pain .

It 's not the act itself , it 's the hypocrisy .
That 's the line on Paul Wolfowitz coming from editorial pages around the world .
It 's neither : not the act ( the way he disregarded the rules to get his girlfriend a pay rise ) ; and not the hypocrisy ( the fact that Wolfowitz 's mission as World Bank president is fighting for " good governance " ) .
First , let 's dispense with the supposed hypocrisy problem .
" Who wants to be lectured on corruption by someone telling them to ' Do as I say , not as I do ' ? " asked one journalist .
No one , of course .
But that 's a pretty good description of the game of one - way strip poker that is our global trade system , in which the United States and Europe - via the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation - tell the developing world : " You take down your trade barriers and we 'll keep ours up . "
From farm subsidies to the Dubai Ports World scandal , hypocrisy is our economic order 's guiding principle .
Wolfowitz 's only crime was taking his institution 's international posture to heart .
The fact that he has responded to the scandal by hiring a celebrity lawyer and shopping for a leadership " coach " is just more evidence that he has fully absorbed the World Bank way : when in doubt , blow the budget on overpriced consultants and call it aid .
The more serious lie at the centre of the controversy is the implication that the World Bank was an institution that had impeccable ethical credentials - until , according to 42 former World Bank executives , its credibility was " fatally compromised " by Wolfowitz .
( Many American liberals have seized on this fairytale , addicted to the fleeting rush that comes from forcing neocons to resign . )
The truth is that the bank 's credibility was fatally compromised when it forced school fees on students in Ghana in exchange for a loan ; when it demanded that Tanzania privatise its water system ; when it made telecom privatisation a condition of aid for Hurricane Mitch ; when it demanded labour " flexibility " in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami ; when it pushed for eliminating food subsidies in post- invasion Iraq .
Ecuadoreans care little about Wolfowitz 's girlfriend ; more pressing is that in 2005 the World Bank withheld a promised $ 100 m after the country dared to spend a portion of its oil revenues on health and education .
Some anti-poverty organisation .
But the area where the World Bank has the most tenuous claim to moral authority is in the fight against corruption .
Almost everywhere that mass state pillage has taken place over the past four decades , the World Bank and the IMF have been first on the scene of the crime .
And no , they have not been looking the other way as the locals lined their pockets ; they have been writing the ground rules for the theft and yelling " Faster , please ! " - a process known as rapid - fire shock therapy .
Russia under the leadership of the recently departed Boris Yeltsin was a case in point .
Beginning in 1990 , the World Bank led the charge for the former Soviet Union to impose immediately what it called " radical reform " .
When Mikhail Gorbachev refused to go along , Yeltsin stepped up .
This bulldozer of a man would not let anything or anyone stand in the way of the Washington - authored programme , including Russia 's elected politicians .
After Yeltsin ordered army tanks to open fire on demonstrators in October 1993 , killing hundreds and leaving the parliament building blackened by flames , the stage was set for the fire - sale privatisations of Russia 's most precious state assets to the so - called oligarchs .
Of course , the World Bank was there .
Of the democracy - free lawmaking frenzy that followed Yeltsin 's coup , Charles Blitzer , the World Bank 's chief economist on Russia , told the Wall Street Journal : " I 've never had so much fun in my life . "
When Yeltsin left office , his family had become inexplicably wealthy , while several of his deputies were enmeshed in bribery scandals .
These incidents were reported in the west , as they always are , as unfortunate local embellishments on an otherwise ethical economic modernisation project .
In fact , corruption was embedded in the very idea of shock therapy .
The whirlwind speed of change was crucial to overcoming the widespread rejection of the reforms , but it also meant that by definition there could be no supervision .
Moreover , the payoffs for local officials were an indispensable incentive for Russia 's apparatchiks to create the wide - open market that Washington was demanding .
The bottom line is that there is good reason that corruption has never been a high priority for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - their officials understand that when enlisting politicians to advance an economic agenda guaranteed to win those politicians furious enemies at home , there generally has to be a little in it for the politicians in bank accounts abroad .
Russia is far from unique .
From Augusto Pinochet , the Chilean dictator who managed to accumulate more than 125 bank accounts while building the world 's first neoliberal state , to Carlos Menem , the Argentinian president who drove around in a bright red Ferrari Testarossa while liquidating his country , to Iraq 's " missing billions " today , there is in every country a class of ambitious and bloody - minded politicians who are willing to act as western subcontractors .
They will take a fee , and that fee is called corruption - the silent but ever present partner in the crusade to privatise the developing world .
The three main institutions at the heart of that crusade are in crisis - not because of the small hypocrisies , but because of the big ones .
The World Trade Organisation cannot get back on track , the International Monetary Fund is going broke , displaced by Venezuela and China .
And now the World Bank is going down .
The Financial Times reports that when World Bank managers dispensed advice , " they were now laughed at " .
Perhaps we should all laugh at the World Bank .
What we should absolutely not do , however , is participate in the effort to cleanse the bank 's ruinous history by repeating the absurd narrative that the reputation of an otherwise laudable anti-poverty organisation has been sullied by one man .
The bank understandably wants to throw Wolfowitz overboard .
I say : let the ship go down with the captain .

We hear it again and again in the news : voters are unhappy with Democrats and Republicans , approval of both major parties is in the dumps and there ’s a general dislike for the status quo .
So this year , more than any other , I want to give voters the low - down on why the status quo is going to stay the same .
Sadly , whether you like it or not .
It ’s a problem that we ’ve only recently become aware of with some regularity thanks to the decentralization of the Internet : the system is rigged this way .
You see , the truth is that even as more and more independent candidates are being fielded for office each year , the number of them actually being elected has remained relatively flat ( that ’s not to say it never happens , but that it ’s just so rare that it ’s relatively unnoticeable ) .
I ’ve decided it ’s in everyone ’s political best interests to identify and break down these walls that have been erected by both incumbents and an apathetic media for third parties in this country .
Here ’s my rough take on what these are ( in order of apparent priority ) :
Restrictive ballot access laws
If a major party candidate can keep rivals off the ballot , they can then ignore those voter ’s concerns without fear of losing ( especially if their major party rival does the same ) .
Ignoring contrarian viewpoints has traditionally been a cornerstone of repressive government .
Fair and equal ballot access reform should be a priority for all third parties and anyone interested in true political reform .
Third parties largely need to move on from this issue if their only contention is that they are n’t recognized as a party , but their candidates have the same signature requirements as major parties .

Third parties largely need to move on from this issue if their only contention is that they are n’t recognized as a party , but their candidates have the same signature requirements as major parties .
Lackluster media coverage
Traditionally , third party candidates have to sell their ideas much harder than their major party rivals because media organizations typically do n’t find anything newsworthy about them ( unless they are beating the voter disaffection drum and pretending to care ) .
Sadly , this directly translates into lost votes since an uninformed voter will not vote for a candidate they have heard little or nothing about .
Whether this is intentional slighting on the part of some media outlets or just laziness in covering politics is debatable .
The most - covered independent campaigns are typically ones that field either a star / celebrity candidate ( Kinky Friedman anyone ? ) or use novel approaches ( read : publicity stunts ) to force their way into the public eye .

Fundraising and volunteers
This deserves to go after the media coverage , because while a campaign is usually small when it ’s starting , the coverage of the campaign is what drives informed voters to begin financially supporting and volunteering for a campaign .
Once the media coverage is triggered , a campaign can typically sustain it ’s momentum through increased news generation , campaign events and fundraisers .

Inclusive polling
Many pollsters will often lump all third parties into “ other ” categories or not include them at all .
Unfortunately , without the aforementioned media coverage , when they are included they often fall into the 2 % margins which can harm campaigns even more than not being included .
One way that third parties can attack this issue is by openly criticizing the pollsters who are not inclusive and paying for their own polls to publicize themselves further .
Another method is to sue state - funded university pollsters and take the case to a federal level .

Debating major candidates
The bar has been set excruciatingly high for third parties , with organizations like the League of Women ’s voters demanding 10 - 15 % polling .
This will never happen until the conditions above are met .
Presidential candidates Michael Badnarik ( L ) and David Cobb ( G ) were arrested while trying to serve papers to cease the debates in 2004 , but in reality it was little more than a variation of the publicity stunt angle , which paid off poorly for them to actually be in the debate , though it did help their publicity substantially ( at least on the Internet ) .

Presidential candidates while trying to serve papers to cease the debates in 2004 , but in reality it was little more than a variation of the publicity stunt angle , which paid off poorly for them to actually be in the debate , though it did help their publicity substantially ( at least on the Internet ) .
Election day ( voting methods )
This is the last hurdle for third parties , and is often the most difficult .
While many argue for a reform to Condorcet or IRV ( Instant Runoff Voting ) , the reality is that those are both methods that are meant to short - circuit all the problems above .
While logically we should be able to vote for candidates in order of ranked preference , it should n’t matter unless the race is a three - way extremely tight one .
Personally , I would like to see this stay the last priority for third parties , since it ’s not bound to change the outcome if their candidates remain unknown because of the walls stated before .
I wo n’t bore you with a lot of speculation on how these can all be miraculously fixed overnight , because the truth is we ’re probably looking at a tough decade of electoral reform in fifty different wars for us to even have just a slim super - minority of candidates in federal office .
I do n’t look at our battles from an ideological presentation standpoint , because I truly do n’t think that what ’s been holding third parties back ( Libertarian especially ) is bad reception of the platform , or the pledge , or whatever .
I ’m sure some people are always going to look at third parties and sniff their noses at one or two issues , leaving reformers and purists to duke it out amongst each other because they think that ’s why they keep losing races .
But in reality , it ’s not .
Update : Richard Winger of Ballot Access
News sez :
The article is unfair to the League of Women Voters .
In about half the states , the League has sponsored televised debates for Governor and US Senator and invited everyone on the November ballot .
The 15 % rule is from the Commission on Presidential Debates , not the League of Women Voters .
I have to disagree on factual grounds here .
I ’m not sure which states Winger has info on where the LWV invites every valid candidate , but back in 2004 in California they told U.S. Senate candidate Jim Gray to talk to the hand even after sponsoring his own poll through Rasmussen that got him 8 % ( the 3 % MOE put him over their 10 % entry barrier ) .
Recently here in Ohio , gubernatorial candidate Bill Peirce recently got dissed because he needs to poll … drumroll please … 15 % .
Update : Richard Winger writes back :
I only know about statewide offices .
In 1994 , Leagues invited at least some of the third party candidates for Governor and US Senator into their debates , in Alaska , Arizona , Colorado , Connecticut , Hawaii , Idaho , Maine , New Hampshire , Oklahoma , Oregon , Pennsylvania , South Dakota ( those were gubernatorial debates ) ; Delaware , Michigan , Missouri , Ohio , Virginia , Wyoming ( those were US Senate debates ) , and US House - at - large , Montana and Vermont .
When a state had two offices , I did n’t list the state twice .
It seems LWV requirements vary state by state .
Plainly speaking , they should just invite everyone who’s on the ballot , otherwise it ’s another unnecessary hurdle .
They ’ve actually raised their requirements in the past when pressured by Ds & Rs , so do n’t act surprised if a third party sues them over their non-profit status requiring them to be non-partisan one day soon … and wins .
Update : Richard Shepard sent a link to his recent article on third parties at Tacoma , Washington ’s paper — The News Tribune .
There ’s an interesting statistic he cites from Pew Research :
We have ample evidence the two - party system is not meeting Americans ’ needs .
Polls reveal a steady decline in voter participation , a lack of trust in government , and a desire for alternatives .
A Pew Research Center report , “ In Search of Ideologues in America , ” identifies four political philosophies of government .
Roughly 33 percent of the public falls into the well - known “ liberal ” or “ conservative ” philosophical camps .
Another 25 percent agrees with the lesser - known “ libertarian ” or “ populist ” philosophies even though they do not self - identify that way .
It seems out of the three biggest parties / ideologies , we ’re all in the polling minority .
Sobering , but it gives ammo to the argument that we need more choice on the ballot and that the media should be covering more than the two majors .

Hiroshima 's Atomic Dome : A warning to the world
A US team has modelled the effects of a limited conflict in the light of new concerns over weapons proliferation .
Its study , reported at an American Geophysical Union meeting , employed the very latest computer simulations .
For an exchange of 100 Hiroshima - sized bombs , the modelling suggested there would be millions of deaths , as well as climate cooling and ozone damage .
The team said increasing urbanisation and the centralisation of economies in megacities had made modern society more vulnerable to the destabilising effects of war .
" We saw what happened on 9/11 : 3,000 people died and the world economy staggered , " said Professor Richard Turco from the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) .
" One can only imagine the implications if Hiroshima - scale detonations occurred in one or more major cities around the world today . "
Agricultural disaster
It was Professor Turco who first coined the phrase " nuclear winter " back in the 1980s to describe the climate shift that would result from a war using atomic weapons .
FATALITY ESTIMATES
For 50 15kt airburst detonations centred on urban zones ; blast and fire deaths Argentina : 4,337,000 Brazil : 7,962,000 China : 16,716,000 Egypt : 7,834,000 France : 3,509,000 India : 12,424,000 Iran : 7,431,000 Israel : 2,594,000 Japan : 5,890,000 Pakistan : 9,171,000 Russia : 6,273,000 UK : 2,891,000 US : 4,056,000
It draws on expertise from UCLA , Rutgers University , New Jersey , and the University of Colorado at Boulder .
The team assumed an engagement between two emerging countries in the subtropics , and that the attacks with 15 - kiloton devices were focused on large metropolitan centres .
The explosions would ignite huge firestorms , fuelled by all the wood , plastics and petroleum products commonly found in such locations .
These would send thick black smoke into the upper troposphere , where heating by the Sun would drive the particles even higher into the stratosphere .
The new simulations , run on a Nasa supercomputer , show that for five million tonnes of black smoke sent skyward , the result would be a global cooling of 1.25 C , as the material spread out and blocked light from reaching the ground .
A reduction in precipitation levels of 10 % and a shortening of growing seasons by up to 30 days was also forecast .
The impact on global food supplies would be catastrophic , the group said .
Growing threat
The researchers warned that the impoverished conditions would last longer than previous studies had indicated because older climate models did not adequately represent the mechanisms that took material high into the stratosphere .
" If you look at the change in solar radiation from , say , the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption ( 1991 ) , it goes away after about a year , but the black smoke is lofted into the stratosphere and it lasts for a decade , " explained Professor Alan Robock from Rutgers .
" The effects last much longer than we thought previously because we now have the computer power and the detailed models to calculate the entire depth of the atmosphere and simulate that . "
Some regions would probably go back to cold conditions not experienced since medieval times and a climate phase sometimes referred to as the " Little Ice Age " when Europe in particular was hit by very harsh winters .
The authors also note that the smoke plumes would upset stratospheric chemistry , resulting in a significant disruption of the ozone layer , depleting it by 40 % over many inhabited areas and by up to 70 - 80 % at the poles .
The researchers said current concern about emerging nations acquiring nuclear weapons and the threat of terrorist attacks merited a return to the subject .
" While most people think we 're on a path of reduced probability of war because of nuclear build - down by the superpowers , in fact we actually have the opposite situation going on , " said Professor Owen Toon from Colorado University .
" We 're on a trend of a build - up of nuclear weapons .
In a couple of decades , there could be 20 , 30 , 40 nuclear states all as dangerous as the Soviet Union used to be . "

You have one drywall screw , one 1.5 V alkaline cell , six inches of plain copper wire , one small neodymium disk magnet , and no other tools or supplies .
You have 30 seconds to make an electric motor running in excess of ten thousand RPM .
Can you do it ?
Surprisingly enough , you can .
Let ’s take a step back .
The most common type of electric motor is the brushed dc electric motor .
This is the kind that you ’ll find inside essentially everything that moves ( or shakes ) and runs on batteries .
This type of motor attracts an electromagnet towards a permanent magnet .
When the two are close enough , the polarity of the current through the electromagnet is reversed , so that it now repels the permanent magnet , and thus keeps turning .
It ’s quite easy to build a working model ; Christian built this example for his third - grade science project .
A simpler yet motor ( sometimes sold as the sold as the “ world ’s simplest motor “ ) just switches off the current for half of the cycle , letting the angular momentum of the spinning motor armature carry it through .
In Make Magazine Volume 1 , the Howtoons comic shows how to make an electric motor that works that way .
None of these is really the simplest motor .
The real champion is the homopolar motor .
Ready to build one ?
Let ’s get started :
The ingredients ( L - R ) :
One ferromagnetic screw , one battery cell , a few inches of copper wire , and a neodymium disk magnet .
I used a drywall screw both because it has a flat head and because it ’s easy to tell when it ’s turning .
You can use a nail instead .
The battery need n’t be any particular type ; an alkaline C - cell works fine and is easy to hold .
Just about any copper wire will work fine for this application .
I used some wire with partially stripped ( and partially striped ) red insulation that is easy to see in the photos .
Bare copper will work just as well .
The magnet came from an LED throwie with a dead battery .
The best magnets for this job are neodymium disc magnets with a conductive plating .
You can get them from plastic toys or buy them from a number of magnet discount and surplus shops .
Set the screw on the magnet , bend the wire .
Attach the magnet to one end of the battery .
The weak , single - point contact that you are making serves as an low - friction bearing .
I like to attach it to the button end , but the other end will work as well .
( If you do so , the motor will spin the opposite direction .
You can also reverse the direction by flipping the magnet up side down . )
( Note to physics geeks :
The heavier your magnet plus screw system is , the lower the friction will be , right up to the point that magnet is n’t strong enough to hold them any more .
This is because the friction force is proportional to the normal force .
In other words , a bigger magnet is usually better . )
Press and hold the top end of the wire to the top end of the battery , making an electrical connection from the top battery end to the wire .
Here we go : Lightly touch the free end of the wire to the sideof the magnet .
The magnet and screw start to spin immediately .
We can get ours up to 10,000 RPM in about fifteen seconds .
Watch out :
The screw and magnet can easily fly out of control , and you do not want that screw ending up in your eye .
Also note that some of the components , like the wire , can get very warm while you ’re doing this .
Wear safety glasses and use common sense !
Short movie ( 25 s ) : spinning up the motor ( embedded below , or click through to YouTube )
Wondering what to try next ?
You may also like this project , which is about building a similar sort of motor that spins water instead of a magnet .
How does this work ?
When you touch the wire to the side of the magnet , you complete an electric circuit .
Current flows out of the battery , down the screw , sideways through the magnet to the wire , and through the wire to the other end of the battery .
The magnetic field from the magnet is oriented through its flat faces , so it is parallel to the magnet ’s axis of symmetry .
Electric current flows through the magnet ( on average ) in the direction from the center of the magnet to the edge , so it flows in the radial direction , perpendicular to the magnet ’s axis of symmetry .
If you took physics at some point , it ’s possible that you ’ll remember the effect that a magnetic field has on moving electric charges : they experience a force that is perpendicular to both their direction of movement and the magnetic field .
Since the field is along the symmetry axis of the magnet and the charges are moving radially outward from that axis , the force is in the tangential direction , and so the magnet begins to spin .
Neat !
For a slightly more thorough explanation , have a look at the end of this article , which is about a magnetohydrodynamic homopolar motor .
It ’s called a homopolar motor because you never need to reverse the polarity of any motor component during operation , unlike the other types of motors that we ’ve described .
I first learned about this type of motor in an article by David Kagan , in the magazine The Physics Teacher , February 2005 .
It turns out that it ’s been around longer than that : it was invented in 1821 by Michael Faraday .
Somewhat surprisingly , this is more than just a curiosity : motors of this design are currently being developed for quiet , high - power applications .
Final note :
How do we measure the rotational speed of the motor ?
You can get an optical tachometer for $ 20 or less , intended for use with model airplanes .
I have model LXPT31 from Tower Hobbies , which is expecting to see an airplane propellor with two blades .
I added two wide black stripes to the magnet with a Sharpie , which allow the tachometer to read the rotational speed of the motor .
Pointing the tachometer at the magnet and spinning up the motor , we were able to clock a speed above 10,000 RPM after spinning up for about fifteen seconds .
Spiffy .
Highly drug - resistant gonorrhea has been spreading rapidly across the U.S. and accounts for 13 % of all cases of the sexually transmitted disease , federal researchers said Thursday .
In a survey of 26 areas around the country , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found particularly high rates of drug- resistance in Long Beach , Orange County , San Diego , San Francisco , Philadelphia and Honolulu .
Drug - resistant infections accounted for at least 25 % of all cases in those areas .
“ That ’s a really dramatic trajectory in terms of emerging resistance , ” said Dr. John M. Douglas Jr. , director of the CDC ’s Division of Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention .
The CDC on Thursday urged doctors to stop using a powerful class of antibiotics -- fluoroquinolones -- that has been the primary treatment for the disease in most parts of the country .

The agency now recommends a single class of antibiotics known as cephalosporins .
“ We have a very efficient class of drugs left , but if they go away and resistance marches on to other antibiotics , then we ’re really in trouble , ” Douglas said .
Gonorrhea , caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae , is the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the U.S. , after chlamydia .
There are an estimated 700,000 new cases each year .
The disease can lead to severe complications in women , including infertility .
It also increases the risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted diseases , such as HIV .
Advertisement
It can be treated with antibiotics , but the bacterium has been developing resistance since the first drugs to fight it were introduced in the 1930s .
The CDC began recommending fluoroquinolones in 1993 .
Around 2000 , fluoroquinolone - resistant gonorrhea began emerging in Hawaii and California .
Health officials believe it originated in East and Southeast Asia and spread through the U.S. , first among gay men and then heterosexuals .
Hawaii and California soon asked doctors to stop using fluoroquinolones , but drug - resistant forms of the disease continued to spread across the country .
Advertisement
The CDC reported that 1 % of gonorrhea cases in 2001 were of the highly drug - resistant version .
After five years , that rose to 13 % nationally .
The acceleration in drug resistance has been most striking in Philadelphia .
The percentage of highly resistant gonorrhea cases skyrocketed from 1.2 % in 2004 to 26.6 % in 2006 .
Among gay men , drug - resistant gonorrhea accounted for 38 % of all cases , rising from just 1.6 % in 2001 .
The major West Coast cities had significant rates of drugresistant gonorrhea , but one anomaly has been Los Angeles , where the proportion remained stable around 10 % .
Advertisement
Dr. Jonathan Fielding , the public health director for Los Angeles County , said he was n’t sure why Los Angeles had such relatively low rates but said it was possible that L.A. caught the drug - resistance problem fairly early and changed treatments .
But in California as a whole , clamping down on drugs has not had an immediate effect .
The rate of drug resistance continued to rise after the state advised against fluoroquinolones in 2002 , more than doubling to 25 % of all gonorrhea cases in 2005 .
Dr. Gail Bolan , chief of the STD control branch at the state Department of Health Services , said she was not sure how many years it would take before the state saw a reduction .

“ Unfortunately , we do n’t understand the organism well enough , ” she said .

Yesterday was the deadline to submit requests for limited exemptions from the DMCA ’s ban on circumvention of access control technologies .
This happens every three years .
Alex Halderman and I submitted a request , asking for an exemption that would allow the circumvention of compact disk copy protection technologies that have certain spyware - ish features or create security holes .
We ’d like to thank Aaron Perzanowski and Deirdre Mulligan of the Samuelson Clinic at UC Berkeley , whose great work made this possible .
Many people decided not to submit exemption requests in this round , because of the way previous rounds have been handled .
For example , the EFF argues that the process is so strongly tilted against exemptions , and the Copyright Office tries so hard to find excuses not to grant exemptions , that there is no point in asking for one .
Even Seth Finkelstein , the only person who has had any real record of success in the process , decided to sit out this round .
I submitted requests for research - related exemptions in 2000 and 2003 ; and having seen how those requests were handled , I sympathize with the skeptics ’ position .
Nevertheless , I think it ’s worth asking for this exemption , if only to see whether the Copyright Office will acknowledge that copy protection technologies that install spyware or otherwise endanger the security or privacy of citizens are harmful .
Is that too much to ask ?
To most readers here , the most interesting paragraph of our exemption request is this one :
Researchers like Professor Edward Felten and Alex Halderman waste valuable research time consulting attorneys due to concerns about liability under the DMCA .
They must consult not only with their own attorneys but with the general counsel of their academic institutions as well .
Unavoidably , the legal uncertainty surrounding their research leads to delays and lost opportunities .
In the case of the CDs at issue , Halderman and Felten were aware of problems with the XCP software almost a month before the news became public , but they delayed publication in order to consult with counsel about legal concerns .
This delay left millions of consumers at risk for weeks longer than necessary .
The DMCA exemption process continues , with reply comments due February 2 .
According to a lawsuit filed against Best Buy this week , at least one Geek Squad technician has been doing more than just fixing computers .
On March 4th , technician Hao Kuo Chi reported to the home of Natalie Fornaciari and Sarah Vasquez .
While there , he allegedly placed his cell phone in the bathroom , where it caught 22 year - old Sarah Vasquez showering .
Upon exiting the shower , she discovered his cell phone placed behind the sink , with the " Record " function enabled .
And you thought cameras on phones were useless !
The girl 's mother kept Chi busy while Vasquez visited a Verizon store and viewed the contents of the recorded file .
Not only did Chi try to sneak some video , but the video he shot apparently shows him setting the phone up .
Busted !
The lawsuit filed against Best Buy alleges that Chi committed fraud , invasion of privacy , and infliction of emotional distress .
The filing also claims that Best Buy misrepresented services , and should have been more careful when hiring Hao .
It is unclear whether or not Hao has a history of this stuff , but it does n't look like it .
How could Best Buy have been " more careful " ?
Issues covered by the application process include questions like : " How do you feel about shoplifting ? " and " How would you deal with a troublesome customer ? "
I do n't recall any questions , specifically , regarding how the potential employee feels about recording video of a client 's daughter taking a shower .
You can , uh , peep the full story at the LA Times .

Interesting Facts About Chocolates
Carl Schramm 's opinion piece in the June issue of Inc. Magazine contains a stunningly bad idea .
The idea comes in the form of a suggestion which is actually somewhat amusing because it reveals the author 's immense ignorance of the nature of the subject his suggestion applies to : government .
The piece is titled Relocating Washington and the name pretty much says what 's on Schramm 's mind .
He wants to spread the federal government out all over the country , with bureaus being located in areas that are rich in industries relevant to their respective responsibilities .
In the middle of the article is a picture of the Capitol Building sitting in a corn field with a caption that reads , " Friends and Neighbors :
The feds might be more responsive to your needs if they lived right next door . "
Now does n't that sound nice ?
Let 's say you need one of those special services that only your friendly neighborhood bureaucrat can provide ( such as audits , inspections , artificial barriers to entry , burdensome regulations to cripple your competitors , lucrative no -bid contracts , or tariffs to guard against those annoyingly efficient foreigners . )
Rather than having to lobby Washington , if Schramm has his way , you 'll be able to jaywalk across the street and just ask .
But aside from greater access to federal officials , the author has more pressing and important reasons for suggesting the move .
The most predictable is the need to protect our rulers from imminent attack by terrorists .
Consider what would happen if all of D.C. was taken out in a single strike .
How could we carry on ?
Who would tax us ?
Who would provide us with " leadership " and foreign policy expertise ?
Who would fund the military industrial complex or covertly train and equip foreign guerillas to provide the constant stream of future enemies needed to justify a continually expanding global empire ?
Who would protect consumers from the corrupt , greedy hand of business that so relentlessly seeks their destruction ?
Who would care for and educate our children ?
Who would keep people from eating too much , using harmful drugs , being unfair or , heaven forbid , unpatriotic ?
It seems obvious that we can't risk having the entire backbone of the Federal leviathan eradicated at once .
But even if the terrorists are unsuccessful at destroying the source of the freedoms they so madly despise , the author presents yet another compelling reason why the Feds should spread out .
" One of the hallmarks of America 's entrepreneurial economy is a never - ending quest to reduce bureaucracy …
How is it then that our government does not reflect this truly American value ? …
Perhaps the best reason to dispatch government agencies to various corners of America is that it would dramatically increase the contact between u2018 them ' and u2018us . '
In abandoning Washington 's suburban cocoon , government workers could n't help but learn lessons about thrift and creativity and ( dare I say it ? ) customer service from the entrepreneurs who dominate the civic life of our cities and states .
As policymakers got to know their new neighbors better , surely their efforts would reflect a deeper understanding of and empathy for the risks entrepreneurs run , the choices they make , and the impact they have . "
So that 's the reason why our government is an overblown , bureaucratic mess .
If businessmen would just stop hiding their secret “ lessons ” from those who live in D.C. , Capitol Hill would look like the Googleplex .
The beltway busybodies just need some instruction in creativity and customer service .
They need a greater appreciation of the plight of the entrepreneur .
If they only knew what was going on in the trenches they could figure out how to help .
The preposterous nature of such a suggestion is striking .
The bloated wastefulness of government has nothing to do with the fact that it is geographically centralized .
The differences in productivity , efficiency and bureaucracy in the private versus the public sector cannot be solved by having bureaucrats and entrepreneurs play getting - to - know - you games or by holding neighborhood barbeques .
As long as we have a government it will display characteristics consistent with its nature .
The flaws in our government that the author laments are flaws inherent in the institution of government itself .
They are not unique to American government , just as efficiency , customer service and creativity are not unique to American business .
Incentives are what define and differentiate private ownership and free enterprise from top - down , command systems .
The former are rooted in liberty , property and voluntary exchange while the latter are based on force , deception and fear .
They are completely different systems and they produce outcomes as disparate as the nature of their foundations .
Until the incentives of the system are changed , we can expect the same outcome from government that we 've always seen .
And if the incentives were to be changed , well then it would n't be government anymore .
A government cannot be run like a business .
In closing , the author offers one last reason to consider his proposal .
" With more contact , entrepreneurs would come to realize that , in fact , the bureaucrats are n't out to get them .
Federal workers buy groceries and mow the lawn and worry about gas prices and their kids ' educations , just like you do .
If you want their respect , the feeling ought to be mutual . "
So the Feds are just doing their jobs .
They 're not out to get us ( try telling that to anyone who 's been harassed by the IRS ) .
Suppose we assume that this is true , that they have n't fallen in love with big government and that they do n't share the envy and resentment of successful businessmen that permeates most of Washington .
It 's entirely possible that most federal bureaucrats are nice people who make great neighbors and who , if employed in the private sector , would be productive and efficient .
The problem is that it is precisely the act of " doing their job " that puts them at odds with entrepreneurs .
Their job is to harass , to regulate , to threaten , to take by force .
I 'm afraid that makes it difficult for the truly entrepreneurial types out there to feel amiably towards them .
Personally , I do n't want their respect .
That 's theirs to give or withhold at their own discretion .
What I want is to be left alone and I do n't think moving my harassers next door will solve that problem .
Instead , I have a better idea .
It 's true that we should Relocate Washington .
Not to the far corners of the homeland , but to the far reaches of the global empire .
They 've done a good enough job pacifying the center , but are having some problems subjugating the periphery .
If we moved the Feds to say … Baghdad and Kabul , perhaps they could get a better handle on the situation .
Think how much more quickly liberty would flourish in the Middle East , if the backward people who inhabit the region could witness the greatest democracy in the world first hand .
If they could just see how free we are over here they would throw down their weapons and welcome us with open arms and shower us with rose petals .
And what better way to teach them about freedom than to send a swarm of benevolent bureaucrats and self - righteous regulators to inhabit their countries .
They already have a great constitution , now all they need is an IRS , an NSA , a TSA , FBI , CIA , DEA , ACF , AoA , AHRQ , NARA , DHS , BEA , BLM , CDC , COPS , CBO , CPSC , DCAA , DOD , DIA , DSS , DOC , DHS , HSS , DOT , DOE , EPA , EEOC , FAA , FCC , FDIC , FEMA , FTC , FDA , GSA , GAO , GPO , HUD , ITA , DOL , MDA , NASA , NIST , NIH , NOAA , OSHA , OMB , ONDCP , SEC , SBA and an SSA .
Then they 'll be well on their way to enjoying the freedoms and liberties that we Americans enjoy .

The Best of Aaron Singleton
The press conference to announce Dunn ’s resignation was scheduled to be held at 1 P.M. on Friday , September 22nd .
Dunn ’s request to participate in the press conference was rejected , but she felt that she was parting on good terms .
Hurd embraced her , and every board member followed suit , hugging her and murmuring , “ This is so unfair .
We ’re sorry .
Thank you . ”
At the press conference , Hurd acknowledged that the processes “ broke down , and no one in the management chain , including me , caught them . ”
He thanked Dunn for her eight years of service .
At the same time , he said he had received information that is “ very disturbing to me , ” and a Hewlett - Packard lawyer offered a narrative of the events that placed the blame squarely on Dunn .
Dunn was especially upset that the lawyer said she contacted private investigators , without mentioning that it was a Hewlett - Packard security manager who had sent her to them .
After the press conference , CNBC turned to a panel of experts , among them Viet Dinh , who praised Dunn for “ a courageous and graceful thing ” and for “ taking responsibility for the investigation that she initiated , conducted , and supervised . ”
That same day , Hewlett - Packard announced that Mark Hurd would become chairman as well as C.E.O .
Those who supervised the leak investigation —
Ann Baskins , Kevin Hunsaker , and Anthony Gentilucci — have resigned from the company .
Bob Wayman , the interim C.E.O. when Kona I began , retired .
On Wednesday , October 4th , Dunn was charged by the California Attorney General with four felony counts : fraudulent wire communications , wrongful use of computer data , identity theft , and conspiracy .
She pleaded not guilty .
Also charged in the criminal case were Hunsaker and DeLia and two private investigators , Matthew DePante and Bryan Wagner ( a.k.a. “ mike@yahoo.com ” ) .
They , too , pleaded not guilty .
Baskins ’s lawyer said last week , “ A general counsel has to be able to rely on her senior counsels ’ research and advice , particularly when she has hundreds of lawyers working for her worldwide . ”
Hunsaker ’s lawyer said , “ There can not be a violation of law without an intent to violate the law , and Kevin absolutely believed that the investigation was being done in a legal and proper way . ”
The S.E.C. is continuing to investigate Hewlett - Packard ’s compliance with disclosure obligations and other issues , as is the F.B.I. and the U.S. Attorney in California ’s Northern District .
On January 12th , one of the private investigators , Bryan Wagner , pleaded guilty to federal charges of identification theft and conspiracy and has been coöperating with federal investigators , a potentially ominous turn for others under investigation .
I had dinner with Dunn in San Francisco the first week in January .
The previous June , she had learned that she had a recurrence of ovarian cancer , and , after surgery , had resumed her chemotherapy treatment .
She was eager to recount her story , and to rebut the many myths that she maintains have arisen about her .
In the contest between her and Perkins — one representing the post - Sarbanes - Oxley world of accountability and governance , the other the action - oriented culture of Silicon Valley — Dunn believes that she has been thoroughly vanquished .
“ I bow to Tom , ” Dunn told me .
“ He is a powerful man .
He ’s far more powerful than I am . ”
Still , all but one of the Hewlett - Packard directors with close ties to Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , including Perkins and Keyworth , are now gone .
The directors who have taken their place — the Nokia and ExxonMobil executives , a banker from Wachovia — are not the Silicon Valley heroes Perkins championed but managers from large public companies , exactly the kind of director sought by Dunn .
Across the Valley , technology companies have been adding seasoned governance experts to their boards .
Keyworth told me that the allegations that he was a “ leaker ” have caused him irreversible harm .
“ I ’ve had some tough criticism in my life , ” he said , “ but I ’ve never been dragged in the mud like this before .
I kept the nation ’s atomic secrets !
I ’m on the board of General Atomics , which makes the Predator aircraft .
I ’m close to top people in the U.S. military .
Now I ’ve been branded a ‘ leaker . ’ ” Though readily acknowledging that he was a source for Kawamoto ’s January 23rd article ( a “ puff piece , ” as he calls it ) , he resents insinuations that he leaked any confidential Hewlett - Packard information .
Perkins feels vindicated by the outcome , and , from all appearances , remains close to Hurd .
In an e-mail to Hurd on September 12th , Perkins wrote , “ When I resigned I did it in anger , but I still believe it was the right thing to do .
. . .
You should know that I always wanted you to be chairman , but this was an awful way to get there . ”
A week later , in a second e-mail , Perkins informed Hurd that a friend , the Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Kleiner Perkins partner John Doerr , had spoken with Bill Lockyer , the Attorney General :
I am continuing to try to take the steam out of the boiler as it pertains to you .
John Doerr had a very good conversation with Bill Lockyer about the situation based upon my assessment ( i.e. , you are one of the victims ) .
It ca n’t hurt .
Perkins told me that he never thought the affair would reach this juncture .
“ In the beginning , all I wanted was to get the facts and get the minutes right .
I never wanted a scorched - earth campaign .
I did n’t expect them to stonewall . ”
Nor did he expect Dunn to be indicted .
“ This was n’t grand larceny , ” he told me .
“ I do n’t think she should go to jail .
She ’s very ill . ”
What started out on Dunn ’s part as a quest for higher ethical standards led to a lawless , out - of - control investigation and possibly a prison term .
She began the investigation at the behest of the board ; even Perkins agreed that the leaks had to be stopped .
She was urged to keep the investigation in - house .
She insisted repeatedly that it be strictly legal and was assured that it met Hewlett - Packard ’s high ethical standards .
She received legal advice from Baskins and Hunsaker on the legality of pretexting that proved disastrous .
She never heard the objections raised by the lower - level investigators and maintains that she does n’t even remember hearing the word “ pretexting . ”
She emphasized Sonsini ’s assertion that , among chairmen of major corporations , not one in ten would have acted any differently .
At the first mention of getting access to directors ’ and reporters ’ personal phone records , she should have tried to stop the investigation .
But the same could be said , even more emphatically , of others connected to the investigation : Hunsaker and Baskins , certainly — both of them lawyers — but also Mark Hurd , who as chief executive was privy to both Kona I and Kona II , attended an early meeting at which phone records were discussed , and was briefed on their progress .
“ Mark got the same legal advice I did , ” Dunn said .
“ He got the same memos .
We were both victims . ”
But Hurd remains chairman of Hewlett - Packard , and Dunn faces four felony counts .
Dunn worries that she wo n’t live long enough to defend herself in court .
“ I care deeply about what people who know me think , ” she said .
“ But , in order to be exonerated , it takes so long .
My legacy may be written before that can happen . ”
Despite the ongoing investigations , Hewlett - Packard is now thriving financially .
Earlier this year , the stock rose above $ 43 , the highest level in six years , and in late January the board disclosed that Hurd had been given an $ 8.6 million cash bonus and options on five hundred thousand shares of stock . ♦
Every once in a while we get an email from a customer asking about how permissions work with our products .
They ’re almost always asking how to prevent someone from doing something .
“ How do we prevent someone from posting a message or adding a to - do or downloading a file ?
How can we make our project site read only except for a select few ? ”
When we set out to build Basecamp we decided that it was going to be about communication , not control .
It is our belief that when you collaborate with trusted parties it ’s important for people to be able to communicate any way they see fit .
Preventing someone from saying or doing something often breaks these free flowing communication channels and introduces miscommunication or silence — two cancers of collaboration .
We do have some permissions in Basecamp .
There are some basic controls over who can do what , but as far as products like Basecamp go , Basecamp would be considered among the least controlling .
If we started all over today we ’d probably have even less permissions and less controls .
Some of the controls we ’ve put in place have turned out to make collaboration harder , not easier .
Back to the customers …
When they ask how to prevent people from doing this or that I usually reply with something like “ Have you tried asking them not to do this or that ?
If you do n’t want them to upload files just ask them not to .
If you do n’t want them to create to - do lists just ask them not to .
Communicate with them as you would if you were n’t using software . ”
And to my delight , their replies are usually “ Great idea !
I had n’t thought of that .
I ’ll try that and see how it works . ”
Follow - up emails usually come back as success stories .
Simply communicating with people about your expectations of their behavior is often the simplest and most effective solution .
It ’s respectful , it ’s kind , it ’s fair .
And if someone does something you did n’t want them to do just remind them politely that they were n’t supposed to do that .
They ’ll almost always get it the second time .
So next time you are looking for more control , consider more communication .
It may surprise you .
Summary : Eyetracking data show that users are easily distracted when watching video on websites , especially when the video shows a talking head and is optimized for broadcast rather than online viewing .
As broadband connectivity has grown , websites have increased their use of video clips .
Unfortunately , many of these videos are produced for television broadcast and are thus unsuitable for the online environment .
In 1997 , I wrote an analysis of TV vs. computers that still holds : broadcast TV is a medium for relaxation , where the " user " sits back and becomes immersed in whatever the program directors decided to air .
In fact , TV users are usually called " viewers , " emphasizing their passive mode of engagement .
In contrast , computer users sit forward and drive their own experience through a continuous set of choices and clicks .
Because of this fundamental difference in user experience , broadcast video feels boring on the Web .
There 's nothing to do , no choices , no user control .
Eyetracking Study of Web Video
We conducted an eyetracking study that records where users look on a wide variety of Web pages .
Although it 's too soon to present detailed results , early data offer striking information about how users behave while watching video clips that are produced for TV and posted on websites .
The following figure shows a " heatmap " of fixations — where the users ' eyes rested — during a video on a news - oriented website .
Red indicates the most - watched areas , while blue indicates the least .
Distribution of eye fixations while a user watched 24 seconds of a video clip on cnn.com .
The figure shows data from a 24 - second segment in which the camera was held steady — that is , the same elements were continuously shown in the same screen locations .
Here 's the full gaze replay video ( in the gaze replay , the moving blue dot indicates where the user is looking ) :
Your browser does not support the video tag .
This video shows where the website visitor looked as this video played .
( In most browsers , hover over the video to display the controls if they 're not already visible . )
This sample segment was excerpted from a video that was four minutes long and contained other camera positions , including a split - screen layout that let viewers simultaneously see the studio anchor and the interviewee in the field .
As expected , heatmaps recorded during such segments varied from those captured in the relatively static segment .
During the split - screen , for example , the heatmap of fixations included large red blobs over both people 's faces .
In our 24 - second segment , the interviewee 's face also attracted much attention .
That 's not surprising : we 've long known that faces are attractors .
Also expected were the eye fixations over the caption , which shows the man 's name and affiliation .
It 's more interesting to notice how much attention was diverted elsewhere in the image , including the road sign behind the interviewee .
There 's even a brief glance at an object over his shoulder that looks like a trash can .
Most interesting of all is the tremendous attention spent outside the video itself on things such as alternative headlines and video controls .
The eyetracking data clearly show that a talking head is boring , even for 24 seconds .
On the Web , 24 seconds is a long time — too long for users to keep their attention on something monotonous .
Video Guidelines
We 've just begun research on the usability of online video and other multimedia elements on websites .
While I 'll surely have many more guidelines later , for now the main guideline for producing website video is to keep it short .
Typically , Web videos should be less than a minute long .
A related guideline is to avoid using video if the content does n't take advantage of the medium 's dynamic nature .
This does n't mean incessant use of pans , zooms , and fades to add artificial movement .
It does mean that it 's better to use video for things that move or otherwise work better on film than they would as a combination of photos and text .
Finally , recognize that Web users are easily distracted , and keep distracting elements out of the frame of your shots .
If there 's a road sign in the video , for example , users will try to read it and will thus miss some of the main content .
Since the Web 's beginning , I 've warned against repurposing .
The initial problem was that companies simply put up advertising brochures as websites .
Later , newspapers and other content sites failed to follow the guidelines for writing for the web and used headlines that were optimized for print .
Now , as technology evolves , we 're seeing the same phenomenon for yet another media type : you can't recycle video and expect to create a good online user experience .
The Web is its own medium .
We seem doomed to learn this lesson again and again .

Other findings from our eyetracking research .
The longer of Mr. Keller 's two prepared statements said the paper initially held the story based on national security considerations and assurances that everyone in government believed the expanded eavesdropping was legal .
But when further reporting showed that legal questions loomed larger than The Times first thought and that a story could be written without certain genuinely sensitive technical details , he said , the paper decided to publish .
( Mr. Keller 's two prepared statements , as well as some thoughtful reader comments , are posted on the Public Editor 's Web Journal . )
Times readers would have benefited if the explanation in the original article had simply been expanded to include the points Mr. Keller made after publication .
And if the length of that proved too clunky for inclusion in the article , the explanation could have been published as a separate article near the main one .
Even the sentence he provided me as to why he would not answer my questions offered some possible insight .
Protection of sources is the most plausible reason I 've been able to identify for The Times 's woeful explanation in the article and for the silence of Mr. Sulzberger and Mr. Keller .
I base this on Mr. Keller 's response to me : " There is really no way to have a full discussion of the back story without talking about when and how we knew what we knew , and we can't do that . "
Taken at face value , Mr. Keller seems to be contending that the sourcing for the eavesdropping article is so intertwined with the decisions about when and what to publish that a full explanation could risk revealing the sources .
I have no trouble accepting the importance of confidential sourcing concerns here .
The reporters ' nearly one dozen confidential sources enabled them to produce a powerful article that I think served the public interest .
With confidential sourcing under attack and the reporters digging in the backyards of both intelligence and politics , The Times needs to guard the sources for the eavesdropping article with extra special care .
Telling readers the time that the reporters got one specific fact , for instance , could turn out to be a dangling thread of information that the White House or the Justice Department could tug at until it leads them to the source .
Indeed , word came Friday that the Justice Department has opened an investigation into the disclosure of classified information about the eavesdropping .
The most obvious and troublesome omission in the explanation was the failure to address whether The Times knew about the eavesdropping operation before the Nov. 2 , 2004 , presidential election .
That point was hard to ignore when the explanation in the article referred rather vaguely to having " delayed publication for a year . "
To me , this language means the article was fully confirmed and ready to publish a year ago -- after perhaps weeks of reporting on the initial tip -- and then was delayed .
Mr. Keller dealt directly with the timing of the initial tip in his later statements .
The eavesdropping information " first became known to Times reporters " a year ago , he said .
These two different descriptions of the article 's status in the general vicinity of Election Day last year leave me puzzled .
“ If economics is about choice , would n’t increased attention to brain chemicals eventually relegate economic decision making to the shadows ?
The answer is an emphatic no . ”
A sk a random sample of economists what dopamine is , or the meaning of Hamilton ’s Rule , and I expect most would n’t know .
Neither would they likely be familiar with sexual selection , haplodiploidy , pleiotropy , or the Trivers - Willard hypothesis .
In some ways , this is a blessing .
By ignoring dopamine , a neurotransmitter linked to the brain chemistry of pleasure , economists have followed a tradition of avoiding the deeper questions connected with human happiness , in order to concentrate on more manageable problems .
This tradition goes back to when the profession wisely chose to steer clear of Jeremy Bentham ’s quixotic quest for the exact measurement of pleasure and pain .
Economists approach the psychology of pleasure with humility , parsimony and circumspection .
There is no scientific way to compare the utility level of different individuals , intones Edwin Mansfield in an italicized passage from his economics textbook .
All textbooks agree ; better to concentrate on easier stuff like income and prices .
Economists do n’t know or care why you like ice cream ; they just want to know what you ’ll do if its price goes up .
By focusing on simpler questions , economists escape getting sucked into the labyrinthine intricacies of the human brain .
Contrast the success of cautious economists with the failures of intrepid Freudian psychologists , who plunged into the dark recesses of the mind and came up with so little that has stood the test of time .
Early economists were smart to ignore nuances of the brain because those nuances were poorly understood .
In Bentham ’s day , the cutting edge of brain science was phrenology — the idea that you could read someone ’s character by feeling the contours of his or her skull .
But today ’s economists , unlike their counterparts just a couple of decades ago , can now access a wealth of information about the physiology of pleasure thanks to advances in neuroscience , evolutionary biology , primatology , ethology , and other fields .
Recent discoveries and technology enable researchers of every stripe to learn more about what goes on inside the once inscrutable black box economists call the utility function .
See “ Freud and the Cocaine Episode ” by Jean Chiriac , for a summary of Freud ’s experiments .
Recall that cocaine was not an illegal drug at the time .
For instance , imagine if Freud were able to conduct his experiments with cocaine using today ’s technology .
He would have been able to observe , through the use of positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanning , the exact parts of his brain that were activated by his cravings .
He might have seen the folly of prescribing the drug as a cure for “ melancholia . ”
We now know that cocaine wreaks havoc with the brain ’s finely tuned reward system by lodging itself in a dopamine transporter , causing a flood of the stuff and producing an unforgettable euphoric rush .
( It is as if a child ’s allowance , once doled out by an exacting parent , were now spilling from a jackpot slot machine . )
But the dopamine splurge is short lived ; the brain soon re-engineers itself to stanch the flood , causing the user to need a lot of cocaine just to feel normal .
Goodbye , euphoria ; hello , addiction .
Sophisticated technology such as PET scans point to the possibility that Bentham ’s hedonimeter — the machine that measures utility — might not be such a crazy idea after all .
Were such a thing ever to be perfected it would likely shake the very core of welfare economics and public policy .
Imagine an addendum to your W2 statement that includes your annual number of “ utils . ”
It ’s just science fiction now , but perhaps someday working hedonimeters will generate new and thorny problems in economic policy and ethics .
There are other developments in the physiology of utility that are just as radical , and they ’re already here .
For the past dozen years , increasing numbers of people have been altering their brain chemistry by raising their serotonin levels with drugs like Prozac .
Serotonin , like dopamine , is a neurotransmitter that has been implicated in the experience of pleasure , especially the kind that comes from having high status in one ’s peer group .
Drugs like these offer people a chance to literally choose their utility functions , a decision which , as far as I know , has not received much analysis by economists .
But it does n’t take leaps of imagination or fancy technology to connect economics and biology .
Insights from plain old high school biology classes — or high school dances for that matter — can contribute fundamental insights into the workings of the utility function .
Consider the possibility that , for biological reasons , the utility functions of men and women might differ because of differences in reproductive capacity .
A typical woman , in her whole life , produces only about 400 viable eggs ; a typical man , in just one day , produces enough sperm to populate a country the size of Japan .
Even though the dictates of evolutionary biology — survive and reproduce — hold with equal force for men and women , their means of achieving these goals differ .
A man can literally “ go forth and multiply , ” but a woman can only go forth and add .
This conflict of interest between the sexes was first remarked upon by Charles Darwin , and later formalized and tested by Angus John Bateman
in his pioneering experiments with fruitflies , first published in 1948 .
Bateman found that male fruitflies that were promiscuous passed on more of their genes than more monogomous males .
But for females , monogomy was the road to increasing the prevalence of their genes in future generations .
Male - female differences in human sexual behavior are usually experienced first hand at the high school dance , or something like it .
The stereotype of eager boys pursuing recalcitrant girls , while not universally true , is nonetheless close to the mark .
Several psychological studies indicate that men usually have a more avid desire for short - term sexual liaisons .
The more avid pursuit of short - term sex by males , or “ Bateman Principal ” is relevant for economics in many ways .
The worst economic calamity to befall a family , and especially women and children , is divorce .
A leading cause of divorce is infidelity .
And the Bateman effect sheds light on the problem of infidelity by addressing its biological roots .
Economists do study things like mating , marriage and family behavior , but what is astonishing , in light of concepts like the Bateman Principle , is that they hardly ever assign any special role to being male versus being female .
Spouses might just as well be persons 1 and 2 .
I suspect that part of social scientists ’ reluctance to face up to obvious sex differences comes from concerns about political correctness .
Sex differences in behavior get more attention from stand up comics .
I expect , though , that these concerns will evaporate , and probably soon , because of the excellent recent work of feminist scholars from several fields — especially anthropology and primatology — which addresses issues related to reproductive biology .
None of them would likely be offended by discussions of the Bateman Principle .
Some , like behavioral ecologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy , have challenged Bateman ’s model using logic and evidence .
But that ’s science , not politics .
The economic implications of sex differences in utility functions extends beyond family behavior .
For example , there is emerging evidence that men invest differently than women .
They tend to be more active traders , take bigger risks , and , in at least one study , earn lower returns .
Biologists trace the male propensity for risk - taking back to reproductive concerns .
Men who multiply succeed in the “ mating sweeps ” by spreading their genes disproportionately , but achieving “ alpha ” status requires taking risks .
But all these brain chemicals and genes … do they paint free will into an ever shrinking corner ?
If economics is about choice , would n’t increased attention to these so - called “ hard - wired ” forces eventually relegate economic decision making to the shadows ?
The answer is an emphatic no .
In the late 1970 ’s Time magazine ’s cover did a disservice to the emerging field of sociobiology by featuring a portrait of a glassy - eyed couple attached to puppet strings , presumably meant to signify genes .
This is not even a caricature , it ’s a gross misrepresentation .
Genes do n’t control us , and you do n’t need fancy biological arguments to see why , just simple arithmetic .
One of the big surprises of the human genome project is how few genes we have — 30,000 instead of the expected 100,000 .
But even 100,000 genes would not be enough to “ control ” our behavior for every contingency .
Hardwired behavior occurs when you yank your hand away from a hot stove before you know it ; most of our actions do n’t happen this way .
In fact , evolutionary biology interprets the capability to make choices in a fast - changing environment as a key adaptation .
The ability to think about new problems and to choose under uncertain and unfamiliar conditions helps us to survive and reproduce .
Genetic determinism is not the only fallacy that bedevils biological inquiry .
Another is the decrepit catchphrase , “ Nature versus nurture . ”
Nature , that is , genetically based capabilities and inclinations , is designed to work in concert with nurture ( that is , environment ) .
A toddler ’s brain automatically lights up to receive new words , but to learn them , she has to hear them first .
So what accounts for her knowledge of words , the capability to store them or the opportunity to hear them ?
I am reminded of the Zen riddle , “ What is the sound of one hand clapping ? ”
It ’s a hard question , and not one I want to spend too much time thinking about .
The “ either - or ” quality of the nature - nurture debate has created a lot of suffering .
Hitler favored nature and thought people could be bred like chickens .
Stalin and Mao favored nurture and thought people could be trained like seals .
Each had a stupid model of human nature .
Understanding human behavior requires more knowledge about the utility function — to understand why we care about the things we care about — along with knowledge about prices , incomes and how we make choices .
In other words , the time is ripe for combining biology and economics .
Big storm at Affordable Suites .
And it 's been confirmed by a local reporter posing as a gay couple .
They turned away an inter-racial gay couple , and told them it 's because they 're gay .
From the local CBS affiliate :
A gay couple looking to rent a hotel room say they were turned away because of their sexuality .
" She was n't discreet about it , " said Jason Pickel , referring to a hotel employee .
" She was not apologetic .
She just said , ' We do not rent to gay people . ' " ....
News19 contacted the hotel , posing as a potential renter , and inquired about two men staying in the same room .
The receptionist who answered the phone told us the following : “ Our policy is we do n’t rent to two people of the same sex if we only have one bed . ”
“ Is that your policy , ” we asked .
“ That ’s corporate policy because they only have one sleeping area . ”
We then asked , “ Okay , but they can't share the bed ? ” " I suppose they could , but most men do n’t want to , " she said .
The owner now says that there is no such policy to discriminate , but his employee was quite emphatic that there is .
This is why we need civil rights laws .
It is legal at the federal level , and in most states , to turn away gay couples from hotels simply because they are gay .
That 's wrong .
That 's why we have civil rights laws .
So is Saudi production about to nosedive Saudi Arabian average oil production per well .
The average well flow rates are drifting down slowly from just above 6000 bpd in 1991 to just below 6000 bpd in 2005 .
No sign of a pending nosedive here !
A couple of weeks ago I made a comment saying that we needed data on producing wells and drilling history in order to further analyse Saudi oil production .
In answer to my wish Kyle posted a comment with this link to the OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin which contains all this information - well almost .
Background
This is the fourth article on Saudi Arabia in this recent series on The Oil Drum .
Stuart Staniford set the ball rolling with his post :
I responded with :
To which Stuart replied with :
There 's nothing like a good controversy to stimulate research .
But where does the truth lie ?
Stuart 's position Oil production peaked in Saudi Arabia in 2005 .
Recent sharp declines in production are involuntary and Saudi Arabia has switched from swing producer to supply constrained producer .
My position Sharp falls in Saudi production since April 2006 are in part voluntary achieved by retiring wells .
I say " in part voluntary " because it seems likely that the Saudis will welcome the chance to rest wells with high water cut or low reservoir pressure .
When called upon to do so , I believe Saudi Arabia will increase future production through bringing wells out of retirement and a rolling program of drilling new wells .
Summary
Cross checking OPEC production and rig count data with International Energy Agency ( IEA ) and Baker Hughes data shows excellent agreement suggesting there is no reason to doubt the reliability of the OPEC data source .
In 2005 , Saudi Arabia had 1923 producing wells that on average produced 5740 barrels oil per day per well .
This is astonishing high well productivity for an area that has been producing oil for over 50 years .
The average well productivity has drifted down from just above 6000 bpd in 1991 to just below 6000 bpd in 2005 ( Figure 1 ) .
There is no sign of a looming productivity crisis in these data and it would appear that increasing production may be achieved quite simply by drilling more wells .
The data provide insight into Saudi Aramco reservoir and resource management in relation to their roll as swing producer .
In the past , production has been reduced by retiring production wells and raised again by bringing wells out of retirement .
All the while , Aramco have a rolling program of drilling new wells thereby increasing the total number of wells that are available for production .
In my post of 7th March I suggested that the most likely explanation for falling Saudi production since April 2006 was voluntary restraint executed through a program of resting wells with high water cut or low pressure .
The data presented here contain no evidence of a pending production crisis and voluntary restraint is still considered to be the most likely explanation for recent falls in Saudi production .
Data
This post looks in detail at the drilling and production record of Saudi Aramco since 1980 .
The OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin provides access to many data tables pertaining to OPEC and global oil and gas production .
Click on the Oil and Gas Data tab to access Tables 36 and 37 which are the source of data presented in this post .
Amongst other things these tables provide information on " The number of producing wells " in Saudi Arabia from 1980 to 2005 and the number of wells drilled each year .
As is often the case , not all the data you may wish to have is provided .
In the drilling statistics , wells by type ( oil , gas , dry and other ) are specified for 1980 to 1991 and for 2002 and 2003 but for the other years only a total number is provided which slightly obscures the oil well drilling history .
Furthermore , the producing wells are not broken out by oil or gas which adds marginal uncertainty to the data presentation .
The production data used in this post is that taken from the 1986 BP statistical review .
These production figures are for crude oil , condensate and natural gas liquids ( C+C+NGL ) .
In the OPEC drilling data , I have combined the number of gas wells and oil wells .
This meshes with the BP data - as a growing amount of liquids production in Saudi Arabia is from NGL that is produced from gas wells .
This adds marginal uncertainty to the data analysis but does not prejudice the validity of the overall conclusions .
One data anomaly , deemed to be a data error , is present in the 1985 producing wells ( table T37 ) where a figure of 731 is recorded .
1985 was the production nadir for Saudi and this figure is highly anomalous compared with the adjacent years .
It has been arbitrarily changed to 371 to bring the data in line .
Data reliablity A number of commentators are sceptical about the accuracy and reliability of information produced by OPEC .
I have therefore conducted a couple of cross checks between the OPEC data with other sources .
In the charts below , the OPEC production data for Saudi Arabia is compared with BP and IEA data and information on Saudi rig counts are cross checked with Baker Hughes international rig count .
Figure 2 Saudi Arabian oil production .
OPEC ( Table T38 ) , BP and IEA sources compared .
The OPEC data is " Crude oil " and shows excellent agreement with the IEA data which is crude + condensate ( C+C ) .
The BP data includes natural gas liquids ( NGL ) which explains why this data tracks well above the C+C .
Note how the contrbution from NGL has grow in importance since 1990 .
Click to enlarge ( applies to all charts ) .
Figure 3
The number of active rigs in Saudi Arabia .
OPEC ( Table T35 ) compared with Baker Hughes ( oil+gas+miscellaneous ) .
The agreement is generally excellent apart from 2005 where the OPEC count is significantly higher than Baker Hughes .
Note how the total rig count has been rising steadily since 1995 , suggesting that the Saudis have been winding up their oil and gas activities steadily for the last decade .
In general terms there is excellent agreement between the OPEC data and other sources and I see no reason to doubt the validity of the drilling and well data provided by OPEC .
Producing wells and production
There is a close correspondence between the numbers of producing wells and oil production ( Figure 4 ) .
But as discussed below , the correlation between these two variables is complex and masks a story of shifting reservoir management strategy , global supply and demand , swing production and geological constraints .
The number of producng wells ( left scale ) and the average daily oil production ( C+C+NGL ; right scale ) .
In broad terms , the number of producing wells was reduced from 1980 to 1985 in order to cut back production and constrain global oil supply at a time production was building in the North Sea , the North Slope ( Alaska ) and other areas .
In this period , new wells were still being drilled and the reduction was achieved by mothballing wells and production capacity .
Following the 1985 production low , wells were brought out of retirement and from 1985 to 1991 , production was built back towards 10 million bpd .
Note how production dips in 1990 and 2002 correspond with dips in the number of producing wells .
These are voluntary reductions in production brought about by retiring wells that may be brought out of retirement to boost future production as needs dictate .
In 2003 there was a surge in global demand and the Saudis helped meet that demand by drilling more oil wells that year ( Figure 5 ) and by retiring fewer wells ( Figure 6 ) resulting in significant jump in the number of producing wells ( Figure 4 ) .
Drilling history
Figure 5 provides some fascinating insight into the workings of Saudi Aramco .
In the period 1980 to 1985 production was cut from 10 to 4 million barrels per day through a program of well retirements discussed above and yet they continued to drill new oil wells at a rate of around 100 per year throughout this period .
It was only in 1986 that drilling activity was cut back ( oil price crash ) and the drilling low point of 1988 is offset by 3 years from the production low point of 1985 .
The number of wells drilled ( left scale ) and the average daily oil production ( C+C+NGL ; right scale ) .
The breakdown of well by type has not been made available from 1992 to 2001 and since 2004 .
Wells in the " other " category will include water injection wells and observation wells .
Dry wells are presumably unsuccessful exploration wells .
The overall level of drilling activity has been rising since 1991 ( GW1 ) and it is a great pity that we do not have the breakdown by well type for most of this period .
By 2002 - 2003 it can be seen that the number of oil wells being drilled each year had approximately doubled from the pre-1985 era and that there has been a substantial increase in the number of gas wells drilled .
The rising number of oil wells drilled combined with more or less flat production in the period 1991 to 2003 is a sure fire sign that the average productivity of new wells is falling .
This is perfectly natural , not surprising and does not signal an immediate crisis .
The average productivity of new wells will most likely continue to fall .
For example the Khurais development has target production of 1.2 million bpd using 300 wells .
This suggests a minimum target well productivity of around 4000 bpd as some of the wells will be water injectors .
Well retirement pattern
What is meant by well retirement ?
Saudi Arabia , as the biggest producer in the OPEC swing production cartel , have a long history of raising and lowering production to suit market needs .
Part of the mechanism used to achieve this control is to shut down production in perfectly good wells .
The other mechanism for lowering production is to choke back producers ( lower production ) .
Production may then be raised at will by re-instating retired wells , opening the chokes on restricted wells and drilling new wells .
Saudi ability to raise production will be dependent upon the inventory of retired wells available to them at any point in time and to the capacity of production facilities .
In his comment here , Kyle suggested that the Saudis may be retiring wells that were producing at 4000 bpd .
This would be unheard off in the OECD and in most other OPEC countries .
In my post of 7th March I suggested that the Saudis may elect to retire wells with high water cuts or low reservoir pressure .
Resting such wells is good reservoir management practice .
It must also be noted , however , that some wells that are retired may eventually be abandoned if their productivity is no longer profitable or if they have become obsolete .
Combining the data shown in Figures 4 and 5 enables an estimate to be made of the number of producing wells that are shut down each year .
number of retired wells = number of wells drilled - YOY change in productive wells
This pattern is shown in Figure 6 and in Figure 7 the cumulative tally of retired wells is stacked on the producing well tally .
Saudi Arabia well retirement pattern .
A positive number equates to the number of wells retired ( mothballed ) in any given year while a negaitve number equates to the number of wells brought out of retirement .
It is not possible to conduct this exercise for the years where the breakdown of wells drilled by type are not given .
In the period 1980 to 1991 the Saudis essentially went through a cycle of retiring wells and then bringing those wells out of retirement ( whilst continuing to drill new wells all the time ) .
The peak cumulative tally was reached in 1985 ( the production nadir ) when the Saudis had mothballed 814 wells !
By 1991 , when all production was required during GW1 the tally of mothballed wells had fallen back to just 40 .
Cumulative wells retired ( Figure 6 ) stacked upon the number of producing wells .
In 1980 , there may have been a significant inventory of retired wells for which we have no data and these are not shown here .
The breakdown of wells by type is not give for most years since 1991 .
It seems likely that a significant inventory of retired wells may have accumulated in this period .
Note that some wells that are shut down may become obsolete .
For example , during redevelopments such as Haradh , old vertical wells may be replaced with horizontal wells and these retired vertical wells will most probably become obsolete .
So what might the current tally of mothballed wells in Saudi Arabia be ?
The paucity of data since 1991 makes this impossible to say .
However , in 2002 a staggering 257 wells were mothballed .
In 2003 , which was the first year of the recent production surge , the Saudis still had capacity to mothball or abandon 18 wells .
The production increase that year was achieved by adding 214 new oil wells and not shutting down a large number of older wells to compensate .
The period 2004 to 2005 I imagine may replicate the pattern of 2003 , where new production was added by simply drilling wells without retiring older wells .
If there was any production shortfall then the Saudis will have had 257 wells rested in 2002 to fall back upon .
2006 saw the commissioning of the Haradh III project , although this only has 32 production wells .
Haradh III was a high profile mega project development but the number of producing wells is not hugely significant compared with the annual drilling program ( unless of course a trilateral is counted as 3 wells ) .
Production history
Saudi Arabian average daily production per year is plotted against the number of producing wells in Figure 8 .
This provides fascinating insight into Saudi reservoir management practice .
From 1981 to 1985 production did nose dive from over 10 to below 4 million bpd through a program of planned well retirement .
Then in 1985 Saudi policy was changed in order to maintain market share , production was raised and the oil price collapsed in 1986 .
Between 1988 and 1989 production was held constant even though the number of producing wells was raised from 590 to 858 .
This would seem to signal a new approach to reservoir management with lowered flow rates and production sustained from a larger number of wells .
The constant trend of 6000 bpd per well was established in 1989 and it would almost seem that this has been a target well productivity for the Saudis since then .
The great knot of data points at around 9 million bpd represents the " plateau years " of production from 1991 to 2002 .
Then in 2003 , with rising global demand and falling production in the North Sea and other areas , the Saudis were called upon to ramp up production which was achieved with relative ease by simply adding more wells through drilling and reducing the well retirement rate .
That $ 2000 bet
The production history of Saudi Arabia with C+C+NGL plotted on the Y axis versus the total number of producing wells on the X axis .
The key features are 1 ) 1980 - 1985 , falling production as a result of voluntary well retirement .
2 ) 1985 to 1988 increasing production brought about by bringing wells out of retirement and drilling new wells .
3 ) 1988 to 1989 flat production with large increase in number of producing wells resulting in a drop in average well productivity .
4 ) The knot of data points at 9 million bpd represents the plateau years of 1991 to 2002 .
5 ) 2003 to 2005 production stretch achieved by increasing the number of producing wells through drilling and reduced retirement rate .
So where does this leave Saudi oil production , peak oil and the end of the world as we know it ?
Regular readers of The OIl Drum may think I have become a cornucopian .
I assure you not at all , I 'm simply looking at data and drawing reasonable conclusions .
Saudi ability to sustain and grow production is dependent upon the availability of new good quality mega projects to develop and the cupboard in this respect is beginning to look rather bare .
Khurais due on by 2009 , some off shore field developments and further development of gas resources ( NGL ) should provide sufficient resources to sustain production , and perhaps modest growth , for a few years at least .
And as Stuart pointed out the Saudis will likely have a huge number of smaller fields to develop , though I very much doubt many of those will be brought on stream by 2008 .
Hubbert linearisation suggests that Saudi Arabia is in the vicinity of 50 % depletion of their ultimate recoverable developed reserves .
Declining Saudi production therefore is probably only a few years away .
In his last post Stuart raised the stakes on his wager to $ 2000 .
So let 's have a reminder what that wager was :
I 'll bet $ 1000 ( now $ 2000 ) with the first person who cares to take me up on it that the international oil agencies will never report sustained Saudi production of crude + condensate of 10.7 million barrels or more .
In BP currency of C+C+NGL that equates to around 12.8 million bpd .
Figure 9 shows the fundamental difference between my position and Stuart 's and also illustrates why I 'm not about to take on Stuart 's bet .
Stuart has called a peak in Saudi production in 2005 and no matter how many wells they now drill , he forecasts that production will continue to slide in a manner similar to that shown .
My position is that recent falls in Saudi production reflect voluntary restraint achieved by retiring wells and that production may rise again in the future , dependent upon global demand picking up .
Detail from Figure 8 showing production history from 1991 to 2005 with conceptual forecasts .
The plum coloured line is Stuart 's more optimistic scenario from his post of 8th March ( green line with ? ) .
I have shown the number of producing wells increasing at a rate of 250 per year ( the last year with data was 2003 where over 250 oil and gas wells were drilled ) and this results in an average well productivity below 3000 bpd by 2009 .
This would be a truly phenomenal collapse from 2005 levels of 5700 bpd .
The red line illustrates conceptually how I see Saudi production evolving .
I cannot place a time line on this as I see Saudi production linked to the global demand supply balance .
The key features however are falling production linked to well retiral followed by resumption of growth but at a lowered gradient reflecting anticipated lower well productivity in future ( 11.5 million barrels per day from 2400 wells equates to 4800 bpd per well ) .
So what difference does this make for global energy markets ?
A look at the oil demand forecast for 2007 from the IEA gives some insight .
The IEA are forecasting demand to rise strongly by around 3 million bpd between the second and fourth quarters .
Saudi Arabia would normally be the main country called upon to meet this increased demand .
If Saudi production falls instead by around 1 million barrels per day , as modelled by Stuart , then a supply crunch and energy crisis will likely unfold .
According to my view , Saudi Arabia , together with other OPEC countries will raise production to meet this demand challenge .
We will see another squeeze on reserved capacity , higher prices and demand destruction , essentially repeating the cycle of 2005 / 2006 .
Every squeeze such as this will bring us one step closer to peak oil which I still see as 2012±3 years .
Pentagon : ' Civil war ' inadequate term for Iraq war Story Highlights •
More attacks October - December 2006 than any three - month period since 2003
• Gates has signed orders to speed up deployment of additional troops
• Senate rejects timetable for troop withdrawal from Iraq
Adjust font size : WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new Pentagon report said some elements of the war in Iraq fit the definition of civil war , but the term " does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict . "
The war in Iraq has been characterized by fighting between the majority Shiite Muslim sect and the minority Sunni Muslims , who were in power under Saddam Hussein 's regime .
But the report also cites Shiite - on - Shiite violence ; al Qaeda and Sunni insurgent attacks on coalition forces ; and " widespread criminally motivated violence " as features that complicate the designation of civil war .
The quarterly report , mandated by Congress , said attacks and casualties documented for the last three months of 2006 are the highest since the war began four years ago .
The document , dated March 2 , was released on Wednesday .
The congressional report cites declassified parts of the recently released National Intelligence Estimate in discussing the question .
It defines " the hardening of ethno - sectarian identities and mobilization , the changing character of the violence , and population displacements , " as characteristic of civil war .
The report says warfare in Iraq has morphed from a " predominantly Sunni- led insurgency against foreign occupation to a struggle for the division of political and economic influence among sectarian groups and organized criminal activity . "
( Read about earlier Pentagon report )
It said the numbers of " attacks on and casualties suffered by coalition forces , the ISF [ Iraqi security forces ] , and Iraqi civilians for the October - December reporting period were the highest for any three - month period since 2003 . "
The report said the attacks were concentrated in Baghdad and in Anbar , Salaheddin , and Diyala provinces , with a record 45 attacks a day in Baghdad .
Compared with Baghdad , levels of attacks elsewhere were low .
" Coalition forces continued to attract the majority of attacks , while the ISF and Iraqi civilians continued to suffer the majority of casualties .
Casualties from these attacks decreased slightly in January , but remained troublingly high . "
The report said data collected includes " violence reported to or observed by coalition forces , " so the report gives only a " partial picture of the violence experienced by Iraqis . "
The report cites U.N. civilian casualty estimates reported by hospitals .
" For the month of December , the U.N. estimated that more than 6,000 civilians were killed or wounded .
This is about twice as many casualties as were recorded by coalition forces . "
More aviation support Defense Secretary Robert Gates has signed orders to speed up the deployment of 3,000 additional troops to Iraq , CNN has learned .
The troops primarily will be responsible for providing airborne support for the 20 brigades of ground combat forces .
The troop increase brings the number of additional forces being deployed to Iraq to more than 31,000 , nearly 10,000 more than the number President Bush initially said would be needed for the " surge . "
The troops will be deployed in May , 45 days earlier than planned .
In the first concrete sign that the higher level of ground forces may last into next year , the Pentagon is considering extending the tour of duty for several more units , according to military officials .
Other developments
The Senate rejected on Thursday a resolution that would have set a timetable for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq .
The resolution , sponsored by Majority Leader Harry Reid , would have directed the Bush administration to begin phased troop withdrawal within 120 days of enactment and would have set a goal of troop withdrawal by March 31 , 2008 , with the exception of certain missions .
The vote was 48 in favor and 50 opposed .
Sixty votes were needed for the resolution to pass .

Two roadside bombs killed four U.S. soldiers Thursday as they were returning from operations in eastern Baghdad , the military said .
The first device detonated near the vehicles , and the second detonated shortly after the initial blast , killing the four soldiers .
Two others were wounded , the military said .
The deaths bring to 3,207 the number of U.S. troops killed since the war in Iraq began .
One of Iraq 's two vice presidents , Adel Abdul Mahdi , visited President Bush at the White House on Thursday .
Mahdi , the target of a recent assassination attempt , thanked Americans for their support of Iraq , and Bush praised his courage and his " vision of peace and reconciliation . "
" We are not finished , but we are doing better than expected " in the Baghdad security crackdown , he said .
U.S. - led coalition forces killed an Iraqi soldier and wounded three others during a Thursday morning raid targeting al Qaeda in Iraq network in Mosul , a U.S. military statement said .
The possible " friendly fire " incident is under investigation .
The military said ground forces and a helicopter came under small arms fire from armed men in two buildings .
After the shooting was over , the armed men were identified as Iraqi soldiers , the statement said .
In other raids Wednesday night and Thursday , coalition forces killed two suspected terrorists and detained 11 others .
An Iraqi appeals court upheld the death sentence of former Saddam Hussein deputy Taha Yassin Ramadan for his role in the 1982 killing of 148 men and boys in Dujail , Iraq , after a failed assassination attempt on Hussein .
Ramadan , who was Hussein 's vice president , will be hanged , according to a member of the nine - judge court panel -- who emphasized the decision was final .
At least five people were killed and 21 wounded when a parked car packed with explosives detonated Thursday morning next to a minibus in Iskandiriya , south of Baghdad , police said .
The vehicle was carrying employees of the state - run National Car Industry Co. Police also said the manager of the company was shot dead this past week , while driving to work .
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Basim Mahdi contributed to this report .

Conservative blogger Hugh Hewitt published the following email he received , apparently from a Disney / ABC insider .
What is particularly astounding is the open derision for President Clinton by this Disney / ABC insider , and equally appalling is Disney / ABC 's seeming desire to have the movie be an intentional slap at Bill Clinton , period .
The Disney execs met all through the weekend - unheard of in this business - debating what changes would be made and what concessions should be given .
Here is what looks to be the conclusion ....
- The message of the Clinton Admin failures remains fully intact ...
But the blame on the Clinton team is in the DNA of the project and could not be eradicated without pulling the entire show ....
.... underline just how far out or touch and scared the Clinton Admin is about the revelation of the facts as portrayed in this project .
Is it just that Clinton is continuing to re-define his legacy ?
Or is it his fears for this election cycle and 2008 ?
Or both ?
Thanks for getting the word out .
It 's made a significant difference in getting this broadcasted as it should be .
Someone at Disney / ABC needs to be fired , and then , come next January , we need some congressional subpoenas issued to Disney / ABC about their blatant attempt to influence the US elections on behalf of the Republicans .
AT MICROSOFT , IT'S known simply as the Bill Review .
At some point in the early stages of any major product or service launch , the richest man in the world would sit in judgment , assessing a team 's progress and deciding whether the project should still get the company 's backing .
Engineers and executives spent days and nights preparing for this session , a grilling that could make or break a career .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

The anxiety was entirely justified .
The CEO ( and later chief software architect ) brought every ounce of his ruthless , superior intellect to the job , and he did n't suffer fools .
Tallying the number of times Gates shook his head and said " fuck " became the standard metric for failure throughout the 1990s .
Joel Spolsky , a former Microsoft developer , recalled making one presentation in which someone counted only four .
" Wow , that 's the lowest I can remember , " Spolsky 's colleague told him .
" Bill is getting mellow in his old age . "
Now the era of the Bill Review is coming to a close .
In June , Gates stepped down from his role as chief software architect ( though he 'll retain the title of chairman ) .
He 'll spend the next two years ratcheting down his work at the company he cofounded 31 years ago , devoting the bulk of his time to philanthropic efforts .
His handpicked successor , Ray Ozzie , does n't like to curse , at least not in meetings .
In fact , Ozzie is in many ways the anti-Gates : courtly , soft - spoken , as approachable as your favorite college prof .
But the two men share something important to the past and future of Microsoft : technological brilliance .
As the inventor and principal executive behind Lotus Notes in the ' 80s and '90s , the 50 - year - old Ozzie is considered one of the best software minds on the planet .
In its day , Lotus Notes was among the most popular applications in corporate America .
In 1997 , Ozzie started Groove Networks , a company – like the one behind Lotus – created to help office workers collaborate electronically .
Microsoft bought Groove in April 2005 for $ 120 million , and Ozzie signed on as a top executive in Redmond .
But the idea of being put on a pedestal makes Ozzie squirm .
For starters , he does n't like to be in front of crowds and used to suffer from crippling stage fright .
More fundamentally , trying to manage from atop a pedestal does n't work , he says .
You lose touch with employees , and that makes it harder to lead an organization and get things done .
And at Microsoft – a company many say is clinging to an outdated business model and beset by more - nimble competitors – there 's a lot of hard work to be done these days .
Just listen to Ozzie describe his management style .
" When I find a hairy bug , " he wrote in a 2003 blog posting , " I love having the developer come in and debug it face - to - face .
It gives me a chance not only to understand more about the product 's internals , but also , you have no idea what I learn chitchatting while waiting for debug files to copy , etc.
Design and implementation issues , stuff that people have been building off to the side , things about the organization , rumors , etc . "
He continued : " I suppose this is just classic ' walking the halls , ' but I feel as though without this kind of direct nonhierarchical contact I would lose touch with my organization , and people throughout would know I was disconnected and would lose respect for me . "
It 's hard to imagine how a guy this self - effacing could survive inside Microsoft 's insular , hierarchical , hypercompetitive culture .
Redmond is notorious for bringing outsiders into the executive ranks and promptly shredding them .
But since joining the company 18 months ago , Ozzie 's star has only gotten brighter .
He was brought on as one of three chief technical officers , and less than two months into his tenure , he was leading a secret strategy session on how to fight competitors like Google .
By November , he was the architect of a new software development strategy for the entire company .
And in June of this year , he reached the mountaintop : Gates announced that he was essentially retiring and named Ozzie as the company 's technology überboss .
" With Gates , everything was always a production , " says one program manager who asked to remain anonymous .
" You 'd go to Building 34 , where he and [ CEO Steve ]
Ballmer have their own separate wings , and then you 'd have to get cleared by a security guard , and then you 'd have to get cleared by two secretaries – all before you made your presentation . "
When Ozzie was interested in learning more about a product , he would go to the program manager 's conference room , and he went prepared with good questions showing that he had done his homework .
And as chief software architect , he shows no signs of changing his approach .
There are , of course , two major reasons for Ozzie 's ascendancy at Microsoft : Gates and Ballmer .
Ozzie is one of the few technologists anywhere whom they respect ; they 'd been trying for years to get him to join the company .
Now he 's carrying their hopes for the future , and it's a heavy load .
Ozzie needs to move Microsoft from selling software in a box to selling lightning - fast , powerful online applications ranging from gaming to spreadsheets .
The risks are enormous .
The mission is to radically alter the way the company sells its most profitable software and to pursue the great unknown of so - called Web services – trading an old cash cow for an as - yet - to - be - determined cash cow .
No , Microsoft does n't think its customers will stop using PCs with hard drives and work entirely online , but the desktop era is drawing to a close , and that promises to force some painful trade - offs .
MICROSOFT HAS BEEN in a funk since 2003 .
Its travails could be the subject of a Harvard Business School case study on the innovator 's dilemma .
The company made – and still makes – billions selling desktop software , mainly Windows and Office .
But the center of gravity has moved , and desktop software is about as cutting - edge as a nightly network newscast .
Instead ,
Web - based apps are taking hold , and devices other than the PC – smartphones , iPods , digicams – represent the growth markets for software .
At the same time , new business models , like search - based advertising and low - cost software subscriptions , are beginning to generate big money .
None of this is news in Redmond .
In a 1995 company - wide memo titled " The Internet Tidal Wave , " Gates famously recognized the network as a disruptive tsunami .
And starting in 2000 , he tried to prepare his troops for yet another big shift , with a series of speeches on Web services .
Even then , Gates was describing a world where desktop applications would eventually work in concert with high - speed apps delivered over the Internet .
Among other benefits , he noted , " you should never have to enter the same information multiple times . "
But despite all the visionary pronouncements , Microsoft has been consistently outmatched on this new battleground .
Apple Computer completely controls the online music business with the iPod .
( In July , Microsoft effectively scrapped its partnerships with hardware makers and has resorted to creating its own music player , named Zune , to try to compete . )
Cell phones , BlackBerrys , and PDAs are now arguably the primary way we check email , yet Microsoft trails in supplying software to those devices .
Microsoft 's game console , the Xbox 360 , has been a hit , but competition from Sony 's PlayStation 2 has kept prices low , making profits elusive .
And when it comes to Internet search – another hugely popular function that does n't run on a PC – Google is widening its lead over Redmond and exploiting new advertising models that generate billions in revenue .
Google is also experimenting with a collection of Web apps , including maps , video , even online word processing and spreadsheets .
Meanwhile , Microsoft has been struggling with the sort of things it historically has done best – producing big , integrated software packages .
Vista , its new operating system , is due out next year , but it 's almost two years late and has no firm release date .
The upshot ?
Microsoft 's stock , which generated better than 50 percent compound annual returns during the '90s , has n't moved at all in nearly five years .
Morale in Redmond , once the envy of corporate America , is the lowest it has been in company history .
Employees complain of IBM - like bureaucracy that stifles creativity and innovation .
And petty financial jealousies are rampant :
Thanks to the stagnant share price , few are getting rich at Microsoft these days .
Half the staff – those who joined the ranks in the early '90s – are worth millions of dollars from stock options .
The other half – hired after 2000 – are worth a fraction of that .
Perhaps worst of all , five years after Microsoft dodged a breakup and other huge antitrust sanctions for being too aggressive , it 's hard to find anyone who is scared of the company anymore .
Remember when competing with Redmond used to be considered a death sentence ?
Now Google taunts it daily .
It has hired about 100 Microsofties , half of whom work at a satellite office a few miles away from Microsoft HQ .
Apple , for its part , has become so confident of consumers ' preference for OS X , its operating system , and software like iPhoto and GarageBand that it now allows users to run Windows on its machines .
Early reports indicate the strategy is working : Sales of Mac laptops are booming and have pushed Apple 's US market share in the category to 12 percent , doubling in just six months .
Despite all this competition , however , Microsoft looks awfully healthy .
General Motors would love to have such problems .
The company has developed a robust server software business since the late ' 90s , and its Windows and Office monopolies still mint $ 1.5 billion a month .
It has almost $ 35 billion in the bank .
But executives at Microsoft are smart enough to be worried .
They 're painfully aware of the story of IBM in the 1970s .
It was the most powerful corporation in the world – so powerful that the government sued it for antitrust violations .
Fifteen years later , it was on its back .
In those days Microsoft was the young superstar – much as Google is today – that helped push Big Blue from its perch .
Redmond does n't want to see history repeat itself .
Ozzie 's plan – laid out in a 5,000 - word memo to executives last fall and in a speech to Wall Street analysts in July – is tough love .
Indeed , it 's a blunter assessment of Microsoft than any executive , including Gates or Ballmer , has probably ever made .
To avoid being marginalized , Ozzie said , Microsoft needs to shift gears fast and concentrate on the software - services world .
That means figuring out how to get new ideas out of the lab and into the marketplace faster , rethinking the way the company makes and sells applications , and spending billions of dollars on infrastructure , like giant server farms , to power all those changes .
To a corporation that has built some of the most bloated , complex software ever to boot up , Ozzie gave this advice : " Complexity kills .
It sucks the life out of developers , it makes products difficult to plan , build , and test , it introduces security challenges , and it causes end - user and administrator frustration . "
Better , he went on , to " explore and embrace techniques to reduce complexity . "
In other words , instead of spending years working on giant , deeply integrated software packages and doing one big , heavily marketed release , Microsoft needs to think more like Google and other next - gen Internet companies – designing and releasing software faster and in smaller interchangeable pieces and then letting online user feedback guide improvements .
The goal is radical and risky : embrace a variety of revenue models , including monthly subscriptions and online advertising , to become more competitive .
But the vision is simple : enable users to have access to their data and applications wherever they are and regardless of what device they 're using – the laptop at work , the PC at home , the cell phone , the television , whatever .
" It should all behave seamlessly , " Ozzie says .
He 's quick to point out that Microsoft will continue to sell software in a box for a long while .
Business customers , in particular , still want a degree of stability and predictability in the software they use , so many may prefer an old - fashioned release cycle .
These users may also wait awhile before they let someone like Microsoft – or any outsider – run their servers .
It would be bad business to get too far out in front of these customers , Ozzie says .
But he sees lots of ways to use the Web to complement Windows and Office that Microsoft has barely tapped .
" Take PowerPoint , for example , " he tells a gaggle of analysts crowding around him at a Microsoft cocktail party in July .
" Would n't it be great if you could hit F5 when you finished preparing a presentation and have your PC automatically upload the file to a Web address ?
Then people listening to your presentation by phone could see you flipping through your slides in real time , too . "
OZZIE'S PLAN will take the company in the right direction .
The question is how much progress it will manage to make .
Microsoft is a giant corporation with 70,000 employees , and Ozzie is basically telling all of them to change how they think about their jobs .
It 's probably one of the hardest things Microsoft has ever attempted .
Imagine being an airline mechanic .
You 're accustomed to waiting for planes to roll into the hangar to be fixed .
One day , someone tells you that from now on , you 're going to have to maintain the planes while they 're in the air .
That 's what Microsoft is facing .
For most of its life , it rolled the Windows and Office planes into the hangar and retooled them .
Now it needs to write software that can be maintained more easily on the fly .
Once you turn on a service , like an online word processor , " it 's on forever , " one former Microsoftie says .
" It does n't ever go off .
So when you add features or want to fix something , you have to do it while it 's running .
It changes your mindset in terms of what 's possible and what 's impossible . "
Another challenge Ozzie faces is persuading the organization to follow him .
He may hold Gates ' title , but everyone at Microsoft understands that he will never hold Gates ' sway .
And without direct responsibility for any of Microsoft 's businesses , he will have to get Robbie Bach , Kevin Johnson , Jeff Raikes , and Craig Mundie – the presidents in charge of Microsoft 's three business units and Microsoft Research – to feel that it's in their economic interest to play ball .
That does n't appear to be a problem right now .
Ozzie 's reputation , the public backing from Gates and Ballmer , and the fact that Ozzie 's proposals do n't yet threaten the bottom line have helped him get a huge amount done in a short time .
At a San Francisco presentation a year ago , he announced the formation of two groups – Windows Live and Office Live – that , along with three - year - old Xbox Live , would lead Microsoft 's latest charge onto the Internet .
These groups have already rolled out almost three dozen products and services .
Sure , a lot of it is stuff we 've seen before on Yahoo or Google , like customized homepages that aggregate all the information you care about – mail , calendar , address book , news .
But there are also snappy little innovations like the recently released Windows Live Writer , which simplifies the still - difficult process of adding anything more than text to a blog .
Office Live , meanwhile , expands on the old idea of allowing users to set up domains and email boxes .
For $ 30 a month , Microsoft adds collaboration tools .
You can work on a project , save it to Microsoft - run servers in a giant data center somewhere , and allow a colleague to work on it at the same time or later .
Tools like this are part of the expensive server software that Microsoft sells to big corporations .
But until now they have n't been available to home and small business users on the PC platform .
And company executives have successfully turned Xbox Live – Microsoft 's $ 70 - a - year online gaming service – from a secondary offering into a must - have part of the Xbox experience .
In the first two years of the service , only about 10 percent of Xbox buyers used the online service .
But in the wake of a major upgrade and the rollout of the Xbox 360 last year , 60 percent of the console 's buyers are now playing online .
Microsoft is on track to sell 10 million Xbox 360 consoles by the time Sony 's PlayStation 3 hits stores in November , Gates says .
Among the most intriguing applications to come out of Ozzie 's tenure , so far , developers say , is one that Ozzie and his team of a half - dozen developers wrote themselves .
Called Live Clipboard , it lets you easily cut and paste elements between online services – a picture from Flickr into Picasa or a contact from your online calendar or some random Web page into Outlook .
Ozzie released the elegantly simple application , which he announced in March , in a very un-Microsoft way – under a Creative Commons license .
In other words , it 's free for developers to use and improve upon , no strings attached .
He called it " a little gift to the Web , " and so far , most of the development community , long suspicious of Microsoft geeks bearing gifts , has believed him .
" When I saw it , I thought , ' Wow , this is a huge innovation , and it 's great to get it out so quickly , ' " says Alex Hopmann , a 10 - year Microsoft developer and manager who left the company 18 months ago for a startup .
" It used to be that someone would come up with an idea like that and it would n't see daylight for two years , until the next product release . "
The true test of progress , of course , will come when Microsoft demonstrates it is actually prepared to gamble with a part of its Office and Windows revenue .
Will we someday be able to use portions of Microsoft Office – say Word , Excel , or PowerPoint – as free , online , ad - supported apps that run inside an Internet browser instead of on our hard drive ?
Will we be able to take a working Excel spreadsheet and paste it into our blog ?
Those things are being discussed ; just do n't count on seeing them tomorrow , Microsoft insiders say .
Another topic under discussion : selling cheap , stripped - down versions of Office to suit various niches .
Microsoft gets loads of abuse from consumers and businesses for selling an expensive , one - size - fits - all product larded with features that most people ignore ( or actively hate – AutoCorrect , anyone ? ) .
So , a few midlevel executives are wondering , why not offer customers the option of a cheap subscription with fewer features , but those tailored to their specific needs ?
The idea is risky for the company , which relies on Office to generate some $ 12 billion a year in revenue .
But that 's the kind of tough love Ozzie is proposing .
To see the depth of transformation Ozzie is talking about , spend a few hours with Gary Flake , one of 10 Microsoft employees to hold the coveted title of technical fellow .
He joined the company last year after a year - and - a - half stint as Yahoo 's head of R&D , and he 's clearly a different kind of Microsoft engineer :
He does n't believe in Windows ' supremacy or in the software - in - a - box concept .
He 's proud to tell you that he 's written more than 100,000 lines of open source code , an affront to Redmond 's traditional businesses .
And he 's quite willing to question Microsoft 's ability to innovate , which would have been considered heresy a few years ago .
" In addition to saying , yes , we do some innovative things , and we do n't get credit for them , I 'd take it a step further , " says Flake , who , as head of the 100 - engineer Live Labs team , is charged with getting Microsoft 's breakthroughs into the marketplace faster .
" I 'd say we do n't always do the innovative things we should do .
We need to improve in that dimension . "
That Flake can get away with talk like this is perhaps one of the biggest signs of change inside Microsoft .
Historically , Gates & Co. have reacted with fury when their bona fides as innovators were questioned .
Now Redmond seems to be facing up to the reality that its innovation machine is broken .
IT WAS LOTUS NOTES that made Ozzie 's reputation – and got the attention of Microsoft chieftains .
" Bill and Steve felt they should have done Notes – that it was their birthright , " a former executive says .
" The fact that Ray did it first earned him their undying respect . "
Indeed , so far Gates , Ballmer , and the rest of Microsoft 's executive team have gone to great lengths to put Ozzie in a position to succeed in his new role .
A year ago they streamlined Microsoft 's corporate structure – compressing seven business units into three – and changed the way top executives in each division are compensated , in hopes of reducing cross-division friction .
Historically , the company was organized to encourage each unit to pursue its own agenda , even at the expense of other divisions .
Now executives must demonstrate a degree of company - wide cooperation to get a top bonus .
In May , Microsoft also changed its review process for rank - and - file employees , who increasingly felt that the system discouraged risk - taking .
It used to be that you were graded on a curve within your group :
For every top performer there had to be a subpar one .
That worked fine when the company was smaller .
But as Microsoft grew , the policy encouraged sloth .
Why chance moving to a group of superstar engineers , people reasoned , if it meant you might go from above average status to below average ?
Now each employee is graded based on individual goals , regardless of how others do .
These goals are reset as often as every other month to encourage engineers to ship lots of little software modules and revise them online rather than spend an entire year on one huge release .
Gates and Ballmer have shown that they will do what it takes to retain valued employees , especially those courted by Google .
Microsoft 's lawsuit against search expert Kai-Fu
Lee last year for violating his noncompete agreement when he jumped to Google may have made Gates seem desperate at the time , but it also sent a message to potential defectors .
When Google recently poached top marketing exec Vic Gundotra from Microsoft , he agreed to honor his contract and not work for a year rather than get sued .
The company has also improved the food in its cafeterias , offered more concierge services like grocery delivery , and , most important , tripled the number of stock options an employee can receive as an annual bonus .
One engineer says that when Google tried to hire away a friend of his in his twenties , Microsoft offered the man $ 250,000 in stock to stay with Redmond .
He still left , but the story is an indication of how hard Microsoft is fighting back .
Top management has also pushed to make pay scales and communications in general more transparent .
In the Office division , for example , compensation is now directly linked to title so employees know roughly where every colleague stands in the ecosystem .
Gates himself is trying to be more open .
This year he made available to the whole company electronic copies of the papers he takes on his annual Think Week vacation .
In the past , what Gates perused during his celebrated week of rumination was a closely held secret .
WILL ANY OF THIS pull Microsoft out of its funk , help it compete better with Google , or return it to a position of dominance ?
There certainly are reasons to believe it 's possible .
Everyone in the world of high tech understands that Microsoft is at its toughest when cornered .
And so the Ray Ozzie Show should be – and is – getting Silicon Valley 's attention .
Google may turn heads when it comes to replacing the desktop as a computing platform , says Tim O'Reilly , Web 2.0 guru and founder of computer book publisher O'Reilly Media .
" But if you look at how Microsoft is positioning Live , it 's clear it understands this new world . "
In addition to rethinking its innovation process and speeding up product cycles , the company is planning to spend $ 2 billion more than usual next year .
It has n't explained why , but most observers believe the money is earmarked to expand its
Web services and build server farms all over the world to support its new online infrastructure .
No other company can bring that much financial muscle to bear so quickly .
And say what you will about incursions by competitors like Apple , Google , and Linux – Microsoft applications still claim more " eyeball time " from more people than any other high tech products in the world .
Even now , after all the buzz about Google 's panoply of software products , if Microsoft can match it feature for feature – say , with a good desktop search and photo management program in Vista – Redmond could , despite years of false starts , start catching up to the search giant .
But the odds are long , and history is against it .
Yes , Microsoft is a unique company , but established corporations with 70,000 employees almost without exception have a hard time learning new tricks .
Microsoft has done better than most , with Windows , then Office , and now its server business .
But it also has been struggling to become more Internet - centric since it launched MSN more than a decade ago .
And with the obvious exception of Internet Explorer , it has had decidedly mixed results .
Ten years ago , the world was convinced that Microsoft would use MSN to control the Internet the same way it controlled the desktop : extracting tolls , blocking competitors , regulating which sites surfers could access .
Back then , the world worried that Microsoft would take command of the entertainment business by using its cash reserves to buy the best programs and music and using its software in our cable set - top boxes to dictate what we watched .
None of those fears came to pass .
Instead , Microsoft has been outmaneuvered by faster , hipper competitors , from Apple and Google to Flickr and YouTube .
Ozzie believes things will be different now , thanks to what 's come to be known as the cheap revolution .
Because broadband , processing power , and storage are so inexpensive and ubiquitous , he says , the high tech landscape is more receptive to the seeds Microsoft is planting than at any other time in history .
He also says the time is ripe because there 's a business model to support a new generation of online applications – advertising – that previously did n't exist .
Every Web - based startup may share these opportunities , he admits , but Microsoft has the wherewithal to capitalize on them on a massive scale .
He 'd better be right .
In 1995 , Bill Gates foresaw the Internet tidal wave and pushed his company to adapt .
At the time , that seemed prophetic .
Today , Ray Ozzie is pushing the same thing , but this time it 's about survival .

net ( znalezione w gwar.pl ) .
Co z tego wyrośnie ?
I czy też będzie gwarno na ich temat ?
Mam nadzieję , że bardziej optymistycznie .
I 'm sick and tired of this patriotic , nationalistic and fascist crap .
I stood through a memorial service today for a young Marine that was killed in Iraq back in April .
During this memorial a number of people spoke about the guy and about his sacrifice for the country .
How do you justify ' sacrificing ' your life for a war which is not only illegal , but is being prosecuted to the extent where the only thing keeping us there is one man 's power , and his ego .
A recent Marine Corps intelligence report that was leaked said that the war in the al - Anbar province is unwinnable .
It said that there was nothing we could do to win the hearts and minds , or the military operations in that area .
So I wonder , why are we still there ?
Democracy is not forced upon people at gunpoint .
It 's the result of forward thinking individuals who take the initiative and risks to give their fellow countrymen a better way of life .
When I joined I took an oath .
In that oath I swore to protect the Constitution of the United States .
I did n't swear to build democracies in countries on the other side of the world under the guise of " national security . "
I did n't join the military to be part of an Orwellian ( " 1984 " ) war machine that is in an obligatory war against whoever the state deems the enemy to be so that the populace can be controlled and riled up in a pro-nationalistic frenzy to support any new and oppressive law that will be the key to destroying the enemy .
Example given – the Patriot Act .
So aptly named , and totally against all that the constitution stands for .
President Bush used the reactionary nature of our society to bring our country together and to infuse into the national psyche a need to give up their little - used rights in the hope to make our nation a little safer .
The same scare tactics he used to win elections .
He drones on and on about how America and the world would be a less safe place if we were n't killing Iraqis , and that we'd have to fight the terrorists at home if we were n't abroad .
In our modern day emotive society this strategy ( or strategery ? ) works , or had worked , up until last month 's elections .
My point in this ; to show that America was never nationalistic .
If anything they were Statalistic ( giving their allegiance to the state of their residence ) .
This is shown in the fact that the founders created states with fully capable and independent governments and not provinces that were just a division of the federal government .
These men believed that America was a place where imperialistic values would be non-existent .
Where the people trying to make their lives better by working hard , thinking , inventing and using the free market would tie up so much of normal life that imperialistic colonization and the fighting of wars thousands of miles away for interests that are not our own would be avoided .
They believed this expansion of power could be left to the European nations , the England , France and Spain of their time .
However this recent , and current influx of nationalistic feeling has created an environment where giving up your rights , going to a foreign country to fight a people who did not ask for us to be there , nor did their leader do anything to warrant us being there , and dying would be considered honorable and heroic .
I do n't believe it anymore .
I do n't believe it 's right for any American to go along with it anymore .
Yes I know that we in the military are bound by the UCMJ and somehow do n't fall under the Constitution ( the very thing we 're suppose to be defending ) but sooner or later there is a decision that every American soldier , marine , airmen and seamen makes to allow themselves to be sent to a war that is against every fiber this country was founded on .
I know that when April rolls around I will be thinking long and hard on that decision .
Even though we in the military are just doing as we 're told we still have the moral and ethical obligation to choose to do as we 're told , or to say , " No , that is n't right . "
I believe that if more troopers like me and the professional military , the officers and commanders , start standing up and saying that they wo n't let themselves or their troops go to this illegal war people will start standing up and realizing what the heck is going on over there .
The sad fact of the matter is that we are not fighting terrorists in Iraq .
We are fighting the Iraqi people who feel like a conquered and occupied people .
Personally I have a hard time believing that if I was an Iraqi that I would n't be doing everything in my power to kill and maim as many Americans as possible .
I know that the vast majority of Americans would not be happy with the Canadian government , or any other foreign government , liberating us from the clutches of George W. Bush , even though a large number of us would like that , and forcing us to accept their system of government .
Would not millions of Americans rise up and fight back ?
Would you not rise up to protect and defend your house and your neighborhood if someone invaded your country ?
But we send thousands of troops to a foreign country to do just that .
How is it moral to fight a people who are just trying to defend their homes and families ?
I think next time I go to Iraq perhaps I should wear a bright red coat and carry a Brown Bess instead of my digitalized utilities and M16 .
Notice I never once used the word homeland in any of this .
I have a secondary point I want to bring up now .
Never once was the term homeland ever used to describe the country of America until Mr. Bush began the department of homeland security after the 9/11 attacks .
Taking a 20th century history class will teach us that the most notable countries in the last century that referred to their country in this way were Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia .
Hitler used the term fatherland to drum up support , nationalistic support , for his growing war machine .
He used the nationalism he created in the minds of the Germans to justify the sacrifice of their livelihood to build the war machine to get back their power from the oppressive restrictions the English and French had put on them at Versailles .
This is the same feeling that has been virulently infecting the American psyche in the last hundred years .
This is the same feeling that consoles a mother after her son is killed in an attempt to prosecute an aggressor 's war 10,000 miles away .
It 's also known as Patriotism these days , but I say , " No more . "
No more nationalistic inanity , no more passing it off as patriotism .
Patriotism is learning , and educating oneself to understand what their country really stands for .
I heard a lot during the memorial service about how the dead Marine did so much good for others and how his helping others was like a little microcosm of America helping because we have the power to do so .
Well if we have the power to help people why are n't we helping in Darfur where hundreds of thousands of people have died in the last 10 years .
Saddam was convicted and sentenced to death for killing 143 Shiites who conspired to assassinate him .
( I know all you " patriotic " Americans would be calling for the heads of anyone who conspired to assassinate supreme leader Bush ) .
And yet we spend upwards of 1 trillion dollars and nearing 3,000 lives to help these Iraqis when they do n't even want us there .
Not to mention we do n't have the legal justification to be there .
I guess we should wait around for the omnipotent W Bush to decide who we should use our superpowerdom to help next .
It 's about time to throw him and the rest of the fascists out .
Moreover it 's about time to start educating Americans about their past and history , and letting them know that imperialistic leaders are not what the founders of this great country wanted .
Philip Martin [ send him mail ] has been a Marine for 2 years .
He is in the infantry ( a " grunt " ) , and spent 7 months in the al - Anbar province of Iraq .
He went on more than 180 combat patrols in and outside of the city of Fallujah , where he was hit with 2 IEDs ( luckily never injured ) and was involved in a number of firefights .
He is currently stationed in Twentynine Palms , CA , and due to return to Iraq for a second deployment in April 2007 .
He is 21 - years - old .
A Swedish pilot was flung out of his aircraft by a malfunctioning pair of hi-tech trousers , it has been revealed .
The incident , which took place last week , was reported in The Local yesterday .
It seems the stick - jockey in question was a Swedish air force officer flying a Saab Gripen fighter .
Fighter pilots typically wear a " G - suit " , also known as " speed jeans " .
This is a pair of special inflatable trousers which are automatically pumped up as G - forces build up in high - energy manoeuvres .
The squeeze on the pilot 's legs prevents all his blood draining into them , which helps in avoiding blackouts or tunnel vision .
In this case , however , it appears that the automated expando - pants tragically malfunctioned , triggering the luckless birdman 's ejection seat and firing him violently out of the jet .
The Gripen subsequently plunged to total destruction in a remote region , but the pilot parachuted to safety .
Swedish forces investigators said it was " very likely " that the deadly trousers were to blame for the incident .
" When subjected to large forces the suit fills with air .
This is thought to have affected the ejector switch , " said Mats Helgesson of the Swedish central command .
There was no suggestion , sadly , of any involvement by sinister artificial intelligence tech , perhaps wishing to rid itself of old - school fleshy control and fly free like its prospective American flying - robot brethren .
This was a purely trouser - based disaster .
The rogue apparel is apparently used in all Gripens of the C and D marks , and as a result these planes are forbidden from exceeding 3G until further notice .
Older A and B model jets do n't use the Wallace - &- Gromit - esque strides , and can still be flown without restriction .

Chef's Quitting Controversy
Monday , March 20 , 2006

Isaac Hayes ' Quitting Controversy | Austin Rocks | ' Sopranos ' Magic
Isaac Hayes ' Quitting Controversy
Isaac Hayes did not quit " South Park . "
My sources say that someone quit it for him .
I can tell you that Hayes is in no position to have quit anything .
Contrary to news reports , the great writer , singer and musician suffered a stroke on Jan. 17 .
At the time it was said that he was hospitalized and suffering from exhaustion .
It ’s also absolutely ridiculous to think that Hayes , who loved playing Chef on " South Park , " would suddenly turn against the show because they were poking fun at Scientology .
Last November , when the “ Trapped in a Closet ” episode of the comedy aired , I saw Hayes and spent time with him in Memphis for the annual Blues Ball .
If he hated the show so much , I doubt he would have performed his trademark hit song from the show , “ Chocolate Salty Balls . ”
He tossed the song into the middle of one of his less salacious hits and got the whole audience in the Memphis Pyramid to sing along .
I can tell you , Hayes was very pleased with himself , was in a great mood and , as always , loved his fans ' coming up to him and asking him about Chef .
As recently as early January , before his stroke , Hayes defended the " South Park " creators in an interview with “ The AV Club , ” the serious side of the satirical newspaper , The Onion .
AV Club :
They did just do an episode that made fun of your religion , Scientology .
Did that bother you ?
Hayes :
Well , I talked to Matt [ Stone ] and Trey [ Parker ] about that .
They did n't let me know until it was done .
I said , ' Guys , you have it all wrong .
We 're not like that .
I know that 's your thing , but get your information correct , because somebody might believe that [ expletive ] , you know ? '
But I understand what they 're doing .
I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses and understand what we do .
[ Laughs . ]
The truth is , Hayes has a sly sense of humor and loves everything about " South Park . "
It ’s provided him a much - needed income stream since losing the royalties to the many hits he ’s written , such as “ Shaft ” and “ Soul Man , ” in the mid-1970s .
Even though he ’s one of America ’s most prolific hit writers , Hayes has been denied access to profits from his own material for almost 30 years .
But it ’s hard to know anything since Hayes , like Katie Holmes , is constantly monitored by a Scientologist representative most of the time .
Luckily , at the Blues Ball he was on his own , partying just with family and friends .
He was very excited about having gotten married and about the impending birth of a new child .
Friends in Memphis tell me that Hayes did not issue any statements on his own about South Park .
They are mystified .
“ Isaac ’s been concentrating on his recuperation for the last two and a half , three months , ” a close friend told me .
Hayes did not suffer paralysis , but the mild stroke may have affected his speech and his memory .
He ’s been having home therapy since it happened .
That certainly begs the question of who issued the statement that Hayes was quitting " South Park " now because it mocked Scientology four months ago .
If it was n’t Hayes , then who would have done such a thing ?
Meantime , Tom Cruise may have gotten Comedy Central to pull its repeat of " South Park " 's Scientology spoof last week , but the result is that episode is all over the Web .
You can see it for free at youtube.com .
Not only that , the Comedy Central Web site has four clips from the 21 - minute show .
And it also says that “ Trapped in the Closet ” will air this Wednesday at 10 p.m .
So whether or not Cruise actually did use influence at Viacom / Paramount to get the show pulled from last week ’s schedule , here it is , bigger and better than ever .
Of course , no one would have cared one way or another if “ Trapped ” simply had aired on schedule .
Of course , no one could blame Cruise , John Travolta or even R&B singer R. Kelly for being upset about the episode .
They are poked fun at mercilessly .
In the episode , Stan , one of the " South Park " characters , is solicited into Scientology .
He gives them $ 240 and takes an EMeter test .
This convinces the higher - ups that Stan is the reincarnation of the group ’s founder , L. Ron Hubbard .
That would be bad enough , would n’t it ?
But Cruise visits Stan in his bedroom and winds up hiding in his closet when Stan tells him he ’s not the greatest actor .
Thus is born the line “ Tom Cruise wo n’t come out of the closet . ”
It ’s repeated dozens of times .
Travolta soon joins Cruise in Stan ’s closet .
He wo n’t come out , either .
And when they do , there is the ecstatic announcement that they ’ve “ come out of the closet . ”
You get the picture .
But nothing in “ Trapped in the Closet ” is any worse than anything " South Park " creators Stone and Parker have done before .
Just rent “ Team America ” and see what I mean .
Austin Rocks : Is the Music Biz Alive ?
From the looks of things this weekend in Austin , Texas , you ’d think rumors of the demise of the record business were just that — rumors .
Despite all - time - low CD sales , empty record stores and monopolistic radio conglomerates strangling the airwaves , rock is still rolling by the looks of things down here .
I came down to Austin for the final weekend of the annual South by Southwest festival — also known as SXSW , a play on Alfred Hitchcock ’s “ North by Northwest . ”
I came for several reasons , not the least of which was constantly hearing from anyone who ’d been here that Austin was the anomalous Texas city , full of culture and fun .
They were , of course , correct .
I will now put Austin on my list of favorite “ fly over ” cities along with Memphis and Chicago .
Texas ’ capital has an amazing aesthetic and nearly defies logic .
There are no Texan stereotypes here , either .
It ’s as if Austin is the Texas town that Europe forgot .
And a fantastic new 33 - story modern skyscraper , the Frost Bank Tower , looms over the “ old ” Western city and gives Austin a welcome futuristic glow of promise .
Very impressive .
On Saturday night , SXSW made the Sixth Street area of downtown alive with dozens of rock bands , singer - songwriters and anyone who could commandeer a bar stage .
In just a few hours , I got to hear some phenomenal music : “ Soul Man ” Sam Moore , New Orleans ’ Alan Toussaint , Lyle Lovett , New York legend Garland Jeffreys , a little bit of Roseanne Cash and The Pretenders .
Say Amen , somebody !
Of course , the weekend began on Friday night at the famous Saxon Bar on the outskirts of the city .
That ’s where I got to hear Austin ’s favorite son , Stephen Bruton , play along with some of his friends .
If you do n’t know him , Bruton has long been a star here , having played with and had his songs recorded by Kris Kristofferson , Bonnie Raitt and many other superstars .
It ’s hard to say why Bruton himself never became a solo star .
His albums are terrific , filled with songs that sound like they should have been hits .
You can read all about him at www.stephenbruton.com.
His brand of folk blues and modern country will never go out of style .
Saturday night was bookended by two blockbuster shows from members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
Moore was the headliner at the first one , at Town Lake .
It featured a surprise appearance by Travis Tritt , who ’d flown in from Atlanta on his private jet just to sing one song with the legendary Moore — “ Riding Thumb , ” a number that will appear on Moore ’s highly anticipated “ Overnight Sensational ” album in June .
All I can tell you is , the overflow outdoor crowd went nuts for this , as they did for Moore and Tritt trading vocals on “ When Something Is Wrong With My Baby . ”
Moore , by the way , is 70 ; Tritt is 43 .
They seemed very much the same age on Saturday night , and perfectly suited to one another .
Moore ’s voice is a revelation and more will be revealed shortly .
" Overnight Sensational , " which I ’ve heard , should be for him what " Private Dancer " was for Tina Turner two decades ago .
The other big show of the night was from my favorite band , The Pretenders .
I can not be objective about Chrissie Hynde .
I love her .
Even though the sound system was absolutely miserable , The Pretenders put on a hot show to promote their new box set on Rhino .
I ’m really grateful to Seymour Stein , whom I ran into on an elevator , for helping me get into this tiny show in the backyard at Stubb ’s ribs joint .
It was a pleasure hearing the couple hundred standing audience members sing along to “ Back on the Chain Gang . ”
And the group did my all - time favorite obscure Pretenders song , “ Cuban Slide . ”
In between Moore and the Pretenders , I jumped over to a honky tonk on Sixth Street called Bourbon Rocks with Chesky Records ’ owner Norm Chesky .
We wanted to see New York ’s Jeffreys , and we made it just in time .
He opened his set with the new song “ I ’m Alive . ” Jeffreys is like a force of nature .
He ’s 62 and looks 35 , with the stamina of a 20 - year - old .
No one works harder on stage , and his songs — new and old — continue to elicit a personal response from his audience .
Considering that " Wild in the Streets , " his seminal song , was released in 1977 , I was amazed that so many young people in the packed , sweaty room knew the words by heart .
And there were countless other bands playing all over the place all weekend .
I ran into New York Times critic Jon Pareles heading in one direction , and none other than Island / Def Jam ’s L.A. Reid going in another .
Sixth Street reminded me of Memphis ’s Beale Street on a hot summer night , jammed with throngs of kids buzzing to hear not only the music of the moment , but the best of the near - past and living legends .
And everyone is eating : Like Memphis , Austin is a hog pit .
People can barely put down their barbeque long enough to say the name of their favorite band .
And everyone has a favorite place for ribs , which they swear are the best , and no two people say the same name .
In lieu of having an angioplasty , I return home instead .
Wicked Memories — ' Sopranos ' Magic
Tonight at BB King ’s in New York : a Wilson “ Wicked ” Pickett memorial celebration featuring Southside Johnny , Jimmy Vivino and many special guests I am precluded from mentioning .
It ’s a great night of Memphis soul honoring the man who sang and wrote “ In the Midnight Hour , " and proceeds from the tickets will go to MusiCares …
David Chase may be paranoid about the press , but otherwise he continues to produce the most outstanding drama or comedy on television .
Last night ’s episode of “ The Sopranos ” was disturbing and poignant , superb in every way .
This is easily shaping up as the best season in the series ’ long run .
Edie Falco is mesmerizing .
James Gandolfini’s “ dream ” scenes showed that he is more than just a Jersey goombah .
How can " The Sopranos " not win the Emmy this time ?
Nothing touches it …
Finally , I am sad to report that my old friend , Wendy Glass , a respected fine art dealer on New York ’s Upper West Side for several decades , has passed away at age 80 .
She will be sorely missed .
Wendy was a close friend of many famous artists whose work she dealt in , including Frank Kleinholz , Rafael Soyer and Chaim Gross .
Wendy came from an over - achieving family .
Her father , Aaron Davis , was a philanthropist whose name is stamped onto a performance hall in Manhattan .
Her late sister , Natalie Spingarn , wrote several best - selling books about living with cancer that changed people ’s lives .
Rest in peace ...
Chinese soothsayers : Year of Pig signals conflicts before new world order RAW STORY
Published : Thursday February 15 , 2007 Print This Email This Sponsored by : The Agenda with Joe Solmonese
The world can expect a roller - coaster ride of conflict and unrest , natural disasters and a plunge in global stock markets once the Year of the Pig begins , Chinese soothsayers say .
As the world farewells the Year of the Dog on Sunday , believers in Chinese superstitions have been busy consulting fortune tellers , feng shui geomancers and a wealth of new books for the year 's fortunes .
Chinese fortunes are based on a belief that events are dictated by the different balances in the elements that make up the earth -- gold , wood , water , fire and earth .
Feng shui expert Raymond
Lo said that according to ancient Chinese belief , the Year of the Pig is symbolised by two elements -- fire sitting on top of water .
" Fire sitting on water is a symbol of conflict and skirmish , and this may bring a relatively less peaceful year with more international conflicts and struggles , " he said .
Lo said the last time such an arrangement appeared was in 2002 , the year that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks .
" It is anticipated that there will be more international conflicts and disharmony , which will even lead to regional warfare , uprising and unrest , or the overthrow of governments in certain countries , " he said .
The elemental arrangement for 2007 , with fire standing on top , could represent openness , optimism and warmth , but it can also bring fire disasters and huge explosions , Lo said .
The Chinese calendar moves in 60 - year cycles , meaning the world will experience in the new year events similar to those that took place in 1947 .
In that turbulent year , the Cold War began in earnest when then US president Truman declared his anti-communist doctrine and the Soviet Union rejected a US plan for atomic weapons control , sparking the nuclear arms race .
That year saw the same elemental arrangement with yin fire dominant in the Year of the Pig .
" So it will not be surprising that there will be more gun battles , murder with guns , bombing attacks in the year 2007 , " Lo added .
--
World faces unrest and disharmony but all ends well --
The lunar calendar is based on the cycles of the moon and associates each of the 12 years forming a partial cycle with an animal .
The pig is the last in the zodiac sequence that begins with the rat , followed by the ox , tiger , rabbit , dragon , snake , horse , goat , monkey , rooster and dog .
Fortune - tellers base their predictions on the relationship between the zodiac animals and the characteristics of each animal year .
They also take into account the changing balance over the years in the five spiritual elements that Chinese philosophy believes form the core of the universe -- gold , wood , water , fire and earth .
Feng shui expert Lee Sing - tong predicts serious conflict in the Middle East this coming year .
" Religious wars will turn intense .
There will be large - scale warfare or explosions , " said Lee , a third - generation feng shui master .
He also expects serious diplomatic conflicts in the East , for instance between China and Japan , and says the problem will be most acute until May 5 .
Fortune teller Alion Yeo , who predicted nuclear testing in North Korea last year , said there is a chance that the power of Pyongyang 's leader , Kim Jong - il , will weaken .
" This will most likely happen between June and July .
I can see their leader is in bad luck during the period .
This means something will be changed : someone might replace him or he might fall ill , " Yeo said .
" There might be a chance that he would leave his position or hand over his duty to someone else , " he added .
The Year of the Pig will largely be a smooth one for the United States , although Yeo predicts an interest rate hike in the third quarter and a big accident between June and July .
" It could be a big fire or an explosion .
It would be something that draws the world 's attention and causes the stock market to fall , " he said , adding however that the market would quickly recover .
Yeo also predicts a strong earthquake , at least 7.0 on the Richter scale , in a Japanese city between March and April .
But the number of wounded would be limited by the earthquake resistance of the country 's architecture .
Although Yeo anticipates global unrest , he expects a mediator will come in to balance the tense situation between conflicting countries .
" I do n't think it will be that bad this year .
Although there will be a lot of unrest and disharmony , problems will be solved in the end , " he said .
Lo agreed .
The pig belongs to the water element and is the birth month of wood .
The pig symbolises the germination of plants and when new life is born .
" The pig year can bring a new beginning of international relationships and social orders , this could bring new regimes with new governments in some countries , " he said .
And Lee predicts the birth of someone of national importance to China .
He said this person will be born on June 30 between 5.00 - 6.59 am Hong Kong time ( 21.00 - 22.59 GMT ) somewhere in the east or south of the country .
" This date of birth is very rare .
It only happens once every 60 years .
It is very difficult to see such a good fate , " he said .
Lee said he did not publish this prediction in his latest feng shui book for fear of inciting mothers to plan their pregnancies to occur at that time .
" I do n't want to ruin the natural order .
I do n't want someone planning their pregnancy artificially .
Heaven might not allow it , " he said .
" But this child would be a prodigy , very intelligent and talented .
This person would have the quality to become China 's leader or a prime minister , " he added .

Chapter Seven : Not The End Of Story
Chapter Eight : No Light At The End Of Tunnel
" US crisis wo n't affect Malaysia 's plan "
Because ....
Finance Minister Najib said the economy 's fundamentals remained strong , with international reserves at a high of RM404.4 billion and non-performing loans ( NPL ) in the banking sector declining since 2003 to a present 2.5 per cent .
In American , just like all the normal human being in the world , when they make any major purchases , they will always ask bank for loan .
However , the sorhai american company always like to retrench people and thus the people there the income not very steady one .
In Malaysia , when your income not steady you will loan money from AhLoong instead of BANK .
But in america , their FBI very power so there is no Ahloong , instead their bank will loan money to all these not steady income people and this type of loan is called Subprime Loan .
About 10 years ago , all the commercial banks in American were promoting their loan with advertisement likeSince most Ang Mor are only " ada gaya " and " hao - lian " type of people , the bankers came out with special packages for these pokkai fellas .
So , Ads like these were flying everywhere :
Wah !
These packages are damn fierce wan !
It basically tell people do n't worry for the about repaying the loan because you may strike lottery before payment is due !
In the event you do n't strike lottery , you can still sell the house that you bought at higher price and pay everything and keep the gain !
Because of packages like this , many American ( especially those who think if Black and become president of USA everything is possible ) started to borrow money and buy house as INVESTMENT !
So , the banks business become very good , the accounts all look damn solid and all the bankers got huge bonus !
But now .... got one problem ... money all loan out but who can guarantee that these sorhais will be able to pay back when time comes ?
After collecting his huge bonus , the CEOs of the commercial banks also need to do more creative works or else they will be fired soon .
So , he went to see the bigger brother - Investment Bank !
For those of you who do n't know , the Investment Bank in US is damn power wan !
Their name also damn solid like Morgan Stanley , Lehman brothers , Goldman Sachs .
The commercial bank CEOs objective is very simple , they want the Investment Bank to share share and join with them to play the game of Subprime Loan !
Even though the Investment Bank name power , their top management are also same like us eat full nothing to do one .
So , they get all those economists , professors , even Nobel prize winners and together go to starbucks drink coffee and blow water .
After many rounds of talking cock , they concluded that these subprime loan is very risky but very exciting and profitable !
Something like bank robbery !
As a greedy bunch of motherfuckers working for greedy Investment Banks , they decided not to miss this great opportunity so , the Investment Banks are in !
Since Investment Banks are so power and big !
They also decided to play it BIG !
So , in order for them to raise all the fund to lend it out to those pokkai house owner , they issued something call CDO ( Collateralized Debt Obligation ) .
In line with the reputation of Investment Banks , the name CDO also power meaning no one understand !
But Lin
Peh tell you la , these CDO is actually something like Investment Banks borrow money from the some sorhais but the loan is guaranteed by those pokkai house owner 's loan and their fucked up " very expensive " house .
So , where to find such sorhai ?
In order to find the sorhais who are willing to put out such big sum of money for this type loan , the Investment Bankers did a lot of road show and even engage professionals to make their powerpoint presentation look solid .
After that , they invited groups and groups of sorhais to come listen to them talk cock , drink wine and see their powerpoint .
When the powerpoint presentation said that the average return on CDO is approximately 12 % , the saliva of the Hedge Fund managers started to drool , so they decided to put their money in and play the game also !
Before you jump into the conclusion that hedge fund are the sorhai , let 's look at how the hedge fund got so much money ....
The basic job function of hedge fund managers are killing each other at wall street without seeing any blood !
They are the one who go around the world , screw peoples currency , stock markets , commodities so the CDO is only a small case la !
The hedge fund managers went around the world and look for low interest loan .
For example , Japan interest rate has been very low since the day Karaoke machinese was invented .
So , the hedge fund went to Japan and borrow at 1.5 % which means , they just have to sign a few signatures , get the money from Japanese and then give to the investment banks and they can sit home masturbate and enjoy a net return of 10 % without doing anything .
With deal like that , the more they borrow , the more their return la !
Do you still call them sorhai ?
So , all the deals are now in place and the cash started to flow !
Strange thing does happen when you have such a huge system running - from the year 2001 to 2006 , the real estate market in US was at a super boom !
Everyone was buying houses and make a lot of money !
So , they were right about becoming a real estate tycoon without having to come out with a single cent !
So , from house owners to banks to investment banks to hedge fund all making money !
Damn solid !
However , the investment bankers were not too happy when they see the hedge fund was making so much money from the CDO without having to do any donkey work .
So , they got jealous and they themselves also invest in CDO !
It is something like Ahloong themselves go borrow from another Ah Loong !
When that happened , the hedge fund managers see that the CDO was in such hot demand , they also became greedy and they pledge the CDO to banks so they can borrow more money to invest in more CDO and everyone just become richer and richer !
When the Investment Bankers see that the CDOs merry - go - round becoming so big round just like the Eye On Malaysia like that , they also got panic already .
So , to play safe , they call the insurance company and tell the insurance company that they want to buy insurance for their CDOs !
Even though the insurance companies are generally greedy motherfuckers , they also not sorhai one .
They study the track record of the CDOs and they charge the Investment Banks a heavy premium for it and give this type of policy an even more power name called Credit Default Swap ( CDS ) !
Since the hosuing market was ok , and everyone was still enjoying huge profit , the Insurance Companies too made very good money from these CDS in the last few years because they just sit there and collect premium without paying out anything !
That 's WIN WIN SITUATION - just like what your teacher taught you in school !
As usual , eveything that can generate income , people on the the wall street will create a unit trust fund for it .
So , over the last few years , Many Unit Trust Fund that invest in CDS were created .
However , in order to generate good sales for these Trust , these unit trusts must get good rating from the rating agency .
So , the people on wall street used their creativity to 100 % and came out with a brand new idea - Assuming the companies already made $ 80 Billion in the CDS over the years , they will allocate a portion of it lets say $ 10 Billion to secured the Unit Trust Fund .
Using the $ 10 Billion as 10 % securities , the Fund will sell to the public $ 100 Billion of the Unit Trust .
That means , if the Fund lost money , the first 10 % ( $ 10 Billion ) of the loses will be covered by the Insurance .
But when it makes money , everything belongs to you !
Good Deal or not ?
Therefore , the rating agency also give the fund AAA ( highest ) rating !
Since the deal is so good and with AAA rating somemore , everyone also bought !
Old man bought !
Young man bought !
Pension fund bought !
Education fund Bought !
It was such good business , the Unit Trust decided to issue more Units to be sold !
However , the problem is they never increase the $ 100 Billion securities !
which also means the " reserve " for the losses has decrease from its original 10 % to god knows what .
Just like Old chinese proverb said " Everything You Ate You Have To Vomit Out " .
The good time came to a stop by end of the year 2006 when the housing prices started to come down , people who bought houses found out there are no more buyers for the houses so they just defaulted on the loan and said FUCK IT !
The Bank try to lelong out those houses but could not find buyer .
Citibank , Bank of America all reported huge loses .
So , the bank all said FUCK IT !
Since Investment Banks has even bigger stake than the commercial banks in these loans , Morgan Stanley , Lehman Brothers all reported even bigger losses .
So , the Investment Banks also said FUCK IT !
When the Hedge Fund saw all the other fellas all fucked , they also cannot escape and Hedge Fund Stake is even bigger !
So , Hedge Fund said FUCK IT !
And of course , all the AAA rating Unit Trusts FUCKED !
Now , Pension Fund FUCKED !
Education Fund FUCKED !
The share market FUCKED !
USA FUCKED !
Europe Fucked !
Japan FUCKED !
Australia FUCKED !
The Whole World FUCKED !
Bush FUCKED ! McCain FUCKED !
Obama FUCKED , But ......

Lettre de George Sand à Alfred de Musset
C'est la lettre adressée à Alfred de Musset .
C'est du grand art !
Si vous la lisez normalement , vous verrez une très belle lettre d'amour .
En revanche , si vous lisez juste une ligne sur deux , vous serez étonné de votre lecture !
Je n'ai pas pu trouver avec certitude si la lettre est authentique ou bien un canulard fabriqué plus récemment .
Il existe d'ailleurs plusieurs variantes qui circulent sur internet ( et des estimations qu'elle a été adressée également à Chopin ou à Franz Liszt ) .
En revanche il est rare de trouver les deux réponses successives et un tel programme de décodage .

La lettre de George Sand
Je suis très émue de vous dire que j'ai bien compris l'autre soir que vous aviez toujours une envie folle de me faire danser .
Je garde le souvenir de votre baiser et je voudrais bien que ce soit là une preuve que je puisse être aimée par vous .
Je suis prête à vous montrer mon affection toute désintéressée et sans cal - cul , et si vous voulez me voir aussi vous dévoiler sans artifice mon âme toute nue , venez me faire une visite .
Nous causerons en amis , franchement .
Je vous prouverai que je suis la femme sincère , capable de vous offrir l'affection la plus profonde comme la plus étroite en amitié , en un mot la meilleure preuve dont vous puissiez rêver , puisque votre âme est libre .
Pensez que la solitude où j'ha- bite est bien longue , bien dure et souvent difficile .
Ainsi en y songeant j'ai l'âme grosse .
Accourrez donc vite et venez me la faire oublier par l'amour où je veux me mettre .
La réponse de de Musset Notez que la clé du dé-chiffrement est indiquée dans la lettre ... ce qui répugne Sand .
Quand je mets à vos pieds un éternel hommage Voulez - vous qu'un instant je change de visage ?
Vous avez capturé les sentiments d'un cœur Que pour vous adorer forma le Créateur .
Je vous chéris , amour , et ma plume en délire Couche sur le papier ce que je n'ose dire .
Avec soin , de mes vers lisez les premiers mots
Vous saurez quel remède apporter à mes maux .
La réponse de Sand
Cette insigne faveur que votre cour réclame
Nuit à ma renommée et répugne mon âme .

George Sand est le pseudonyme d'Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin ( 1er juillet 1804 - 8 juin 1876 ) , plus tard Baronne Dudevant .
C'était un écrivain français , féministe avant l'heure ; elle a écrit des romans , des nouvelles , des contes , des pièces de théâtre , une autobiographie , des critiques littéraires , des textes politiques ...
C'est une artiste qui ne se consacra pas seulement à la littérature mais aussi à la peinture .
Ce fut aussi une femme engagée dans le combat politique et elle participa dans les coulisses au gouvernement provisoire de 1848 .
Sa vie
Elle naît à Paris en 1804 mais passe la plus grande partie de son enfance à Nohant dans l'Indre .
Ce séjour à la campagne la marquera et elle reprendra le thème de la vie à la campagne dans plusieurs de ses ouvrages ( comme dans « La Mare au Diable » ) .
En 1822 , elle épouse le Baron Casimir Dudevant avec lequel elle aura 2 enfants : Maurice ( né en 1823 ) et Solange ( née en 1828 ) .
Très vite elle quitte son mari et connaît alors une vie amoureuse plutôt agitée .
En 1831 paraît son premier roman « Rose et Blanche » qu'elle a écrit en collaboration avec Jules Sandeau , son amant , de qui elle s'inspire pour son pseudonyme Sand .
En 1833 et 1834 , elle connaît une liaison mouvementée avec Alfred de Musset dont elle tirera « Elle et Lui » .
Elle le quitte pour le Docteur Pagello .
Plus tard , elle connaît Franz Liszt et surtout Frédéric Chopin avec qui elle vivra près de 10 ans ( 1838 - 1847 ) .
À Majorque , on peut visiter aujourd ' hui la chartreuse de Valldemossa où elle passa l'hiver 1838 - 39 avec Frédéric Chopin et ses enfants .
En 1841 elle fonde avec Pierre Leroux la Revue Indépendante .
George Sand se lie à des démocrates comme Arago , Barbès ou encore Bakounine et se réjouit en 1848 de la chute du roi Louis - Philippe et de la fin de la Monarchie de Juillet affichant son engagement politique social et communiste .
Après les journées de juin , elle se retire en 1851 à Nohant , contrainte d'écrire pour le théâtre à cause d'embarras financiers .
Mais elle ne se cantonne pas à Nohant , voyageant aussi bien en France ( fréquents séjours à Paris ) qu'à l'étranger .
Elle continue à mener une vie hors normes et agitée .
Elle a d'autres liaisons amoureuses , se bat pour la défense des droits des femmes et pour ses idées politiques , se lie d'amitié notamment avec Flaubert et Théophile Gautier , fréquente les frères Jules et Edmond Goncourt .
Elle n'arrête pas d'écrire jusqu'à sa mort en 1876 , à l'âge de 72 ans , à Nohant .
Victor Hugo déclara le 8 juin 1876 : «
Je pleure une morte , je salue une immortelle ! ».

Interview recorded Feb. 27 , 2007 .
Listen to the interview .
Although we ’ve talked about this issue , your article in The New Yorker , “ The Redirection , ” a couple of times , Mr. Hersh , would you give us a thumbnail sketch of your story ?
Hersh : Yeah , basically , it ’s a story saying that we ’ve changed our policy in a very dramatic way in the last few months .
It ’s awfully hard to know when and where .
We are involved in a war now in Iraq , and it is not going well .
So the president has decided we are going to expand this .
What we want to do is  our target now is Iran .
We want to isolate Iran .
We want to run operations against Iran .
We ’ve been doing that for a year , and we also want to escalate against Iran ’s buddies in Syria and Lebanon .
So we are now The United States has joined forces with the Brits , Israelis , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Jordan  the moderate Sunni Arab countries  in a coalition designed to beat back the Shia .
They are a minority , but a very powerful minority .
As you know , Iran is Shia .
Right now in Lebanon , the Sunni government , controlled by a man named Prime Minister Siniora , is under much pressure from a coalition headed by Hezbollah  which is Shia .
It ’s got Christians on it too , but the coalition wants a bigger share of the pie in Lebanon  more power .
So , there is a standoff there .
The U.S. is throwing in  all the way  with those who want to stop the Shia anywhere in the Middle East .
That is a huge escalation because , among other things , the growing contradiction of the policy is that we have made the Shia in Iraq our allies .
It is not quite clear how strong that relationship is anymore , but that ’s
So you ’ve got It ’s sort of like the yellow submarine , you know ?
They disappear .
The policy is so complicated , so contradictory and so ad hoc , you just wonder what these guys are thinking of .
Goyette : I ’ve described it on my show  Bush and these people  as the sorcerer ’s apprentice .
They ’ve unleashed these forces that they cannot contain  they cannot foresee .
But is n’t anyone in the administration overcome with shame in not foreseeing the obvious : that the de-Ba’athification and the invasion of Iraq would have contributed substantially to the a Shia power block ?
I mean , that seems like it would have been foreseeable back in 2002 .
Hersh :
You know , you ’ve got to understand how obdurate these neocons are .
When the war began , by June of 2003
You know , I ’m tuned in .
I ’ve been writing critically about this .
I ’ve written no other story since 9 - 11 , only this one insane crummy subject  it ’s driving me nuts .
But within two or three months [ of the beginning of the war in 2003 ] , my buddies on the inside were saying , “ We are beginning to hear the insurgency ditty bopping . ”
We could hear them communicating with each other .
We could n’t break the code , but we picked up messages .
It was Iranian signals gear .
It was pretty sensitive stuff .
The Iranians were passing along communications gear [ to Iraqis ] .
By the way  why should n’t they ?
I mean , that ’s not a sin .
Why should n’t they [ Iran ] help their ally and weaken us ?
That ’s the way the world is .
In any case , the neocons refused to listen to the idea that the Shi’ites in the south  whom they were pushing , because they wanted to de -Ba’athify : get rid of the army and anything in connection with Saddam , which is really stupid .
They [ neocons ] would say to the military and the intelligence service , “ Do n’t worry about it .
Do n’t forget that there was an eight year war in the eighties between Iraq and Iran  very bloody by the way  where twenty thousand people would die on any given day .
There were horrible battles .
The Shia in Iran and the Shia in Iraq hate each other . ”
That was the theory : there is no way the Iraqi Shia are going to support Iran after that war .
This is what the neocons said .
It did n’t matter how many times the [ intelligence ] community would report and say , “ we ’ve got real problems here .
We notice five thousand Iranian intelligence officers . ”
You know , you saw the presence of the Quds brigade and others in every major city in the south of Iraq .
One thing about the Iranians : they are not very subtle .
They wear usually black suits , white shirts , no ties , buttoned up all the way , black shoes and white socks .
You can see them .
They make no attempt to hide themselves .
Actually , at one point in 2004 they were actually renting big apartment buildings in Basra and other places where they put up their people .
They were n’t just doing military stuff .
They were doing a lot of humanitarian work too .
You know  helping out an ally , because the more they can get the war going against us , the stronger their position gets .
Goyette :
It was even more than that , because we effectively announced to the world that once we are finished in Iraq , then Iran and Syria are next .
We made it in their [ Iran ’s ] interest to keep us bogged down .
Hersh :
That is why I do n’t understand why the public is n’t more cynical .
Every time Bush says , “ Iran is helping Iraq .
Syria is helping and supplying arms  the same for Hezbollah . ”
If you remember the halcyon days  the first couple of weeks when everyone thought it was going to be [ okay ] .
The statue [ of Saddam ] fell and everybody thought democracy would spill like water all over the middle east out of Iraq .
Cheney and others would say , “ we are doing Iran next and then Syria and then Lebanon . ”
I mean , they basically laid down a trump card and then wondered why people there objected [ laughter ] and tried to resist us as much as possible .
It is beyond belief just in sheer terms of competence , you know ?
Just in sheer terms of competence  it is amazing .
Goyette :
Well , explain to me this Sunni tilt , and how that plays into the hands of al - Qaeda or al - Qaeda - like interests .
Hersh :
What happened is You know , I did n’t know [ about ] this [ Sunni tilt ] .
I went in December I went twice to Beirut .
I ’ve been there a lot over the years , because the Middle East is obviously important since this war .
So I went to Beirut .
I had an interview and was the first Westerner , I guess , to see Nasrallah [ after the Israeli bombing of Lebanon ] .
I had seen him before .
I had always talked to Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , the head of Hezbollah  a very bright guy .
Yes , Nasrallah was one of the leading cutting edges of terrorism in the 1980’s .
Yes , but in the last ten years he has been operating politically .
The toggle switch from terrorism to politics has gone that way , and you know what ?
Let ’s keep them [ Hezbollah ] in politics .
They had members of parliament in Lebanon .
They had four or five cabinet ministers that they pulled out because of the recent fight .
But they were very involved politically and socially  [ with ] schools and hospitals in southern Lebanon .
So I went to see Nasrallah a bunch of times  usually about Iraq .
He was a Shi’ite leader very friendly with the Iranians and also very friendly with the Shi’ite leadership in Iran .
They all trained together .
They all were the same religious group .
They went to the same basic schools .
I would sort of get a feel on what ’s going on .
This time I went to see him about Lebanon .
If you remember last summer , he had conducted something that had never happened before .
He had done a war against Israel  put up against Israel and beat them .
The only Arab country to ever do it .
Nobody is more important right now .
This is n’t just me talking .
This is our intelligence people in the government saying to me , “ the most important man in the Middle East right now is Nasrallah ”
In places like Egypt  I was just in Cairo  he is more popular than anybody in the Egyptian government .
This a Shia .
In almost totally Sunni Egypt  in what they call the “ Arab street , ” it ’s Nasrallah  he ’s the boss .
Anyway , so I go to see the guy [ Nasrallah ] in December and oh man Look , I know the Israelis have him under a death threat .
They ’ve had him under a death threat for years , particularly after he won the war  or did well in the war .
So I am in three or four cars .
I am searched .
I mean , [ it ’s ] black , with all of the shades and the curtains drawn in the car .
I am transferred three or four times in basements  all bombed out .
I finally get to the guy and say , “ What is going on , man ?
I did n’t know you were that scared of the Israelis ? ”
He says , “ Oh no , it is not the Israelis .
We ’ve got fellow Arabs : Jordanian intelligence , Salafis , Wahhabis  jihadists .
These are the most extreme guys . ”
Salafis and Wahhabis are out of Saudi Arabia .
They are Sunni radicals , who are connected to al - Qaeda in the sense that they believe anybody who is not a Sunni is an infidel  an infidel and disposable .
Then you discover that there are 3 , count them , 3 units , one large and the others smaller  three terrorists linked to al - Qaeda units in Lebanon that have all been formed in the last six to eight months .
And we , the United States of America , are looking the other way as money flows in from us and from Saudi Arabia under the table to get these guys [ al - Qaeda terrorists ] arms , clothing , and material goods so that they
Why do we support the Sunnis ?
Why support the same guys 
I mean the Salafis , [ Wahhabis etc. ]  that we would have arrested two or three years ago and put in Guantanamo ?
Now we are supporting them because they are potential allies against Nasrallah and Hezbollah .
They [ Sunnis ] are tough .
Hezbollah ’s tough .
Hezbollah knows how to do terrorism .
These guys do too .
[ It ’s ] in case we end up in a civil war there .
We want to have allies .
That is the height of cynicism .
First of all , why do we want them you know what ’s going on in Iraq between the Sunni and the Shi’ites is crazy .
And where are the Christians in Iraq ?
There used to be two million  now they are gone .
Goyette : Right .
Hersh :
And they are gone .
I mean , it ’s a civil war , and it is a sectarian war .
Now he ’s trying 
This president , with this policy , is going to push Lebanon into sectarian war too .
There is already trouble between Sunni and Shia .
It ’s just really
Goyette :
It strikes me as Orwellian  it ’s like Winston rewriting history and shoving stuff down the memory hole .
You would think that the American people would at least have the short term memory to remember that these [ Sunni jihadists ] were supposed to be the bad guys .
Hersh :
Well , I mean look , they [ Americans ] are just learning about this .
The story has only been out a couple of days .
The major newspapers have n’t given it a whiff yet because they probably do n’t know how to do it .
Goyette :
They do n’t understand what it means
Hersh : Uh , yeah , you know , I worked for the New York Times for nine years .
I always have a mixed feeling about them .
It is the most important newspaper in America .
It still is .
When they report a story , it has enormous influence .
They just have n’t figured out this presidency .
I think that just maybe they do n’t know how .
I mean , it is sort of amazing to me they have n’t figured out this presidency .
Goyette : Well , back to Nasrallah , is there a new Israeli - Lebanese war brewing right now ?
Hersh : Sure .
I would say , we have replaced the Israelis in this situation .
I do n’t think there is going to be an open conflict .
I think what you are seeing right now is tremendous pressure being placed on Nasrallah to neutralize them by us , in supporting the government there .
What Nasrallah wants is a bigger piece of the pie .
Under the crazy rules in Lebanon , the way they have divided the country up politically is a hoot .
They fixed the percentage everybody can have in the parliament .
The Shia  this was done in 1943  were fixed then at twenty percent .
Well , the Shia are a hell of a lot more than twenty percent , and they may even be more than fifty percent .
What Nasrallah basically wants is to change these numbers .
He wants a bigger piece of the pie , and he ’s got a coalition that includes a very prominent Christian in a man named Michel Aoun , who got 74 percent of the Christian vote in the last election .
So Nasrallah is not alone in this .
They want to redo the electoral procedure .
That is the critical issue .
Our American position is , that there will be no compromise in Lebanon .
They are not going to get anything .
If it means war , so what ?
Goyette : Now back to your New Yorker article , “ The Redirection : A Strategic Shift . ”
A lot of us at talk radio shook our heads in utter amazement at these shrink wrapped , washing machine sized palates of cash that came into that country in billions .
We thought that it was all just disappearing in your typical average graft  showing up in gym bags and people stuffing money in duffel bags .
But in truth , there may have been substantial slush funds as you suggest in your article , created for black ops .
Hersh : Yes , and here is where it gets complicated .
There is always pools of money around for black ops .
There always are [ for ] side pockets .
We all know from the hearing the other week with Congressman Waxman that something like almost nine billion dollars was not accounted for .
There was some very funny conversations with Mr. Bremer of the coalition provisional office testifying that , “ Oh , he just did n’t know .
He did n’t keep track . ” [ Laughs ]
Goyette : [ Bremer said , ] “ I had to do it .
I had to get people paid .
They would n’t take their own currency ”
Hersh :
There were also other pools of money .
Saddam had anywhere from  you count it  half a billion to more than that , that we found in just raiding his bunkers .
There also was , I am told , as much as a billion dollars more in cash found the various ministries when we took over the government .
So you had three large pools of money .
I am here to tell you that nobody could prove it , because that ’s the thing about money .
It ’s not accountable .
That is one reason that being opaque is very important for the [ intelligence ] community .
You can do anything you want [ with cash ] .
But I have been told very reliably that this money  some of it anyway  was being used by covert operations .
I do n’t have a video tape of it .
I just have people I trust .
In the New Yorker we decided to be very careful about it , which is totally appropriate .
We were very careful .
We said , “ It is not clear . ”
There are people who believe that this money showed up directly in covert ops even against Iran , Syria , and Lebanon .
We do know that major covert programs have been run in those three countries by us without Congressional funding .
Where is the money coming from ?
Goyette :
This is a handy way to bypass the Congressional authorization process , which brings us back to the Iran - Contra precedent .
It ’s the same thing but worse .
Iran -Contra looks like a little PR disaster  a little PR black eye  compared to starting another national war .
Hersh : Iran-Contra During the Reagan years  for those who do n’t know 
Reagan really wanted to do something to stop what he considered to be the left wing revolutionary government in Nicaragua , the Sandinista government .
Reagan wanted to use a guerrilla force called the Contras that the CIA had setup with financing .
Congress issued a series of legislative amendments saying , “ No way .
You can not use Congressional money to for this . ”
Goyette : The Boland Amendment .
Hersh : The Boland Amendment .
You got it exactly right .
They [ Reagan administration ] just created this incredible scheme  this Rube Goldberg scheme .
They would sell arms .
They would get Saudi money to buy arms and ship them through Israel into Iran , which is the same country that had held us hostage five or six years earlier  300 guys hostages for a year .
Out of that [ Iranian arms deals ] they generated enough profit to support the Contras .
There were hearings on it that went no where , because  I do n’t know why  the press was n’t We let them off the hook .
By 1987 Reagan was clearly losing it .
So it did n’t go anywhere .
But the precedent was there .
The graph I ’m proudest of , and the story I did , described this without much sourcing
One of the key players in that operation then was a guy named Elliott Abrams , who was in the National Security Council .
Abrams is now the special assistant to the president for Middle East affairs on the National Security Council  a very senior deputy in the government .
He convened a lessons - learned - session sometime less than two years ago [ by ] pulling everybody who was still in the Bush administration that was involved in Iran Contra .
They discussed what was good and what was bad .
The good was that you could do stuff and cheat Congress .
The bad is you got caught .
So the lessons learned are : you do n’t tell anybody anything .
You do n’t trust the CIA .
You do n’t trust the military .
You do n’t run it out of the National Security Council .
At that point in 1984 or 85 , an Admiral named John Poindexter was the guy that they used [ to head things up ] .
Now they said , “ This time you use the man himself , the Veep  the vice - president . ”
Cheney .
I think even then they were thinking and obviously talking about it [ finding money for covert CIA operations ] .
Now you have this in fruition .
You have Prince Bandar  the former Saudi Ambassador to Washington , who is very tight with Cheney  and other neoconservatives funneling money that we use to run operations without telling Congress .
This is not only in Lebanon , but against Bashar al - Assad , the president of Syria , and also in Iran .
I mean , it is really out there .
Goyette :
It ’s really bad .
Now , one other thing that I want to make sure we cover is the Negroponte resignation .
I never thought that he was exactly Mr. Clean to begin with .
I mean , going all the way back to Central America .
Hersh :
Well , I guess he was under pressure to do what he did .
Goyette : Right
Hersh :
All I can tell you is that there has been a lot of tension between him [ and Cheney ] , when he was head of intelligence , the job he quit to become deputy secretary of state .
If you remember , he gave up a cabinet level job to take a sub - cabinet level job , which is interesting .
So [ in ] the job he quit as head of intelligence there was a lot of tension between him and Cheney .
I understand ( and the Pentagon ) he was not approving of many of the operations they wanted to do .
He thought they were high risk and also not legal .
He was seen as a stickler  whether for moral grounds or legal grounds , I do n’t know .
He was seen as a pain .
That is one element .
He was also seen by them as somebody , who was n’t very good at what he did .
That ’s another element .
But the critical issue , I was told by no less than three pretty well informed people , was that he had had it .
He had gone through Iran - Contra : there were hearings , and he almost got in trouble on that .
He did n’t want to do it again .
He was very much against this policy of using Saudi money for covert arms  action rather .
So he protested and eventually quit because of it .
Look I did n’t talk to him .
He did n’t talk to me .
The New Yorker had a series of queries .
He did not deny .
He just simply said he had no comment  for all that that means
Goyette : I have heard now from sources one degree of separation , or maybe occasionally two , from the CIA that one of the sources of the conflict was Cheney .
He [ Negroponte ] did n’t want to participate in cooking the books on the national intelligence estimate on Iran .
Hersh :
That is also very possible , because these guys
You know It is not so much I wish it was so simple as cooking the books .
I think the tragedy of Cheney is that he believes what he believes .
Goyette : Oh , yeah .
I do n’t doubt that .
Hersh :
He just thinks the CIA is wrong .
[ Laughs ]
He does n’t think he ’s forcing them to tell a lie , he thinks he is forcing them to tell the truth .
[ Laughs ]
Goyette :
Well , you suggest the intelligence professionals are watching this thing in a state of stunned and shaken silence  of horror .
Hersh :
Well , it ’s been going on for years .
The silent horror is pretty silent  but it sure is horror .
Goyette : Yeah .
Hersh :
And the same with the Joint Chiefs : they are watching this planning for Iran , the bombing , going on , and they do n’t know what to think .
Goyette : Would you handicap it ?
Do you think we will be able to either find a pretext for a war or have a bombing campaign ?
Hersh :
The only thing I can tell you is I ’ve been writing this story for a year .
It is serious .
People would accuse me of being chicken little  you know , the sky is falling , sky is falling .
Now it is clear that there is something to it .
I just do n’t know what Bush is going to do , but I do n’t think he is going to leave office without dealing with Iran .
Goyette : Well , he has said as much .
How about the Congress though ?
We thought back in November maybe a new Congress would act as a check or a brake on him .
Hersh :
This is the real story .
Will they get up and issue a Boland Amendment ?
That ’s the real story .
Goyette : All right .
Seymour Hersh , you ’ve been very generous with your time .
We thank you so much .
Hersh : Good day .
Why is it that the English continue to get it all so wrong in New York ?
There is something particularly , peculiarly irritating about the Brits over here .
This is a city that 's wide open to strangers , lumpy with a homogeneity of schemers and immigrants , yet the Brits manage to remain aloof and apart , the grit in the Vaseline .
Those with the voices like broken crockery , the book - at - bedtime accent , have a lot to answer for .
The Brits believe that they have a birth - given sincerity and that it's not what you say but how you say it that matters .
And that all silly , gullible Yanks , from policemen to society hostesses , will wave us ahead on life 's road when we open our euphonious mouth .
In fact , most Americans can't tell the difference between Billy Connolly and Russell Crowe , and why on earth should they ?
If you really , really want to disjoint an Englishman — ruin his day — then just ask him which bit of Australia he 's from .
And then there is the air of patronage , combined with an odor of neediness and a thick - skinned , unembarrassable meanness .
" Oh God , have you eaten with the Brits here ? " a friend asked me .
" They 'll book a table for six , and then nine of them turn up .
Ask for the check and they 'll all have to go to the bathroom or smoke a cigarette or make a phone call , and there 'll be one guy left at the table .
That 'll be the D.A.S. — the Designated American Sucker , who through sheer naked embarrassment will pick up the tab , and suddenly they 'll all be back at the table , thanking him with their impeccable manners .
This will be the only time they 've actually spoken to him , because for the rest of the meal they 'll be talking about people who they were at school with , who all have the names of small dogs .
If there 's no D.A.S. , they 'll hold an auction over who had the steak and two beers .
I 'm not kidding .
You know what gets me ?
It 's not like they 're poor .
Not really poor , like lots of immigrants .
They just think we 're lucky to have them .
They walk into a room and imagine it just got classier . "
The British in New York are not good mixers .
We hunker together , forming bitchy old boys ' and girls ' clubs where we complain about and giggle over Americans like nannies talking about difficult , stupid children .
An English girl , newly arrived , has been picked up by the expat coven and asked for tea .
And rather nonplussed , she says , " It 's sad and sort of weird .
This is the way our grandparents used to behave in Africa and India . "
New York 's grand British club , the social embassy , is Soho House .
Go up to the bar on any Thursday night and see the serried , slouched , braying , bitten - nailed ranks of them , all in need of a toothbrush , a cotton bud , and a dermatologist .
Nursing beers and a well - thumbed ragged project .
They 're all here not making a film , not writing a book , not selling a sitcom .
Do n't tell me about your latest script .
You 're not a film writer .
You 're a handyman .
You 've never made so much as a wedding video .
You do a bit of decorating , some plumbing , and you house - sit plants .
There 's no shame in it .
It 's what immigrants do .
In the Red Lion , a bar on Bleecker Street , half a dozen televisions pump out the Rugby match between England and Scotland .
It 's 9:30 in the morning and the place is packed with geezers and a few chubby - cheeked , ruddy rugger - bugger girls .
They 're a particularly big - boned , docile , good - natured type , who look like members of some alternative royal - family - pedigree breeding farm .
The blokes are necking pints of Guinness and projectile bellowing .
It 's uncannily like being back in London .
The only difference is that half of them are England fans , and half Scotland .
If anyone walked into a Scottish bar back home wearing an English accent during this match , they 'd leave wearing their nose as an earring .
And it strikes me that there 's something unreal about this .
It looks right and smells right .
It even sounds right .
But it 's not right .
They 're all playing extras in their own me - in - New - York movie .
They 're putting on the Britishness as a show .
They 're going through the motions only because they 're here .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A controversial plan to build the first large U.S. offshore wind - power farm won approval from Massachusetts authorities on Friday but still must clear federal regulatory hurdles .

A controversial plan to build the first large U.S. offshore wind - power farm won approval from Massachusetts authorities on Friday but still must clear federal regulatory hurdles .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
Cape Wind Associates LLC , a privately funded Boston - based energy company , has proposed constructing 130 wind turbines over 24 square miles in Nantucket Sound , within view of the wealthy Cape Cod resort region of Massachusetts .
The project , which would meet the energy needs of some 400,000 homes , “ adequately and properly complies ” with the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act , said the state environmental affairs secretary , Ian Bowles .
The wind farm would consistently generate 170 megawatts of electricity , enough to power about 75 percent of Cape Cod and the nearby islands of Martha ’s Vineyard and Nantucket .
At its peak , the wind farm could generate more than 400 megawatts .
Its supporters , including Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , say the project would save millions of dollars in energy costs and help the United States reduce its reliance on foreign oil at a time of high crude prices .
“ We have work to do as we build a clean energy economy -- let ’s get on with it , ” said Patrick , a Democrat .
Opponents -- including some Massachusetts politicians and business leaders with homes on Cape Cod , Martha ’s Vineyard and Nantucket -- say Cape Wind ’s 247 - foot - tall ( 75 - metre - tall ) turbines would kill migrating birds and could threaten the region ’s lucrative tourist industry .
The lead federal agency needed to approve the project is the Minerals Management Service , a bureau in the U.S. Department of the Interior that manages the nation ’s natural gas , oil and other mineral resources on the outer continental shelf .
Cape Wind expects a decision from MMS in early 2008 .
An early indication of the federal agency ’s position on Cape Wind could come at the end of next month when it is expected to release a draft environmental impact report .
COULD BE RUNNING BY 2010
“ We ’re hopeful that we will complete the permitting process by the end of this year , and hopefully receive a final decision by the first quarter of 2008 , ” Cape Wind President Jim Gordon told a news conference .
“ We could be producing clean renewable energy in the 2010 time frame . ”
The United States trails Europe in developing offshore wind - power energy production .
Denmark accounts for more than half of the world production , followed by Britain .
If built today , Cape Wind would be the world ’s largest offshore wind - power farm .
The turbines , six miles off the Cape Cod coast , would each rise nearly as high as the Statue of Liberty in New York and be placed to take advantage of the region ’s strong winds , shallow depth and historically small storm waves .
The project is opposed by former Massachusetts Republican Gov. Mitt Romney , Democratic Sen.
Edward Kennedy and many residents who own coastal property from where the turbines could seen on a clear day .
Kennedy , whose brother former President John F. Kennedy created the Cape Cod National Seashore in 1961 , has said he believes Cape Wind would threaten a wildlife sanctuary and has criticized the lack of a competitive bidding process before the project was announced in 2001 .
The RTSJ approaches the solution to the problem of writing real - time code from a different direction than other available software development platforms such as a typical RTOS ( real - time operating system ) application programming interface ( API ) .
RTSJ embraces the notion of real - time scheduling theory as a fundamental principle for the development of programs which have temporal correctness requirements and as an environment which enhances the ability of developers to write more portable real - time code .
The RTSJ proposes a new system model for the development and deployment of applications which have temporal correctness requirements .
Understanding this system model is the first step toward understanding the scheduling framework in the RTSJ , hence , we 'll first spend some time on it before delving further .
The second fundamental construct we need to understand is that the RTSJ abstracts the unit of schedulability above that with which we are most all familiar , i.e. , the thread .
In the RTSJ things that are scheduled are instances of the Java interface , Schedulable .
The RTSJ abstracts the unit of schedulability in this way to allow the application to imbue these schedulable objects with values that characterize their expected behavior and determined requirements with respect to time .
But more importantly this abstraction allows more than just threads to come under the control of the scheduler , e.g. , event handlers in the RTSJ no longer just execute whenever , they execute under the control of the scheduler .
Thus in the RTSJ event handlers are a schedulable entity rather than , as in a typical RTOS , an unschedulable entity .
Once an application creates its initial set of instances of Schedulable with the appropriate characteristics the application may put those into what we call the ' feasibility ' set .
The feasibility set is an abstract set which simply holds the set of things which the scheduler manages .
The set also embodies a feasibility algorithm , such as rate monotonic assignment ( RMA ) or the deadline monotonic algorithm ( DMA ) .
Given the values of the characteristics given to the instances of Schedulable ( from here on let 's shorten this to the informal , Schedulable or Schedulables ) in the set the feasibility algorithm can determine if all of the Schedulables will meet their given deadlines .
There are , of course , a lot of details about how the feasibility algorithm actually can do such a thing and we 'll cover some of those later .
In the late 1990's it became apparent to a number of us in the field that the problem of software development for real - time and embedded systems had gone beyond the simple and looked to be on a path of exponentially increasing complexity , arising from increases in both size and required features .
Clearly , the state - of - the - art in software development for these systems needed a productivity / abstraction boost .
At this time the Java programming language and runtime crossed the threshold from an interesting experiment to the defacto development platform for desktop and enterprise applications .
The Java environment offered significant productivity increases for development of large , complex , and network - oriented software artifacts over other language choices .
Thus , a growing number of people began to consider the Java language as a possible choice for large and complex software development projects whose requirements included either embedded hardware target platforms and / or timeliness .
Unfortunately , some fundamental features of the Java language precluded the predictable execution of application logic .
Some historical backround
In 1998 a number of us began to build momentum for a formal way in which the Java language could be extended to support such applications .
The Java Community Process ( JCP ) was created by Sun Microsystems and Java Specification Request 01 was started in early 1999 .
The JSR - 01 expert group identified and followed a number of fundamental principles2 .
We need not cover all here except to note that JSR - 01 requires compatibility with the existing Java Language Specification ( JLS ) as defined by the JCP .
The expert group always followed the path of tightening existing semantics in the JLS as opposed to requiring new semantics not currently supported by the JLS .
The RTSJ redefined seven areas of the JLS :
1 ) Threads , Dispatching , and Scheduling
2 ) Memory Management / Garbage Collection
3 ) Synchronization and Resource Sharing
4 ) Asynchronous Event Handling
5 ) Asynchronous Transfer of Control
6 ) Asynchronous Thread Termination
7 ) Physical Memory Access
Of the seven only a portion of the first , scheduling , is the primary focus of this article .
To fully understand the scheduling subsystem though we 'll also look briefly at the RTSJ system model and thread contexts .
Below we quote directly from RTSJ 1.0.1 ( b ) the requirements of the scheduling subsystem of the RTSJ :
1 ) Allow the definition of schedulable objects .
2 ) Manage the assignment of execution eligibility to schedulable objects .
3 ) Perform feasibility analysis for a set of schedulable objects .
4 ) Control the admission of new schedulable objects to the feasibility set .
5 ) Manage the execution of instances of the AsyncEventHandler and RealtimeThread classes .
6 ) Assign release characteristics to schedulable objects .
7 ) Assign execution eligibility values to schedulable objects .
8 ) Manage the execution of groups of schedulable objects that collectively exhibit additional release characteristics .
System Model , Memory Model , and Threads
Arising out of the RTSJ guiding principles and observations of trends in development of software artifacts for embedded and real - time systems is the RTSJ System Model .
( The terms soft and hard real - time are used in their formal sense .
First , consider logic which has a temporal correctness condition , e.g. , a deadline .
When referring to logic which has a hard real - time requirement we will mean that the requirement is that the logic must never complete after the given deadline but if it does the system is considered to be in an abnormal mode .
When referring to logic which has a soft real - time requirement we will mean that the logic is allowed to complete after the given deadline in explicitly defined ways . )
This model supports the execution of non- , soft - , and hard real - time logic within the same application , on the same Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) , and on the same computing machine .
These three execution contexts are supported by three different thread types :
java.lang.Thread( JLT ) : Used for backward compatibility and all logic which does not require timeliness .
Pre-existing Java applications will execute unmodified on an RT - JVM in this context .
javax.realtime.RealtimeThread( RTT ) : Used for logic which has soft real - time requirements or logic which has maximum latency requirements which are larger than the maximum interference of the garbage collector ( GC ) .
For RTSJ implementations which include a real - time garbage collector ( RTGC ) logic within this context uses the RTGC for automatic memory management , i.e. , reclamation of invisible objects .
Logic executing in this context must follow the assignment rules ( see memory model later ) .
javax.realtime.NoHeapRealtimeThread( NHRT ) : Used for logic which has hard real - time requirements .
Logic executed in this context must also follow the assignment rules and in addition is not allowed to manipulate ( including even read ) a reference to an object which had been allocated on the regular Java heap .
The RTSJ introduces , to Java applications , the notion of allocating objects in areas of memory other than the regular Java heap ( Heap from now on ) .
Two new memory areas are defined , Immortal Memory ( IM ) , and Scoped Memory ( SM ) .
The lifetime , when objects are considered live or dead , of objects allocated in these memory areas is managed by mechanisms different that that used for the Heap .
[ The lifetime of an object , obliquely , refers to the mechanism by which the assertion : " the application logic will never use a particular object again " can be made .
E.g. , the lifetime of an object controlled by a manual memory management mechanism is from the point in time the application creates it until the application logic forcibly terminates it , e.g. , with a call to a deallocation function such as free ( ) . ]
Typical garbage collected language runtimes , such as regular Java , use visibility ( the existence of a reference ) to determine when an object can no longer be referenced by application logic .
If no reference to an object exists in application logic then the application can no longer ' see ' that object and the GC can collect it . )
Objects allocated in IM never die .
They can be referenced by all logic at any time without concern .
Objects allocated in an SM area live until no thread is executing in the static / dynamic programmatic scope into which the SM had been assigned .
Of course , this last statement requires a bit more explanation .
The RTSJ also introduces the idea of a current memory area ( CMA ) .
All executing logic , at any particular point in time , has associated with it a memory area , one of : the Heap , the Immortal Memory Area , or a Scoped Memory Area .
An object created as the result of the execution of new is allocated in the CMA at the time new is executed .
When an application starts the CMA is the Heap , as it is for any regular Java program .
Application logic may change its CMA in various ways , all of which require more detail then we can get into in this class .
For now we 'll just give a couple of ground rules for using these different memory areas .
NHRTs must at all times have as their CMA either the IM area or an SM area .
RTTs may have all three types of memory areas as their CMA , whereas JLTs may have only the Heap or the IM as their CMA .
Schedulable , Scheduler , and Parameter Objects
The Java language includes a concept known as an interface .
An interface is a classlike definition but includes only method signatures .
Class definitions are allowed to Implement an interface .
A Class definition which implements an interfaces must include all of the method signatures in the interface with a complete code body for each .
The fundamental unit of schedulability in the RTSJ is an instance of the interface Schedulable .
All RTSJ implementations will include four class definitions which implement Schedulable : RTT , NHRT , AsyncEventHandler ( AEH ) , and BoundAsyncEventHandler ( BAEH ) .
All instances of the interface Schedulable are visible to and managed by the scheduler .
The scheduler itself is represented by the abstract class , Scheduler .
Application logic interacts with the scheduler via methods on one of the concrete subclasses of Scheduler , e.g. , Priority Scheduler .
The priority scheduler is required in all implementations , however , particular applications may include additional schedulers .
When the application code creates instances of Schedulable , via the constructors of one of the four Schedulables given above , the schedulable can be given a set of characteristics which both define and mandate certain behavior .
Release characteristics , embodied in an instance of the class ReleaseParameters , indicate to the runtime system whether the Schedulable is released periodically , sporadically , or aperiodically .
( Classic real - time scheduling theory defines three patterns of releases for tasks .
A release is considered a point in time at which the said task becomes available for dispatch to the processor .
Let t i be the time of the i-th release of task T .
T is periodic if t i+1 -t i =C 0 , i=1 ...+,C 0 >0
T is sporadic if t i+1 -t i is more than or equal to C 1 , i=1 ...+,C 1 >0
T is aperiodic if t i+1 -t i more than or equal to 0 ...+
Instances of ReleaseParameters also include the cost per release , start time , handlers for missed deadlines or cost overruns .
The cost values is used by both the cost enforcement algorithms and feasibility tests , both explained in subsequent sections .
( Cost is the time taken for one release of a task to execute to completion on a uniprocessor . )
Instances of ReleaseParameters also include the cost per release , start time , handlers for missed deadlines or cost overruns .
The cost values is used by both the cost enforcement algorithms and feasibility tests , both explained in subsequent sections , later .
Traditional priority is the dispatch time metric used by the required priority scheduler .
This scheduler as well as any other scheduling algorithms may define a subclass of Scheduling Parameters to communicate to the scheduler any values associated with the scheduler necessary for the scheduling algorithm to do its job .
The RTSJ defines Priority Parameters for the required priority scheduler which simply holds the priority of the Schedulable .
Cost Enforcement
Although optional in RTSJ implementations , cost enforcement is probably the single most important feature for portability and analysis in the scheduling subsystem .
As mentioned above , cost , is a value given to the system via a ReleaseParameters object and is an estimate of how much processor time will be used by the Schedulable per release .
( When we were designing the RTSJ we did n't want to require features that would be very difficult to implement in typical real - time operating systems because that would reduce the likelihood that these vendors would commit to RTSJ implementations ( all standards efforts are , after all , compromises ) .
Cost enforcement is such a feature .
It is difficult to implement .
However , we at Sun feel that no RTSJ implementation is complete without it . )
Cost enforcement , when available , turns this informative exchange into a contract between the application and the system .
The system will allow the Schedulable no more than cost time units of processor time per release .
If the Schedulable attempts to use more than cost time units per a release then the system will de-schedule the Schedulable and not reschedule it until the start of the next release time ( for periodics this is the start of the next period ) .
Without cost enforcement the validity of any installed feasibility test depends completely on the cooperation and correct behavior of application logic .
If , by chance , underestimation , or whatever , application logic exceeds its given cost in any release the consequences can be dramatic and far reaching .
Essentially , any other time - critical piece logic in the system could miss its deadline through no action of its own .
Looking at this another way , cost overruns cause non-local effects , something all software developers fear , and in our case these non-local effects can easily cause system failure .
We use system failure here to mean that a piece of application logic which has hard real - time requirements , i.e. , it must meet every deadline , fails to complete its work before its deadline .
Without cost enforcement the system is at the mercy of the application and the system can do nothing to prevent the failure .
However , if cost is enforced or honored then the system , through a feasibility test , can determine if all tasks will meet their deadlines .
The feasibility test is a component of the scheduler .
Feasibility
Feasibility ( schedulability is a synonymous term ) is how the real - time community describes a sequence of releases of a set of tasks that ensures that all releases of all tasks meet their deadlines .
To further understand this concept we 'll first need to define , precisely , the scheduling problem .
First , let 's define our system model .
Consider a set of tasks , T i each represented by the tuple , ( C i , I i , D i ) where C i is the cost per release , I i is the interval between releases , and D i is the deadline for task T i .
Each task also has a set of release times , call them , R tk which represents the kth release of task T i .
The scheduling problem is finding a sequence of R jk such that R +1 ki - R ik I i and the completion time of the release started at R ik completes before R ik +
D i and uses no more than C i time units of the processor .
In a system where i=1 this is pretty simple .
It 's easy to see that if C i I i and D i : I i i and R i+1 k - R ik I i , i=1 .
..+ the system is feasible , i.e. , all releases of the task will meet their deadlines .
However , as we start to look at systems with more than one task determining feasibility becomes more difficult .
In the general case solving this problem is NP - Hard ; no know algorithm can find the optimal solution in polynomial time .
But , fortunately , there are some restrictions and assumptions about the system that can be made which allow a closed form computation to determine feasibility .
The most widely known feasibility test is named the rate monotonic priority assignment algorithm ( RMA ) .
There are many others , such as the deadline monotonic algorithm and earliest deadline first .
We 'll look at only RMA , and how an RMA scheduler would be implemented in the RTSJ , in this class .
i
i
i
i
i
j
j
j+1
i1 , ... ,
T ik , ... , T in where the period of T ik is less than or equal to the period of T ik +1 .
Now assign priority P k to task T ik .
This assignment pattern is the assignment of decreasing priorities to tasks as their periods monotonically increase , hence the name .
It has been proven that if ,
then all releases of all tasks will complete before the end of the period ( deadline ) in which they are released .
We 've shown only a simple system model .
Please see the Liu and Layland paper at the end of this article for the full model with all restrictions and the proof .
This formula is actually straightforward to understand , but , a couple of examples may help .
Lets first consider a set of three tasks with costs and periods of :
We see that this simple task set is not feasible because 0.80.78 is false .
Let 's just change one of the periods a bit and see what happens .
If the new set of costs and periods is :
And , the right hand side is still 0.78 , then the task set is now feasible because 0.630.78 is true .
If priorities are assigned to these three tasks such that the tasks had execution eligibility in the following order
T 3 >T 1 >T 1 then , because the feasibility formula computation returned true , we would be sure that all releases of all three tasks would always complete before the start of the next period ( deadline ) .
Another interesting observation is that in the definition of the tasks above we did not indicate the units ( milliseconds , microseconds , etc. ) for the cost and period values .
It does n't matter as long as all are in the same units .
This leads us to the realization that feasibility is independent from the magnitude of the costs and periods of the tasks in the system
The cost and periods could have represented days and , still , the first example would still not be feasible .
The RTSJ accommodates the notion of feasibility analysis through its abstract concept of the feasibility set .
Here 's the general idea .
During the initialization phase of an application instances of Schedulable , RTTs , NHRTs , AHEs , and BAEHs are created .
During their creation they are given the appropriate release and scheduling characteristics .
In turn each is , abstractly , added to the feasibility set .
The method used to add them to the set will , typically , execute the feasibility ( e.g. , RMA ) formula on all of the Schedulables in the set plus the new one being added .
The result of the computation is then returned to the application as a boolean ( true or false ) .
If the return value is true then the application can be certain that all of the releases of all of the Schedulables will meet their deadlines .
Additionally , note , that the application need not know anything about the underlying idiosyncrasies of the particular RT - JVM or the underlying OS .
The separation of concerns is a fundamental goal of the RTSJ .
We believe that it is the province of the RTSJ implementers to understand such idiosyncrasies and incorporate them into the computation of feasibility .
Sporadic and Aperiodic Schedulables
We 'll briefly discuss how the RTSJ accommodates Schedulables which have a release pattern that is either sporadic or aperiodic .
Recall that a sporadic release pattern means the the interval between release is given as a minimum , i.e. , two subsequent releases will never occur closer than I time units .
These are handled just as periodics with the minimum interarrival time used as the period .
There is some over - provisioning because , by definition , the sporadic Schedulables will not all be released as often as their given minimum interarrival times , but , in case they are , there will be processor cycles available to ensure that they also all meet their deadlines .
Aperiodic Schedulables are much more problematic .
Recall that the aperiodic release pattern means that two , or infinitely more , releases can occur with 0 time units between each release .
Of course in practice this is impossible , but , the theory has to take care of this boundary case .
In theory a single aperiodic requires infinite computing power .
Obviously something has to be done .
We typically define a periodic task9 whose job is to execute all aperiodic tasks that arrive before its release time .
( In the literature this task has been given the unfortunate name of , sporadic server .
I say unfortunate because it can be a point of confusion for people new to real - time scheduling theory discussions .
It simply means that the task serves aperiodic tasks by executing them during its own execution for each release of itself .
And , since it may not need to execute once every period ( because no aperiodic task needs to be executed ) it is properly classified as a sporadic release pattern . )
The RTSJ supports this theoretical notion through instances of ProcessingGroupParameters ( PGP ) .
These are parameter objects that have the same fields as a periodic parameters object but have a different meaning .
This meaning is :
All aperiodic Schedulables with a reference to a single instance of PGP constitute a processing group .
Also , PGPs can be added to the feasibility set as a Schedulable themselves .
The PGP has a cost and a period and is handled by the feasibility analysis just like a periodic task .
Releases of these aperiodic Schedulables will be executed in each period of the PGP up to cost time units .
PGPs therefore collect aperiodic Schedulables and execute them periodically in a way that can be understood by the feasibility analysis .
Conclusion
We 've seen how the RTSJ first abstracts the unit of schedulability into a Java interface names Schedulable .
All instances of Schedulable ( such as RTTs , NHRTs , AEHs , and BAEHs ) may participate in the feasibility analysis .
Schedulables are created and given a set of characteristics which define and mandate their execution behavior with respect to time .
By relying on the RTSJ feasibility analysis an application can obtain some measure of portability among different hardware , OS , and RT - JVM platforms .
However , the estimation of the cost value remains a difficult issue , not only for RTSJ application but for all real - time applications .
The scheduling subsystem of the RTSJ greatly insulates the application and application developer from the idiosyncrasies of the underlying RT - JVM , OS , and hardware .
Applications need only create instances of Schedulable , give them appropriate characteristics , add them to the feasibility set , and react to the result of the feasibility analysis .

Subject First desktop motherboard supported by LinuxBIOS : GIGABYTE M57SLI - S4 Hi ,
The GIGABYTE M57SLI - S4 [ 1 ] is the first - ever desktop motherboard
supported by a Free & Open Source BIOS , thanks to AMD engineer Yinghai
Lu who released GPL - licensed code last month .
This state - of - the - art
motherboard is based on the NVIDIA nForce 570 SLI chipset and AMD's
latest Socket AM2 .
It contains tons of advanced features such as :
Support for AMD Athlon 64 X2 , Athlon 64 FX and Athlon 64 processors
2X PCI Express x16 slots
3X PCI Express x1 slots
2X PCI slots
3X 1394a ( FireWire ) ports
10X USB 2.0
16GB maximum memory
SATA RAID
6X SATA 3Gb/s slots .
This motherboard can be obtained today from many retail and online
stores [ 2 ] and the source code for the BIOS can be downloaded from the
LinuxBIOS SVN server [ 3 ] .
This is a huge victory in the quest for a completely Free & Open
Source general - purpose computer that enables users to have full
control over their own hardware .
The Free Software Foundation has made
the campaign for a Free BIOS a top priority because it is a key
component in the software stack of personal computers [ 4 ] .
The need
for a Free BIOS is even more pressing since DRM and Treacherous
Computing have found their way into some proprietary BIOSes and EFI .
From a practical perspective , LinuxBIOS removes the need for ugly
hacks and workarounds in the kernel that compensate for buggy BIOSes 
we can now fix the BIOS ourselves .
I encourage everyone upgrading their desktop computers to consider
getting this motherboard or another one that is supported by
LinuxBIOS .

The the current edition of Stanford Magazine , contains an excellent article ( excerpted below ) by Marina Krakovsky summarizing Carol Dweck ’s research , which is the topic of Dweck ’s fascinating recent book , Mind - Set .
* * *
Through more than three decades of systematic research , she has been figuring out answers to why some people achieve their potential while equally talented others do n’t — why some become Muhammad Ali and others Mike Tyson .
The key , she found , is n’t ability ; it ’s whether you look at ability as something inherent that needs to be demonstrated or as something that can be developed .
What ’s more , Dweck has shown that people can learn to adopt the latter belief and make dramatic strides in performance .
. . .
* * *
As a graduate student at Yale , Dweck started off studying animal motivation .
In the late 1960s , a hot topic in animal research was “ learned helplessness ” : lab animals sometimes did n’t do what they were capable of because they ’d given up from repeat failures .
Dweck wondered how humans coped with that .
“ I asked , ‘ What makes a really capable child give up in the face of failure , where other children may be motivated by the failure ? ’ ” she recalls .
At the time , the suggested cure for learned helplessness was a long string of successes .
Dweck posited that the difference between the helpless response and its opposite — the determination to master new things and surmount challenges — lay in people ’s beliefs about why they had failed .
People who attributed their failures to lack of ability , Dweck thought , would become discouraged even in areas where they were capable .
Those who thought they simply had n’t tried hard enough , on the other hand , would be fueled by setbacks .
This became the topic of her PhD dissertation .
Dweck and her assistants ran an experiment on elementary school children whom school personnel had identified as helpless .
These kids fit the definition perfectly : if they came across a few math problems they could n’t solve , for example , they no longer could do problems they had solved before — and some did n’t recover that ability for days .
Through a series of exercises , the experimenters trained half the students to chalk up their errors to insufficient effort , and encouraged them to keep going .
Those children learned to persist in the face of failure — and to succeed .
The control group showed no improvement at all , continuing to fall apart quickly and to recover slowly .
These findings , says Dweck , “ really supported the idea that the attributions were a key ingredient driving the helpless and mastery - oriented patterns . ”
Her 1975 article on the topic has become one of the most widely cited in contemporary psychology .
Attribution theory , concerned with people ’s judgments about the causes of events and behavior , already was an active area of psychological research .
But the focus at the time was on how we make attributions , explains Stanford psychology professor Lee Ross , who coined the term “ fundamental attribution error ” for our tendency to explain other people ’s actions by their character traits , overlooking the power of circumstances .
Dweck , he says , helped “ shift the emphasis from attributional errors and biases to the consequences of attributions — why it matters what attributions people make . ”
Dweck had put attribution theory to practical use .
She continued to do so as an assistant professor at the University of Illinois , collaborating with then - graduate student Carol Diener to have children “ think out loud ” as they faced problem - solving tasks , some too difficult for them .
The big surprise : some of the children who put forth lots of effort did n’t make attributions at all .
These children did n’t think they were failing .
Diener puts it this way : “ Failure is information — we label it failure , but it ’s more like , ‘ This did n’t work , I ’m a problem solver , and I ’ll try something else . ’”
During one unforgettable moment , one boy — something of a poster child for the mastery - oriented type — faced his first stumper by pulling up his chair , rubbing his hands together , smacking his lips and announcing , “ I love a challenge . ”
Such zest for challenge helped explain why other capable students thought they lacked ability just because they ’d hit a setback .
Common sense suggests that ability inspires self - confidence .
And it does for a while — so long as the going is easy .
But setbacks change everything .
Dweck realized — and , with colleague Elaine Elliott soon demonstrated — that the difference lay in the kids ’ goals .
“ The mastery - oriented children are really hell - bent on learning something , ” Dweck says , and “ learning goals ” inspire a different chain of thoughts and behaviors than “ performance goals . ”
Students for whom performance is paramount want to look smart even if it means not learning a thing in the process .
For them , each task is a challenge to their self - image , and each setback becomes a personal threat .
So they pursue only activities at which they ’re sure to shine — and avoid the sorts of experiences necessary to grow and flourish in any endeavor .
Students with learning goals , on the other hand , take necessary risks and do n’t worry about failure because each mistake becomes a chance to learn .
Dweck ’s insight launched a new field of educational psychology — achievement goal theory .
Dweck ’s next question : what makes students focus on different goals in the first place ?
During a sabbatical at Harvard , she was discussing this with doctoral student Mary Bandura ( daughter of legendary Stanford psychologist Albert Bandura ) , and the answer hit them : if some students want to show off their ability , while others want to increase their ability , “ ability ” means different things to the two groups .
“ If you want to demonstrate something over and over , it feels like something static that lives inside of you — whereas if you want to increase your ability , it feels dynamic and malleable , ” Dweck explains .
People with performance goals , she reasoned , think intelligence is fixed from birth .
People with learning goals have a growth mind - set about intelligence , believing it can be developed .
( Among themselves , psychologists call the growth mind - set an “ incremental theory , ” and use the term “ entity theory ” for the fixed mind - set . )
The model was nearly complete ( see diagram ) .
* * *
The most dramatic proof [ that you can change the mind - set itself ] comes from a recent study by Dweck and Lisa Sorich Blackwell of low - achieving seventh graders .
All students participated in sessions on study skills , the brain and the like ; in addition , one group attended a neutral session on memory while the other learned that intelligence , like a muscle , grows stronger through exercise .
Training students to adopt a growth mind - set about intelligence had a catalytic effect on motivation and math grades ; students in the control group showed no improvement despite all the other interventions .
* * *
Unlike much that passes for wisdom about education and performance , Dweck ’s conclusions are grounded in solid research .
She ’s no rah - rah motivational coach proclaiming the sky ’s the limit and attitude is everything ; that ’s too facile .
But the evidence shows that if we hold a fixed mind - set , we ’re bound not to reach as high as we might .
* * *
But are n’t there plenty of people who believe in innate ability and in the notion that nothing comes without effort ?
Logically , the two ideas are compatible .
But psychologically , explains Dweck , many people who believe in fixed intelligence also think you should n’t need hard work to do well .
This belief is n’t entirely irrational , she says .
A student who finishes a problem set in 10 minutes is indeed better at math than someone who takes four hours to solve the problems .
And a soccer player who scores effortlessly probably is more talented than someone who ’s always practicing .
“ The fallacy comes when people generalize it to the belief that effort on any task , even very hard ones , implies low ability , ” Dweck says .
* * *
In May , Professor Dweck will give the keynote address at the Association for Psychological Science 19th Annual Convention .
House Majority Leader Tom DeLay said yesterday that Republicans have done so well in cutting spending that he declared an “ ongoing victory , ” and said there is simply no fat left to cut in the federal budget .
Mr. DeLay was defending Republicans ’ choice to borrow money and add to this year ’s expected $ 331 billion deficit to pay for Hurricane Katrina relief .
Some Republicans have said Congress should make cuts in other areas , but Mr. DeLay said that does n’t seem possible .
“ My answer to those that want to offset the spending is sure , bring me the offsets , I ’ll be glad to do it .
But nobody has been able to come up with any yet , ” the Texas Republican told reporters at his weekly briefing .
Asked if that meant the government was running at peak efficiency , Mr. DeLay said , “ Yes , after 11 years of Republican majority we ’ve pared it down pretty good . ”
Congress has passed two hurricane relief bills totaling $ 62.3 billion , all of which will be added to the deficit .
Republican leaders have been under pressure from conservative members and outside watchdog groups to find ways to pay for the Katrina relief .
Some Republicans wanted to offer an amendment , including cuts , to pay for hurricane spending but were denied the chance under procedural rules .
“ This is hardly a well - oiled machine , ” said Rep. Jeff Flake , Arizona Republican .
“ There ’s a lot of fat to trim . … I wonder if we ’ve been serving in the same Congress . ”
American Conservative Union Chairman David A. Keene said federal spending already was “ spiraling out of control ” before Katrina , and conservatives are “ increasingly losing faith in the president and the Republican leadership in Congress . ”
“ Excluding military and homeland security , American taxpayers have witnessed the largest spending increase under any preceding president and Congress since the Great Depression , ” he said .
Mr. Keene said annual nonmilitary and non-homeland security spending increased $ 303 billion between fiscal year 2001 and 2005 ; the acknowledged federal debt increased more than $ 2 trillion since fiscal year 2000 ; and the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill is estimated to increase the government ’s unfunded obligations by $ 16 trillion .
Tom Schatz , president of Citizens Against Government Waste ( CAGW ) , said if Mr. DeLay wants to know where to cut , “ there are plenty of places to reduce . ”
His group soon will release a list of $ 2 trillion in suggested spending cuts over the next five years , and he said Congress also could cut the estimated $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion in pet projects that make their way into must - pass spending bills each year .
CAGW and the Heritage Foundation also suggest rescinding the 6,000 - plus earmarked projects in the recently passed highway bill .
But Mr. DeLay said those projects are “ important infrastructure ” and eliminating them could undermine the economy as Congress tries to offer hurricane relief .
“ It is right to borrow to pay for it , ” he said .
“ But it is not right to attack the very economy that will pay for it . ”
Mr. Schatz , though , said the highway bill included projects such as flowers for the Ronald Reagan freeway in California , which he said are n’t essential spending .
Mr. DeLay said the budget this year was pared down and 100 programs or offices were eliminated in this year ’s spending bills .
“ We have been doing that for 11 years , ” he said .
He said it ’s an “ ongoing process ” that will be more complete after this year ’s budget process , which calls for cuts to Medicaid and other entitlement programs .
Rep. Patrick T. McHenry , North Carolina Republican , agreed that Republicans “ have been more fiscally sound than the Democrats were in their decades in the House . ”
He acknowledged that “ we ’re still trying to improve , ” and noted Mr. DeLay is leading the fight to reform the budget process .
“ We ’ve had a good start , but many of us want to see the government be more fiscally sound and conservative in the future , ” Mr. McHenry said .

IT IS AN odd article of faith among conservatives that Hillary Clinton is a sure - fire lock to win the Democratic presidential nomination .
You can hardly turn on Fox News without hearing some pundit assure viewers that Clinton is the runaway favorite .
But this belief says more about them than it does about her .
The belief in her invincibility is a product of their deepest fears .
After all , it ’s not as though conservatives think that Clinton is a brilliant , natural politician .
Nobody does -- as a backslapper and as a public speaker , she ’s decidedly average .
When they try to talk about why Clinton inevitably will roll over her primary competition , they usually invoke the dreaded “ Clinton machine . ”
A recent Wall Street Journal editorial , for instance , asserted that Clinton is the clear favorite but offered little evidence to support this other than the existence of “ those Clinton legions -- of fundraisers , union chiefs , party bosses , think tank operatives , media consultants . ”
Conservatives rarely make clear exactly how this dreaded machine is supposed to mow down the competition .
Other candidates have fundraisers , union supporters , media consultants and the like .
Is the idea that Clinton ’s team is so battle - tested from her husband ’s presidency that it knows how to play the game far better than the competition ?
It ’s a plausible theory , but so far it does n’t seem to be working out that way .

A week ago , South Carolina state Sen. Robert Ford , a Clinton supporter , declared that having a black man at the top of the Democratic Party would doom the entire ticket .
That , of course , was just the thing Barack Obama wanted -- a chance to stand up for the right of African Americans to run for president .
“ When folks were saying , ‘ We ’re going to march for our freedom , ’ they said , ‘ You ca n’t do that , ’ ” he said in his next speech .
“ When somebody said , ‘ You ca n’t sit at the lunch counter ....
You ca n’t do that . ’ ” It was the highlight of Obama ’s speech , all thanks to a blundering attack by a Clinton surrogate .
Then there is the continuing controversy surrounding Clinton ’s 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war .
Clinton ’s advisors have apparently decided that she will never apologize for the vote , as doing so would make her look weak in the general election .
Which may be true , except that her war vote is hounding her everywhere she goes , the first primaries are nearly a year away and the war keeps getting worse .
So Clinton looks extremely vulnerable .
Why do so many conservatives insist that she ’s a lock to get the nomination ?
A few of them have a strong vested interest in the Hillary Clinton boogeyman .
There ’s an enormous amount of money to be made in scaring the pants off of conservatives about Clinton .
Last year , conservative pundit John Podhoretz published the fear - mongering screed “ Can She Be Stopped ? ” “ Hillary Rodham Clinton will become the next president of the United States unless you Republicans can find a way to stop her , ” he warned .
I ’m guessing the way of stopping her involved , among other things , buying Podhoretz ’s book .

The bigger factor , I think , is that conservatives are spooked by the Clintons .
They had Bill Clinton on the ropes when they took control of Congress after the 1994 elections .
He beat back their revolution .
They had him again a few years later when they caught him with his pants down and made his misbehavior a theme of the 1998 midterm elections .
Instead , Democrats won seats .
In the Republican mind , there must have been some sort of Clinton voodoo at work .
The public was on their side , they believe , yet through some sort of nefarious dark political art , he turned the tables on them .
The conservative hatred of the Clintons has always had around the edges a certain fear of the supernatural .
A famous 1993 American Spectator cover story depicted Hillary Clinton as a witch .
A witch is an object of hatred , of course , but also a creature with dark and frightening powers .
In reality , the public never really was on the Republicans ’ side .
Yes , they gave them control of Congress in 1994 , but a majority of Americans opposed the deep cuts in popular social programs that the GOP agenda required .
And yes , the public was disgusted by Bill Clinton ’s adultery , but a majority likewise opposed impeachment all along .
Stopping these wildly unpopular things did n’t require magic or even a fearsome political machine .

LCA : The state of the Nouveau project
In any conference , there comes a time when one has to wonder what the people who do the talk scheduling were thinking .
For lca2007 , that moment came when your editor realized that the talks on OLPC ( Jim Gettys ) , real time ( Ted Ts'o ) , and Nouveau were all scheduled together .
Nouveau won out , but it was not an easy decision .
The Nouveau project is an effort to develop a set of free 3D drivers for NVidia chipsets .
NVidia has long annoyed the free software community with its refusal to release free drivers or programming information for its video chipsets .
The Nouveau folks have had enough of that , and they are doing something about it .
Dave Airlie used his slot at linux .conf.au to talk about the project and its current status .
Nouveau got its start in February 2005 , though serious work did not begin until June of that year .
The project was announced at FOSDEM 2006 , at which point others started to help .
There are currently about six developers doing serious work on Nouveau .
The project is relying on reverse engineering for the information needed to write free drivers .
To that end , the developers have put together a set of tools .
At the top of the list is renouveau , which is designed to reveal the commands sent to the card in response to specific operations .
Using the existing binary drivers , renouveau sets up a context , then scans the process 's mappings until it finds the command FIFO .
It then requests an operation and sees how the FIFO changes .
With enough operations , a pretty good idea of how the adapter is programmed to specific ends can be had .
This was not a trivial tool , and the better part of a year was put into its development .
Renouveau is useful for examining the FIFO , but it does n't help with reads and writes to I /O registers .
For that , there 's another set of tools , starting with valgrind - mmt - a version of valgrind designed to trap I /O memory operations .
Libsegfault is a modified version of mmap ( ) which does n't actually do the mappings as the caller would like ; it traps the subsequent segmentation faults and dumps out the operations .
There is another tool , called kmmio , which performs a similar task for register operations done in kernel space .
Finally , the project uses a BIOS tracer which runs BIOS code in x86emu and traps I /O register accesses .
All of the information obtained from these tools is supplemented with hints from the old , free nv driver .
There is also , says Dave , information " which should n't be there " to be found on some Russian web sites .
Where has all of this information led the project ?
Basic tasks , like the allocation of instance RAM and FIFO initialization , are working .
Hardware context switching works - on little - endian machines .
There is 2D support derived from the nv driver ; it offers basic EXA and RandR 1.2 support .
On the 3D front , the Mesa TCL ( transform , clipping , and lighting ) driver mostly works .
Textures and objects do not , however .
It is possible to run glxgears on nv4x chips .
It has taken some time to get to this point , but Dave thinks that things will start to move a lot faster from here .
The next milestone would be to run Quake 3 .
That is , says Dave , an obligatory step on the roadmap .
Getting there will involve texture support , a better memory manager , and better locking in the kernel DRM code .
The developers ( Dave in particular ) are aiming for RandR 1.2 multi-head support .
Once all of this is in place , the nouveau driver will have reached a reasonably capable state .
There are a lot of people asking when this will be ;
Dave says that the project 's IRC channel is often overwhelmed by spectators looking for news .
There is no wish to push the code out ahead of its time ; among other things , that would nail down the API between the kernel and the X server , making things harder to change .
The current hope is to have some sort alpha release toward the end of 2007 .
For people wanting to help , Dave had a simple message : they need developers .
There 's not much for people who can't work on driver code to do at this point .
Graphics drivers , he says , are not as hard as people think .
Finally , he addressed the issue of the $ 10 K pledge for the project .
It rather took the developers by surprise ; they had not endorsed this drive , and had held some doubts as to whether it would be successful .
How the pledge money will be handled is still being worked out ; it looks like it will mostly be used for hardware purchases .
Lack of support for 3D video adapters has stalled the community for years ; there has been a long wait in the hope that the vendors would come to their senses .
That wait is just about over .
The Nouveau project ( along with various others ) shows that we have the resources to figure out how our hardware works , even in the face of complex devices and uncooperative vendors .
It would be better if we did not have to take things into our own hands this way , but it is nice to see how well we can do it when the need arises .
Let Your Dream Job Evolve Tom Colicchio

To this day , the best job I ever had was working the grill at my parents ’ country club in New Jersey when I was 15 years old .
I made $ 275 a week in cash and got to work in a pair of cutoffs .
But your idea of a dream job changes over time .
When I was 22 , I wanted to run a top restaurant in New York , and I achieved that with Gramercy Tavern when I was in my early thirties .
At that point , you can open more restaurants , or you can just take it easy .
If I still just had Gramercy Tavern , I ’d probably only show up to work at 5 o’clock three days a week , but I realized I wanted more .
You ca n’t be a chef forever .
It takes too much out of you .
Thomas Keller , who runs the French Laundry and is probably the best chef in America , spends a tremendous amount of time in the kitchen .
At the end of the day , he can barely stand up .
It used to be the same for me .
I ca n’t and do n’t want to do that anymore .
I do n’t spend nearly as much time with my 11 - year - old boy as I want .
I want to play my guitar two hours a day .
If I could n’t do those things , I ’d be very difficult to work with .
My company is now my dream job .
The cooking first attracted me , but now I love the business end of it , too .
It ’s not only about creativity in the kitchen but also how to deal creatively with some of the business issues .
The guy running our new lunch spot ‘ wichcraft has worked with me for nine years .
He had a passion for sandwiches .
I helped him design the shop , create the menu , and now we ’re rolling it out across the country .
That ’s every bit as fun as seeing these young guys come up and do some great work in the kitchen .
Connect to Your Passion Tim Brosnan

I was the captain of my college baseball team , but I knew I did n’t have what it takes to play in the majors .
At some point , I decided I was n’t going to be embarrassed about telling people what I wanted to do , which was to work in baseball .
I got a lot of snide remarks , but I eventually met a guy whose brother - in - law was the Yankees ’ general counsel .
That led to a meeting with the deputy commissioner .
He asked , “ What do you think you could do for us ? ”
And I said , “ I ’ll scrub toilets if you ’ll give me a job .
I think I can prove myself once I get in . ”
I was hired in 1991 to head international business affairs and have been in baseball ever since .
The business of baseball is all about connecting to people ’s passion for the game .
I have to be acutely aware of my own baseball passion , because we have to figure out what is lovable about our product and constantly manipulate it to keep it that way .
Understanding everything that needs to be dealt with to put the game on the field — to create that pristine , nine - versus - nine , summer - night , smell - of - grass , shine - of - lights experience — has made me appreciate the game even more .
It ’s a huge entertainment business .
Baseball ’s revenues will be north of $ 4.5 billion this year .
I get to exist inside the game , but I also get to work in an enormously dynamic business environment .
A childhood friend of mine from the Lower East Side still calls me and tells me what ’s good , what ’s bad , what ’s wrong , and what ’s right about baseball .
I can have that discussion because I still have that love for the game .
The only thing I ca n’t do is root as hard for the Yankees as he does .
Pursue the Creative Spirit Halle Stanford
In college , when all the other students were making dark movies , I was saying , “ Let ’s do a puppet television show ! ” I interviewed for a job with the Jim Henson Co. after graduation and was told that I was overqualified but to keep in touch .
They actually meant it , though , because soon after , I was hired as a creative assistant .
I was the grand note - taker , but it was exciting nonetheless .
The first time I met [ Muppets puppeteer ]
Frank
Oz , I nearly fainted .
The words that came out of my mouth were , “ I like Grover . ”
And he said to me , “ So do I . ”

At the time , the company had just healed from the grief of losing Jim , when everybody picked themselves up again .
As a 22 - year - old just starting out , I really benefited from that creative spirit .
The company was willing to nurture who I was , building my talent from within , and I worked my way up .
In 2000 , a German company acquired Henson .
I loved working at Henson , but I did n’t love watching the company go into creative limbo , so I left .
For three years , I produced shows on my own , trying to keep that Hensonesque creative dialogue going .
When the Henson family took back the company in 2003 , I knew it would have everything again creatively .
When Jim ’s daughter , Lisa , called me last year to come back and head kids ’
TV , I gladly accepted .
The staff is leaner , more focused , and very excited .
My mom told me , “ You are so much happier now that you ’re back there again . ”
It really is more of a dream job now .
Those Who Do , Teach Rick Steves
I ’m real thankful that I found something I love doing that works from a business point of view .
When I wrote my first guidebook , I was a piano teacher with a recital hall , but gradually the hall became used more for travel lectures than for piano recitals .
When I ’m in Europe , I ’m breathing straight oxygen , I ’m 10 years younger , I ’m bolting out of bed in the morning , making new friends , learning new things , putting the puzzle together , coming home , and making a lot of money .
It ’s pretty cool .
advertisement
Lately , I have so much to update that I spend less time out there looking for new stuff , which is frustrating .
But it ’s just a reality that I can only do so much , and I ’m more committed to making sure my existing material is accurate than finding new stuff .
In the old days , I would lead tours all summer long , five three - week tours in a row .
Now we do 300 tours a year , and I have 80 guides who work for me , so I lead tours mainly through my books , which are a kind of blueprint , and TV shows .
Even though I do n’t get to explore as much anymore , the joy and reward in my work have always been about teaching .
I just love helping people travel better .
I ’m a teacher with eager students .
People come to me because they ’re excited about their upcoming trip , and the idea that they can learn from my mistakes and travel better is very exciting to me .
People rely so closely on the books for their trips that they ’re on a first - name basis with me .
I ’m their travel partner in their pocket .
I ’ve got enough money .
I measure profits by how many trips I positively affect .
Behold the server farm !
Glorious temple of the information age !
They 're ugly .
They require a small city 's worth of electricity .
And they 're where the web happens .
Microsoft , Google , Yahoo , and others are spending billions to build them as fast as they can .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) -- Margie Backaus is standing on a 17 - acre plot outside Secaucus , N.J. , shaking her head in disbelief .
Garbage bags and broken glass litter the ground , and weeds have taken over the parts of the land that are n't bald .
At least the view is nice , if you like power lines , shipping containers , and the New Jersey Turnpike .
Backaus , a chatty , petite blond , does n't say a word , but you can tell what she 's thinking :
This looks like a place where Tony Soprano would dump a body .
Only Backaus is n't scouting locations for a TV shoot .
She 's chief business officer for Equinix ( Charts ) , a company that operates huge data centers for corporations and Internet companies , and she 's looking for someplace to build another facility , Equinix 's third new center in the past several years .
A colleague tries to explain why the site they 're visiting on this hot May afternoon might work :
It 's big enough to accommodate a 750,000 - square - foot complex -- equivalent to seven Costco ( Charts ) stores and three times the size of the megacenter Equinix is building in phases in the Chicago suburbs .
And those unsightly wires overhead are actually a plus :
The company could tap them to build its own electrical substation to power the facility .
But Backaus just does n't like it .
More troubling to her than the Superfund - site vibe is the amount of time it would take to construct a new building and get it up and running .
" I have to wait two years till it 's done ? " she says , surveying the detritus .
" I 'm out . "
Backaus 's impatience is understandable .
Equinix , a small but fast - growing publicly traded company whose clients include Google ( Charts ) , Yahoo ( Charts ) , MySpace , and other Internet powers , is bursting at the seams , as are data centers operated by the likes of AT&T ( Charts ) and IBM ( Charts ) .
Competition for real estate , even ugly scraps of land such as the Secaucus acreage , is so fierce that Equinix 's brokers began cold - calling landlords in northern Jersey when it became apparent the company would need to expand in the New York area .
Most people do n't think of it this way , but the Information Age is being built on an infrastructure as imposing as the factories and mills of yore .
Think of all the things people have been using the Internet for -- all the e-mails , blogs , photos , videogames , movies , TV shows .
None of those bits and bytes simply float off into the ether , magically arriving at their assigned destinations .
Storing , processing , and moving them all is heavy , heavy lifting .
And the work is performed by tens of millions of computers known as servers , all packed into data centers around the world .
The industry term for the vast rooms full of humming , blinking computers inside each of these complexes is " server farms , " but " work camps " would be more accurate .
Consider that every time you conduct a web search on one of Yahoo 's sites , for example , you activate roughly 7,000 or more computers -- and that does n't count at least 15,000 others that support every query by constantly poking around the Net for updates .
" When you go to certain parts of a data center , it looks much more like a factory than something high - tech , " says Urs Hölzle , a senior vice president of operations at Google .
The Great Planting of these server farms has only begun , thanks to a revolution currently taking place in the $ 120 billion software industry .
Software is becoming webified : Computer programs that traditionally have been installed on personal computers -- from simple word processing and e-mail to heavy - duty applications that help companies manage payroll - - are going online .
( Bye - bye to CD - ROMs and 300 - page installation manuals . )
Google in June released an online spreadsheet and earlier this year acquired the maker of a web - based word - processing program called Writely .
The true sign of the times : Microsoft , a company that has become synonymous with desktop software , has pledged to move a big swath of its applications to the online world .
To handle this change , Internet companies are building their own centers , though none of them is all that eager to talk about it .
Microsoft has been the most open -- it recently broke ground on a 1.4 - million - square - foot campus in Quincy , Wash . , close to hydroelectric power .
Company officials acknowledge that centers in the South and Europe will come afterward .
Yahoo , meanwhile , also has purchased 50 acres in Quincy for a server farm .
Google , which enjoys discussing its data centers about as much as the NSA enjoys discussing its code - breaking techniques , has n't been able to conceal a two - building complex under construction on 30 acres of former farmland in Oregon .
The Google facility will contain some of the estimated half - million to one million ( only Google knows for sure ) servers that the company operates to handle 2.7 billion online searches a month , its Gmail service , and other applications .
Experts figure such a project easily could run north of $ 150 million ; Google , of course , is n't saying .
Analysts expect that the three companies combined will devote roughly $ 4.7 billion to capital expenditures this year , double 2005 levels .
Then there 's the enormous cost of operating these things .
New and improved microchips that can process more data mean that standard - sized servers can do a lot more than their ancestors did , but the newest gear also throws off more heat .
And that means cranking up the air conditioning to make sure the computers do n't literally melt themselves into slag .
Vericenter , an operator of data centers , says a rack of " blade " servers can get as hot as a seven - foot tower of toaster ovens .
It gets hot enough that for every dollar a company spends to power a typical server , it spends another dollar on a / c to keep it cool .
No wonder Yahoo , Google , and Microsoft all are building their server farms in the Pacific Northwest , near hydroelectric power plants selling cheap electricity .
" If I saved just $ 10 in the operation of each of those servers , that 's $ 10 million per year , " says Greg Papadopolous , chief technology officer of Sun Microsystems .
" So how much would you be willing to invest in order to save $ 10 per server ?
This is exactly the discussion companies had around the time of the Industrial Revolution . "
All this talk of plants and equipment must come as a shock to some Internet investors , who surely thought they were buying shares in elegant , money - printing intellectual - property companies , not some dirty , noisy , capital - intensive industry .
When Microsoft in April signaled that it would need to pour at least $ 2 billion more than analysts expected into cap ex in the coming year , the stock sank 11 % in a day .
No , Internet companies are n't spewing Ma Bell levels of capital spending ( yet ) : North American phone companies will spend about $ 60 billion on cap ex this year , ten times what the five largest Internet companies will cough up .
But there 's no question that we 're seeing a change in web economics .
No company feels this more acutely than Microsoft , which is making a shift from a traditional software model , with its low capital costs and robust margins , to the software - as - services model embraced by smaller companies such as Salesforce.com .
The transition is fraught with challenges : Instead of collecting big upfront payments for software , for example , services companies subsist on subscription revenue that trickles in slowly over a longer period of time .
But the biggest challenge lies in building and maintaining the kind of physical infrastructure needed to distribute software , games , and other content -- plus storage - - via the Net .
Despite the financial unknowns , Microsoft is forging ahead .
To build and operate its share of the new web , it has turned to Debra Chrapaty , a feisty technologist who , in all earnestness , says things like , " I 'm a woman who loves data centers .
I love how you walk near a rack of servers and it's really hot , and how it 's cool in other spots . "
( She 's actually part of a lively sorority :
As I traveled the country checking out data centers , I found a surprising number of women in charge -- and they all seem to keep an extra sweater in their office . )
Chrapaty 's team handles the infrastructure for anything at Microsoft that a customer might access over the Internet - - from Xbox Live multiplayer games to Hotmail - - a huge job that is only going to get bigger .
Today the company operates a handful of facilities worldwide that occupy as much space as 12 Madison Square Gardens .
Quincy , Wash. , which will be home to Microsoft 's newest data center , showed up on the company 's radar eight or nine months ago partly because of its cheap power , which Microsoft reportedly will be able to purchase for as little as two cents a kilowatt - hour .
( In comparison , engineers say utilities in California routinely charge 11 cents a kilowatt - hour . )
" A couple of years ago I would measure a data center in square footage , " Chrapaty says .
" Now I look at megawatts of power .
It is a new way of measuring technology . "
So what do these data centers look like ?
They 're a weird mash - up of high tech ( state - of - the - art three - quarter - inch blade servers ) and heavy industry ( row after row of diesel generators ) wrapped in the architectural charm of a maximum - security prison .
To enter AT&T 's data center in Ashburn , Va. , for example , you have to pass through a " mantrap , " a revolving - doorlike contraption connected to a special scanner that literally reads your palm before releasing you into the heart of the facility .
Once inside , it 's hard to see what all the fuss is about .
The main computing area looks a little like a mainframe storage room circa 1960 .
Everything is painted dull beige , adding to the Cold War-era feel .
I almost expect to look up at the balcony - like observation area AT&T maintains for customers and see Ernst Blofeld or some other Bond villain surveying the blinking lights of those magical machines called computers .
But there 's nothing retro ( or , as best I can tell , overtly villainous ) about the transactions taking place on those computers .
The machines humming along in concert are processing your urgent e-mail messages or your company 's website or -- critically - - your kid 's online game activity .
And that dull roar in the background is n't the sound of servers serving but of air - conditioning units cranking away to keep the temperature in the computer room wine - cellar cool .
( AT&T operates four enormous " chillers " in Ashburn that continuously pump 13.5 million gallons of water a day . )
It may come as a surprise , but municipalities are n't necessarily prostrating themselves to host data centers .
It is n't as if these facilities generate tons of jobs -- a center such as Google 's megaplex in Oregon is expected to add 50 to 100 jobs to the local economy , according to press reports -- and most communities simply can't cope with the infrastructure demands of a massive server farm .
" You go to a local utility and tell them that you want 30 megawatts of power , and they 're just catatonic , " Janice Fetzer , who heads up data - center construction for Equinix , says drily .
" They do n't have the resources to build a city within their city . "
( This is part of what is driving Microsoft and others to resource - rich areas like eastern Washington ; remote locations are n't an option for Equinix and AT&T , which have multiple customers using their facilities . )
Fetzer is a bit like a general contractor :
Part of her job is helping scope out real estate for future data centers , but she also coordinates a small group of mechanical and electrical engineers and architects who design Equinix 's huge facilities .
And Fetzer and her team are always looking at cheaper ways to keep the server farms cool .
One approach involves special racks that use chilled water at the source of the heat -- the computers themselves -- to keep the racks from spewing hot air into the room .
This is more radical than it sounds .
" Computers and water do n't really mix , " Fetzer remarks .
" It 's a very emotional subject . "
Remember , we 're talking serious cooling here .
In fact , the underappreciated science of air conditioning has become a hot topic in the technology world , with everyone from server makers to disk - drive designers keenly focused on ways to build cooler computers .
" The duality of heating and cooling is the greatest challenge to electromechanical engineering in the last 30 years , " says Kfir Godrich , director of technology development for EYP Mission Critical Facilities , a Manhattan - based engineering firm that helps design fail - safe facilities .
Even the companies whose microchips go into servers are thinking cool .
Advanced Micro Devices , for example , is pushing its Opteron chips as an energy - efficient solution for data centers ; the company has even launched a major marketing campaign with billboards in Times Square and Silicon Valley trumpeting itself as an environmentally friendly company .
Opteron puts two lower - power processors on a single chip , reducing the electricity needs of servers that use it .
Opteron 's edge , claims Marty Seyer , an AMD senior vice president , is that it helps data centers expand their computing power without having to add real estate or draw a lot more energy .
For Equinix , though , needing to add real estate is a good problem to have :
It means the Internet is growing and demand for its state - of - the - art data centers is robust .
In a few weeks the company expects to disclose the location of its newest facility in New Jersey .
The details , like so many things in a data center , are top secret , but if you 're ever driving around Secaucus and see a bunch of two - megawatt generators and seven - foot - high electrical switches sitting around waiting to be installed , you 'll know what they 're for .
Ethan Winsby considers himself in financial ruin at age 27 -- but not because he lost at gambling or risked everything on a startup that went bust .
Like a growing number of young adults , he had to take out private loans to attend college .
He graduated from the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco in 2005 , but he said his subsequent low - paying job as a cook has made it nearly impossible for him to repay the $ 35,000 he borrowed .
As the 18 percent interest rate compounded , his debt has soared to $ 50,000 .
The monthly payments , if he made them , would be two - thirds of his $ 1,200 monthly after - tax salary .
With no prospects of paying his loans off quickly , Winsby sees his debt spiraling out of control .
" At this rate , I 'm going to be in default , " he said .
" Default means you have no options .
It 's the main source of stress in my life .
It should n't be .
I was trying to make a career for myself .
I wish I had n't even gone to school . "
As the cost of college skyrockets and the federal government limits how much it will loan students , young adults increasingly are taking out private loans to finance their education .
The amount loaned to students nearly tripled between 2001 and 2006 , from $ 6.1 billion to $ 17.3 billion , according to an annual student aid survey released Tuesday by the College Board .
" I am shocked and worried about the amount of debt these companies are encouraging students to take out , " said Robert Shireman , executive director of the Project on Student Debt .
The trend is especially dangerous , he said , because such loans almost always carry a variable interest rate and lack the protections offered by federal loans , " so if interest rates go up , your private student loan can look like a credit card pretty quickly . "
Recent changes in federal law make it nearly impossible to discharge any kind of student loan debt through bankruptcy .
Instead , a borrower faces the possibility of a ruined credit rating or being forced into an unaffordable payment plan .
Education experts are calling on the federal government to raise the amount it will loan students and to give them more grants to keep them from having to turn to private loans to fill the gap .
Historically , private lenders have marketed loans to students in professional schools who have high earning potential once they graduate .
But increasingly , they are targeting undergraduates .
One company , Loan to Learn , advertises on Google with this tantalizing ad : " Financial Aid Not Covering Your Costs ?
Get up to $ 50,000 in five days . "
The company will loan qualifying undergraduates $ 50,000 a year , up to $ 250,000 .
The United States Student Association filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission in September saying that Loan to Learn engaged in " false and deceptive advertising practices " by encouraging students to view its private loans as a preferable alternative to federal grants and loans .
If the FTC finds a company has violated the law , it can seek a court order to require changes .
Loan to Learn officials deny misleading students and say they provide a needed service .
" To say that Loan to Learn does n't have an interest in the students cuts to the core , " said Catherine Reynolds , chairwoman and CEO .
" What we do is simply try and help families have an option . "
Students and families are finding it increasingly hard to pay for college .
In the past five years , the cost of attending a public university has risen 35 percent after adjusting for inflation , according to the College Board .
Meanwhile , federal loan amounts have stagnated .
For example , under the most popular federal program , called Stafford , an undergraduate can borrow no more than $ 23,000 over five years -- roughly what the average private university charges for a single year 's tuition and fees .
The maximum Pell Grant for needy students has stayed at $ 4,050 for three years .
Many students turn instead to private loans .
A decade ago , such high - interest loans represented 6 percent of all the cash loaned to students .
Today they are 20 percent , according to the College Board .
When Beccie and Carl Smalls ' son decided to attend Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara in 2002 , they realized federal loans would n't come close to covering tuition and expenses .
The Smalls co-signed on two private loans totaling $ 50,300 through Stillwater Bank ( which later sold the loans to the Sallie Mae company ) so their son could get a lower interest rate .
He racked up another $ 31,976 in private loans that his parents did n't co-sign -- the interest rate on those ranged from about 12 to 17 percent -- then dropped out to keep from going deeper into debt .
When his loans came due six months later , he did n't make enough money as a fledgling photographer to cover the $ 1,000 monthly payment .
Sallie
Mae agreed to postpone the due date two more years , but with compounding interest , his debt grew to at least $ 110,000 .
And because he did n't graduate , he could n't consolidate his loans under a fixed interest rate , Beccie Small said .
As co-signers of two of the loans , the Smalls became fearful .
What if their son failed to make his payments ?
A collection agency could ruin the Smalls ' credit rating and eat up any savings they had .
In 2006 , they took a second mortgage on their house to pay off the two loans they co-signed , which had grown from $ 50,300 to $ 67,200 .
Their son still owes $ 555 a month for the next 15 years on the rest of the loans .
By the time he pays them , he will have given Sallie Mae $ 98,877 .
And the Smalls owe $ 712 a month to pay off their house loan .
" There should be more options for these kids , " said Beccie Small .
" There was one option for him -- private loans .
He wanted to go to school so bad , he took what they gave him . "
Students often get into trouble because they do n't fully understand the terms and agreements of what they 're getting into , said Alan Collinge , who founded Student Loan Justice in Washington 18 months ago to collect stories of wronged students and to advocate for change .
He did this after unemployment caused him to default on a $ 38,000 loan to attend the University of Southern California .
That loan has grown to $ 105,000 with compounding interest , penalties and fees .
" College students are an extremely vulnerable segment of the population , " Collinge said .
" They will sign virtually anything you put in front of them . "
Ethan Winsby feels like he signed away his freedom .
Every night , he searches the Internet for a way out of the financial mess and wonders what will happen when Sallie Mae no longer allows him to put off the payments .
In reviewing his situation , Sallie Mae spokesman Tom Joyce called Winsby an " unusual case " and said few of the company 's borrowers have such high variable interest rates .
He added that less than 2 percent of Sallie Mae 's private loan borrowers default .
But higher - education experts counter that default rates are deceptive .
Companies use techniques such as allowing borrowers to defer payments to avoid defaulting -- but loan recipients still owe many times what they originally borrowed .
They say too many people are like Winsby , struggling with loans they might never be able to repay .
" What sense does it make to dig the hole deeper and create an underclass who because of their student loan default will never get out of debt ? " asked Barmak Nassirian , associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers .
" We 're marginalizing a significant portion of our population . "
Protect yourself
Some tips for students facing the high cost of college :
-- Exhaust all federal loan possibilities as well as state and institutional grants and aid .
-- Ask questions .
If the interest rate is variable , for example , ask the lender if there is a limit on how high the rate can go .
For more questions , go to projectonstudentdebt.org/private_loan_questions.vp.html .
-- Talk to the financial - aid adviser at your college about the loan before agreeing to borrow the money .
-- Document everything .
If you are offered a discount , get the terms in writing .

Among the busy coastal Devonian reefs crawling with predators of every shape and size , it would have been easy to miss a shy refugee further inland .
She was a strange looking fish , two - feet long , most of which was tail .
And as we open she 's swimming for her life up a fresh water stream with a larger predator in hot pursuit .
Under normal conditions this little lady -- we'll call her Mother -- and the eggs she carries would n't have a chance .
Her stalker outweighs her by a factor of ten .
But to our great benefit , she has a whole suite of secret weapons .
To understand what those secrets were and how they came about , we need to first go back almost two - hundred millions years before Mother 's time , when ancestors of the first fish appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian Period .
They 're known today as conodonts and they 're not worms , they 're chordates , but they probably evolved from something very much like a worm .
Early conodonts are a candidate precursor to all vertebrates , those familiar animals with a spine we know and love in our own era .
And because of their relatively large brains , conodonts were the geniuses of their day .
They had to be !
For many millions of years these modest creatures were mercilessly hunted , surviving only by their wits , caught up in war between the rival rulers of the primeval sea : Arthropods and Mollusks AKA bugs and snails .
Conodonts first appear in the fossil record about 500 million years ago .
Note :
There is some talk of a new basal chordate recently found and soon to be released that pushes back the origin of proto- vertebrates ' significantly '
By the time the conodonts were hiding in the warm mud of the Cambrian sea , the arthropods already dominated the world .
They came in an amazing array of formidable super bugs .
Anomalocaris was a free - swimming segmented predator over a meter in length , with a mouth that shredded prey like a garbage disposal cutting through hamburger .
Another of the arthropods , Pterygotus , looked like a cross between a lobster and a scorpion ; except they were over six - feet long !

Three trilobites lie in the mud in the left foreground near a starfish .
Rugose corals wave their tentacles from cup - like bodies attached to the ocean bottom .
Other corals species appear like rounded domes .
Flower - like starfish relatives , called crinoids , capture tasty morsels that float nearby .
Gary has also written and illustrated a really neat series of science books for kids of all ages
But by 450 million years ago , during the Ordovician Period , the mega - bugs were being outclassed by a new and even more frightening menace .
The reign of the super - snails had dawned : Or Cephalopods to be more precise , a taxon that includes modern squid and octopi .
The Ordovician and later Silurian versions of Cephalopods include giant nautiloids and ammonoids which easily rank among the most nightmarish monsters to ever inhabit the earth !
Some of these gals were enormous squid like creatures as long as a school bus which carried around a thick shell .
Each of the many tentacles were equipped with hundreds of suckers lined with tiny , razor sharp teeth , all radiating around a parrot like beak located in the center of the creature that could lop off big chunks of flesh and bite through solid bone .
It 's not terribly surprising that during this same time , some primitive fish developed thick bony armor !
But the saving grace for fish was just around the corner ...
In the Agnatha above , a type of early Ordovician fish , you might notice it lacks something most modern fish have : A jaw .
Without a jaw , early fish were limited to slurping down small prey , or gooey algal slime and decomposing flesh .
The jaw might seem like such a useful item to have that natural selection would craft it again and again .
Yet as best we can tell , unlike wings or eyes , the jaw only evolved once in the entire history of life , and only in vertebrates .
But once it did , the balance of power turned decidedly in favor of the fish .
With the capacity to chomp down on prey using the new hinged jaws -- full of sharp pointy teeth -- that 's exactly what the fish began doing .
The newcomers went on a tear , radiating into all kinds of new econiches .
And that 's what marks the late Devonian :
It was the golden age of fish , particularly sharks .
There were sharks that ate shellfish , sharks that lived in the deep sea , and sharks that lived in sandy shallows .
There were speed demon sharks , sharks that sat in stealthy ambush , and even sharks that could leap out of the water and glide for short distances !
Fish grew to the size of whales and the tables were turned on the super bugs and the giant tentacular monsters .
Arthropods and nautiloids suddenly found themselves on the receiving end of what they 'd been dishing out for eons .
It was n't long before toothy fish with gaping maws were chowing down on the meanest nautiloids and the nastiest arthropods , and eventually , even each other .
Life was hard enough for a little fish in a big ocean before the jawed giants came to be and now , because of them , by 375 million years ago it was more dangerous than ever .
So in the interests of self preservation some of those smaller fish sought safety upstream in less crowded rivers or freshwater estuaries .
But there were a couple of problems with that environment for a creature that evolved in the open ocean .
For one , as any aquarium aficionado can attest , put most salt water fish in a fresh water aquarium and pretty soon they 're floating belly up .
So the early refugees from the sea had to adapt to varying levels of salinity before they could safely journey between lake and ocean .
On top of that , the oxygen content in shallow tidal basins and fresh water ponds and streams declines greatly as a function of heat ; and it was pretty warm back then .
Another huge problem was the unpredictable level of essential minerals .
The ocean was plenty loaded down with calcium , sodium , potassium .
and other substances essential to fishy physiology .
The stuff they needed was everywhere , dissolved in the water , free for the drinking .
But ponds and streams were not nearly so well endowed .
Important trace minerals and salts would come and go depending on what kind of rock and soil happen to be exposed or washed in by local run off from rain at any given time .
Evolution addressed all these problems by modifying existing anatomical structures .
Openings formed behind the gills that could absorb a little oxygen from the air when the water turned anaerobic .
Kidney like organs developed to pump salt water out .
And the fresh water explorers began storing calcium and other minerals in their rubbery cartilage during times of plenty so they could call on those reserves when they became scarce .
This was the birth of the harder , bony skeletons found in most fish today .
All these adaptations were a smashing success .
The new freshwater adapted fish proliferated and invaded rivers , creeks , and lakes .
Of course , sooner or later , a big freshwater bully had to evolve that liked to eat the smaller guys and the little fish were right back to square one !
Back to our Devonian drama and Mother , the fleeing fish hoping to avoid being eaten .
Early on in the Devonian several species of fish developed a bony extension supporting the front and back fins called lobes , which helped them hold steady while resting on the bottom in the face of strong currents .
Eusthenoptern , an early ' lobe - finned ' fish .
This is the actual drawing done for Carl Zimmer 's book " At The Water 's Edge " by paleo - wildlife artist Carl Buell .
It lived about 380 million years ago and those fins exhibit fossil homologies to our own limbs .
Although they 're not easy to make out , the forerunners of the familiar arm and leg bones are there .
See also PZ 's post on Panderichthys for the skinny on another transitional a little further along
Mother was one of these kind of critters and her secret weapons included the new bony skeleton , and the latest deluxe model of air bladder which could extract a little oxygen from the air in a pinch .
But her biggest innovation was her lobed fins .
Instead of small lobes with long spines , she had evolved longer , bony paddles and reduced the spines to webbed hooks on the ends .
So Mother -- or Acanthostega as she is formally known -- could scramble upstream through fast moving water just a few inches deep better than any of her contemporaries , by pumping that big tail and scrambling along the bottom with her leggy paddles .
No large predator could follow her into that environment .
And that 's how she got away .
In these shallow water retreat[s ] , Mother and her children were much safer .
Over time they would forge further and further inland , learning to catch and feast upon unwary arthropods , tiny worms , and the small snails that patrolled the shallow water 's edge .
Eventually her descendants would develop even more robust bony paddles with articulated pads , all fastened to a stronger skeleton , that allowed them to take short walks out of the water altogether .
And thus , swimmers became walkers ; fish became amphibians .
The new walking fish would go on to diversify into other amphibians , reptiles , dinosaurs and birds , and a small group would eventually become the mammals .
And in a textbook display of evolutionary biology , all of these clades would produce subsequent members that returned to the water , a couple of which are pictured below .
Enlarge Enlarge
These critters may look closely related and they 're both descendants of land dwelling animals .
But they 're separated by hundreds of millions of years of divergent evolution .
The one on the left is a Tylosaurus , one of the last of the great Mosasaurs .
On the right is Ambulocetus , an early whale from 50 million years ago and as much a mammal as you or I .
Illustrations courtesy of Carl Buell
The sobering thing to contemplate is that if Mother or just one of her critical descendants or forebears had n't made it , most of the familiar animals we know today would n't exist .
No cats or dogs , no turtles or crocodiles , not a single bird or dinosaur would have ever lived .
In their stead would have been completely different kinds of vertebrates -- or no land vertebrates at all .
The bugs , worms , and snails were doing fine on land .
They had beaten fish out of the sea by a hundred - million years .
Had the terrestrial bugs and snails been allowed unfettered evolution with no brainy walking fish to worry about , today we could have giant browsing arthropods preyed upon by lightning fast land octopi , instead of antelope and tigers .
Enlarge
The star of our story : Mother Acanthostega , the one that got away .
She may look like a land dweller , but careful analysis of her bones reveals that without the buoyancy provided by at least a few inches of water , she was about as helpless as a catfish on land .
Her skeleton would have to be reinforced , the developing legs better braced , and ankles evolved , before she could leave the water completely .
Fossil deposits containing her remains have been found in strata over 350 million years old
Which brings me back to my evening meal and the lady who was willfully missing out on one of the great wonders of evolution , even though it was literally staring at her in the face from both sides of the aquarium .
Not all the fish that inhabited fresh water in the Devonian stayed there or went on to become tetrapods .
Some of those guys went back to salt water eventually and the new morphologies they had acquired in the lakes and streams granted them several competitive advantages over their cartilaginous cousins that remained behind .
The primitive lung turned into an air bladder , a precise buoyancy control mechanism .
And the hard mineral matrix in their bones allowed more powerful muscles to anchor and operate stiffer tails and ray - fins .
Both these adaptations significantly improved their agility and speed .
Almost every fish on the menu last night was one of these bony salt water denizens that made the evolutionary voyage to freshwater and back again .
That includes Atlantic Cod , Yellowfin tuna , red snapper , and flounder .
Salmon , one of my favorites , still to this day retrace their fresh water roots , returning the sanctuary of the lake and pond to spawn .
Even the brightly colored triggerfish looking warily out of the tank at my skeptical lady friend and I made the journey to fresh water and back to the salty sea .
And of course , Acanthostega ( Or something close to her ) leads to another lineage : Primates .
One of which would learn to walk on two legs rather than four .
About 70,000 years ago one of those bipedal creatures would walk out of Africa into the Middle East .
By 40,000 years ago they would walk into Europe and 12,000 years ago they would stroll into the New World .
In a geological instant they 're walking on the moon and eating dinner at Red Lobster .
The story my fellow diner was missing out on connected both of us to the fish we came to consume as well as the ones on display .
It 's an epic that joins mankind by way of shallow water , bony minerals , and lobed fins , to every whale , hippo , bison , lizard , squirrel , snake , grizzly bear , frog , eagle , dino , and pterosaur , just to name a handful .
It 's a wondrous tale of predators avoided and conquests won , any of which could have gone the other way .
And if even one of those Devonian links in the long chain of creatures leading to present day forms were broken , you and I , and the world we know , would n't be here .
The third rock from the sun might instead be a planet of intelligent squid or technological insects , peering with inhuman eyes at the ancient fossils of long forgotten , curious fish - like creatures with paddling fins that mysteriously died out .
And who knows , had it not been for the one that got away , perhaps they too would have wondered what might have been , and dreamed of a strange world that never was , ruled by modified walking fish and their bipedal descendants .
Greatest Expectations
BY RUSS WELLEN

MySQL has recently appeared as an Enterprise edition .
We have already looked at whether MySQL ( the company ) is enterprise ready , but we can also ask whether the product itself is suitable for enterprise use .
Some Reg Dev readers clearly have strong views about this already .
First up , remember that Enterprises come in all kinds of shapes and sizes .
In the UK , 58.7 per cent of employed people ( 2005 figures ) work for what we Brits call SMEs ( Small and Medium sized Enterprises ) .
The US has different definitions ( see the SBA site ) .
Irrespective of the exact definition , MySQL can , quite clearly , compete effectively in the small enterprise space – which means it can already service nearly 60 per cent of the working population .
As an example , I talked to John Dyson , the IT director at First B2B .
This is a new technology company that essentially manages messaging between other companies .
Company A needs to send a message in CSV format to company B which needs it in EDI .
First B2B receives the message , converts it to XML , stores it , and then forwards it in the correct format .
First B2B has a database of 24GB which runs on a four processor box with 2 GB of RAM .
In the past , it used Progress as its database , but has now switched to MySQL and is very happy with the result .
Dyson said : " The support is excellent ; indeed it is the best support I have ever known .
The guys on the support desk are very quick and very knowledgeable . "
He is also a major fan of MySQL's Monitoring and Advisory service : " It does n't just highlight the problem , it will supply methods of how to fix it .
It has made a significant improvement in the performance of some of our slower queries . "
OK , so small enterprises can use MySQL very effectively .
What about large ones ?
Well , the classic way to answer that question is to quote a customer list .
MySQL has a list that is long and distinguished , which is fine , but you have to bear in mind that it is just a list of the enterprises that use MySQL somewhere .
It is not a list of the enterprises that use MySQL exclusively .
It is certainly not a list of large enterprises that formerly used Oracle , took a look at MySQL , found it was great , threw Oracle out the door , replaced all of their Oracle installations with MySQL , saved quadrillions of dollars per year , and lived happily ever after .
The real picture is that many large enterprises that still rely on traditional database engines ( such as Oracle , DB2 – and even SQL Server ) to run their mission critical systems , are starting to try out MySQL .
They use it for small applications , at the departmental level , for the newer web - based applications – in other words , in all sorts of innovative ways that are well suited to MySQL 's particular strengths .
But they are not yet using it for the " traditional " enterprise database application workloads .
How can I be so sure of this ?
Because I 'm quoting Steve Curry , the director of corporate communications at MySQL who really ought to know :
" I think we 'll all agree that MySQL is not a ' traditional ' enterprise database - we never have been and are n't trying to suddenly become one now .
" We do n't compete head - to - head against Oracle , DB2 , Teradata , etc .
If users are looking to build that type of higher - end data warehouse / OLTP / client - server application , then they 've probably selected one of the traditional vendors or one of the open - source alternatives that are trying to directly emulate them .
That 's just not us - we 're carving out new , different ground that is not based on replacing existing applications but creating new complementary online ones . "
So , am I saying that MySQL is not , and never will be , a traditional , mission - critical , enterprise database engine ?
No , certainly not .
What MySQL ( the company ) is doing is very , very smart .
It has done a great job of establishing the product in a niche market which includes SMEs and departmental use in large enterprises .
With the new tools and support options , it has laid the foundations which will allow for further expansion into the enterprise .
What it will now do is further develop the product and wait for further adoption .
Curry said : " What we believe is that today 's web technologies like LAMP , AJAX and Ruby will become tomorrow 's enterprise infrastructure .
So , we have come out with a ' MySQL Enterprise ' subscription to help those companies who may need some help / support / risk management instead of relying on their own MySQL DIY hacker / guru types . "
Although neither company will thank me for the comparison , this reminds me of the route that SQL Server started upon 10 years ago .
Remember SQL Server 6.5 ?
It was a dog .
When 7.0 arrived , it was a revelation – a completely different product ; but its reputation preceded it , barking all the while .
So Microsoft bundled all manner of excellent analysis tools in the box .
Many large enterprises started to deploy SQL Server , not for the engine , but for the analytical capabilities .
SQL Server got its foot in the enterprise door .
After 10 years that foot has booted out innumerable Oracle installations and SQL Server is now one of the big three .
MySQL is starting out along the same track .
I do n't think that it 's currently " enterprise ready " in the sense of being a direct replacement , throughout an organisation , for one of the big three .
But it is ready for deployment in small to medium sized enterprises and at the departmental level in large enterprises .
It already has that crucial foot in the door and this new edition gives it some kicking potential . ®
Britney Spears : Black and White photos
Who do n't love her ?
That cute little blonde in school dress ... yes it 's Briney !
Look at picture where she is football player , see her on MTV adwords , go to her 's room with dolls , see picture with her 's bike , see some lovley or wild photo with her , ...
Maybe now she do n't look 's like on this photos but I made some great black and white photos in Photoshop to remind on her 's great body .
That 's pretty much the size of it .
We aim for ' non- disruptive enhancement ' around here .
That means : No Friday installs of anything that has a Customer facing component .
Of late this has become problematic , since we have a sizable User base distributed around the Globe .
Someone is always inconvenienced , no matter when we install ; so we have settled on Developer Convenience as the determining factor .
This means that the last five or six Product releases have occurred on Wednesday Evening between 1800 and 2000 .
The Service DOES NOT GO DOWN .
The New Service ( Client enhancement , bug fix and code maintenance , new database features , etc ) will run in parallel with the Old for a period of weeks .
( Or a period of years , in the case of Client code .
We have Client - software in the Wild that is over eight years old .
The feature set is still supported , We do n't accept bugs on it , however . )
While there is a committee involved in the planning and scheduling of a Change , there is a single Change Captain .
The Change Captain has final authority to say ' Oops .
Back it out ' .
We try to give our User Community a reasonable estimate of when a new feature set will be available .
We plan to have it in play four to six hours before the announced go - live .
This gives us a little ' final - checkout ' time .
Our Users know this and so we sometime get ' early adopters ' .
We do n't discourage this .
The Usual Time Line :
Two weeks before the date -- feature freeze
One week before the date -- code freeze and QA begins regression testing .
On the day : 1300 -- Final Change Review meeting -- are we really ready ?
1600 -- New code / hardware active and checked out 1800 -- Go-time -- everybody involved gathers in a conference room and watches the logs and monitors .
1810 -- Pizza delivered ( on the Project Managers nickel ) 1930 -- More Pizza , this time with beer ( ditto ; there is a line item in the project budget for this ) 2000 -- Go -Live for the Users ; Ice cream arrives Afternoon of the following day -- Post Mortem
This seems to be a working method , it has served for the past fourteen months .
We have only had one release aborted by the Change Captain -- when it was announced in the 1300 ' final readiness ' meeting that the primary power system to one of the co-location facilities had failed at 0300 , and we were on standby generators .
The power vendor ' expected to have it back online by close - of - business today . '
The CC said " that 's nice .
We ain't going until the generator has been up for at least 12 hours . "
We slipped the install a day .

Some of these issues have to do with your specific job , and the nature of the systems .
For instance , when I worked for a university , if a system change would require downtime , we never started before 6 pm on a Friday for planned change , so we had the whole weekend to clean up if things went wrong . *
Things were put into place on Friday night , stakeholders got to review the system on Saturday , and sysadmins and programmers had to get it working by 6 am on Monday .
If it was something that could be done with a quick cutover , I 'd prep everything in advance , get signoff on it in testing , and then cut it over at 7 am on a Monday morning .
( specifically because people came in late on Mondays , so the trouble calls came in slower ** ) .
These days , my work is international , and as I 'm a contractor , they do n't like me working overtime or odd hours .
So , I 'm a firm believer in the Tues - Thurs window .
We had a specific rule of NO system changes after noon on Fridays .
For some types of changes , we have to wait for specific gaps which occur .
For other changes , we do 'em late morning , as most of Europe 's left for the day , and many of our West Coast users are n't early risers .
We then have people around for a full day of debugging , should something go wrong .
So , I 'd have to say my normal window these days is Tuesday - Thursday , 10 am - 1 pm .
( if it 's a local change , and not going to affect the European folks , 8 am - 10 am ) ... * the 6 pm rule , unfortunately , is what got us into problems when our management would n't let us take down a mail server when we noticed it was having disk problems , and resulted in us spending 16 days around the clock trying to get things working ( and by ' working ' I mean e-mail was lost for all students ) ... because management did n't want to react when we noticed the problem ( a little past noon ) , and the system failed in a cascading manner at about 4:30 pm . **
Of course , that also resulted in a problem one day when I got all of the signoffs , but something was n't transfered cleanly ... and as no one noticed ' till about 10 am , I had to manually merge changes , which took me about 2 days ... normally , not a big deal , but the cutover was just to buy me 2 weeks to finish a project ... which then spiralled out of control , and took years to complete ( of course , I had been fired for 'use of sarcasm ' , as as the lead on the project , that might 've explained why they were delayed by 3 + years ( well , that , and bringing in a ' third party ' to review the system , who did n't understand our business needs , or the software we were using which added the first year of delay , and may have resulted in my sarcastic attitude ) )
simon.proctor ++ ... that 's pretty close to how we handle it .
Sometimes we have pushes that would impact customers ( database needs to go down because you cannot pre-live ) so we also evaluate the impact to the end -user .
If it 's too much of an impact , we co-ordinate to do the push off hours ( weekend or after biz hours ) .
I 'd say more than 90 % of our pushes follow your rules and about 2 - 3 times a year I can expect to be working on a Saturday .
- derby
I 'll second that ... much the same where I am .
One added thing - whenever possible ( and it 's not always possible ) , I try to have the " live " system up and running for a day before announcing it .
One last chance to check for ... unforseen consequences :-) -- WARNING : You are logged into reality as root .
I did support for a Fortune 500 company and typically all major changes were done on the weekend .
There were two reasons for this ,
It supposedly gave the developers , Admins extra time to test the environment without everyone banging on it during the work day .
They would bring in employees on Saturday / Sunday to help with testing the implementation .
The real reason was that the Production environment was so convoluted that there was not a good ' test ' environment .
The only way to make sure everything was going to work was to push it into Production and try patching and fixing things as they broke .
What ending up happening was all the basic stuff got checked in Production and they went with that .
Come Monday , as the users got onto the system a ton of bugs were consistently found , which usually caused corporate wide problems .
I have not worked with a company yet that has been consistent about how they role out code into production , but usually it was in the evening hours because it interupted fewer people but those systems typically had little testing so always resulted in major problems the next day .
If it were realistic , I would push the end time back to 15:00 .
If you are writing from a ( purely ) development side , then that potentially leaves you with other teams in the mix ( say a database management and operations teams ) .
You may not have any access at all to any live machines , and you are reliant on these other departments to deploy your changes .
That means you are reliant on them to help fix errors and roll back .
Also , as you mention DNS , it sounds like web development , and if you are UK based , then one of your peak traffic periods may be 16:00 .
And this all ignores the times when you are implementing major changes ( that might include hardware changes as well as software ) where downtime is unavoidable ( or highly likely ) .
Then you must consider the user / customer base first and pick off - peak times in order not to cause long lasting damage to the business .
-=( Graq )=-
> that potentially leaves you with other teams in the mix ( say a database management and operations teams ) .
Almost true in my case .
Unfortunately , there are no real database teams per se .
The hardware team looks after hardware , makes sure the os is up and the capacity is ok .
Beyond that , it is considered ' application ' and out of their remit .
Because of that , I tend to get a little more say in the stuff that I do .
I 'm also lucky that most of what I do is internal to the business .
However , as an international business we have 24 hour access requirements .
This is where our SLAs come into play .
Downtime is inevitable but is generally mitigated as much as possible .
I do n't really mention it as downtime is a lot rarer for my work .
>
As you mention DNS it sounds like web development
That is part of my work but i used DNS as an easy to understand example of not choosing a fixed time for launches .
Thanks for your comments :)
I support one system that has a team working 9 am - 6 pm in Toronto on one server , and another team working about 10 am - 10 pm in Mumbai , India , on a satellite server .
That means the system 's in use from about 11 pm through to about 6 pm local time , so my ' maintenance window ' is technically 6 - 8 pm .
So when it 's time for a roll - out , it 's a little tricky because the two teams share a server for some operations , but not for everything .. so we usually make the changes at both ends sometime during the day and get our end tested .
If it all checks out , we test the Mumbai satellite from Toronto , and then finally get them to try it out at about midnight when they start their day .
We usually have an opportunity to roll back to the previous version , unless it 's a database schema change , in which case any fixes depend on changes to live Production code .
That has n't been a problem in the four years I 've been doing the job .

I do n't have anything to add but wanted to drop a note to say that I really enjoyed this discussion and reading the various approaches .
I 've worked as a sys admin in a highly heterogeneous environment where 24/7 was critical ( associated with patient care ) and I 've worked as a programmer in research where lucky users were supported between 8 am and 5 pm .
Clearly the needs vary depending on users , systems , etc .
Clearly the demands on the admin and / or programmer also vary greatly .
Thanks again for sparking such a discussion .
Democrats took control of Congress this week with promises of fiscal discipline , bipartisanship and help for middle - class America .
They can't keep them all
NANCY PELOSI made history this week , and she made sure Americans noticed .
The congresswoman from San Francisco , who became the country 's first female speaker of the House of Representatives on January 4th , planned to celebrate her swearing - in with three days of carefully choreographed festivities , including a concert , a “ people 's ” reception on Capitol Hill and a trip to her native Baltimore , where a street is to be named after her .
The razzmatazz was designed to convince Americans that Ms Pelosi is not the wacky west - coast left - winger of Republican caricature , but a Catholic mother of five from modest origins in an industrial town .
And , more important , that she is a responsible leader who intends to get things done .
Harry Reid , the Senate 's new majority leader , took over with less fanfare but a similar commitment to action .
The initial to - do list is well known .
For months , Democrats have proclaimed their priorities , dubbed “ Six for 06 ” .
Ms Pelosi has promised to pass them within the first 100 hours of the congressional session .
Top of the agenda is ethics reform , in particular banning lawmakers from taking gifts or free trips from lobbyists , followed by the creation of new budget rules .
The first full - scale bill will be to implement the homeland security improvements recommended by the 9/11 Commission .
That is to be followed by legislation to raise the minimum wage from $ 5.15 to $ 7.25 an hour , boost embryonic stem - cell research , encourage the government to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices in the Medicare prescription - drug plan , cut the interest rate on student loans , roll back tax subsidies for oil firms and expand incentives to save .
These priorities are less a coherent agenda than a grab - bag of popular initiatives .
But they have a clear political logic .
Democrats want to show , quickly , that they are the party of clean , responsible and effective government , unlike the sleazy , partisan and reckless Republicans .
President Bush tried to climb on the bandwagon this week , echoing Democratic calls for a balanced budget by 2012 .
Unfortunately , the tensions between the Democrats ' broader promises are already becoming obvious .
The pledge to be bipartisan is being eclipsed by the desire to act quickly .
House Democratic leaders have threatened to limit congressional debate on their Six for 06 priorities , exactly the tactics Ms Pelosi and her colleagues deplored when Republicans used them .
The toughest choices involve the budget .
Democrats will be forced to decide between their promises to help middle - class Americans and their commitment to fiscal prudence .
So far , the focus has been on fiscal discipline .
Even before formally taking over , the Democrats in charge of spending bills in both the House and Senate have made some sensible decisions .
The first concerns the unfinished 2007 budget .
Technically , Congress ought long ago to have voted on spending bills for the fiscal year that began on October 1st 2006 .
Instead , the Republicans left town with only two out of 11 bills completed .
Democratic bigwigs have promised a single bill that keeps spending at last year 's level .
And they have pledged to strip out all “ earmarks ” , the tagged spending plans through which politicians direct funds to their home districts .
Around 10,000 such pieces of pork , worth around $ 17 billion , are to be filleted out .
The 2008 budget will allow earmarks , but only after new rules are put in place that will require politicians to attach their names to them .
More broadly , the Democrats seem determined to improve the budget process .
They want Mr Bush to include the cost of the Iraq war in his formal budget rather than send Congress a series of “ supplemental ” spending bills .
( The next such request , for at least $ 100 billion , is due in early February ) .
Likewise , rather than passing stop - gap laws every year to prevent the Alternative Minimum Tax from ensnaring ever more middle - class Americans , Democratic tax writers want to solve the problem permanently — though they are coy about how to do so .
But most important , Democrats have pledged a return to pay - as - you - go ( PAYGO ) budget rules .
These rules were first adopted in 1990 , when America 's budget deficit was almost 4 % of GDP .
The idea is simple .
Any tax cut or expansion of a government entitlement programme , such as Medicare , has to be offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere .
Only a super - majority of 60 Senate votes can override the need for offsets .
These rules helped shrink the deficit ; but with the budget in surplus , Mr Bush 's 2001 tax cut set them aside .
Strictly re-adopted , PAYGO rules would force the Democrats into a far tighter fiscal straitjacket than many realise .
That is because Mr Bush 's tax cuts technically expire in 2010 .
Under strict PAYGO rules , any extension of the Bush tax cuts — even those , such as the child - tax credit , that are popular with many middle - class Americans — would need to be paid for by spending cuts or higher taxes elsewhere .
To provide more wriggle room , some Democratic voices have suggested that the PAYGO rules should be based on a different budget baseline , perhaps one that assumes an extension of the Bush tax cuts .
But a louder chorus wants the rules strictly interpreted .
Many of the new lawmakers are staunch fiscal conservatives .
The “ Blue Dog Democrats ” , a congressional group that pushes for budget discipline , now has 44 members and a powerful voice .
The tussle over PAYGO is the opening salvo of a debate that will define the new Congress .
The fiscal hawks will argue that political success depends on the Democrats ' fiscal responsibility , a claim the party 's left is already disputing .
Paul Krugman , a prominent commentator , recently argued that deficit reduction was economically sensible but politically futile .
The lesson of the Bush presidency , he says , is that the fruits of fiscal prudence are squandered by subsequent irresponsibility .
Democrats ought not to make the mess worse , but should not forswear their own policy priorities to improve it .
With luck , the hawks will prevail .

Do we need to be foolish when funny ?
Do we have to be serious when wise ?
NO !
Very little of this website is of my own creation , but I hope this collection of jokes , quotations and silly stuff can cheer up your day and even give some inspiration as well .
I am fascinated by Buddhism and the cheerfulness of the great Tibetan Masters , their deep insights are always combined with fun stories and humor .
My great example in life is Holiness the Dalai Lama .
He can engage in an extremely serious discussion on death or the repression of the Tibetan people , but he will still regularly crack jokes and burst out in laughter .
Now that is the kind of wisdom which is able to see the relativity of life .
This relativity in life is badly needed , when we look at the frustrations of war , politics and natural disasters , it is good to generate compassion , but one should not become depressed in the process .
Hope you have fun , but also some deep thoughts ....
With love and fun ,

THE ECONOMICS OF WAR
David Friedman , Ph. D .
" The science of war is moving live men like blocks . "
Stephen Vincent Benet
John Brown's Body
To most non-economists , economics has something to do with money , and the economics of war presumably has to do with how we pay for the bombs and bullets .
Economists have different and broader ideas of what their field is ; my own favorite definition is that economics is that approach to understanding human behavior which starts from the assumption that individuals have objectives and tend to choose the correct way to achieve them .
From this standpoint , the potential subject matter is all of human behavior ( some of my colleagues would include animal behavior as well ) and the only test of whether behavior is or is not economic is the ability of our basic assumption to explain or predict it .
Given such a broad definition of economics , one might almost say that all of warfare reduces to the technical problem of making guns that will shoot and the economic problem of getting someone to shoot them , preferably in the right direction .
Board games , strategic simulations and popular articles tend to emphasize the technical problems ãhow far a tank will shoot , what kind of armor it will go through and how many tanks ( or knights or hoplites ) each side has ; they generally take it for granted that the playing pieces will go where they are moved .
In real battles they frequently do not .
The economic problem is why they do not and what can be done about it .
Economics assumes that individuals have objectives .
We do not know all of the objectives that any individual has , but we do know that for most of us , staying alive is high on the list .
The general commanding an army and the soldier in the front line have , in one sense , the same objectives .
Both want their side to win , and both want both of them to survive the battle .
The soldier , however , is likely to rank his own survival a good deal higher and the general 's survival a good deal lower in importance than the general does .
One consequence of that disagreement is that the general may rationally tell the soldier to do something and the soldier may rationally not do it .
Neither is necessarily making a mistake ; each may be correctly perceiving how to achieve his ends .
Consider a simple case .
You are one of a line of men on foot with long spears ; you are being charged by men on horses , also carrying spears ( and swords and maces and ... ) .
You have a simple choice : you can stand and fight or you can run away .
If everyone runs away , the line collapses and most of you get killed ; if everyone stands , you have a good chance of stopping the charge and surviving the battle .
Obviously you should stand .
It is not so obvious .
I have described the consequences if everyone runs or everyone stands , but you are not everyone ; all you control is whether you run or fight .
If you are in a large army , your decision to run will only very slightly weaken it .
If you run and everyone else fights and wins , some of them will be killed and you will not .
If you run and everyone else fights and loses , at least they will slow down the attack ãgiving you some chance of getting away .
If everyone runs and you stand to fight , you will certainly be killed ; if everyone runs and you run first , you at least have a chance of getting away .
It follows that whatever everyone else is going to do , unless you believe that your running away will have a significant effect on who wins ( unlikely with large armies ) , you are better off running .
Everyone follows this argument , everyone runs , the line collapses , you lose the battle and most of you get killed .
The conclusion seems paradoxical ; I started by assuming that people want to live and correctly choose the means of doing so and ended by predicting that people will behave in a way that gets most of them killed .
But rationality is an assumption about individuals , not about groups .
Each individual , in my simple example of the economics of war , is making the correct decision about how he should act in order to keep himself alive .
It so happens that the correct decision for me ( running away ) decreases the chance of being killed for me but increases it for everyone else on my side , and similarly for everyone else 's correct decision ; individually , each of us is better off ( given what everyone else is doing ) than if he stood and fought , but we are all worse off than we would be if each of us had failed to reach the correct conclusion and we had all stood and fought .
If this still seems paradoxical to you , consider a more homely example ãan economic problem that occurs twice a day two blocks from where I am sitting .
The scene is the intersection of Wilshire and Westwood , said to be the busiest in the world .
The time is rush hour .
As the light on Wilshire goes green , the traffic surges forward .
As it turns yellow , a last few cars try to make it across .
Since Wilshire is packed with cars , they fail and end up in the intersection , blocking the cars on Westwood , which now have a green light .
Gradually the cars in the intersection make it across , allowing the traffic on Westwood to surge forward ãjust as the light changes again , trapping another batch of cars in the intersection .
If drivers on both streets refrained from entering an intersection unless there was clearly enough room for them on the far side , the jam would not occur , traffic would flow faster and they would all get where they are going sooner ãwhich is presumably their objective .
Yet each individual driver is behaving rationally .
My aggressive driving on Wilshire benefits me ( I may make it across before the light changes , and at worst I will get far enough into the intersection not to be blocked by cars going the other way at the next stage of the jam ) and harms drivers on Westwood ; your aggressive driving on Westwood benefits you and harms drivers ( possibly including me ) on Wilshire .
The harm is much larger than the benefit , so on net we are all worse off .
But I receive all of the benefit and none of the harm from the particular decision I control .
I am correctly choosing the action that best achieves my objective ã but if we all made a mistake and drove less aggressively , we would all be better off .
I am not saying that rationality implies selfishness ãthat is a parody of economics .
Drivers may value other people 's time as well as their own , or they may value a self - image that requires them to act in a polite and considerate way ; if so , rational behavior ( in pursuit of those goals ) may prevent the jam instead of causing it .
The " paradox " is not that rational behavior always leads to undesirable results ãit does not .
In the two cases I have described , it does .
What is paradoxical is that the results are undesirable in terms of precisely the same objectives ( staying alive in the one case and getting home earlier in the other ) that the individual behavior is correctly calculated to achieve .
Let us now return to the battlefield , replacing spears with guns .
One of the less well - known facts about modern warfare is that in combat a substantial percentage of the soldiers ( almost four - fifths , according to one source ) do not fire their guns and those that do frequently do not aim them ; this is one of the reasons that about 100,000 bullets are fired for every enemy killed .
Such behavior seems irrational from the standpoint of the army ãsoldiers are given guns in order that they may shoot the enemy with them ãbut it may be entirely rational from the standpoint of the soldier .
It is difficult to hide in a foxhole and take a carefully aimed shot at the enemy at the same time .
If you can see him , he may be able to see you , and if you are taking the time to aim at him , you may be giving him , or his buddy , a chance to aim at you .
If your objective is to stay alive , there is much to be said for climbing into a convenient hole and firing your gun , if at all , in the general direction of the enemy .
In discussing my first example , I pointed out that the desirability of running away depended , among other things , on how likely you thought your defection was to make your side lose the battle .
The same argument applies here .
At one extreme , consider a " battle " with one man on each side ; hiding in a hole and firing random shots is not a sensible way of getting through it alive .
At the other extreme , consider a battle with massed armies of tens of thousands of men , all shooting at each other at once .
Whether you fight or hide is very unlikely to affect the outcome , so the sensible thing to do is to hide ãassuming , as is usually the case , that the lives of your fellow soldiers are very much less valuable to you than your own .
Many real battles represent an intermediate situation .
How hard you fight is unlikely to affect who wins the battle , but it may well affect the particular part of the battle immediately around you .
In such a case , the soldier must decide which of his alternatives is less likely to get him killed .
The more influence he believes his actions will have on the outcome of the fight , the more likely he is to shoot instead of hiding .
I recently came across an interesting fact that fits quite neatly into this economic prediction .
A study of the behavior of G.I.'s in World War II found that the soldiers most likely to fire their weapons were those carrying B.A.R.πs ( Browning Automatic Rifles ) .
A B.A.R. is a substantially more powerful weapon than an ordinary rifle ; the decision to fight or hide by the man carrying it is more likely to determine what happens on his part of the battlefield ãand hence whether his position is overrun and he is killed ãthan the decision to fight or hide by other members of the squad .
So far I have discussed the economic problem of war without saying anything about solutions .
Obviously I am not the first person in history to realize that soldiers sometimes run away , or even the first to suggest that they do so , not because they are struck with some mysterious panic , but as a sensible response to the circumstances they find themselves in .
Commanders throughout history have been confronted with the problem and have come up with a variety of ways to make it in the interest of their soldiers to fight and , if possible , in the interest of the enemy soldiers to run away .
One solution has become proverbial .
You march your army across a bridge , line it up for the battle with a river ( hopefully unswimmable ) behind it , then burn the bridge .
Since there is now nowhere to run to , much of the argument for running away disappears .
Of course , if you lose the battle , you all get killed .
This is called burning your bridges behind you .
Another solution is to punish soldiers who run away .
One way is to have a second line of soldiers whose job is to kill any member of the first line who runs .
This unfortunately ties up quite a lot of your army ; if the front line all gets killed , the second line runs away , unless there is a third line to kill them for doing so .
A less expensive ( but also less effective ) solution is to keep track of who runs away and hang them after the battle .
In order for this to work , you have to have a pretty good chance of winning the battle , or at least surviving it with your command structure intact ; an army that has just been routed is unlikely to have time to punish the soldiers who ran first .
This suggests one reason why some commanders are so much more successful than others ; once a commander has won a few battles , his soldiers expect him to win the next one .
If the battle is going to be won , it is prudent not to run away ãand since nobody runs away , the battle is won .
This is what is called a self - fulfilling prophecy .
A French military theorist , Ardant du Pica , argued that the traditional picture of a charge , in which the charging column smashes into the defending line , is mythical .
At some point in a real charge , either the column decides that the line is not going to run and stops , or the line decides that the column is not going to stop , and runs .
This brings me to the much - maligned British army of the eighteenth century , We all learn in elementary school about the foolish British , who dressed up their troops in bright scarlet uniforms and lined them up in rigid formations for the brave American revolutionaries to shoot at .
The assumption ( as in the nationalistic histories of most nations ) is that we were smart and they were dumb and that explains it all .
I am in no sense an expert in eighteenth - century military history , but I think I have a more plausible explanation .
The British troops were armed with short - range muskets and bayonets , hence the relevant decision for them , as for the spearmen of a few centuries before , was to fight or to run .
In order to make sure they fought , their commanders had to be able to see if someone was starting to run ; rigid geometric formations and bright uniforms are a sensible way of doing so .
Bright uniforms serve the same purpose in another way as well ãthey make it more difficult for soldiers who run away to hide from the victorious enemy , and thus decrease the gain from running away .
Of course the fugitive can always take off his uniform , assuming he has enough time ( perhaps that was why they had so many buttons ) , but young men running around the countryside in their underwear are almost as conspicuous as soldiers in red uniforms .
Why does the range of weapons matter ?
With short - range weapons , the choice is fight or run ; if you try to hide in a hole , someone will eventually come over and stick a spear in you .
With long - range weapons , running away is hazardous , but warfare is much more likely to involve an extended exchange of fire from fixed positions , so if you hide ( and enough other people on your side fight ) , the enemy may never get close enough to kill you .
So far all of the solutions I have discussed involve raising the cost of running away by penalizing it in one way or another .
An alternative approach is to change the objectives of the fighters .
If the most important thing to you is not surviving the battle but dying gloriously , the incentive to run away disappears ãalthough it may be replaced by an incentive to die gloriously in some stupid attack that loses the battle for your side .
A set of objectives that ranks glory and heroism far above mere survival is a popular theme of heroic literature and frequently appears in descriptions of exotic foreign warriors , preferably " barbarian , " but it is not very common in the real world .
While I have no statistics on the subject , I do have an interesting anecdote .
One of the most famous of heroic warrior cultures was the Norse ; the ideals of Viking warriors certainly ranked heroic death far above cowardly survival .
For the operation of those ideals in the real world , I give you the following story ; the source ( which tells it in somewhat more detail ) is Njal Saga :
Sigurd , the Jarl of the Orkneys , had a raven banner of which it was said that as long as it flew , the army would always advance , but whatever man carried it would die .
At the battle of Clontarf , Sigurd led part of an army of Irish and Vikings against an Irish army commanded by the High King of Ireland .
The fighting was heavy ; Sigurd 's forces advanced but the banner - carrier was killed .
Another man took the banner ; he too was killed .
Sigurd told a third man to take the banner .
The third man refused .
Sigurd , after trying to get someone else to carry it , took the banner off the staff , tied it around his waist and led his army into battle .
The army advanced , Sigurd was killed .
No one would take up the banner , and the battle was lost .
So even in an army of Vikings , there were only three men ( counting the Jarl ) who were willing to give their lives for victory .
The desire for a hero 's death is not the only objective that can keep soldiers from running away .
If the soldier puts a high value on the cause he is fighting for or on the lives of his comrades , he may decide that even a small increase in the chance of losing the battle is too high a price to pay for an improved chance of his own survival .
Alternatively , if the soldier puts a high value on his own reputation for courage , the shame of being seen to run away ãeven the shame of knowing he once ran away ãmay be sufficient to make him fight .
Feelings of comradeship and an extraordinary emphasis on personal courage are sentiments traditionally associated with soldiers , and a wise commander will encourage them .
Perhaps the most famous historical example of this solution is a Theban military unit called the Sacred Band .
It was said to consist of pairs of homosexual lovers .
Since no man would abandon his lover or show cowardice in his presence , the Sacred Band never ran .
Eventually they encountered Philip of Macedon and died to a man .
This illustrates one disadvantage of courage as a solution ; just as with burning your bridges behind you , the results are unpleasant when you lose .
So far I have discussed the problem from the point of view of the commander of the army that might run away .
The conflict of interest between the individual soldier and the army of which he is a part is also a subject of considerable interest to the opposing commander .
In playing a war game , one must actually destroy the other player 's units .
In fighting a war , it is sufficient to create a situation in which the members of a particular unit find it in their interest to run ; having done so , one then goes on to the next unit .
I conjecture that a considerable part of generalship is the ability to exploit the conflict of interest between the enemy soldiers and the army they make up .
One of my hobbies for many years has been the Society for Creative Anachronism , a group that does various medieval things for fun , including medieval hand - to - hand combat done as a rather rough sport .
In order not to get anyone killed , we tend to use real armor and fake weapons ; the latter are mostly made out of rattan , with reasonably realistic weight and balance but no cutting edge .
The rules are supposed to define the winner as the person who would have survived the fight if both armor and weapons were real .
In practice there are many difficulties , not the least being that nobody really knows how hard you have to hit chain mail with a medieval sword in order to kill the man wearing the mail .
We also do group fighting ; the largest of the annual wars features armies of three or four hundred fighters on each side .
The group fighting suffers from a fundamental flaw .
Since being " killed " means at worst a bruise , everyone is a hero ; units almost never surrender , and individual fighters never run away ( except to find another fight elsewhere on the field ) .
The battles are great fun , but considered as experimental archaeology , they are a failure ; they omit one of the most essential features of real medieval battles .
There is one exception .
I once participated in a melee tournament ( a melee is a group fight ) under rules that did , to some extent , recreate the conflict of interest between the individual and the army .
The tournament consisted of a series of melees with randomly chosen teams .
After each melee the fighters on the winning side received points according to their condition ; an uninjured fighter received the most points , a fighter who died ( but whose side won ) received the fewest .
At the end of the day , the fighter with the most points won .
Under such a system , the fighter has an incentive to help his side win , but he also has an incentive to let someone else get killed in the front line while he bravely defends the rear .
If we fought such tourneys more often , and if the winners received sufficiently valuable prizes , we might learn more about how medieval armies really worked .
This is supposed to be a book about the warfare of the future , but so far I have talked about the present and the past .
My justification for doing so is that so far , at least , the economics of war ãin the sense in which I use the term economics ãhas been much more stable than its technology .
There has been enormous progress in weaponry over the last few millennia , but the economic problem is essentially the same , the only important change being the substitution of hiding for running as a result of the increased range of our weapons .
It is possible that all this will change in the future ; one can imagine a robot battlefield on which all of the problems are technical .
In some respects we already have that ; I presume that a soldier manning an ICBM is safer inside the silo firing the missile than running across the landscape as the warheads fall .
But then , the same thing may well have been true eight hundred years ago for the soldier firing a trebuchet at a besieged castle .
It remains the case now as then that a lot of soldiering involves a sharp conflict between the interest of the soldier and the interest of the soldiers , and it is likely to remain the case at least as long as the human brain continues to be a better weapons - control mechanism than anything else we can put in that small a box .
About Project Pterosaur
Mission Statement
The goal of Project Pterosaur is to mount an expedition to locate and bring back to the United States living specimens of pterosaurs or their fertile eggs , which will be displayed in a Pterosaur Rookery that will be the center piece of the planned Fellowship Creation Science Museum and Research Institute ( FCSMRI ) .
Furthermore , the rookery facility will establish a breeding colony of pterosaurs in order to produce specimens that could then be put on display by other regional institutions or church groups .
By doing all this , we hope to accomplish three goals :
Support Creation
Theory by showing the incorrectness of the philosophy of Evolutionism .
Educate the population about Creation Science .
Create excitement about Creation and the Bible in the public .
I ( Dr. Paley ) am the founder and Chief Officer of the project .
I will also be leading the expedition and acting as Science Liaison to the public .
Funding is being provided by Fellowship University , the Fairlight Institute , and donations from wealthy Christian businessmen who wish to remain anonymous at this time .
Why Look For Living Pterosaurs ?
Kids love pterosaurs !
Once Project Pterosaur is complete , children 's eyes will be opened to the wonder of Creation .

Once Project Pterosaur is complete , children 's eyes will be opened to the wonder of Creation .
Evolutionists have engaged in a propaganda campaign to trick the public into falsely believing that the Earth is billions of years old and that many animals which lived side - by - side with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden actually died millions of years before humans were created ( or " evolved " in their twisted view . )
By finding and displaying living examples of what the Evolutionists claim is impossible , we will sow the seeds of Evolutionism doubt , thereby making the public receptive to the truth of the Bible .
While there are other extant creatures which Evolutionists claim have gone extinct long before man , they are not as ideal for our purposes as pterosaurs .
Some of the alternatives are :
Apatosaurs : Still live in the jungles of the Congo .
They are too large for our planned facilities ( and especially for those of the church groups who would wish to borrow them ) and breeding would be difficult given their presumably longer life cycle .

Plesiosaurs :
Are reported living in many lakes and their carcasses have been found in the oceans by fishermen .
However , they are notoriously difficult to find alive and would require a large and expensive aquatic facility to display them .

Velociraptors : Today terrorize the goat herders of Puerto Rico and are rumored to guard the remains of the Ark on Mt. Ararat .
They have become vicious since the Fall as the result of the effects of genetic entropy , making them too dangerous for the sort of interactive public experience we have in mind .
In comparison , pterosaurs are a blessing from the Lord : Many reported living species are of reasonable size , making housing and care affordable ; although they 've become carnivorous , they should be as trainable as the birds of prey commonly allowed to interact with zoo visitors during bird shows ; their life cycle appears to be relatively short , making it easier to establish a productive breeding program ; and finally , historical and modern reports of pterosaurs are much more common than any of the other Evolutionistically anomalous cryptids , suggesting that large populations are waiting to be revealed to our increasingly unbelieving world .
Project Outline :
To better understand the project , please study the following chronological outline .
By the Grace of the Lord , if all goes according to plan , we should have completed Phase III before this decade is out .

Pterosaur Research
For a general overview of pterosaur research with links to more technical literature , see :
Pterosaurs : An Introduction , By Dr. Richard Paley
The Expedition
After the spiritual and cultural renewal it will lead to , the second most exciting part of Project Pterosaur is the expedition .
It is during this phase that we will go into the wild and see what the Lord has to reveal to us .
What species of pterosaur will He grace us with ?
What challenges will He put us through so that we may grow both as Creation Scientists and as Christians ?
The unknown awaits us , but we are guided by Faith to see that the Glory of His Creation is shown to the world .
The media coverage possibilities of this cannot be understated .
Potential Expedition Sites
Our current focus for expedition sites is in Sub -Saharan Africa , where numerous modern pterosaur sightings have been reported .
This dark continent holds many secrets , and its large , unexplored wildernesses could easily hide pterosaur colonies .
The area is reachable on wing from both Northeastern Africa -- which was home to the saraph pterosaurs of the Bible -- and with Mt. Ararat -- from which all postdiluvian life , including pterosaurs , was dispersed -- making it an obvious area to search for extant pterosaurs .
Furthermore , I have experience in the region from my 2002 expedition to find living Apatosaurs .
Another reason to choose Africa is that our expedition will have competition in the next most promising pterosaur location , Papua New Guinea .
Dr. Carl Baugh of the Creation Evidence Museum has already led expeditions to PNG , and has found evidences of two types of pterosaurs there .
He has secured permits from the local government to capture four living specimens and export them to the states as soon as he finds the funding .
Also , Jonathan David Whitcomb has led PNG expeditions and collected local accounts and sightings of the so - called " Ropen , " which he has recounted in his book Searching for Ropens and Finding God .
There is , of course , nothing wrong with friendly competition , and we would like to be the first to bring back this incredible testimony to Creation .
However , we do n't wish to claim jump on Dr. Baugh , so we 'll leave Papua New Guinea to him and his museum 's team .
I would say " May the best Creation Scientist win , " but when either team finds pterosaurs , we 'll all be winners .
( While one might think that sites in the Americas -- which have been home to modern pterosaur sightings , as well as many ancient accounts by native groups -- would be better places to hold the expedition since they would be closer to home , there are mitigating factors that lead us to look elsewhere :
All American reports have been of very large pterodactyloid specimens , so large that it would be cost - prohibitive for us to house and care for them , if we could even manage to capture and bring back a pair .
This would also rule out our plans for an inter-Church specimen loan program , which plays an important part in our cultural confrontation and renewal phase .
Furthermore , there have n't been any reliable sightings since the late Nineteenth century , suggesting that the populations may have gone extinct .
Thus , we feel that our best chances lie abroad .
However , we will follow up on any reports and evaluate whether to mount a less costly photographic expedition to provide further evidences for our Creation Science Museum . )
Our preliminary list of expedition sites we are considering in Africa is as follows :
Candidate Sites Gashaka - Gumti National Park , Nigeria :
This remote and mountainous park is large ( over 4000 square miles ) and mostly unexplored , except by the few natives who live within its borders .
On the park 's southern boundary lies the highest peak in Nigeria , the 7936 ft. Chappal Waddi ( " Mountain of Death " ) .
This peak is near the border with Cameroon , where eagle - sized rhamphorhynchoid pterosaurs locally called olitiau have been reported .
It is likely that the pterosaur population reaches into Gashaka - Gumti , as the cliffs of Chappal Waddi would provide an excellent roosting habitat and the park 's many mountain forests would keep them fed with fresh monkeys .
Mt. Kilimanjaro , Tanzania :
There have been numerous sightings of pterosaurs circling Mt. Kilimanjaro , the tallest mountain in Africa .
It is likely that they roost among its steep , inaccessible cliffs .
Although reports are unclear , the pterosaurs are probably pterodactyloid , as their larger size will help protect them from the colder climate .
However , it is likely that allied rhamphorhynchoid kinds could be found at lower elevations .
Technical note : choice of this location will require mountain climbing gear and hiring of experienced alpinists .
West Lunga National Park , Zambia : Northwestern Zambia was the source of the first modern African pterosaur reports to reach civilization in the 1920s .
West Lunga National
Park is in the same area as those reports ( the Mwinilunga District ) and has many swamps , which are the natural habitat of the native kongamato pterosaurs .
The park is relatively isolated and much undisturbed wildlife can be found there .
Ghana : Local legends confirm the existence here of a pterodactyloid creature called the sasabonsam and it is likely that smaller rhamphorhynchoids could also be found .
Ghana is home to many heavily forested parks that could contain pterosaurs .
Kakum National Park , with its network of forest canopy walkways allowing greater pterosaur spotting opportunities , is the most attractive from a pterosaurlogical perspective .
However , we are also considering Bui National Park , both for it 's biomic compatibility with pterosaur - like bat populations and since Halliburton is building a hydroelectric dam there .
Halliburton 's presence means we can expect better access opportunities through the synergy of private sector and faithbased US government initiatives .
Local Contacts
In order to organize an expedition of this magnitude , we need contacts in the region to help us secure necessary travel and exportation permits , provisions , personnel , and , most importantly , information .
If you are from any of the regions being considered and would like to help us , or have information about another region that you think would be of interest to the project , please contact me at : richardpaley@objectiveministries.org .
Protocols
A well organized expedition needs a set of guidelines on expedition goals and procedural norms so the expedition team can efficiently and morally conduct itself .
Here is our current draft :
Project Pterosaur Protocols
Our first and foremost goal is to serve the Lord and be prayerful in our actions .
Pterosaurs are not to be harmed , nor are their colonies to be unduly disrupted , so as to preserve these evidences for future generations .
If we find pterodactyloids that are too large to capture and bring back unharmed , we will instead take eggs and / or photos .
Ethnological evidences of latent Biblical knowledge in native cultures from before the Tower of Babel incident should be recorded for use in study and museum displays .
Non-Christian natives encountered should be made to know the Word and of the Saving Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ .
A Missiological Technician will accompany the expedition to witness and perform Baptisms as necessary .
Personnel
Assembling a team is very important .
While this is true of any expedition of this scope , there are certain technical needs specific to our expedition that merit special attention .
Most obviously , we need a pterosaurologist to help identify the living specimens in relation to Flood remains and Biblical accounts .
While not strictly necessary in the field , it would be helpful to have both an Intelligent Design theoretician and a baraminologist to assess in situ the specified complexity and baraminicity of any specimens we find .
As mentioned in our protocols , we also need a missiological technician to take care of spiritual matters while the rest of the team is focused on pterosaurs .
And finally we need someone with testimonial experience to document the expedition for use in live field reports and later TV specials .
Here is a chart of the personnel positions and those currently agreeing to participate :

Fellowship Church ) Medical / Veterinary Field Doctor Position not filled Tracker Position not filled Videographer / Documentarian Position not filled Local Guides & Assorted Porters
To be hired on location
I have also contacted " Johnny " Kimbuso , my African guide from my last expedition , to see if he would be willing to help .
It was he who managed to take the picture of the apatosaur we uncovered .
Hopefully , I can convince him to join me again on another Creation Science adventure , although he still suffers trauma from his close encounter with the charging dinosaur .
If you would like to submit a resume , e-mail it to richardpaley@objectiveministries.org .
( To avoid problems from past expeditions , background checks will be performed on all expedition members to ensure that they are good , upstanding Christians . )
Equipment & Supplies
Besides supplies that are common to all animal capture expeditions , we have determined that we need the following special equipment :
Metallic pterosaur effigies based on Biblical designs ( for herding into traps . )
Frankincense smoker ( to disorientate the animals for capture . )
Nets , including large butterfly - style nets for use on smaller rhamphorhynchi .
Calming hoods ( designed based on Deluge - era pterosaur skull remains . )
Reinforced bird cages .
Climate controlled egg transport containers .
Technical note : the Project Pterosaur logo should be placed prominently on all equipment where possible so as to promote the project name and associated educational and witnessing programs with the dissemination of expedition images .
We will be consulting with logo placement experts from NASCAR for technical assistance .
Tracking The Expedition Progress & Educational Programs
As per our outline , we will be using the excitement surrounding the expedition as the " hook " for much of the media campaign , which we will then be able to translate into an opportunity to both educate and witness .
Because of this , it is important for us to document the expedition to allow the public to feel as though they were right there with us , experiencing the majesty and awe of seeing one of God 's most magnificent Creations for the first time .
When we start the expedition , we plan to allow our website visitors and students from schools and homeschool groups to track our progress almost in real - time using our PteroCam .
We will also promote the expedition and later the museum through the use of a mascot , created by Peggy Miller , called Pteva the Pterodactyl .
Merchandise , coloring books , and educational cartoons featuring Pteva will be sold in the museum gift shoppe and through licensing agreements world wide , helping to provide additional funding .
Younger children will be able to enroll in our Junior Pterosaur Ptrackers program , which will provide them with pterosaur literature , special gear , and behind the scenes information .
They will also be encouraged to keep an eye out for pterosaurs in their neighborhood , because you never know if a Quetzalcoatlus might fly over your back yard !
Be sure to check out our Pteva Flying Automata !
Excellent Creation Science educational tool to prepare Sunday School students to care for their class pterosaur once our specimen loan program is up and running ( see below ) .
Rookery and Museum
Once we secure specimens and bring them back , we will need a place to raise and display them .
We also need a facility to help explain to people what they are seeing , and deprogram them from all their years of Evolutionist propaganda .
This is where the Pterosaur Rookery and Fellowship Creation Science Museum and Research Institute come in .
( Although we have not yet begun construction of the facilities , we have extensive plans , funding , and land in the lot adjacent to Fellowship University 's parking structure . )
Pterosauriary display in Rookery courtyard will have perching tree so that visitors can view smaller pterosaur specimens in the round .

Pterosaur Rookery
The Pterosaur Rookery will be the cornerstone of the Creation Science Museum : a world - class pterosaur facility staffed by the top Christian experts in pterosaur care and husbandry ( who will be trained at the very same facility , since little is currently known about pterosaur needs ) .
The rookery will breed pterosaurs for study , conservation , and use in franchise Fellowship Creation Science Museums and our planned inter-Church specimen loan program ( see below ) .
Besides behind - the - scenes breeding and veterinary programs , the rookery will also feature specimen displays open to the public .
First stocked with our initial pterosaurian find , these pterosaur aviaries ( or pterosauriaries ) will later house many different pterosaur kinds and subkinds -- discovered from around the world by future expeditions conducted by Fellowship University -- to delight our visitors and inform them about baraminology and the effects of post - Fall genetic entropy .
Additional Rookery attractions we have planned are : a theater showing a documentary about the expedition , a trained pterosaur show , an animatronic display of pterosaur / human interaction throughout history , a collection of Deluge - era pterosaur fossils , a wandering performer in a Pteva the Pterodactyl costume to entertain children , and a gift shoppe .
Fellowship Creation Science Museum and Research Institute
The FCSMRI will go beyond just pterosaurs and will be an international center for both Creation Science research and educating the public .
Combined with the Pterosaur Rookery , the FCSMRI will be a destination for both scholars and lay vacationers alike and , unlike similar secular institutions such as the Smithsonian , it will be certified Family Friendly .
The Museum section will feature many educational displays , dioramas , and interactive kiosks aimed at making Creation accessible to all -- including the unbeliever .
Collections of Creation artifacts from around the world ( including , of course , pterosaurs ) will be put on display with interpretive guides to lead the public through the evidences to see Biblical truth .
It will also host special exhibits and educational programs for homeschoolers .
Additional Museum attractions / facilities we have planned are : an IMAX - style theater that will double as a lecture hall , a Noah 's Ark simulator ride , a pool for baptizing those convinced by the evidences into accepting Jesus Christ as their Savior , and a gift shoppe .
The Research Institute section will employ or play host to a staff of Creation researchers from such diverse fields as information theory , complexology , hydrodynamics , theobiology , and baraminology , as well as experts in the legal defense of both Creation Science and faithbased programs against anti-Christian organizations .
The goal is to become a " Creation think tank " that will help lead research into new and exciting directions , as well as help shape public policy in order to make it more amiable towards missiological works .
Specimen Loan Program
One of the goals of the Pterosaur Rookery will be to breed as many of the creatures as possible so that franchise museums -- for which we will have licensing programs -- can also put them on display , allowing people all over the country and the world to be able to experience evidences of the Lord 's creation up close and in person .
We will also offer programs to loan specimens to church groups for use in Creation Education programs , along with pterosaur experts -- whom we will train in a planned Pterosaur Handlers School -- to explain their biology and place in God 's Creation .
We will not , however , sell nor loan specimens to institutions that are Evolutionistic or of other disreputable persuasions , such the Smithsonian or the Anheuser - Busch Corporation , who would seek to use the animals to promote Evolutionism or some other form of disrespect to the Lord .
These are God 's Creations and they will be discovered by Godly people , so why should the forces of Godlessness profit by them ?
