Though Matt Wakeling seems to hate his iPhone , he loves it enough to devote a web site to ranting about it .
With FixMy3GiPhone.com , Wakeling hopes to garner enough attention regarding " horrible 3G reception of the 3G Iphone " to encourage Apple and AT&T to improve it .
He shares his negative experience with Apple customer service , and he asks other users with similar troubles to comment with their iPhone 3G reception issues .
As of this writing , about 40 users have commented with their negative experiences .
Wakeling and his following are n't alone : Hundreds of iPhone users have complained about 3 - G reception in the Apple support forums .
The problems vary .
A few readers said they can only stay on 3 - G for a few minutes before their iPhone switches over to the slower EDGE network – even in areas with rich 3 - G coverage .
Some forum users said they 're getting poor reception ( e.g. two bars ) everywhere they go .
FixMy3GiPhone.com is the second site we 've seen surface recently devoted to ranting about iPhone .
On a different iPhone - related topic , some iPhone app developers are posting their rants about Apple 's non-disclosure agreement at FuckingNDA.com .
At that site , developers post ways in which Apple 's NDA stifles them from bonding and thus producing higher quality code .

Whether it ’s sending , receiving , or a bit of both , there ’s no denying that sexting nude pictures is a mainstay in modern culture .
First of all , it needs to be said that unless you ’re a professional adult star , sending nude pictures of yourself is a surefire recipe for disaster .
You can never be sure where your pictures might end up or who might get a hold of them .
However , providing you ’re sending or receiving pictures with a trusted partner ( or even if you ’re just trying to fuck a stripper ) , a potential partner or someone you have the utmost faith in not to share your pictures elsewhere – sending Snapchat nudes can be a very liberating experience .
Here are some of the main reasons why Snapchat nudes are so addictive .
They ’re a great confidence booster
Sending a picture of you in your most intimate state is a nerve - racking but exciting experience .
You will feel slightly anxious about your partner ’s response , but the greatest feeling is when they return your picture with a compliment .
Knowing that someone else out there appreciates you in a primal , sexual way is a simple - yet - effective way to boost your confidence .
This confidence will then translate to other areas of your personality , allowing you to become a more well - rounded individual .
Likewise , simply receiving a Snapchat nude also gets the endorphins flowing .
This is because your sexting partner has chosen you to be the worthy recipient of their sexual efforts .
They ’re more “ real ”
A lot of sex therapists and experts are claiming that pornography is re-wiring the way we achieve sexual gratification .
By viewing porn , it is believed this places the viewer in a “ submissive ” state , and is thusly skewing our perception of healthy sex lives .
It is true that pornography does affect the human brain in negative ways , but only if we perceive ourselves to be “ viewers ” of such material as opposed to “ participants ” .
This is why Snapchat nudes can be so addictive to send and receive .
It ’s because they make us part of the sexual process as opposed to simply watching others act it out for us .
Exchanging Snapchat nudes does n’t affect the brain in negative ways , and in fact provides a much needed endorphin boost .
They create trust between partners
What can be more personal than giving your partner photographic evidence of you at your most primal ?
Sending or receiving a Snapchat nude creates a kind of unspoken trust between both parties .
It ’s kind of saying : I trust you enough to keep this to yourself , therefore , please do n’t abuse the privilege .
It ’s a very primal idea .
Think of Snapchat nudes as a kind of sexual contract .
They ’re not long term
The principal beauty of Snapchat nudes is that , like every beautiful thing in the world , they will eventually disappear for good .
Therefore , your pictures can be as outrageous or as explicit as you like , and you wo n’t need to worry about them being mass shared across the internet .
Knowing that there ’s an insurance policy in place to protect your livelihood allows for a satisfying feeling of freedom .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) - Poland spurned as insufficient on Friday a U.S. offer to boost its air defenses in return for basing anti-missile interceptors on its soil but said it remained open to talks with Washington .

The decision by Poland , a staunch NATO ally , is a setback for the Bush administration drive to counter perceived threats from what Washington calls “ rogue states , ” particularly Iran .
“ We have not reached a satisfactory result on the issue of increasing the level of Polish security , ” Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference after studying the latest U.S. proposal .
“ The aim of the negotiations , in my view , is to enhance the security of our country .
We still agree that it is fundamental for us to maintain our alignment with the United States , which has been , is and will continue to be our strategic ally . ”
In Washington , the State Department said it was studying Tusk ’s remarks closely .
“ Poland remains a close and important ally of the United States , ” Sean McCormack , a department spokesman , said in an e-mailed statement .
“ We remain in negotiations with Poland and do not plan to comment publicly on the details . ”
Tusk , without disclosing full details , said Washington was proposing to put Patriot batteries on Polish soil for one year .
In the months - long negotiations , Tusk ’s center - right government had sought billions of dollars worth of U.S. investment to upgrade Polish air defenses in return for hosting 10 two - stage missile interceptors .
“ We are ready to accept proposals or corrections from the American side which would include our proposal to increase ( our ) security .
We can do this in a day , a week , a month , ” Tusk said .
The Czech Republic has agreed to host a tracking radar under the project .
Its parliament has still to ratify the deal .
Russia has condemned the missile defense plan as a threat to its own security and has said it will target missiles at Poland and the Czech Republic -- its communist - era satellite states -- if the deployment goes ahead .
THREAT
“ If the threat related to the shield indeed increases , then we need elements such as Patriots on Polish territory , and not just for one year , ” Tusk said , adding that the problem was not a question of money .
Political analysts said Tusk ’s rebuff to Washington demonstrated a new Polish self - confidence on the global stage .
Warsaw is one of Washington ’s firmest allies in the region and has troops serving alongside its ally in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ This is the first time that Poland has said ‘ no ’ to the U.S. ...
It certainly sends a signal to Washington that Poland ’s support should not be taken for granted in any circumstances , ” said Pawel Swieboda , head of demosEuropa , a Warsaw think tank .
“ But it is also the case that the government greatly raised expectations and that these were never very realistic .
Poland does need some compensation ( for hosting the interceptors ) but they went too far in demanding Patriots . ”
Polish President Lech Kaczynski , a right - wing opponent of the Tusk government and a strong supporter of the shield plan , is now likely to step up his attacks on the government .
But analysts said the domestic political fallout would be limited as Polish voters are largely hostile to the project .
Washington has said it wants
Poland to host the interceptors but that it would look elsewhere if Warsaw declines to take part .
The Baltic republic of Lithuania , northeast of Poland , has been suggested as an alternative site for the interceptors .

THERE are vast amounts of water on earth .
Unfortunately , over 97 % of it is too salty for human consumption and only a fraction of the remainder is easily accessible in rivers , lakes or groundwater .
Climate change , droughts , growing population and increasing industrial demand are straining the available supplies of fresh water .
More than 1 billion people live in areas where water is scarce , according to the United Nations , and that number could increase to 1.8 billion by 2025 .
One time - tested but expensive way to produce drinking water is desalination : removing dissolved salts from sea and brackish water .
Its appeal is obvious .
The world 's oceans , in particular , present a virtually limitless and drought - proof supply of water .
“ If we could ever competitively — at a cheap rate — get fresh water from salt water , ” observed President John Kennedy nearly 50 years ago , “ that would be in the long - range interest of humanity , and would really dwarf any other scientific accomplishment . ”
According to the latest figures from the International Desalination Association , there are now 13,080 desalination plants in operation around the world .
Together they have the capacity to produce up to 55.6 m cubic metres of drinkable water a day — a mere 0.5 % of global water use .
About half of the capacity is in the Middle East .
Because desalination requires large amounts of energy and can cost several times as much as treating river or groundwater , its use in the past was largely confined to wealthy oil - rich nations , where energy is cheap and water is scarce .
But now things are changing .
As more parts of the world face prolonged droughts or water shortages , desalination is on the rise .
In California alone some 20 seawater - desalination plants have been proposed , including a $ 300 m facility near San Diego .
Several Australian cities are planning or constructing huge desalination plants , with the biggest , near Melbourne , expected to cost about $ 2.9 billion .
Even London is building one .
According to projections from Global Water Intelligence , a market - research firm , worldwide desalination capacity will nearly double between now and 2015 .
Not everyone is happy about this .
Some environmental groups are concerned about the energy the plants will use , and the greenhouse gases they will spew out .
A large desalination plant can suck up enough electricity in one year to power more than 30,000 homes .
The good news is that advances in technology and manufacturing have reduced the cost and energy requirements of desalination .
And many new plants are being held to strict environmental standards .
One recently built plant in Perth , Australia , runs on renewable energy from a nearby wind farm .
In addition , its modern seawater - intake and waste - discharge systems minimise the impact on local marine life .
Jason Antenucci , deputy director of the Centre for Water Research at the University of Western Australia in Perth , says the facility has “ set a benchmark for other plants in Australia . ”
References to removing salt from seawater can be found in stories and legends dating back to ancient times .
But the first concerted efforts to produce drinking water from seawater were not until the 16th century , when European explorers on long sea voyages began installing simple desalting equipment on their ships for emergency use .
These devices tended to be crude and inefficient , and boiled seawater above a stove or furnace .
An important advance in desalination came from the sugar industry .
To produce crystalline sugar , large amounts of fuel were needed to heat the sugar sap and evaporate the water it contained .
Around 1850 an American engineer named Norbert Rillieux won several patents for a way to refine sugar more efficiently .
His idea became what is known today as multiple - effect distillation , and consists of a cascading system of chambers , each at a lower pressure than the one before .
This means the water boils at a lower temperature in each successive chamber .
Heat from water vapour in the first chamber can thus be recycled to evaporate water in the next chamber , and so on .
No salt , please
This reduced the energy consumption of sugar refining by up to 80 % , says James Birkett of West Neck Strategies , a desalination consultancy based in Nobleboro , Maine .
But it took about 50 years for the idea to make its way from one industry to another .
Only in the late 19th century did multi-effect evaporators for desalination begin to appear on steamships and in arid countries such as Yemen and Sudan .
A few multi-effect distillation plants were built in the first half of the 20th century , but a flaw in the system hampered its widespread adoption .
Mineral deposits tended to build up on heat - exchange surfaces , and this inhibited the transfer of energy .
In the 1950s a new type of thermal - desalination process , called multi-stage flash , reduced this problem .
In this , seawater is heated under high pressure and then passed through a series of chambers , each at a lower pressure than the one before , causing some of the water to evaporate or “ flash ” at each step .
Concentrated seawater is left at the bottom of the chambers , and freshwater vapour condenses above .
Because evaporation does not happen on the heat - exchange surfaces , fewer minerals are deposited .
Countries in the Middle East with a lot of oil and a little water soon adopted multi-stage flash .
Because it needs hot steam , many desalination facilities were put next to power stations , which generate excess heat .
For a time , the cogeneration of electricity and water dominated the desalination industry .
Research into new ways to remove salt from water picked up in the 1950s .
The American government set up the Office of Saline Water to support the search for desalination technology .
And scientists at the University of Florida and the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) began to investigate membranes that are permeable to water , but restrict the passage of dissolved salts .
Such membranes are common in nature .
When there is a salty solution on one side of a semi- permeable membrane ( such as a cell wall ) , and a less salty solution on the other , water diffuses through the membrane from the less concentrated side to the more concentrated side .
This process , which tends to equalise the saltiness of the two solutions , is called osmosis .
Researchers wondered whether osmosis could be reversed by applying pressure to the more concentrated solution , causing water molecules to diffuse through the membrane and leave behind even more highly concentrated brine .
Initial efforts showed only limited success , producing tiny amounts of fresh water .
That changed in 1960 , when Sidney Loeb and Srinivasa Sourirajan of UCLA hand - cast their own membranes from cellulose acetate , a polymer used in photographic film .
Their new membranes boasted a dramatically improved flux ( the rate at which water molecules diffuse through a membrane of a given size ) leading , in 1965 , to a small “ reverse osmosis ” plant for desalting brackish water in Coalinga , California .
The energy requirements for thermal desalination do not much depend on the saltiness of the source water , but the energy needed for reverse osmosis is directly related to the concentration of dissolved salts .
The saltier the water , the higher the pressure it takes ( and hence the more energy you need ) to push water through a membrane in order to leave behind the salt .
Seawater generally contains 33 - 37 grams of dissolved solids per litre .
To turn it into drinking water , nearly 99 % of these salts must be removed .
Because brackish water contains less salt than seawater , it is less energy - intensive , and thus less expensive , to process .
As a result , reverse osmosis first became established as a way to treat brackish water .
Another important distinction is that reverse osmosis , unlike thermal desalination , calls for extensive pre-treatment of the feed water .
Reverse - osmosis plants use filters and chemicals to remove particles that could clog up the membranes , and the membranes must also be washed periodically to reduce scaling and fouling .
Getting better all the time
In the late 1970s John Cadotte of America 's Midwest Research Institute and the FilmTec Corporation created a much - improved membrane by using a special cross-linking reaction between two chemicals atop a porous backing material .
His composite membrane consisted of a very thin layer of polyamide , to perform the separation , and a sturdy support beneath it .
Thanks to the membrane 's improved water flux , and its ability to tolerate pH and temperature variations , it went on to dominate the industry .
At around the same time , the first reverse - osmosis plants for seawater began to appear .
These early plants needed a lot of energy .
The first big municipal seawater plant , which began operating in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , in 1980 , required more than 8 kilowatt hours ( kWh ) to produce one cubic metre of drinking water .
The energy consumption of such plants has since fallen dramatically , thanks in large part to energy - recovery devices .
High - pressure pumps force seawater against a membrane , which is typically arranged in a spiral inside a tube , to increase the surface area exposed to the incoming water and optimise the flux through the membrane .
About half of the water emerges as freshwater on the other side .
The remaining liquid , which contains the leftover salts , shoots out of the system at high pressure .
If that high - pressure waste stream is run through a turbine or rotor , energy can be recovered and used to pressurise the incoming seawater .
The energy - recovery devices in the 1980s were only about 75 % efficient , but newer ones can recover about 96 % of the energy from the waste stream .
As a result , the energy use for reverse - osmosis seawater desalination has fallen .
The Perth plant , which uses technology from Energy Recovery , a firm based in California , consumes only 3.7kWh to produce one cubic metre of drinking water , according to Gary Crisp , who helped to oversee the plant 's design for the Water Corporation , a local utility .
Thermal plants suck up nearly as much electricity , but also need large amounts of steam .
“ A thermal plant only is practical if you can build it in such a way that it can take advantage of very low - cost or waste heat , ” says Tom Pankratz , a water consultant based in Texas , who is also a board member of the International Desalination Association .
Economies of scale , better membranes and improved energy - recovery have helped to bring down the cost of reverse - osmosis seawater - desalination .
Although the cost of desalination plants and their water depends on where they are , as well as the local costs of capital and operations , prices decreased from roughly $ 1.50 a cubic metre in the early 1990s to around 50 cents in 2003 , says Mr Pankratz .
As a result , reverse osmosis is preferred for most modern seawater - desalination ( though rising energy and commodity prices mean the cost per cubic metre has now risen to around 75 cents ) .
Experts reckon that further gains in energy efficiency , and hence cost reductions , will be increasingly difficult , however .
According to a recent report on desalination from America 's National Research Council , energy use is unlikely to be reduced by much more than 15 % below today 's levels — though that would still be worthwhile , it concludes .
Sometimes , using desalination within water management may be the only way to ensure supply .
To achieve these reductions , researchers want to find better membranes that allow water to pass through more easily and are less likely to get clogged up .
Eric
Hoek and his colleagues from UCLA , for example , have developed a membrane embedded with tiny particles containing narrow flow channels , producing a significant increase in water flux .
The membrane 's smooth surface is also expected to make it harder for bacteria to latch onto .
Depending on a plant 's design , the new membranes could reduce total energy consumption by as much as 20 % , reckons Dr Hoek .
The technology is being commercialised by NanoH2O , a company on UCLA 's campus .
Meanwhile , the possibility of making membranes out of carbon nanotubes , which consist of sheets of carbon atoms rolled up into tubes , has also garnered attention .
A study published in the journal Science in 2006 demonstrated unexpectedly high water - flow rates .
But insiders think it will be a decade before the idea is ready for commercialisation .
As desalination becomes more widespread , its environmental impacts , including the design of intake and discharge structures , are coming under increased scrutiny .
Some of the damage can be mitigated fairly easily .
Reducing the intake velocity enables most fish species and other mobile marine life to swim away from the intake system , though small animals , such as plankton or fish larvae , may still get caught in the intake screens or sucked into the plant .
Measuring the impact
A bigger problem may be the leftover brine , which typically contains twice as much salt as seawater and is discharged back into the ocean .
So far little scientific information exists about its long - term effects .
In the past , most big seawater - desalination plants were built in places that did not conduct adequate environmental assessments , says Peter Gleick , president of the Pacific Institute , a think - tank based in California that published a report on desalination in 2006 .
But as plants are built in areas with tighter environmental restrictions , more information is becoming available .
Some recent measurements from Perth are encouraging .
Initially scientists from the Centre for Water Research feared that the brine discharge from the plant would increase the saltiness of the coastal environment .
But a monitoring study found that salinity returns to normal levels within about 500 metres of the plants ' discharge units .
“ The brine discharge is a problem that can be overcome with good design , ” says Dr Antenucci .
A separate problem may be that some metals or chemicals leach into the brine .
Thermal - desalination plants are prone to corrosion , and may shed traces of heavy metals , such as copper , into the waste stream .
Reverse - osmosis plants , for their part , use chemicals during the pre-treatment and cleaning of the membranes , some of which may end up in the brine .
Modern plants , however , remove most of the chemicals from the water before it is discharged .
And new approaches to pre-treatment may reduce or eliminate the need for some chemicals .
Based on the limited evidence available to date , it appears that desalination may actually be less environmentally harmful than some other water - supply options , such as diverting large amounts of fresh water from rivers , for example , which can lead to severe reductions in local fish populations .
But uncertainties over the environmental impacts of desalination make it hard to draw definite conclusions , the National Research Council concluded .
Its report suggested that further research on the environmental impacts of desalination , and how to mitigate them , should be a high priority .
The reverse - osmosis process is increasingly being used not just for desalination , but to recycle wastewater , too .
In Orange County , California , reclaimed water is being used to replenish groundwater , and in Singapore , it is pumped into local reservoirs , which are used as a source for drinking water .
In both cases , the treated water is also available for tasting at local water - recycling facilities .
This “ toilet - to - tap ” approach may leave some people feeling queasy , but wastewater is a valuable resource , says Sabine Lattemann , a researcher at the University of Oldenburg , Germany , who studies the environmental impacts of desalination .
“ Energy demand is lower compared to desalination , ” she explains , “ and you can produce high - quality drinking water . ”
As water becomes more scarce , people will want to find several ways to secure their supplies .
Many parts of the world also have enormous scope to use water more efficiently , argues Dr Gleick — and that would be cheaper than desalination .
But sometimes , making desalination part of the approach to water management may be the only way to ensure a steady supply of drinking water .
In drought - ridden Western Australia , which ordered conservation years ago , the Water Corporation has adopted what it calls “ security through diversity ” , otherwise known in the industry as the “ portfolio ” approach .
At the moment , Perth 's residents receive about 17 % of their drinking water from seawater desalination .
Desalination makes sense as one of several water sources along with conservation , agrees Dr Antenucci .
But , he adds , “ to say it is the silver bullet is wrong . ”
Nissan's ( NSANY ) CEO , Carlos Ghosn , has once again upped the stakes in the electric car arms race .
He promises that NSANY 's electric car , scheduled to be available in 2010 , will be profitable from the outset and will have zero emissions , period :
I want a pure electric car .
I do n’t want a range extender .
I do n’t want another hybrid ...
It ’s not going to be zero emissions in certain conditions .
It ’s going to be zero emissions ....
Everything that we develop , we develop for profits ... We make money on all our cars .
We do not have loss leaders .
In a not so subtle slap at Toyota 's ( TM ) Prius and GM's Chevy Volt ( scheduled for release in 2010 as well ) , Ghosn referred to any car powered by alternative means but that still uses fossil fuels as “ unsustainable ” .
Nissan plans to be the first automaker to sell a mass - market , zero-emission vehicle in the US .

Dr Oguchi added that it is also easy to store the cells and he plans to develop a tissue bank - as long as the funding is forthcoming .
He estimates that will take a decade to achieve , but will give future scientists a range of genetic codes that can be matched to a patient to minimise the risk of transplanted organs of tissue being rejected .
PYONGYANG , North Korea ( CNN ) -- North Korea on Friday destroyed a water cooling tower at a facility where officials acknowledge they extracted plutonium to build nuclear weapons , CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour reported from the scene .
The cooling tower is demolished at the Yongbyon nuclear complex near Pyongyang , North Korea .
The massive implosion , which came at about 5 pm local time Friday at the Yongbyon facility , was intended to be a powerful public symbol of a move to end nuclear activities by the Communist nation once branded a member of an " axis of evil " by U.S. President George W. Bush .
The destruction of the highly visible symbol of North Korea 's long - secret nuclear program came just a day after the country released details of its program .
" They fired a warning flare and then in three minutes the whole thing came tumbling down in a massive cloud of smoke , " Amanpour said .
Watch Amanpour 's report from the scene . »
" There was a moment of stunned silence as the magnitude of what had happened sunk in , " Amanpour said .
U.S. State Department officials and observers from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) watched from a reviewing stand on a ridge about 1,000 yards away , she said .
" This is a very significant disablement step , " the U.S. envoy to North Korea , Sung Kim , said .
Nuclear experts say that the plant 's destroyed central water - cooling tower would take a year or longer to rebuild if North Korea were to try using the plant again .
" This is a critical piece of equipment for the nuclear reactor , " said analyst John Wolfsthal , of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , who has been following North Korea since the 1980s .
" Without this facility , the reactor can't operate and can't produce more plutonium for weapons . "
Watch the tower being demolished »
North Korea has been dismantling other parts of the facility under the watchful eyes of representatives of the five other nations , including the U.S. , that have been involved in six - party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang 's nuclear weapons program .
On Thursday , North Korean officials turned over to China a 60 - page declaration , written in English , that details several rounds of plutonium production at the Yongbyon plant dating back to 1986 .
Watch President Bush claim progress over the N. Korea nuclear issue »
In it , North Korea acknowledges producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs , according to the U.S. State Department .
In response , Bush said he would lift some U.S. sanctions against North Korea and remove the country from the State Department 's list of state sponsors of terrorism .
But he made clear that other sanctions remained in place on North Korea -- which has been on the terrorism list since its alleged involvement in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner which killed 115 people .
" The United States has no illusions about the regime in Pyongyang , " Bush said .
" We remain deeply concerned about North Korea 's human rights abuses , uranium enrichment activities , nuclear testing and proliferation , ballistic missile programs and the threat it continues to pose to South Korea and its neighbors . "
U.S. analysts will pore over the document to resolve Washington 's outstanding concerns , which include questions about the extent of North Korea 's proliferation of nuclear technology and the status of any uranium enrichment program .
Watch what 's still unknown after Pyongyang 's declaration »
Friday 's event at the nuclear plant marked at least an effort by North Korea -- dubbed " The Hermit Kingdom " in the international community for its isolationist tendencies -- to show the world a good - faith effort to end its nuclear weapons program .
Media outlets from the five other nations involved in the talks were invited to view the tower 's implosion , a rare move in North Korea .
CNN was among the media outlets present .
But there appeared to be no mention of the declaration or planned implosion at Yongbyon on the Web site of North Korea 's state - run news agency on Thursday .
And an article Wednesday noted the 58th anniversary of the Korean war , calling it " a war of aggression started by the U.S. imperialists in an attempt to occupy the whole of Korea . "
CNN 's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour contributed to this story from Pyongyang .
All About North Korea • Nuclear Proliferation
A new report on severe sporting injuries among high school and college athletes shows cheerleading appears to account for a larger proportion of all such injuries than previously thought .
The latest annual report from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill - based National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research shows high school cheerleading accounted for 65.1 percent of all catastrophic sports injuries among high school females over the past 25 years .
Previously , the figure was believed to be 55 percent , but new data included in this year 's survey indicates that the true number of cheerleading injuries appears to be higher .
The story is the same for college participants as well .
At that level , the new data shows cheerleading accounted for 66.7 percent of all female sports catastrophic injuries , compared to past estimates of 59.4 percent .
The difference is due to a new partnership between the UNC center and the National Cheer Safety Foundation , a California - based not - for - profit body created to promote safety in the sport and collect data on injuries , which provided the center with previously unreported data .
The addition of new information compiled by the foundation saw the inclusion of an additional 30 injury records from high schoolers and college students .
Beforehand , the number of direct catastrophic injuries in all sports totaled 112 .
The center 's director , Frederick O. Mueller , Ph.D. , professor of exercise and sports science in UNC's College of Arts and Sciences , who has authored the report since it was first published in 1982 , said catastrophic injuries to female athletes have increased over the years .
" A major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity , which now involves gymnastic - type stunts , " Mueller said .
" If these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty , catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading . "
Between 1982 and 2007 , there were 103 fatal , disabling or serious injuries recorded among female high school athletes , with the vast majority ( 67 ) occurring in cheerleading .
No other sports registered double - figure tallies ; gymnastics ( 9 ) and track ( 7 ) had the 2nd and 3rd highest totals , respectively .
Among college athletes , there have been 39 such injuries : 26 in cheerleading , followed by three in field hockey and two each in lacrosse and gymnastics .
In 2007 , two catastrophic injuries to female high school cheerleaders were reported , down from 10 in the previous season , and the lowest number since 2001 .
However , there were three catastrophic injuries to college - level participants , up from one in 2006 .
Mueller said catastrophic sporting injuries may never be totally eliminated , but collecting and constantly analyzing reliable injury data can help reduce them dramatically .
According to the report , almost 95,200 female students take part in high school cheerleading annually , along with about 2,150 males .
College participation numbers are hard to find since cheerleading is not an NCAA sport .
The report also notes that according to the NCAA Insurance program , 25 percent of money spent on student athlete injuries in 2005 resulted from cheerleading .
Disinfecting Wipes May Spread , Not Kill , Germs
If used improperly , the popular cleaning wipes may do more harm than good .
June 3 , 2008  --
The antibacterial wipes that have emerged as a sanitary status symbol in homes , hospitals , schools , gyms and even grocery stores may not be the ultimate answer in hygiene — and they might even spread , rather than kill , bacteria .
Researchers from the Welsh School of Pharmacy at Cardiff University in Wales tested the cleaning power of three different types of antibacterial wipes containing either traditional disinfectants , detergents or natural antimicrobial substances , such as those extracted from plants .
A team led by microbiologist Gareth Williams used the wipes to clean surfaces that had been severely contaminated with the notorious bacterium Staphylococcus aureus — including the Methicillin - resistant type known as MRSA , which has become a growing concern in hospitals .
The study , presented Tuesday at the American Society for Microbiology General Meeting in Boston , found that natural antimicrobial wipes removed the most bacteria from surfaces , while disinfectant wipes did the best job of destroying bacteria .
" Ideally , you 'd want the wipes to kill what they remove , " Williams said .
But researchers found that all of the dirty wipes , including those with the disinfectant , still had some bacteria remaining on them .
When they were reused , the wipes just transported the bacteria to another location .
" We would recommend that one wipe is applied in one application to one surface , and then discarded , " Williams said .
" This is in an attempt to prevent the transfer of bacteria to different surfaces . "
Hospital Conditions
The conditions in the study were meant to emulate the bacteria - filled environment of a hospital intensive care unit .
Health professionals aim to control the levels of potentially dangerous bacteria in these settings through disinfection — in short , the removal of as many microscopic troublemakers as possible .
But disinfection should not be confused with sterilization .
Disinfection is not designed to kill all organisms , but rather to simply reduce the number of organisms on a surface , said Donna Duberg , assistant professor of clinical laboratory science at Saint Louis University in St. Louis , Mo .
" Our bodies are designed to handle a certain number of bacteria , " she said .
Complete sterilization is unnecessary , especially in homes , which are much less contaminated than a hospital ICU .
" We use way too many antibacterial agents , " Duberg said , adding that the overuse of products like wipes , soaps and cleansers that contain these substances can lead bacteria to become resistant to our methods of extermination .
" I personally believe there is n't anything that good , hot soapy water can't clean , " she said .
How to Use Antibacterial Wipes
Dr. William Schaffner , chair of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , agreed that people should be careful to use antibacterial wipes appropriately to avoid spreading bacteria around their homes .
His motto for disinfectant wipes : " use it and lose it , " especially on highly contaminated surfaces in the bathroom and kitchen .
For example , do n't use the same wipe to clean both the toilet and the sink .
Schaffner called this type of reuse a " false economy , " trading the price of wipes for the spread of germs .
But Schaffner added that in hospitals , surfaces are not the primary source of bacteria that infect patients .
Other patients and health care workers are the ones who transmit the most germs .
" It is hands that are the great transfer vehicle for bacteria from patient to patient , " he said .
So the rising use of antibacterial wipes should n't overshadow the most important rule of hygiene : Wash your hands .

Obama to rename Bush 's faith office
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) plans to slam President Bush ’s faith - based program as “ a photo op ” and a failure on Tuesday , and says he would scrap the office and create a new Council for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships that would be a “ critical ” part of his administration .
Obama , unveiling a plan to overhaul and expand Bush ’s faith - based program during remarks at a community ministry in Zanesville , Ohio , said the White House Office of Community and Faith - Based Initiatives — which Bush founded during his second week in office — “ never fulfilled its promise . ”

“ Support for social services to the poor and the needy have been consistently underfunded , ” Obama says in prepared remarks .
“ Rather than promoting the cause of all faith - based organizations , former officials in the Office have described how it was used to promote partisan interests .
As a result , the smaller congregations and community groups that were supposed to be empowered ended up getting short - changed . ”
Obama was referring to accusations by John J. DiIulio Jr. , the office ’s first director , and David Kuo , his former deputy , that White House support for the program was driven more by swing - state politics than by compassion for the needy .
The White House views the office as one of the cornerstone 's of Bush 's legacy , making Obama 's vow a very personal one .
Reaching out to evangelicals who are nonplussed by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , Obama declared : “ I still believe it ’s a good idea to have a partnership between the White House and grass - roots groups , both faith - based and secular .
But it has to be a real partnership — not a photo op .
That ’s what it will be when I ’m president .
I ’ll establish a new Council for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships . ”
“ The new name will reflect a new commitment , ” he continued .
“ This Council will not just be another name on the White House organization chart — it will be a critical part of my administration . ”
Anticipating criticism from the left , Obama said : “ I believe deeply in the separation of church and state , but I do n’t believe this partnership will endanger that idea — so long as we follow a few basic principles .
First , if you get a federal grant , you ca n’t use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you ca n’t discriminate against them — or against the people you hire — on the basis of their religion .
Second , federal dollars that go directly to churches , temples and mosques can only be used on secular programs .
And we ’ll also ensure that taxpayer dollars only go to those programs that actually work . ”
The Obama campaign released plans saying his new President 's Council for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships , working within the White House , “ will work to engage faith - based organizations and help them abide by the principles that federal funds cannot be used to proselytize , that they should not discriminate in providing their services , and they should be held to the same standards of accountability as other federal grant recipients . ”
The campaign listed four goals :
— Train the trainers to enable local faith - based organizations to learn best practices , grant - making procedures and service delivery so that they can better apply for and use federal dollars .
— Partner with state and local offices so that federal efforts build on successes made at the state and local level .
— Hold recipients responsible by conducting rigorous performance evaluation , researching what works well and disseminating best practices .
— Close the summer learning gap by focusing faith - based and community - based efforts on summer learning programs for 1 million children .
War between Russia and Georgia orchestrated from USA
The US administration urged for an immediate cease - fire in the conflict between Russia and Georgia over the unrecognized republic of South Ossetia .
War between Russia and Georgia orchestrated from USA
In the meantime , Russian officials believe that it was the USA that orchestrated the current conflict .
The chairman of the State Duma Committee for Security , Vladimir Vasilyev , believes that the current conflict is South Ossetia is very reminiscent to the wars in Iraq and Kosovo .
“ The things that were happening in Kosovo , the things that were happening in Iraq – we are now following the same path .
The further the situation unfolds , the more the world will understand that Georgia would never be able to do all this without America .
South Ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from Georgia , but the latter denied everything , whereas the US Department of State released no comments on the matter .
In essence , they have prepared the force , which destroys everything in South Ossetia , attacks civilians and hospitals .
They are responsible for this .
The world community will learn about it , ” the official said .
In the meantime , it became known that the Georgian troops conducted volley - fire cleansings of several South Ossetian settlements , where people ’s houses were simply leveled .
“ The number of victims with women , children and elderly people among them , can be counted in hundreds and even thousands , ” a source from South Ossetian government in the capital of Tskhinvali said .
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry , Sergei Lavrov , told reporters that Georgia ’s actions in South Ossetia question its consistency as a state and as a responsible member of the international community , Interfax reports .
" Civilians , including women , children and elderly people , are dying in South Ossetia .
In addition to that , Georgia conducts ethnic scouring in South Ossetian villages .
The situation in South Ossetia continues to worsen every hour .
Georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people .
They shell residential quarters of Tskhinvali [ the capital ] and other settlements .
They bomb the humanitarian convoys .
The number of refugees continues to rise – the people try to save their lives , the lives of their children and relatives .
A humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace , ” Russia ’s Foreign Minister said .
The minister added that the Georgian administration ignored the appeal from the UN General Assembly to observe the Olympic truce during the Beijing Olympics .
“ The Georgian administration has found the use to its arms , which they have been purchasing during the recent several years , ” Lavrov said .
“ The fact that Georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their Russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself , I think , ” the minister added .
“ Now it is clear to us why Georgia never accepted Russia ’s offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the South Ossetian conflict , ” Lavrov said .
“ Not so long ago , before the military actions in South Ossetia , Georgia ’s President Saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because Georgia would not use force against its people , as he said .
It just so happens that it is using it , ” Sergei Lavrov said .
Sergei Lavrov believes that the international community should stop turning a blind eye on Georgia ’s active deals to purchase arms .
“ We have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms , in which the Georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years , ” Lavrov said .
Hank Paulson likely has too much self - respect to repeat his assertion that the Treasury wo n't need to bail out Fannie ( FNM ) and Freddie ( FRE ) .
So it will be interesting to see what he does say when he finally speaks publicly about them again .
The farther FNM and FRE stocks fall , the sooner Paulson will have to act .
The companies have now all but forfeited any opportunity they had to raise equity from third parties , and as yesterday 's Freddie debt sale showed , even debt buyers are getting nervous .
This , in turn , is helping to push up mortgage rates , which is what the Treasury fears most .
Some still speculate that a third - party equity buyer will ride to the rescue , but this is a pipe dream .
No private - market buyer would likely invest without an explicit guarantee from the government .
And because this guarantee would likely preserve some ( not much ) value for current shareholders , Paulson is unlikely to provide it .
Paulson spent weeks answering the charge that he bailed out Bear Stearns while leaving Mom and Pop to go bankrupt , and the criticism of a similar move at Fannie and Freddie would be intense .
Most analysts speculate that the bailout will take one of two forms :
Investment in preferred equity , which would wipe out current shareholders .
Purchase of debt , with some of Fannie and Freddie 's mortage portfolios pledged as collateral .
Those who are still buying FNM and FRE 's stocks at this level are presumably banking on the second scenario .
They should n't :
It will likely just delay the inevitable .
Buying debt would provide liquidity , but it would n't solve the credit problem .
And , eventually , unless the economy and housing markets suddenly recover , future losses would likely force the companies to raise equity .
Which returns us to bailout option No. 1 .
Barring a miracle , FNM and FRE are going to zero .
It will be interesting to see how long it takes the market to reflect that .

In this week 's New Yorker , Elizabeth Kolbert wrote about the Danish isle of Samsø , which over the past 10 years , has gone from exclusively using fossil fuel energy sources , to living exclusively off renewable energy .
Using a combination of onshore and offshore turbines , private mini-turbines , solar panels , straw - burning furnaces and biofuels , the 4,300 - resident island has become a sort of a sandbox for green experimentation .
Advertisement
The man responsible for Samsø 's shift is Søren Hermansen , who after deciding farming was n't for him , became an environmental sciences teacher , and then a renewable energy expert .
Growing up on the island and seeing the impact the people were having on the environment , Hermansen felt he could talk the residents into making some changes .
The public response was favorable , and the transformation began .
The island now has 11 onshore turbines , a biomass plant , and a straw burning plant , which are invested in by the residents of Samsø , as well as outside , private investors .
All the while , this green movement has brought in a constant flow of researchers , scientists and sociologists trying to figure out Samsø 's mojo .
And for those in the giant turbine market , I think it 's worth noting that giant turbines come with panoramic sunroofs .
Not sure about power locks and cruise control , however .

Es war kein einfacher Nachmittag für Lewis Hamilton .
Beim Großen Preis von Russland kassierte der Mercedes - Pilot von den Stewards gleich zwei Strafen , weil er wiederholt am Ausgang der Boxengasse den Start geübt hatte , obwohl dies laut Regelwerk verboten ist .
Im AvD Motorsport Magazin haben die ehemaligen Piloten Marc Surer und Karl Wendlinger dafür wenig Verständnis gezeigt .
"
Er müsste es wissen , wo er seinen Übungsstart machen darf .
Er ist schon lange genug in der Formel 1 dabei .
Es gibt Regeln , auch in den anderen Motorsport - Klassen .
Da sollte man schon wissen , wo man seinen Start machen darf " , sagte Wendlinger , nicht ohne sich über Sieger Bottas zu freuen : " Es hat Abwechslung gegeben , Hamilton ist nicht der Sieger , er ist Dritter geworden , aber der Mann , den es in der Formel 1 zu schlagen gilt .
Es ist unglücklich gelaufen , deshalb hat er die Strafe bekommen . "
Surer und Wendlinger mit KritikUnd auch Surer sah den Fehler klar beim Briten .
" Schuld ist schon der Fahrer , weil wenn 19 Fahrer am richtigen Ort den Start üben und Lewis Hamilton geht ans Ende der Boxenausfahrt und übt da , wo die Autos schon mit hoher Geschwindigkeit aus der Box rauskommen , dann ist das einerseits gefährlich und zweitens habe ich nicht verstanden , warum er überhaupt auf die Idee kommt , da hinzugehen .
" Dennoch ist auch Mercedes nicht ganz unschuldig .
" Natürlich müsste das Team ihn stoppen und deswegen hat das Team jetzt auch 25.000 Dollar Strafe bekommen " , erklärte Surer weiter .

Das Team ist auf ihn angewiesen , das Team muss auf ihn warten .
Wir haben ja gesehen , Verstappen hat Bottas dieses Jahr ein paar Mal schon geschlagen , aber Lewis Hamilton zu schlagen , das ist viel schwieriger .
Das heißt , Mercedes ist auf Lewis angewiesen und deswegen muss er sich nicht beeilen " , erklärte Surer die Situation des 35 - Jährigen .
Auch der frühere Sauber - Pilot Wendlinger sieht die Situation des Briten entspannt .
" Ich glaube , da macht er sich gar keine Gedanken drüber .
Das wird funktionieren , er wird weiter bei Mercedes bleiben .
Ich glaube , das ist auch sein Anliegen , weil er weiß , dass er da das beste Paket hat .
" Der Vertrag von Hamilton läuft am Saisonende aus , sein Teamkollege Valtteri Bottas hat seinen Kontrakt bereits verlängert .
Obama on McCain speech : ' Breathtaking , ' not in a good way
What Obama needs : More arguments on issues with John McCain , fewer interviews with West Virginians .
To that end , he responded to McCain 's speech on the environment just now , hitting McCain on that long Senate record we 're going to learn a lot about this year :
It is truly breathtaking for John McCain to talk about combating climate change while voting against virtually every recent effort to actually invest in clean energy .
You do n’t have to look further than the wind turbine plant where Senator McCain is speaking today to assess his commitment to this cause .
While Senator McCain talks about the need to invest in alternative energy , he rejected the single biggest investment in renewable energy in history , including incentives that contributed to a nearly 50 % increase in wind power generation last year , and he has repeatedly opposed renewable fuel mandates and higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks .
In stark contrast , I ’ve called for a national standard to ensure that we 're using more renewable energy , an expansion of our green energy sector that would create millions of green jobs , and a bipartisan plan to double our fuel efficiency standards .
That is why the American people will have a clear choice in November when I am the nominee – between a candidate who opposes real solutions to our energy crisis , and leadership that will solve it once and for all .
Tokyo Electric Power Co , TEPCO has developed a vehicle quick charging station that it says will take a vehicle 25 miles with just a 5 minute charge .
This new charging technology is a breakthrough because it allows commuters to charge their vehicles on the road without having to plug them in overnight at home , and takes roughly the same amount of time it would take to fill up with gasoline .
One of the main reasons electric cars have thus far failed to break out into the mainstream is due to the lack of infrastructure in place - namely the fact that there are few recharging stations for electric cars to be repowered while on the move .
Well now Tokyo is attempting to address this problem by setting up 1,000 recharging sites .
According to the plans , there will be an initial 200 recharging stations during the fiscal year in 2009 - with this expanding to 1,000 in around three years .
TEPCO has developed a quick recharging system that allows electric vehicles to run for 25 miles on a five - minute charge or 37 miles on a 10 minute charge .
The plan is to start installing these devices to coincide with Mitsubishi and Subaru introducing their own electric cars - TEPCO is working in partnership with the two manufacturers .
[ M]ark [ S ] huttleworth buys [ M ] icro [ S ] oft codecs for Ubuntu
T he following observation came up in our IRC channel just a short while ago .
It indicates that Ubuntu engaged in licensing of codecs from Microsoft .
< microsoft - spy > schestowitz : you are allowed , Ubuntu licensed Windows Media from Microsoft for Netbooks
< jbh >
I do n’t know anyone in CA
< moparx >
I ’ll never understand why a distro ( or any foss developer for that matter ) would purposefully taint themselves for some of microsoft ’s proprietary scraps .
< schestowitz > Gah .
Maybe that ’s why they do n’t allow downloads of it .
< schestowitz >
Software patents are n’t even valid where Canonical is .
< schestowitz > ms -spy , got a URL , please ?
< jbh > never even heard of netbooks before
< microsoft - spy > schestowitz , how about http://www.canonical.com/netbooks ?
< schestowitz >
I believe this is important because given what I know I worry that MS ( Mark S. ) would do the same with MS for business ‘ enterprise ’ boxes .
< microsoft - spy > schestowitz , MS does whatever benefits him , proprietary kernel parts etc
< schestowitz > Which MS ?
< schestowitz >
< microsoft - spy > Shuttleworth
< schestowitz >
Well , that ’s very problematic because he enables Microsoft to control the price of Free software .
< schestowitz >
They already cross-licence with Apple , but they play by their own rules .
< microsoft - spy > he just says “ All the * applications * in Ubuntu are free software only . ”
< schestowitz > Cross - licensing ( pardon the typo above ) is incompatible with the GPL .
< schestowitz >
Yes , but ..
< microsoft - spy > so does not include drivers , firmware , codecs , …
< schestowitz >
Just to be clear , the issue is not binary / FOSS , but gratis / taxed
< schestowitz >
This forbids redistribution , which is also why they do n’t permit downloads .
It ’s like another Moonlight .
If you fail to see why this is bad , then consider looking back at the Red Hat ' extortion ' story ( more in this recent article about the ‘ codec incident ’ ) .
Also recall what Novell did .
In order to defend such plots , Microsoft has been fighting for DMCA around the world — essentially extending beyond the boundaries of the United States .
Recently it was Canada that got targeted and in the news you find Red Hat ’s founder , Bob Young , entering the ring .
Lulu Inc. CEO
Bob
Young is a major voice in the open source software industry , but according to him the entire community has been unjustifiably ignored throughout the Canadian government ’s copyright reform initiatives .
Last year , the Conservative government vowed to adopt copyright laws which would make it illegal to modify or remove any device or software fitted with a technical protection measures ( TPMs ) .
After months of hearsay and numerous delays , the buzz on Parliament Hill now suggests a proposed copyright bill from Industry Minister Jim Prentice is imminent .
In the wake of these rumors — which many industry activists have begun referring to as the Canadian version of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) — a new open source software alliance has added their name to the lengthy list of opposition to the Industry Minister ’s soon - to - be- unveiled legislation .
It ’s worth adding that Bob Young is pro-GPLv3 ( video ) .
We wrote about this Microsoft lobby before .
As some further relevant readings ( external links ) , consider :
This is a dangerous precedence that Microsoft is setting and It ’s sad to see Canonical and Intel playing along .
Nevertheless , it ’s not surprising given the nearness of Intel and Microsoft .
In private , sources told us a few months ago that Mark Shuttleworth negotiated codecs with Microsoft . █

McCain and Vietnam : Revising history to pave the way for new wars
By Bill Van Auken
18 June 2008
The Republican Party ’s presumptive candidate for president , Senator John McCain of Arizona , is routinely referred to in the US media as a “ Vietnam War hero . ”
In speech after speech over the past month , his Democratic rival , Senator Barack Obama , has prefaced criticism of McCain ’s policies with a declaration of his belief that the Republican is “ a genuine war hero , ” “ a man who has served this country heroically ” and “ an American hero whose military service we honor . ”
While conventional political wisdom would no doubt dismiss such rhetoric as , on the one hand , the packaging of the candidate by the Republicans and , on the other , a tactical feint on the part of a Democratic candidate lacking in military experience , the words have a far deeper and more ominous political significance .
What is the objective source of McCain ’s designation as a “ war hero , ” a title that he parlayed into a successful political career bankrolled by the family fortune of his second wife and abetted by the corrupt Arizona developer Charles Keating ?
McCain , the son and grandson of four - star Navy admirals , was nearly a decade into a rather undistinguished career as a Navy pilot when he was shot down over North Vietnam in October 1967 , landing him for the next five and a half years in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp .
Before his plane went down , he had spent about 20 hours in combat in the skies over Vietnam , dropping high explosives on the towns and people below during short flights from an American aircraft carrier parked in the South China Sea .
He had volunteered to participate in an operation known as “ Rolling Thunder ” launched by the Democratic administration of President Lyndon Johnson in an attempt to break the will of the Vietnamese people .
The aim was to use sustained bombing to destroy the country ’s economy and infrastructure and kill or maim large numbers of its citizens .
Before the war was over , US warplanes dropped close to eight million tons of explosives — four times the bombs dropped in all of World War II — on a country roughly the size of New Mexico .
This , the most intense and sustained bombing campaign in history , devastated Vietnam ’s cities and destroyed its industrial , transportation and communications infrastructure .
Before the war was over , some five million Vietnamese were killed , many of them victims of US aerial bombardments .
In his book Vietnam : A History , veteran journalist Stanley Karnow presents the account given by a Vietnamese peasant of one bombing raid : “ The bombing started at about eight o’clock in the morning and lasted for hours .
When we first heard the explosions , we rushed into the tunnels but not everyone made it .
When there was a pause in the attack , some of us climbed out to see what we could do , and the scene was terrifying .
Bodies had been torn to pieces — limbs were hanging from trees and scattered around the ground .
The bombing began again , this time with napalm , and the village went up in flames .
The napalm hit me .
I felt as if I was burning all over , like a piece of coal .
I lost consciousness .
Friends took me to the hospital , and my wounds did n’t begin to heal until six months later .
Over 200 people died in the raid , including my mother , sister - in - law and three nephews .
They were buried alive when the tunnel collapsed . ”
What is described here is not an act of heroism , but a war crime carried out by what was militarily the most powerful nation on earth against an impoverished and historically oppressed country .
When McCain was shot down , he was completing such a bombing run against a power plant in a heavily populated area of Hanoi .
McCain ’s survival after parachuting into Hanoi is testimony to the humanity of the Vietnamese people and was owed in particular to one Vietnamese worker who swam into the lake where the wounded pilot had landed , pulled him out before he drowned and then protected him from an enraged crowd .
One can only imagine the reaction if a foreign pilot — whose own country was never attacked — were to parachute into Phoenix or any other US city or town after bombing raids that had torn men , women and children to pieces and reduced homes to rubble .
In a 1997 interview on the CBS news program “ 60 Minutes , ” McCain frankly acknowledged , “ I am a war criminal ; I bombed innocent women and children . ”
It was an honest statement , though hardly a convincing argument for making him president .
The fact that he was a war criminal reflected not merely his own personal actions , which in terms of slaughter were no doubt every bit as devastating as a My Lai massacre , albeit inflicted from a longer distance .
Rather it was a matter of the objective character of the war itself .
Clearly there were many in the top echelons of the government , its military and intelligence agencies and in both major parties who bore far greater responsibility for the waging of a criminal and counterrevolutionary war of aggression in Vietnam .
The American ruling establishment has spent more than three decades attempting to revise the history of the Vietnam War in order to conceal its own responsibility for the greatest war crimes since the fall of the Nazis and to erase the political memory of US imperialism ’s defeat under conditions of mass opposition and social struggles at home .
Kicking the “ Vietnam syndrome ” has been the stated aim within the ruling elite at least since the first Bush administration .
It was hoped that the first Persian Gulf War and then the invasion of Iraq would somehow sweep aside the popular aversion to US wars of aggression that was the bitter legacy of Vietnam .
McCain ’s admission in 1997 notwithstanding , his lionization as a war hero has very much been a part of this effort .
Meanwhile , his own conceptions about the Vietnam war have played a decisive role in shaping his attitudes towards Iraq and a potential new war against Iran .
An article published in the New York Times Sunday , based on an essay written by McCain in 1974 while attending the National War College approximately a year after his release , provided fresh insight into the lessons drawn by McCain from his grueling and formative experience in Vietnam .
While many officers concluded that the US should have never sent combat forces into Vietnam , McCain ’s essay “ focused on the failure to sustain public support for the fight , ” according to the Times .
He criticized fellow POWs who “ questioned the legality of the war ” as being “ easy marks for Communist propaganda ” and blamed “ divisive forces ” in the US itself .
As an antidote , he proposed a more intensive indoctrination of US troops in the foreign policy aims of the government — while admitting that “ a program of this nature could be construed as ‘ brainwashing ’ ” — and a more aggressive attempt by the government to acquaint the American people with “ some basic facts of its foreign policy . ”
Of course , millions of Americans — including many in the military — “ questioned the legality of the war ” because it was in fact a criminal war of aggression .
Moreover , American working people were not prepared to continue paying the price for this war , which killed some 60,000 troops and left hundreds of thousands more physically and mentally shattered .
Meanwhile , people all over the world regarded the war as a crime and a moral disgrace .
A number of naval and air force pilots , however , drew different conclusions about the war .
Most prominent among them was Gen. Curtis LeMay , the former Air Force chief of staff , who chafed at any restrictions on the air war against the Vietnamese and suggested that the US “ bomb them back into the stone age . ”
These elements were highly critical of the Johnson administration at the outset of the Rolling Thunder campaign , believing that the US needed to carry out the unrelenting carpet bombing of Vietnamese cities .
They praised Nixon for unleashing 200 B - 52 bombers on Hanoi in the so - called Christmas Bombings of 1972 , an atrocity that failed to break the will of the Vietnamese people and paved the way to the withdrawal of American forces from the country .
McCain has described his term at the National War College , when he wrote his essay , as the period when his “ principles were grounded ” on issues of war and foreign policy .
His basic conclusion was that the US could have won the Vietnam War had it pursued a different military strategy and not succumbed to the influence of “ divisive forces , ” in which he includes the antiwar movement , the media and the Democratic Party .
McCain ’s rewriting of the history of Vietnam is by no means unique .
It has been a major ideological campaign for decades , finding its expression in such popular culture products as the Rambo films .
Its ultimate purpose is to pave the way to new US wars of aggression such as the one in Iraq — where McCain has said that he would have no problem keeping US troops for 100 years — and Iran , where he expressed his view by singing “ bomb , bomb , bomb ... bomb , bomb Iran ” to the music of an old Beach Boys tune .
The Democratic Party ’s aiding and abetting of this ideological campaign also did not just begin with the obsequious praise of McCain as a “ war hero . ”
For decades , the party has recoiled in fear from the charge of the right that its antiwar wing was responsible for US imperialism ’s defeat .
It is worth noting that the Republicans meanwhile have shown no compunction about attacking rival candidates ’ war records .
In 2004 , they formed the “ Swiftboat Veterans for Truth ” not only to vilify Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry for having opposed the war upon his return from Vietnam , but to question whether the battle for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star ever took place .
For their part , Kerry and the Democrats did their best to bury the candidate ’s campaign against the war of more than 30 years before , presenting him as a “ war hero ” who knew “ how to defend his country . ”
The effect of this campaign rhetoric — like the Democrats ’ continuous “ honoring ” of McCain ’s military record today — was to help rehabilitate the Vietnam War .
This attempted rehabilitation is founded not on any new insights into the past , but is rather predicated on the hope that searing memories have faded and that a new generation is less familiar with the terrible events of that war .
In the end , this historical revisionism , practiced by both the Democrats and Republicans , is driven by a consensus within the ruling elite — whatever the tactical disagreements on how best to salvage their interests in Iraq .
They agree that the defense of American imperialism ’s strategic position will require new and even more terrible war crimes .
This is no less true of Obama — who has described Afghanistan as a “ war we must win , ” proposed unilateral attacks on Pakistan , and called for a larger army — than it is of John McCain .
Under these conditions , and with American working people once again confronting both intense social struggles at home and war abroad , the defense of the real history of US imperialism ’s defeat in Vietnam becomes all the more vital .

February , 1959 , the Ural Mountains in Russia - Ten young cross country skiers from the Ural Polytechnical Institute , eight guys and two girls led by Igor Dyatlov , set out for two weeks of adventure .
One became ill and turned back : Little did he know he would be the only one to return alive .
Weeks later , searchers found one of the most bizarre scenes in modern lore .
The bodies of the nine victims were scattered over a wide area of the frozen landscape .
Some were wearing only their underwear .
Some were wearing each others ' clothes .
Two had head injuries .
One had no tongue .
Two had severe internal chest injuries .
None had any visible external signs of trauma .
Some of their clothes were found to be radioactive .
Circumstances suggested that some the victims may have been blind .
Various other witnesses in the region reported bizarre orange spheres in the night sky ; and strangest of all , the bodies had orange skin and gray hair .
This was the Soviet Union in the middle of the cold war , and few details other than what I just gave were reported .
Journalists attempting to give more information found their books and articles censored .
Independent investigators found official records to be missing or classified .
Many fingers have pointed at military testing .
Did radioactivity from some secret weapons test drive the group insane ?
Some people think UFOs are responsible for the deaths , citing the reports from other skiers in the region who saw the orange spheres in the night sky in the direction of the Dyatlov party .
Russian authorities closed the case , called the cause of death a " compelling unknown force " , and classified it top secret .
The mountain was renamed Dyatlov Pass .
And that 's about all that anyone 's ever been able to learn about the case .
I found some translated articles from Russian media and some western articles , and although the case offers some really compelling mysteries , it also offers an elephant in the room :
The possibility of avalanches being the culprit .
I wanted to see how likely avalanches would have been in that area , so I looked it up on Google Earth .
Turns out it 's hardly the type of place you 'd expect avalanches .
The hills are low and rounded , much better for cross country skiing than for avalanches , at least according to my personal informal assessment from looking at the terrain on Google Earth .
And , obviously , the group felt comfortable enough with any potential danger to make camp where they did .
But I also found a Russian tourism brochure for the area that warns of avalanche danger on slopes steeper than 15° .
According to the police reports , the slope immediately above the campsite was at 22 - 23° , and 50 to 100 meters above the campsite it increased to 25 - 30° .
That 's quite steep .
There was a cornice , and the snow at the campsite was 2 meters deep .
There has also been much discussion in the Russian press about the possible role of avalanches in the Dyatlov Pass incident .
So I 'm going to go ahead and call avalanches a plausible factor in the tragedy .
A number of skeptics have addressed the question of radioactivity by pointing out that the mantles used in camping lanterns contain thorium , which emits alpha particle radiation , to the point that there is actually a radiation warning on the packaging .
These mantles , if you 're not familiar with them , are little fabric bags that serve as the wick in a burning lantern .
They 're quite fragile and easily turn to dust that gets everywhere , like onto the clothes of everyone in the tent , when you replace them , which you need to do pretty regularly .
Thorium gas mantles were invented in 1891 and were manufactured in many countries for a long time .
Coleman , the largest US manufacturer , only phased them out in the 1990's .
I found a blog comment signed " Igor " , a guy who says he 's Russian and went to the same college as the Dyatlov Pass victims , and he states in his comment that thorium gas mantles were not available in Russia in 1959 .
That does n't sound consistent with general articles on the subject , plus I found a Russian WWII lantern on eBay that was kerosene fueled , and all the kerosene lanterns I could find details on do use thorium gas mantles .
It 's a question mark , and remains a plausible possibility in my book .
Here is my proposed explanation of what happened .
It 's wrong , of course , because it 's done from my armchair 50 years after the fact and with no firsthand knowledge of the region , but it 's completely reasonable and does adequately satisfy the facts as we know them .
Nine skiers set up camp in an area with potential avalanche danger , but no more or less danger than would have been found if they set up anywhere else they could have reached before nightfall .
Sometime during the night , a loud noise , either from a nearby avalanche , a jet aircraft , or military ordnance , convinced at least five members of the group that an avalanche was bearing down on them .
They burst out of the tent wearing whatever they happened to be sleeping in and ran .
At some point one of them fell and struck his head on a rock .
They became lost in the dark and poor visibility , or simply found themselves stranded with their injured friend , and finally built a fire .
They quickly got hypothermia and probably shouted themselves hoarse for their friends .
Two of them lost consciousness and the others made a desperation decision :
To take what little clothes their two unconscious buddies had and risk it all to try and make it back to camp .
One made it 300 meters , the second made it 480 , and the third a full 630 meters before all five were dead from hypothermia .
Back at camp , the four who did n't panic and run away in the night got dressed , collected provisions , and began to search for their friends .
They searched for hours , circling high and low , until at some point either through a slip or just bad luck , they were caught in a real avalanche .
During the resulting turmoil one received a fatal skull fracture , one received twelve broken ribs , and one bit her tongue off , all perfectly plausible injuries during such a traumatic death .
Their bodies remained buried until the spring thaw , as is so common with avalanche victims .
At the open - casket funeral for the first five victims , relatives saw the combination of five days of winter sunburn in those days before sunscreen , and the mortician 's effort to cover up frostbite and a full month of exposure to the elements , and described it as a strange orange color ; though others described it simply as a deep tan , which is consistent with reasonable expectations .
And who knows what hair would have looked like after all that exposure and who knows what kind of treatment done by the mortician , so I can't assign too much significance to what amounts to a few anecdotal reports from some funeral attendees , and not even all funeral attendees .
Plus I 'm quite certain that if UFOs had turned all of their hair really gray , do n't you think the cold war Russian authorities would have had it colored back to normal for an open casket funeral ?
Their bodies had been exposed outdoors for weeks .
Of course they looked terrible .
What of the radiation on their clothes ?
Well , there is at least as much uncertainty about what the Russians were doing with their atomic and thermonuclear weapons in that area in those days , as there is about exactly what type of radiation and how much was found on the Dyatlov pass victims .
Since we do n't know anything about either , we can't say that any explanation is inconsistent with what was found .
And , the thorium lantern mantle question quite probably makes the entire radiation issue a moot point .
Assuming they 'd changed a lantern mantle sometime during the trip , which nearly always has to be done , there 's every reason to expect to find low - level alpha radiation on the clothes of anyone who participated .
How about those UFO reports ?
Well , people all around the world report UFOs every day , and whether anything happened to the Dyatlov party or not , it 's not especially surprising that skiers in the Ural Mountains saw UFOs that night .
What did that have to do with the Dyatlov party ?
We have a statistically insignificant correlation , with a sample size of one , and no reason to suspect that one thing had anything to do with the other .
Human psychology encourages us to think anecdotally and assume a causal relationship , but for my money , I consider the UFO question irrelevant .
Maybe if the UFOs were identified , and known to have some specific physical capability , then we'd have something to talk about .
The Russian newspaper reports stating that the victims may have been blinded appears to be pure speculation , based only on two observations : first , that some of them were wearing the wrong clothes ; and second , that when they built their campfire they did n't use some dry wood nearby .
Is it really necessary to conclude that blindness , ostensibly caused by UFOs , is the most likely explanation for the choice of firewood ?
Five panicked young people , underdressed , in subzero temperatures in near - zero - visibility darkness , were lucky to get a fire built at all .
I think we can cut them a little slack on what firewood they were able to find .
Summary : I 'm still looking for something in the Dyatlov Pass mystery that lacks a simple and mundane explanation .

I ’m just back from ten days ’ vacation , mostly spent pounding away on the book that my wife and I are working on about women in the developing world .
So I did n’t weigh in on the dispute about Scott McLellan ’s new book and whether the press rolled over in the run-up to the Iraq War .
Katie Couric notably sided with the critics , saying it was “ one of the most embarrassing chapters in American journalism . ”
In The Washington Post , Ari Fleischer offers his own take , which was that the press did indeed do its job :
At the risk of agreeing with one of my toughest protagonists in the briefing room — NBC ’s David Gregory — the press was tough , plenty tough .
I have the scars — and the transcripts — to prove it ….
The press did ask the hard questions , repeatedly .
Based on the CIA ’s conclusions , many of the president ’s and my answers turned out to be wrong , but you ca n’t blame the press for either the CIA ’s reporting or decisions reached by the president .
It ’s important to recognize that regardless of the outcome of the war in Iraq — an outcome still being written — the press did n’t cause it to happen or otherwise enable it .
My take is different .
I think we in the press were indeed too docile in the aftermath of 9/11 , although I think that is partly explained by the lack of Democratic Party opposition to White House policies at the time .
We in the press tend to cover disputes , and so if Democratic senators had stood up to criticize these policies , we would have done our job better .
But when the opposition party has rolled over and there ’s no dispute to cover , then the news media ’s role becomes more complicated .
More broadly , the standard criticism of the press has to do with Iraqi WMD , and there I think some of the critique is misdirected .
Sure , we should have been more skeptical in our tone , but since the senior Clinton administration foreign policy team all thought that there was WMD in Iraq I ’m not sure the coverage would have felt much different to the average reader .
Where I do n’t think we ’re adequately scolded has to do with the attitude of the Iraqi people .
No amount of journalism could have proved that Iraq did n’t have WMD , but we could have done a much better job conveying the fact that ordinary Iraqis did n’t want a U.S. invasion .
They hated Saddam but also hated the idea of “ liberation ” by U.S. troops , and planned to welcome us not with flowers but with bullets .
That was relevant information that was entirely gettable ; it was obvious to anyone reporting in Iraq or the region , and indeed some reporters did convey that .
But overall American news coverage did n’t adequately convey the hostility among Iraqis to the U.S. invasion and the anger that it would inspire , and the American invasion was premised partly on the false notion that Iraqis were going to welcome us .
We should have done a better job pushing back at that spin from the White House .
That ’s my take .
What ’s yours ?
It ’s been a bad couple of weeks for passport designers .
Several things happened that could alter the future of the technology used in our travel documents .
The first bit of bad news came from the UK , where a van was stolen containing 3000 “ virgin ” passports .
These passports were on their way to an RAF base , where they would be flown to consulates all around the world ( previously covered here on Gadling )
The passports were made in a high security printing facility owned by 3 M , but of course , no amount of security helps against stupidity .
When the driver of the van stopped at a store to buy a candy bar , his colleague ( who was still in the unlocked van ) was ordered to keep his head down while the thieves drove off , stopped in a dark alley , and unloaded all the passports into a waiting car .
The passenger of the delivery vehicle has been arrested and released on bail .
The UK passport service said “ computer chips embedded in the passports to store personal and biometric data have not been activated .
The service says that means the documents , which are still missing , ca n’t be used as passports . “ .
Turns out they could n’t have been more wrong , which brings us to the next bit of bad news .
RFID ( radio frequency identification ) chips in passports have been a hugely controversial issue .
Ever since the first trials were conducted , security specialists have warned that they are not the holy grail they are said to be .
Back in 2006 , right after the first chip enabled travel documents rolled off the printing presses , researchers showed how easy it is to read , and write to the chip in these passports .
In a more recent experiment , a researcher read the information off one passport , and altered it , rewriting the data to a different chip , but with a new photo ; Osama Bin Laden .
When the standards were developed for the RFID chips in travel documents , a system was put in place that could verify the information stored on the passport with a remote database of “ public keys ” .
So far , only 10 of the countries participating in RFID passports have signed up for this new public database , and only 5 are actually using it .
Once this system is in place , a scanned passport will be verified against the data it is supposed to contain .
This technology should eventually make it much harder to use a fake or altered passport at an immigration counter , but only in countries that have the systems in place for using RFID .
Any other county will still have to rely on the visible data stored in the passport .
Since the RFID technology is only intended for immigration purposes , a fake passport can still easily be used for other purposes , like banking or real estate .
In the meantime , there are 3000 UK passports on the market ( worth about $ 3400 each ) , and millions of passports being printed each month with RFID chips that do n’t really protect anyone .
With each vulnerability found in these RFID passports , the designers are pushed back a little closer to their drawing boards , where they will eventually have to develop an even better method of protecting the countries they work for .
Of course , in the big picture of things , nothing can stop good old human stupidity .
Arguments about genetic modification , often wrongly characterised as science versus irrational nature - worshippers , have lost none of their passion .
On one side are those who yearn for simple , high - tech solutions to complex problems .
Against GM , there are ecological realities and scientific evidence .
There is overwhelming evidence that farming took a wrong turn after the last war , with widespread use of artificial nitrogen fertilisers and sprays .
In Britain , we lost up to 95 per cent of our ancient woodlands , flower meadows , hedges and wildlife and saw massive losses of farms and farm workers ' jobs .
Farming became more oil - dependent .
Our food lost vitamins , taste and diversity and our diet became unhealthy .
As the environmental and human cost of industrial farming became harder to deny , along came a new miracle cure – genetic engineering .
Twenty years ago , GM promised unbelievable wonders – fruit that would never freeze , crops needing no fertiliser or sprays and food with vitamins and medicines engineered in .
All food would soon be GM .
Geneticists would engineer anything we wanted , taking a gene from a fish here , a pig there , adding a bacteria gene and maybe a bit of a virus .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The greatest coup by the GM companies , and their greatest scientific fraud , was to ensure no GM food had to be tested for safety .
In America , they established the concept of " substantial equivalence " – which means that if a GM crop looks like its non-GM equivalent and grows like it , then it is it – no safety testing is needed before people eat it .
GM maize could have added virus and antibiotic resistance genes , and a gene that makes it express an insecticide in every leaf , stem and root – but to the US government it looks and grows like maize , so it is safe to eat .
GM crops face mounting scientific evidence of uncertainty , risk and danger .
But now , because of rising food prices , the GM industry 's claim that GM is needed to feed the world is suddenly newsworthy again .
However , a key reason for soaring food prices – higher oil costs leading to higher fertiliser prices – also presents a massive threat to GM crops .
All current and planned GM crops depend on artificial , oil - based fertiliser to grow , and all need to be treated with pesticides to survive .
In 2006 , the pro-GM US Department of Agriculture observed that " currently available GM crops do not increase yield potential " – a point already made by a 2004 UN Food and Agriculture Organisation report which acknowledged that " GM crops can have reduced yields " .
The recently published UN IAASTD report , the work of more than 400 international scientists , about the future of global food production under the challenges of climate change and population pressure , concluded that GM crops do not have much to offer .
Confirming an earlier FAO conference 's conclusions , the IAASTD report acknowledged organic farming 's real potential to help feed the world in an era of rising oil prices and the urgent need to cut greenhouse gases , because organic systems use solar energy and clover to fix nitrogen in the soil , not oil and gas .
The value of this approach was also confirmed in a report this year by the International Trade Centre , technical advisors to the WTO and UN .
The new challenge we face is : how do we feed the world as oil and gas become costlier and scarcer , and as we cut greenhouse gases by 80 per cent by 2050 ?
No one suggests the answer to that is GM .

In Britain , the control grid is moving along at a brisk clip .
As if barking CCTVs , random searches , terrorist databases , metal detectors in the street , and other intrusive methods of control and intimidation are not enough , now folks going to the cinema will be searched .
The People reports :
Cinema - goers may be searched on the way into shows in a new crackdown on suicide bombers .
Suicide bombers ?
Indeed , a big problem in merry old England , never mind one of the last “ suicide bombers ” that struck on July 7 , 2005 , planted his bomb under the Circle line train in London .
It was apparently a Houdini trick .
Maybe the cops will begin crawling under trains , looking for wily bombers determined to disrupt the British way of life ?
But it is not simply the cinema :
Theaters , restaurants and hotels will also be covered in an anti-terror blueprint to be published by Security Minister Lord West later this year .
Diners , hotel guests and theater - goers could all have to undergo searches .
It seems every sort of public business will be rolled into the control grid :
From next month owners of pubs , bars and clubs will also be able to take part in exercises with police to make their premises safe .
Using multi-media DVD simulation they will be told how to spot suspicious customers and evacuate their buildings .
British television now reports Gestapo - like police tactics — random bus searches , drug sniffing dogs , impromptu metal detectors — as if no big deal .

Ohio Attorney Cliff Arnebeck , who notified Attorney General Mukasey yesterday about threats made by Karl Rove against the GOP 's high - tech guru , Mike Connell , as we reported last night , will join Peter B. Collins and me during my weekly Friday 5 pm PT appearance on PBC 's syndicated radio show .
You 'll be able to listen online at www.PeterBCollins.com if his show is not aired in your town .
And you may call in with questions and comments for Arnebeck or myself at 888 - 5 - PeterB ( or post them here , and I 'll try to ask them ) .
Hope you 'll tune in !
Arnebeck joined us for the first half - hour of the show and dropped a few interesting details during our discussion .
Among them : Bush can't pardon someone convicted under a civil RICO case , which is what Arnebeck is compiling .
( Also , ca n't remember if it came up during the interview , but as some have suggested that Rove simply invoke Executive Privilege to avoid being deposed in this case , Exec Privilege does not come into play in such a case .
It only refers to Congressional testimony . )
Connell had agreed to meet with the House Judiciary Comm .
several months ago , but so far Judiciary has n't followed up .
Arnebeck makes a tantalizing reference to the finding in the Paula Jones case that sitting Presidents may be deposed in civil cases .
More detail on those points and others in the audio interview .

The Best Equipment for Vlogging in 2020 : The Complete Checklist
Celebrity vloggers ranging from gamers to beauty gurus can earn as much as $ 1 million per month .
But with such diverse content , what do they have in common ?
One thing – perhaps the most important – is high - quality videos .
Whether you ’re an aspiring vlogger who ’s just starting out , and looking to invest in the right gear .
Or maybe you ’ve already got a YouTube channel and some subscribers under your belt , and you ’re looking to upgrade your existing equipment to something with a little higher quality .
Either way , today ’s viewers are accustomed to – and demand – high - quality footage .
Anything less than sharp images and crisp audio is a distraction from your content , and viewers wo n’t stick around .
So what is the best equipment for vlogging ?
Which brands and models should you opt for ?
Read on to find out what gear you really need to take your vlog to the next level .
What Is the Best Equipment for Vlogging ?
Here we ’re going to break down each category of vlogging equipment and bring you the best picks for 2020 .
Lights , camera , action !
Camera
First things first , every prospective vlogger needs a great camera .
A common misconception is that you need to spend a lot of money to guarantee superior video quality , but this simply is n’t true .
Of course , much depends on the kind of content you ’ll be filming .
Some bloggers can make do with their smartphone camera or a GoPro .
Others will need something a little more technical , however .
You might want to opt for a camcorder .
These are great for recording video , but are n’t so adept at photography if you ’re looking for some versatile equipment .
What ’s more , in certain conditions such as low - lighting , they can result in grainy footage .
Otherwise , you could go for a DSLR .
These can be used for photography as well as videos , and offer both a viewfinder and a screen so you can watch what you ’re filming , as you film it .
Panasonic , Canon , and Sony all offer decent DSLR options .
A DSLR is of course going to be more expensive than using the smartphone that you already own .
But this is what ’s going to give your vlog that professional look .
Microphone
Next , let ’s take a look at microphones .
Almost all cameras will come with a built - in microphone , however , very often is n’t going to cut it .
Sub - par audio is a surefire way to distract , and repel , viewers .
The first option is a DSLR microphone .
These are a great choice because they simply mount on top of your DSLR ( or mirrorless ) camera , so are easy to use .
What ’s more , they pick up only the sound that you actually want to record – e.g. whatever the microphone is facing .
Some recommended models for a DSLR microphone are the Rode VideoMic Pro , the Sennheiser MKK400 , and the Azden SMX - 10 .
Other types of microphones include lavalier and USB microphones .
The lavalier mic captures great quality audio but has limited usage and a complicated set - up .
These days , vloggers tend to shun the ‘ unfashionable ’ look of a microphone clipped to a shirt below the speaker ’s mouth .
As for USB microphones , these are well suited to voice - over work .
If you ’re sat at your desk , and need to record audio without video ( they ’re a bit of an eyesore ! ) , this could be the best option for you .
Tripod
Now , let ’s turn to tripods .
Tripods are essential to avoiding shaky video footage .
Unless you ’re selecting this style intentionally , perhaps as part of a “ day in the life ” vlog , shaky camera work is to be avoided at all costs !
Tripods come in different sizes , and beware that the smaller models wo n’t be a good match for larger camera lenses .
The tripod you choose will be determined by the camera model you go for .
The support you require also depends on the kind of vlogging you want to do .
If you ’ll be based in one primary , indoor location , the Magnus VT - 4000 might be a good option .
However , if you ’re an on - the - go vlogger , you might need something more lightweight .
GorillaPod is a popular brand of tripods , especially for travel - vlogging , as they are extremely portable and flexible .
They can attach to just about anything , and the smaller models can double up as a selfie - stick .
Software
Of course , once you ’ve shot your footage , the work is n’t over .
Next , you ’ll need an editing program to put together what you ’ve filmed .
Computers often come with free editing software already installed , however , if you ’re serious about vlogging , you ’ll need to invest in a more advanced program .
There are different options when it comes to paying a one - off fee to use the software , or a monthly fee that rolls over .
Also , sometimes editing software is Windows - or Mac- specific .
A few popular options include Final Cut Pro X by Apple , Adobe Premiere Pro , and Vegas Movie Studio .
The best option for you will depend on your budget and existing hardware .
However , you can rest easy knowing that although it might take some time getting to grips with these programs , there are hundreds of tutorial videos available on YouTube .
Lighting
Finally , let ’s take a look at lighting .
Much like the other categories we ’ve looked at , the best lighting option for you is going to depend on the style of vlogging you ’re in to .
In fact , for many vlogging categories out there , you may not need to invest in any lighting products at all .
However , a couple of good options for keeping a subject well - lit in indoor settings are ring lights and soft - light kits .
These are great versatile lighting options , with ring lights being on the cheaper end of the scale .
While these are examples of more basic vlogging lighting equipment , if you ’re going to be incorporating a green screen into your videos , you will of course need something more technical .
The key is ensuring a consistent light across the frame .
Litepanels and Kino are two recommended brands for this more advanced lighting technique .
Which Are the Best Products for Me ?
Now you know our picks for the best equipment for vlogging in 2020 .
We ’ve covered everything from camcorder vs DSLR , to the best shotgun microphones , and you should have a good idea of what vlogging gear you need to get started and to ensure high - quality content .

Two years ago , New Hampshire refused to accept heating oil from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , the pro-Castro U.S. critic who once called President Bush “ the devil . ”
But with fuel prices rising , well , free oil is free oil .
With the state ’s blessing , New Hampshire residents will be receiving some of the fuel this winter .
New Hampshire becomes the last state in the Northeast to embrace the offer .
“ A lot of people have said , ‘ We need help and we value any help we can get , ’ ” said Amy Ignatius , director of the state ’s office of energy and planning .

The oil giveaway will be managed by Citizens Energy , a nonprofit organization set up by former Massachusetts Rep. Joseph Kennedy to help the poor stay warm .
But the state energy office plans to help Citizens publicize the aid and sign up fuel - oil dealers .
Back in 2006 , when Chavez began offering free oil to Americans from Venezuela ’s government - controlled Citgo , New Hampshire ’s energy office contacted the Venezuelan Embassy about a deal .
But the idea galled some New Hampshire Republicans , including Sen. John E. Sununu , who called it a “ disgrace ” and an attempt at grandstanding by Chavez .
Democratic Gov. John Lynch squelched the deal .
Two years ago , heating oil sold for about $ 2.50 per gallon in the Northeast .

Last month , the average price was $ 4.61 , and it could reach $ 5 by winter .
The average tank holds 250 to 275 gallons .
Filling it can cost more than $ 1,200 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- John Edwards , who made his marriage a central part of his overall message during the 2008 Democratic primaries -- was dealt a political blow Friday after admitting to having an extramarital affair .
Former Sen. John Edwards has been listed as a possible 2008 vice presidential candidate .
In an interview on ABC News " Nightline , " Edwards acknowledged the affair with 42 - year - old Rielle Hunter , which began after she was hired to make documentary videos for his campaign , ABC said .
Opinions , however , are mixed on whether he would have a future in politics .
CNN contributor James Carville , a former aide to Bill Clinton -- who acknowledged an extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky in his second term -- said Edwards ' career is in dire straits .
" Certainly , his political career is in shambles .
It 's not going to come back .
I humanly feel sorry for Mrs. Edwards .
I feel sorry for the Edwards children .
But I 'm not shocked , " he said Friday .
Watch analyst discuss what 's next for Edwards »
Elizabeth Edwards , in a posting on the Daily Kos Web site , said , " The fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done .
" But he did tell me .
And we began a long and painful process in 2006 , a process oddly made somewhat easier with my [ cancer ] diagnosis in March of 2007 .
This was our private matter , and I frankly wanted it to be private , because as painful as it was , I did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well . "
Like Carville , CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger said this incident could hurt his career .
" Obviously , lying like this , brazenly , is going to put an end , probably , to his political career and could affect whether he gets any role if Barack Obama were to win the presidency , " she said Friday .
The former North Carolina senator , who was often mentioned as a possible candidate for Obama 's vice presidential pick , does not believe that his admission will have a long - lasting impact on his career .
Edwards , the vice presidential candidate during Sen .
John Kerry 's 2004 presidential bid , told ABC on Friday that he never expected to be chosen as Obama 's running mate but that his public career has not ended .
He said he would not worry about any possible positions in an Obama administration .
Watch more on the Edwards controversy »
" I do n't know what 's possible and what 's gone , " he said .
Don Fowler , a former Democratic Party chairman , said this week that Edwards might be forfeiting a major role at the party 's upcoming convention in Denver -- or in a future Democratic administration -- unless he cleared the air .
" I think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to , the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot , " Fowler said .
iReport : What 's your reaction to Edwards ' affair ?
Obama , in Hawaii for a weeklong vacation , said he understands that Edwards does not plan to attend the convention .
" This is a difficult and painful time for them , and I think they need to work through that process of healing , " he said .
" My sense is that that 's going to be their top priority . "
CNN senior political analyst David Gergen , who served as a White House adviser to Presidents Nixon , Ford , Reagan and Clinton , said Democrats could have been hurt if Edwards had clinched the Democratic nomination .
" He put the Democratic Party in real jeopardy , " he said .
" If he had been the nominee of the party now , and this thing had blown up ... it would have -- it would have ruined the Democrats ' chances of taking back the White House . "
Edwards announced in January that he was dropping out of the 2008 Democratic presidential race .
He endorsed Obama in early May .
He trailed Sen. Hillary Clinton and Obama in the early contests .
He came in third in key races in New Hampshire and South Carolina .
Gergen added that the Democratic Party needs to " move swiftly " to resolve this political firestorm so it does n't linger with voters this fall .
Speaking in support of Obama in Las Vegas , Nevada , on Friday , Clinton responded briefly to a reporter 's question about what impact the revelation of the affair would have on Democrats .
" My thoughts and prayer are with the Edwards family today , " she said .
" That 's all I have to say . "
Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said Friday that Edwards ' infidelity may affect both parties ' images .

" The questions are going to be asked , does this hurt Republicans or Democrats , or the political impact .
And the truth is that it 's going to hurt everybody , because right now , in an uncertain world , we 're looking to see who we can trust to lead the country , and this lessens , I think , faith in political leadership in general , " he said Friday .
Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala said Edwards ' affair will result in a " larger loss of faith in institutions . "
" But keep in mind , you know , John Edwards did not order that anyone be tortured .
He did not violate the Geneva Convention .
He did not forge a document to lead us into a war .
He cheated on his wife , " he said .
Begala added that although this is a shortcoming for the former senator and a personal tragedy for him and his family , he holds no public office .

ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - Anheuser - Busch Cos BUD.N will stop selling energy drinks that contain alcohol in the United States under an agreement with 11 state attorneys general who had alleged that the brewer was marketing the products to underage drinkers .
The St. Louis company said on Thursday it has stopped producing caffeinated versions of its Bud Extra and Tilt malt beverage products , and was reformulating them to remove caffeine and guarana , another stimulant .
“ We have determined that competing in the prepackaged caffeinated alcohol beverage sector may detract from our reputation as the global industry leader in promoting responsibility among adults who drink and discouraging underage drinking , ” Francine Katz , vice president of communications and consumer affairs for Anheuser , said in a statement .
Attorneys general from the states -- Arizona , California , Connecticut , Idaho , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , New Mexico , Ohio and New York -- praised Anheuser - Busch and called on other makers of alcoholic energy drinks to halt their sale and marketing .
The attorneys general said they were investigating as many as 15 other companies that make similar drinks .
Anheuser - Busch controls nearly half the U.S. beer market with brands like Budweiser .
The attorneys general said their investigation , which began more than a year ago , showed Anheuser - Busch made false and misleading statements about the health effects of Tilt and Bud Extra , and that ads were aimed at consumers under the age of 21 .
“ We were concerned that these beverages were being aggressively marketed over the Internet with a strong focus on college populations , ” Maine Attorney General Steven Rowe said during a conference call .
The state officials said the alcoholic energy drinks were marketed with promotional giveaways for things like free music downloads .
“ The nature and tenor and content of the ads was clearly targeting underage drinkers as well as others , ” Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said .
The settlement revives a controversy that fueled Anheuser ’s decision last year to pull its Spykes drinks from the market after advocacy groups and others accused the company of targeting underage drinkers .
As part of the settlement , Anheuser - Busch will also pay $ 200,000 to participating states .
Anheuser and Miller Brewing Co , which is part of SABMiller PLC SAB.L , had said in February that they had received demands from several state attorneys general about how they market and sell caffeinated alcoholic drinks .
Anheuser , which has received a $ 46.3 billion takeover offer from InBev NV INTB.BR , said in its statement that although both Tilt and Bud Extra had met regulatory requirements and received necessary state and federal agency approvals , it would reformulate them in response to the concerns of the attorneys general .
The brewer added that it may take several weeks for the caffeinated versions of Bud Extra and Tilt to sell out .
The incident took place in the Sangin district of Helmand
British troops in southern Afghanistan have killed four civilians and injured three others after a vehicle failed to stop at a checkpoint .
Soldiers opened fire on the vehicle north of Sangin town centre in Helmand Province , suspecting that those inside were insurgents , Nato said .
The wounded were taken to a field hospital at the UK's Camp Bastion .
The Ministry of Defence expressed regret over the incident and said the driver had ignored warning shots .
A spokesman said there was always a risk vehicles which failed to stop could contain explosives .
He added : " It 's regrettable that this has happened but it 's very hard to make these decisions . "
The International Security Assistance Force said the situation had been " caused by the reckless actions of the vehicle driver ' ' .
An investigation into the incident is to take place .
British medical personnel treated the three injured civilians at the scene before they were taken to the nearby Camp Inkerman for further checks .
They were later transferred by helicopter to Camp Bastion .
Suicide attacks
Helmand is one of the most dangerous areas in Afghanistan , with Taleban insurgents active .
The BBC's Alastair Leithead said it had been a " bad week " for troops at Camp Inkerman .
Dog handler L/ Cpl Kenneth Michael Rowe , 24 , was killed after a patrol came under attack from the Taleban and a soldier was injured when a British mortar bomb fell short .
In June , a suicide bomber killed three troops in the area .
Our correspondent said : " Suicide attacks are a major risk in the Sangin valley . "
In recent years there have been a number of such incidents .
Troops have warned civilians to keep away from their convoys and checkpoints .
However , some Afghans , apparently unaware that they are seen as a threat , have failed to heed these warnings .
Sudan says an indictment of Mr Bashir would harm any prospects of peace
Sudan 's president has been accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court .
Luis Moreno - Ocampo told judges at The Hague that Omar al - Bashir bore criminal responsibility for alleged atrocities committed over the past five years .
The three - judge panel must now decide whether there are reasonable grounds for an arrest warrant to be issued .
Sudan 's foreign ministry said it did not recognise the ICC or its decisions .
" This document is certainly politically motivated , " one cabinet minister , al - Samani al - Wasila , told BBC Arabic TV .
Accusing Mr Moreno - Ocampo of taking sides , the official recalled that he had previously likened Sudan to a Nazi state .
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BASHIR Genocide : Killing members of the Fur , Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups Causing these groups serious bodily or mental harm Inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about these groups ' physical destruction Crimes against humanity : Murder Extermination Forcible transfer Rape Torture War crimes : Attacks on civilians in Darfur Pillaging towns and villages
Bashir move bold but problematic
Noose tightens around Bashir China 's secret war in Sudan
" We shall adopt all measures necessary to ensure the security of our country and people , the head of the state and Sudan 's sovereignty , " he added .
Sudan has refused to hand over two suspects who Mr Moreno - Ocampo charged last year , Humanitarian Affairs Minister Ahmad Harun and militia leader Ali Kushayb .
It has also labelled Mr Moreno - Ocampo a criminal , and warned that any indictment could stall peace talks and cause mayhem in Sudan .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he expected Sudan to " ensure the safety and security of all United Nations personnel and property " there despite the allegations .
The White House urged all parties in Sudan to " remain calm " , saying it would " monitor the situation " in The Hague .
US National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe stressed that the US was not part of the ICC .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged Khartoum to co-operate with the ICC .

There was no immediate formal reaction from Russia or from China , which is Sudan 's biggest arms supplier .
Some 300,000 people have died as a result of the conflict in Darfur since 2003 while more than two million people have fled their homes , the UN estimates .
Sudan 's government denies mobilising Arab Janjaweed militias to attack black African civilians in Darfur since rebels took up arms in 2003 .
' Absolute control '
Mr Moreno - Ocampo's report found " reasonable grounds " for believing Mr Bashir bore criminal responsibility on 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes .
He had allegedly " masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the Fur , Masalit and Zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity " after they rebelled .
" His motives were largely political , " Mr Moreno - Ocampo said .
" His alibi was a ' counterinsurgency ' .
His intent was genocide . "
Pro-government militias allegedly followed Mr Bashir 's orders to attack and destroy villages from the three groups , pursuing survivors into the desert .
Those who reached camps for displaced people faced further violence , Mr Moreno - Ocampo alleged :
" In the camps Bashir 's forces kill the men and rape the women .
I do n't have the luxury to look away .
I have evidence . "
Mr Moreno - Ocampo accused the Sudanese president of using his " absolute control " of the state apparatus to conceal the truth and protect his subordinates " in order to secure their willingness to commit genocide " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I strongly support the ICC 's move , I do not want to see people dying anymore .
Job , Sudan
The UN has already raised the security alert level for its staff in Darfur .
The joint United Nations - African Union Mission in Darfur ( Unamid ) , which has 9,000 troops , has been struggling to contain the violence .
The ICC was set up in 2002 as the world 's first permanent war crimes court .
Other international courts have previously indicted Serbia 's President Slobodan Milosevic and President Charles Taylor of Liberia .

Technology has democratized the music industry in many obvious ways – notice how every band , regardless of stature , has a MySpace page ?
But one of technology 's more subtle effects has been to make our sound systems smaller , lighter and greener .
The special sauce : Class D amplifiers , the first real advance in speaker design in decades .
These amps were once thought to be appropriate only for low - end audio devices like cellphones .
But with continuing refinements they have started showing up in everything from flat panel televisions and computers to high - end sound systems .
" Imagine a light bulb in your house , " said NHT audio engineer Gordon Chang .
" If you turn it on all the way , it 's too bright , and if you turn it off , it 's too dim .
Now if you turn it on and off really quickly , you can get the light to look like it 's halfway between on and off . "
Traditional amplifiers achieve the same effect using electrical resistance , similar to a dimmer switch that controls the light .
Those resistors turn valuable electricity into unwanted heat , which necessitates bulkier design .
Ever wonder why your ultra - thin panel television sounds so great despite having so little real estate dedicated to audio ?
The Class D amplifier , which is having a massive , albeit largely unacknowledged effect on consumer audio devices , is responsible .
" The big advantage with Class D amplifiers is that they 're much more efficient from an energy usage point of view than conventional Class AB amplifiers , which are what you 've seen in most audio equipment up until now , " said John Widder , market development manager at STMIcroelectronics , a semiconductor manufacturer .
He said Class AB amps typically run at between 15 and 40 percent efficiency when playing back music , while Class D amps run at between 40 and 85 percent .
And that 's only part of the picture .
" The advantages of that efficiency then ripple through the entire system … power supplies can be smaller , or if it 's battery operated equipment , the battery life is longer , " said Widder .
" But then , in addition , because the amplifier 's more efficient it has less heat to get rid of , so heat sinks can be smaller , or maybe ( the devices ) do n't even have a heat sink at all , which makes the equipment then smaller and lighter .
You can have things like five or seven channel home theater systems in very small boxes with very high output power . "
These efficient designs lower shipping costs and ultimately contribute less mass to our planet 's landfills .
The effect may be negligible on a per-unit basis , but when you consider that Class D could result in the vast majority of the world 's sound - producing electronics consuming less than half as much energy as they used to and they are being manufactured at much smaller sizes , it 's clear that the economically - driven trend towards Class D amplifiers will have a significant positive effect on the environment .
Class D amplifiers are superior to their predecessors in many ways ,
but none of them matter to music fans unless they sound good , too .
" Initially , " explained Widder , " Class D was only used inapplications where audio was a secondary consideration " such as incellphones .
No longer .
Most high - end plasma and LCD televisions now useClass D amplifiers , as do several home theater systems .
I too can bearwitness to how excellent Class D can sound , having reviewed the Kuller Aux Out400 , a $ 1,000 audiophile - quality bookshelf system .
Longconsidered unworthy of high - end music applications , Class D's more recent specs are praiseworthy :
sub - tenth - of - a- percent total harmonic distortion and frequency responseequivalent to that of Class AB ( see diagram ) .
Class D even has somesonic advantages over its predecessor , says Widder : " low – or even zero –
crossover distortion " ( which occurs in Class AB amps when one outputstage takes over for another ) and " very high dynamic range andsignal - to - noise ratios " ( meaning that it has many levels between softand loud , with very little noise interfering with the sound of themusic ) .
So who 's making this stuff ?
ABI Research analyst Steve Wilson told us that twocompanies are responsible for a good amount of the high - end Class D
electronics in home theater setups : IcePower ( a division of Bang & Olufson ) and D2Audio .
Meanwhile , a company called TriPath made the chips used by the Aux Out 400 speaker set I liked so much – a version of Class D it calls " Class T " ( for TriPath ) .
Atthis point , anyone with even a mild geeky streak will want to know howClass D's sound improved enough to spread from cellphones to hometheater systems , where sound quality is a big priority .
As it turns out ,
the change has been largely a matter of filtering and design .
Sincea Class
D amplifier has an output that switches between on and off , thenoise created by that switching must be filtered out .
" You just have tobe careful with the filter design and circuit board layout , " saidWidder .
" It takes a little more work on the part of the designer . "
Asword spreads among the audio community that Class D amps are ready forprime time , we can only expect these design improvements to multiply .
Class D amplifiers maynot have much name recognition , but they 're already changing the ways welisten to music , with the welcome side effect of shrinking and greening the world 's audio hardware .
A little respect is long overdue .

Introduction
The Ubuntu developers are moving very quickly to bring you the absolute latest and greatest software the Open Source Community has to offer .
Hardy Heron Alpha 5 is the fifth alpha release of Ubuntu 8.04 , and with this new alpha release comes a whole host of excellent new features .
Note :
This is still an alpha release .
Do not install it on production machines .
The final stable version will be released in April 2008 .
In General
These features are showcased for your attention .
Please test them and report any bugs you find .
If you want to see what the developers have cooking for the next alpha release , take a look through the Hardy blueprints page : https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/hardy
Upgrading from Ubuntu 7.10
To upgrade from Ubuntu 7.10 , press Alt+f2 and run " update - manager - d " .
Then click on " update " .
Xorg 7.3
The latest Xorg is available in Hardy , Xorg 7.3 , with an emphasis on better autoconfiguration with a minimal configuration file .
Linux kernel 2.6.24
Alpha 5 includes the 2.6.24-8.14 ( 2.6.24.2 - based ) kernel .
This brings in significant enhancements and fixes that have been merged in the last few months into the mainline kernel .
Among these is the introduction of dynticks support for amd64 , bringing the same power savings already available on 32 - bit systems to 64 - bit laptops and desktops .
PulseAudio
Alpha 5 includes PulseAudio enabled by default .
Some non-GNOME applications still need to be changed to output to pulse / esd by default and the volume control tools are still not integrated .
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/cleanup-audio-jumble
PolicyKit
With Alpha 5 , Policy Kit integration is visible in the administrative user interfaces .
Policy
Kit makes it possible to run administrative applications as a normal user , and have them get a particular set of extra privileges for certain operations , which allows fine - grained control over user permissions and enhances usability , as well as eliminating the security implications of running the whole application as root .
For details of Policy Kit integration in Hardy , refer to the policykit - integration blueprint .
Firefox 3 Beta 3
Firefox 3 Beta 3 replaces Firefox 2 as the default browser in Alpha 5 , bringing much better system integration including icon and colour theming that matches the system , as well as GTK2 form buttons and open dialog .
Transmission
The GTK version of the popular Transmission Bit Torrent client comes with Alpha 5 .
It 's set to replace the Gnome Bit Torrent downloader .
Vinagre
The new Vinagre VNC client is installed by default in Alpha 5 , replacing xvnc4viewer .
Vinagre allows the user to view multiple machines simultaneously , can discover VNC servers on the network via Avahi , and can keep track of recently used and favorite connections .
Brasero
The Brasero CD / DVD burning application , which will complement the CD / DVD burning functions of Nautilus and replace the Serpentine audio CD burning utility , is installed by default in Alpha 5 .
World Clock Applet
Integrating the features of the intlclock applet , the GNOME panel clock in Alpha 5 can display the time and weather in multiple locations .
GVFS
Nautilus 2.21.6 in Alpha 5 uses GVFS , the virtual filesystem abstraction layer that 's set to replace the aging GnomeVFS in GNOME 2.22 , as its backend .
In the near future , GVFS will make it possible to fix shortcomings of Nautilus such as the inability to restore files from trash , pause and undo file operations , and make it possible to escalate user privileges for certain operations using Policy Kit for authentication .
It also brings a significant performance boost to many operations .
GNOME System Monitor
The GNOME System Monitor has a revamped " Resources " tab , with Cairo graphs that scroll and scale smoothly , and brand new widgets .
Virtualization
KVM is now officially maintained within the Ubuntu kernel .
libvirt and virt - manager have been adapted to Ubuntu .
They allow for easy guest creation and basic management out of the box .
Virt - manager can be used to remotely administer guests on a remote server .
They also work with XEN , even though it is not officially maintained .
The kernel also includes the virtio modifications which should greatly improve guest I /O access .
Firewall
ufw ( Uncomplicated Firewall ) is a new firewall application designed to make administering a firewall easier for end - users while not getting in the way of network administrators .
Currently , ufw is a command - line interface for administering host - based firewalls .
For more details , read the UbuntuFirewall specification .
umenu
WinFOSS and the Windows open source software have been replaced by umenu , a simple launcher that lets the user install Ubuntu from Windows using Wubi ( see below ) , install Ubuntu to a partition without having to make their CD - ROM the first boot device , and find out more about Ubuntu at the www.ubuntu.com website .
Wubi
There is a new installation option for Windows users .
Wubi allows users to install and uninstall Ubuntu like any other Windows application .
It does not require a dedicated partition , nor does it affect the existing bootloader , yet users can experience a dual - boot setup almost identical to a full installation .
Wubi works with a physical CD or in stand - alone mode , by downloading an appropriate ISO to install from .
It can be found on the root of the CD as Wubi.exe .
A full installation within a dedicated partition is still recommended , but Wubi is a great way to try Ubuntu for a few days and weeks before committing dedicated disk resources .

Caveats
There are several known bugs that users are likely to run into with Hardy Alpha 5 .
We have documented them here for your convenience along with any known workarounds , so that you do n't need to spend time reporting these bugs again :
The kernel in Alpha 5 is unable to access CD - ROM devices in some configurations , which means some users who were previously able to install Ubuntu will not be able to install this alpha from CD media .
As a workaround , users can boot the installer with the additional " all_generic_ide " boot option .
https://launchpad.net/bugs/181561
Video problems have been reported with the 64 - bit ( amd64 ) version of Edubuntu desktop .
As a workaround , users can manually specify a video resolution at the boot menu .
https://launchpad.net/bugs/173130
Video problems have been reported with the 64 - bit ( amd64 ) versions of Ubuntu desktops and some NVIDIA graphics cards .
As a workaround , users can remove the " splash " boot option at the boot menu .
https://launchpad.net/bugs/147623
Users with an older ATI Radeon graphics card might have video problems .
As a workaround , you can boot the livecd with a failsafe mode , and after installation add ' Option " AGPMode " " 4 " ' to the " Device " section of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf .
https://launchpad.net/bugs/133192
Due to the switch to GVFS , which is not feature complete , the " Network " item in the Places menu does n't work , and Nautilus can behave erratically , especially in trash operations .
Refrain from operating on valuable files with this version .
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/185756
The desktop launcher for Firefox does not work in Alpha 5 , as a consequence of the change from Firefox 2 to Firefox 3 .
The fix for this issue is in progress .
As a workaround , Firefox can be launched from the Applications -> Internet menu .
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/193902
Printing from Firefox beta 3 does not work .
Investigation of this problem is ongoing .
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/194486
Problems running Wubi , the Windows Ubuntu installer , with the 64 - bit ( amd64 ) version of Ubuntu have been reported .
As a workaround , users should run Wubi from the i386 CD images .
Suspend ( to ram ) and hibernation do not work in a Wubi installation .
Even if those options are available on the desktop , you should avoid using them .
When running Wubi from a Kubuntu CD , the KDE desktop will crash and the user will be left with just a X cursor , however the install will continue and it will reboot automatically upon completion .

The Alpha 5 release notes were brought to you by :
The sharp decline in Chinese stocks is approaching a milestone : With a 4 % drop Friday , the market has fallen by nearly half since its peak last fall .
The decline has wiped out nearly $ 2.5 trillion of wealth and is testing the government 's apparent resolve to let the market find equilibrium on its own .
The plunge has slashed the savings of millions of Chinese investors who jumped into the market as it rose six - fold in two years .
It is crimping expansion in the country 's nascent financial sector and may put a squeeze in corporate ...
“ Going eco - friendly … does n’t that cost extra ? ”
Tired of hearing that line ?
So are we .
So let ’s bury this assumption once and for all !
Here ’s how to save a ton of cash .
1. Change to Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs .
LED lightbulbs will be greener , but right now they ’re pricey – while CFLs are usually less than $ 2 each .
And it ’s a field of constant innovation .
Between $ 15 and $ 50 per bulb over 5 years .
2. Buy a Solar Oven
Red - hot innovation .
Remember burning holes in paper with a magnifying glass ?
These appliances focus the sun ’s rays onto your food and cook it as thoroughly as a traditional oven – without using a spark of electricity .
So simple you can even make them yourself .
These replace the standard convection ovens which use around $ 0.10 of electricity an hour – and then there ’s gas .
3. Stop Using Washing Powder
There are mineral - salt - powered equivalents to washing powder , like the Ecoballs “ flying saucers ” .
And yes , they work .
$ 200 - $ 400 per 1000 washes .
4. Use a Programmable Thermostat
Over half of American homes do n’t have them : that ’s a lot of homes being heated when they do n’t need to be .
Install one today ( say , a Ventstar Flat Stat ) and watch your heating bills plummet .
Calculate your exact saving here ( Microsoft Excel spreadsheet ) .
5. Avoid Gas-powered Lawnmowers
They ’re wasteful and polluting – and avoidable .
Use one of the newer brand of push reel mower – or , if you have some money to invest , solar - convert !
With a gas - powered lawnmower , an hour ’s grass - cutting is around 100 miles in your car .
UPDATE : While any gas savings are money in your pocket , the above statement refers to the pollution created by an hour ’s grass - cutting – here ’s Science Daily on this .
6. Walk or Cycle to the Shops
You use the most fuel at low speeds and when you start your car .
So short trips really are n’t worth it – cycle or walk instead .
Give yourself longer to shop ( you can cut down on gym time to balance things ) – and carry less by shopping more often .
With rising fuel prices , you can expect any fuel economy savings to grow and grow .
7. Only Start Your Car When You ’re Ready to Drive It
Make sure everyone ’s in before turning the key .
And waiting for someone for more than 60 seconds ?
Kill the engine .
You ’re more likely to consume more fuel idling than restarting .
It ’s been estimated that idling Burger King customers waste 16 million gallons of gas a year .
8. Pack a Lunch
Prepacked sandwiches : all that plastic , and how much money ?
So make your own : it ’s vastly cheaper and more fun ( you get to choose the fillings ) .
Personal estimate : Making my own – $ 15 / wk .
Shop - bought – $ 30 - 50 / wk .
9. Clothes : Let the Wind Do It for You
Tumble - drying needs huge amounts of energy ( see below ) .
So go for a combination of an eco-friendly spin dryer for when it ’s raining , and washing lines ( standard or fancy ) for when the sun ’s shining .
Tumble dryers use around 2.5 kwH of electricity per hour .
Compared with the rest of your appliances , that ’s huge .
Dry naturally , and you ’ll save $ 100s a year .
Oh , and millions of tons of CO2 .
10 . Kill the Lights
If your room ’s a bit gloomy , do n’t just reach for the lightswitch .
Think about how to get more daylight into your room – whether simply by moving furniture around , or guiding the light in with sunpipes or mirrors .
Banishing the lights for the night will have a significant impact on your electricity bill .
Even turning them on an hour later than before will make a difference .
11 . Harvest the Rain
Catch rainwater in water butts or more sophisticated arrangements , and you have a ready supply of water for anything except drinking ( you ’d need fairly expensive filtration to make it safe ) .
Up to half your water bill .
12 . Grow Your Own .
We want to see the return of Victory Gardens , using every neglected square inch of everyone ’s back yard to grow vegetables .
Food miles turn into food inches , and the results taste better than you could have imagined if you ’re been eating the mass - produced variety .
Also , buy locally produced food – it ’s just other people ’s Victory Gardens !
Huge savings on grocery bills .
13 . Unplug When You Go
There ’s a great deal of concern about energy being invisibly wasted , particularly with modern devices that have a “ standby ” setting .
So when you ’ve finished with the electronic marvel of your choice – unplug it .
Anything from $ 50 a year upwards per household is spent on keeping those little red LEDs glowing .
14 . Heat Your Water through the Ground
It ’s cutting - edge , so it ’s certainly not cheap – but ground source heat pumps are the next big thing in eco-friendly house design .
They run some of your water supply through the ground where it picks up natural geothermal energy .
Result : toasty - hot water for free !
Your central heating bill will evaporate .
15 . A/C Is Better than Heating
If you can find an alternative to using your electric A/C unit , use it – but remember that it ’s much less eco -hostile to cool the house down than it is to heat it up .
So when the house gets cold , think layers layers layers .
See it as a challenge – to make your Winter electricity bill lower than the summer one !
UPDATE : Thanks to Dougal for pointing out that despite news reports to the contrary , the claim that air - conditioning is more cost - effective than heating has been repudiated by RealClimate .
16 . Wash Colder
As Allison noted a while back , 90 % of the energy used to wash clothes goes into heating the water .
Wash on a cooler setting , and you save energy …
… and that saves you money on your bill .
Could n’t be easier .
17 . Eat Less Meat
Meat is the most expensive item on the average food bill .
It ’s therefore ironic that we eat too much of it – and no , I ’m not vegetarian ( although that ’s an excellent argument against meat as well ) .
Meat is a delicacy , not a staple – so do n’t be afraid of having a few no -meat days during the week .
500g T - bone steak – $ 20 .
Just sayin’ .
18 . Waste Not , Spend Not
If you ’re the average American , you buy four bags of groceries , and you throw one of them straight in the trash .
No , really .
So learn to make the most of the food you buy : soups , stews , freezing , composting , you name it .
One quarter ( or more specifically , 27 % ) of your food bill , right there .
19 . When It Comes to Technology , Newest Usually Means Most Expensive
With technology , everyone loves shiny and new things – particularly us men ( a genetic flaw , perhaps ) .
But if there ’s a second - hand , perfectly functioning alternative , we should go with it .
So become a retrophiliac , and always try to buy last year ’s technology , first - or second - hand .
Regarding full retail price , look at what happened with the iPhone .
20 . Make Fashion Fit You
There ’s no cutting corners on quality clothing – except when a professional tailor is doing it for you .
If you want to look fabulous on a budget , trawl your city ’s second - hand options and find items that are near your size – then have them adjusted .
A guy ’s perspective : in this manner I saved $ 200 on a suit last year .
21 . Work in the 21st Century
The Information Revolution has changed the way we work .
Telecommuting is a much cheaper option to spending 3 hours in traffic .
Videoconferencing beats the real thing in bucks .
So find ways to avoid those costly long hauls to and from work .
( Even if the company ’s paying ! ) .
Or are you saying that your own time is n’t valuable to you ?
22 . Shop in the 21st Century
Always support your local traders – they ’re where you ’ll most likely to get the best - quality goods .
But when it comes to the harder - to - get items … shop online .
You save on packaging and ( depending on the items ) you save on gas , because it ’s delivered to your door by someone who was on the road anyway .
And yes , shopping online is almost always cheaper – if not quite as tactile and fun !
23 . Carry a Tote Bag
It prevents urban tumbleweed .
It ’s stylish .
And it ’s tougher than those flimsy supermarket bags …
… which you ’re increasingly being asked to pay for ( by companies that lack the nerve to ban them altogether ) .
24 . Clean the House with Cents , not Dollars
Household cleaners are expensive .
So do n’t buy them .
Go for the natural , non-polluting options that are just as effective , available everywhere and cost next to nothing .
Miracle cleaners miraculously wipe out your budget .
Lemons , on the other hand , are cheap .
and finally …
25 . Go Green .
In the bad old days , you paid extra for an eco-conscious lifestyle .
Now , eco-friendliness is the norm – and in more and more cases , not choosing green is the way to overspend .
Choose green , save money , help the planet .
There is no catch .

Exxon spends 1 % of record profits on alternative energy David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This On Thursday , Exxon announced its largest profits ever : $ 11.68 billion in the second quarter of 2008 .
Yet with all that money , says ABC's Good Morning America , the oil giant only spent 1 percent on alternative energy sources .
" Today 's announcement of Exxon 's massive profits continues what has been a very good year for big oil , " reports ABC .
" Just how good ?
Well , it 's expected to be even better than last year , when the combined sales of the top five oil companies added up to $ 1.5 trillion .
That 's greater than the GDP of Canada . "
With oil prices up nearly 50 percent from the same time last year , and demands for alternative , renewable sources of energy on the rise , what is Exxon doing with its record - breaking , windfall profits ?
ABC News " crunched the numbers . "
" They 're probably spending more on the advertising than they are actually spending on the actual research , " said Bernard Picchi , a senior managing director with Wall Street Access .
" Exxon has publicly said that it is not in the renewable energy business , but rather focused on oil and gas , " said the report .
" So it should be no surprise that out of the five largest oil companies , Exxon spent just 1 percent of its $ 41 billion in profits last year on alternative energy sources . "
Among the other oil giants , said the report , British Petroleum spent the most on renewable energy in 2007 : some 2.9 percent of its $ 21 billion profit .
" What the spent on alternative energy was just a drop in the bucket , " said Picchi .
" Probably about $ 2 billion .

And the world passeth away ...
by David J. Stewart | March 2007 | Updated August 2016
“ And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever . ” — 1st John 2:15
Please understand that I do n't condemn anyone , for the Bible condemns all of us as guilty , dirty , rotten , hell - deserving sinners .
My salvation solely rests in Christ 's righteousness , because of the precious blood that He gave for our sins .
My intention is not to be unkind ; but rather , to address the issue of salvation .
On March 9th , 2007 I was saddened to hear about the suicide of Boston lead singer Brad Delp , who was only 55 .
What many fans of Boston do n't know is that all vocals on the first three albums were sang by Brad Delp exclusively .
That 's quite amazing from a musician 's perspective .
Tom Scholz , the bands leader , has often been referred to as a musical genius .
Boston 's debut album , Boston ( 1976 ) , sold over 17,000,000 copies !
Photos Left and Right : Brad Delp in 1970 , and then in 2006 .
Tragically , Brad Delp committed suicide on March 9th by placing two charcoal grills in his bathtub in New Hampshire .
He died of carbon monoxide poisoning .
Mr. Delp had been a vegetarian for 37 years , and took care of his health .
Brad certainly was n't your typical drug - addict , wild - partying Rocker .
Brad was known to break out the apple juice after his concerts instead of booze .
Sadly , and tragically , I fear that Brad Delp is suffering in Hell this moment .
Jesus said in Matthew 16:26 , " For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ? "
Jesus plainly taught in John 3:3 , " Except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God . "
Being a nice guy like Brad , who raised lots of money for various charities , and was a decent person , just is n't enough to merit Heaven .
I know this upsets many people to hear , but you 'd better obey the Bible .
The Scriptures tell us frankly that Heaven cannot be merited in any way ( Ephesians 2:8 - 9 , Titus 3:5 ; Romans 10:3 - 4 ) .
The only people who get mad at me are the people who do n't believe the Bible .
If you believe that the Bible is God 's inspired Words , then you will agree with my Biblical preaching concerning the necessity of being born again .
All I am saying is that Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven .
I do not know where Brad Delp went , but he is either in Heaven or Hell .
I do n't know if he died IN THE LORD ( Revelation 14:13 ) or IN HIS SINS ( John 8:24 ) .
Jesus said that except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of God ( John 3:5 ) .
We are all living on borrowed time my friend .
Brad 's high vocal range on Boston 's debut song , More Than A Feeling , took the world by surprise , unsurpassed by none .
Delp 's suicide is tragic .
Before long , all of us will join Brad Delp in eternity .
That is the focus of my article .
Where will you spend eternity ?
Led Zeppelin's hit song Stairway to Heaven , contains the lyrics , “ And she 's buying the stairway to heaven . ”
May I say , it 's not for sale friend .
You can't buy your way into Heaven .
You need Jesus ' righteousness !
Jesus paid a debt that He did not owe , because we owed a debt that we could not pay .
The only way into Heaven is through Christ 's righteousness , which is by faith alone .
A lot of wonderful people will be burning in Hell one day , sorry to say , because they saw themselves as being good ; however , if we all compare ourselves to the holy Word of God , then we all fall short of the glory of God and will see our desperate need for the Savior ( Romans 3:10 - 23 ) .
I cannot say for certain if Brad Delp went to Hell , but I 've found no profession of faith in his life , nor any reason to believe he was a born - again Christian .
I wish it were so .
The question is , again , where will you spend eternity ?
The Bible , God 's Word , warns us in 1st John 2:17 that this world WILL PASS AWAY ...
" And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever . "
In a little over 100 years from now , if the Lord tarries His return , all 6,800,000,000 people living upon the earth today will be dead and gone into eternity .
Think about that .
Life is too short to risk going to Hell forever .
The Bible tells us exactly what God expects from us .
Praise God , eternal life is a free gift , paid for by Jesus ' precious blood .
All you need to do is acknowledge that you are a guilty sinner in the sight of a holy God , and believe the Good News ( aka , “ the Gospel ” ) of the Lord Jesus Christ .
What is the Gospel ?
I 'm glad you asked friend .
The “ Gospel ” according to 1st Corinthians 15: 1 - 4 is that Christ died on the cross for our sins .
He was buried .
And then miraculously by God 's power , Jesus bodily resurrected three days later .
This is the Gospel .
Christ DIED , was BURIED and is RISEN !
If you place your faith in this Good News , you are immediately and forever saved .
It 's that simple to be saved .
This is NOT religion ; but rather , genuine Christianity .
We are woeful SINNERS and Jesus is the redeeming SAVIOR .
Salvation is not doing your best , it is having Christ 's best put to your account through receiving Him by faith .
God will not save anyone who is trying to be saved , He will only save those who are trusting to be saved .
Brad Delp was admired by millions of people around the world , but where is he now ?
Do you believe that the Bible is God 's Word ?
Romans 1:20 declares that mankind is WITHOUT EXCUSE ...
“ For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse . ”
We are all warned in 2nd Thessalonians 1:8 , “ In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ . ”
Those are frightening words !
I believe the Bible is God 's Word , do you ?
I thank God I am a born again Christian , and my sins have been cleansed away by the precious blood of Jesus Christ ( 1st Peter 1:18,19 ) .
Nothing else matters if you die in your sins without Jesus Christ .
Life is short , too short ( Proverb 27:1 ) .
Before we know it , this life will be over , and others will follow after us ...
AND THE WORLD PASSETH AWAY !
Of course , if you 're a rock star your life - expectancy is MUCH lower .
Take a look at Rock 's Death List .
No one ever goes to Hell but those who CHOOSE to go there .
John 5:40 , “ And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life . ”
Notice that Jesus did n't say CANNOT , He said WILL NOT .
The choice is yours .
Brad 's family members gave a statement to the press on March 14 , 2007 ...
“ He gave as long as he could , as best he could , and he was very tired .
We take comfort in knowing that he is now , at last , at peace . ”
I wish with all my heart I could believe that Brad Delp is AT PEACE , but John 3:3 states , “ Except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God . ”
Hebrews 9:27 , “ And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment . ”
This world will soon pass away .
All of the things which seem so important to most people today wo n't matter one bit 10,000 years from now !
All that will matter then is whether you died in your sins ( John 8:24 ) , or in the Lord ( Revelation 14:13 ) .
I have no doubt that Brad Delp was a good man , as far as sinners go ; however , he was still a sinner , as I am .
Although there is good and bad in all people , we are all still sinners under the condemnation of God 's Law ( Romans 3:19 - 23 ) , and deserving of Hellfire ( Romans 6:23 ; Revelation 20:11 - 15 ) .
We all need God 's salvation , which is obtained only through the blood of His Son , Jesus Christ .
Do you know for sure if you died today that you would go to Heaven ?
You can know for sure , by coming as a sinner and BELIEVING THE GOSPEL .
Jesus does n't forgive sins .
That is correct !
Jesus has already paid for our sins , so it is a free gift that may simply be taken .
If you 'll simply receive Christ 's sacrifice on the cross as full - payment for your sins , believing that He raised up from the dead 72 hours later , you will be immediately , eternally and irrevocably born - again by the Holy Spirit of God.
John 6:28 - 29 , “ Then said they unto him , What shall we do , that we might work the works of God ?
Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent . ”
Galatians 3:2 , “ This only would I learn of you , Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ? ” The apostle Paul wrote to the church at Galatia .
Paul had just one question ...
How did you get saved ?
That is , how did you become indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God ?
Was it by doing the works of the law ?
Or was it by the hearing of faith ?
I love that last part ...
THE HEARING OF FAITH .
Paul was making sure that they were saved .
In other words , if you believe the Gospel when you hear it preached , you are saved .
It is that simple !
1st Corinthians 1:21 , “ For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe . ”
Eternal life is a gift .
Ephesians 2:8 - 9 , “ For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
Not of works , lest any man should boast . ”
We are saved by completely resting in the finished redemptive work of Jesus Christ .
It 's not what we can do for God that gets us to Heaven , but what He has done for us by His grace .
I simply wrote this article to address the matter of eternal life .
Brad Delp was well loved , famous , a gifted singer and a great guy , but where is he in eternity ?
The Bible says that those who do not obey the Gospel go to Hell forever ( 2nd Thessalonians 1:8 - 9 ) .
I can only hope that Mr. Delp was a Christian .
1st John 2:15 - 17 tells us that this life will soon PASS AWAY , and all that will matter then is whether one obeyed the Gospel or not .
While you are looking in these amazing and outstanding you will wonder yourself is it possible to draw in paint like this .
My favorite image is Jack Sparrow , it is very well done .
Others images are also great , some of them really looks amazing and unique .
It seems that a lots of time and will is used for some drawings .
A nurse who gave a chemical abortion to a patient who had only come for a consultation has been cautioned .
Ann Downer , based at the Calthorpe Clinic in Edgbaston , Birmingham , failed to check the woman 's personal details before giving her the drug .
The woman was recalled when Ms Downer realised her mistake but the drug had already taken effect .
The Nursing and Midwifery Council said she could keep her job but would have a caution on her record for three years .
First names
A spokesman said the council 's conduct and competence committee heard the clinic 's practice was to only call out patient 's first names in a bid to protect confidentiality while in the waiting room .
Once the patient was inside a private room , other details , such as full name , birthdate and address were checked to make sure it was the person they were expecting .
Ms Downer failed to carry out an identity check and gave a drug , Misoprostol , to a woman who was due to have an initial consultation .
This would have consisted of a consultation , blood tests and a scan .
She would then have been given the drug at the second stage , if she and the doctor agreed to it .
When she was recalled , she was suffering from stomach pains and bleeding and was given a procedure to finish the abortion .
She made an official complaint about the mix -up .

That last one is real -- not satire but straight from FEMA 's website .
With an installed peak power of 23 MW ( updated ) , the solar park at Jumilla , Murcia ( Southeastern Spain ) is the world ’s current highest capacity PV plant and the most efficient to - date .
It took a team of 400 people 11 months to build the Jumilla plant , where 120,000 solar panels are grouped into 200 separate photovoltaic arrays - owned by different investors - to convert light from the sun into electricity .
It ’s expected to generate an estimated annual income of $ 28 million ( €19 million ) and a reduction in CO2 emissions of 42,000 tons a year .
The plant covers an area of 100 hectares in La Hoya de Vicentes , Jumilla , ( see picture ) where the local Mayor says 300 days of sun a year are guaranteed .
Its total annual production will be the equivalent of the energy used by 20,000 homes .
The project developer was Luzentia Group .
Luzentia awarded the construction of the park to Elecnor , a company with a solid background in engineering and the solar industry .
The solar arm of Elecnor , Atersa , worked as the systems integrator , with solar panels coming from different firms , due to the size of the project .
Besides Atersa , the other providers were Solon , Yingli , Suntech and Ningbo .
Powerlight ( Sunpower Corp. ) provides its patented single - axis solar trackers to improve the system´s performance .
Different measures were taken following the recommendations from a local association , Juncellus , to ensure high environmental criteria in the construction of the plant .
They included replanting an area of almost 5.4 thousand square yards around the plant , water deposits for fires , drinking troughs for birds and other such details .
According to the figures given by the Spanish Minister of Industry at its inauguration earlier this month , renewable energy currently accounts for around 7 % of the total primary energy produced in the country , and will reach 10 % in 2010 if biomass production is added onto the energy produced by solar and wind farms .
Spain will be able to reach the European Union ’s target of a 20 % share by 2020 , he said .

It 's happening .
Delhi is witnessing a change , slow perhaps , but nonetheless increasingly visible .
Like alternative fuels , which brought a positive change in mobility , electric vehicles are now gaining greater acceptance .
Compressed natural gas ( CNG ) changed the basic transportation in the Capital and close to 10 % of private cars run on it now .
Then came Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( LPG ) , making its mark as an easily storable and compact auto fuel used by a substantial private vehicles owners .
Now , it 's electric vehicles that are slowly making waves in Delhi .
They are the cheapest mode of transport .
Hold your breath -- two wheeler run at a highly affordable cost of 10 paise per km , while for cars the figure is around 40 paise !
There 's more : an added advantage is electric two wheelers do n't require any registration or driving license under the current motoring policy of the government .
Though electric car do need all the legal procedures followed by other vehicles .
While many may argue electric vehicles are a non-starter due to low speed and short travelling range , the government has ' stepped in ' to share the burden and make them popular as an emission free transport solution to tackle rising pollution and congestion .
First it was the central government , which waived the entire excise tax and now the Delhi government has taken the lead with a series of steps to push the electric vehicle bandwagon .
The central government 's decision to waive 8 % excise is likely to bring prices down by Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,400 , if the manufacturers pass on the entire benefit to the customers .
Currently , electric vehicles are priced in the range of Rs 20,000 for low speed two wheelers to around Rs 36,000 for the high - speed models .
While electric car prices start from Rs 3.28 lakh , which can now be cheaper by Rs 35,000 .
UK based electric vehicle maker Ultra Motors ' Indian subsidiary Ultra Motors India 's director ( marketing ) Deba Goshal said , " It will help to make the electric vehicle viable and help the industry grow .
We had been facing a pinch after the excise on petrol two wheelers was brought down to 12 % from 16 % , while there were no changes for the electric vehicles .
The 12 % difference with the petrol vehicles will make a sizeable difference and boost demand in the market . "
To make these vehicles more acceptable , specially to de-congest the national capital which has the highest number of vehicles in India , electric vehicle companies are also approaching the adjoining Haryana and Uttar Pradesh state governments to extend similar benefits for all such vehicles .
The Delhi government has recently announced a gross subsidy of 29.5 % ( 15 % general , 12.5 % VAT and 2 % road tax and registration ) for each electric vehicle , which could make the cars cheaper by a lakh and two wheelers by Rs 5,000 .
This has prompted the Bangalore - based Reva Electric Car Company to debut in the Capital .
In fact , India is amongst the few countries in the world where an electric car is manufactured and also exported .
Reva , which comes at a price band of Rs 3.28 lakh to Rs 4.28 lakh ( on- road Bangalore ) is expected to be priced from Rs 3 lakh .
It will debut in the Delhi market at this competitive on - road price .
The two - seater hatchback is expected to be cheaper than the Hyundai Santro , Tata Motors Indica and General Motors Spark , which come in the price band of Rs 3 lakh to Rs 3.3 lakh ( on - road price Delhi ) , though these vehicles are not comparable due to their diverse benefits .
Reva Electric Car Company president Girish Rekhe told ET , " We are basically looking at introducing a new mobility concept for the Capital and will introduce Reva sometime next month .
Reva is the simplest and the cheapest car to drive .
We are looking at the corporate sales and institutional sector , which get huge tax and depreciation rebates on buying our car .
But as it has a limited driving range of 80 kilometres .
So , we will also tap the female and senior citizen market . "
Reva , a battery run car which has an on - board charger to facilitate easy charging , will be opening its first retail dealership in Lajpat Nagar in South Delhi early next month .
The car can accommodate two adults and two children in the rear .
The rear seats are foldable to adjust cargo in the boot .
It also has an optional air - conditioning system .
Customers have a choice of personalising the colour schemes with over 2,000 shades .
The car runs on eight 6 - volt lead acid batteries which can be charged by plugging into any 15 ampere electric socket .
The 2.6 - metre long Reva has a turning radius of 3.5 metres and is easy to park .
The car has a maximum speed of 80 kmph and runs at a cost of 40 paise per kilometre .
" It 's a modern urban concept which tackles the parking and emission problems .
We are not looking for great volumes but will be educating the customers on the new eco-friendly mobility concept and cheap running cost . "
Mr Rekhe said .
After breaking away from its UK - based technology partner Ultra Motors , Ludhania based electric two wheeler maker , Hero Electric is going on its own and marketing the new solo brand .
Banking on the potential , the company , with its seven Hero Electric range of two wheelers in the market will launch four new models , including two high - speed scooters to double its sales to 70,000 vehicles in FY '09 .
Hero Electric managing director Naveen Munjal said , " We are in the process of developing a strong indigenous range of electric two wheelers .
We are developing new concepts based on the speed , distance and mobility requirements of customers .
The technology is almost ready and the product rollout will start in the second half of this year . "
The company is banking on the cheap running cost to rollout these vehicles .
" We have set aside a marketing budget of Rs 50 crore to educate customers on this relative new and green technology , which has a running cost of 10 paise per kilometer .
We have identified certain high potential territories for our electric vehicles .
We shall be concentrating more on the western and southern regions along with small cities and towns , " Mr Munjal said .
Around 1.3 lakh electric two wheelers were sold in FY ' 08 , against the 9.8 crore petrol and diesel vehicles in the same period in India .
Electric two wheelers , which formed a bulk of the total sales , mainly drove the electric vehicle industry and around 1.2 lakh were sold in the same period .
According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers ' ( SIAM ) the market is likely to double in this fiscal and expected to reach over a million vehicles by 2010 .
To push sales and develop the market , electric vehicle companies are also negotiating with banks and financial institutions to introduce retail financing .
Finance plays a major role in automobile sales and more than 65 % of vehicles sold in India are through loans and credit schemes .
However , as many segments of electric two wheelers are not to be registered under the Motor Vehicle Act , the company looking at finance options on the pattern of consumer durables .
" Unlike a car or a bike , many electric vehicles are not required to be registered with any government department .
So to safeguard the collateral security of banks , we are in the process to provide both security as well as easy finance options on electric vehicles , " Mr Munjal added .
There are close to 36 manufacturers of electric vehicles in India , many of these are marginal players .
The Delhi based Lohia Auto Industries is also making a foray with a new manufacturing facility at Kashipur in Uttrakhand to tap the growing potential of electric vehicles .
Its president V K Gupta said , " We aim to cater to students in the 12 - 18 years group , housewives and adults in smaller cities and the price reduction will help us to aggressively target these customers .
With virtually no operating cost for these vehicles , their demand will grow and government 's intention to save environment with these pollution free vehicles will boost demand . "
The key drivers for the electric vehicle industry are inadequate public transportation system , especially in the semi-urban and rural areas , increased availability of affordable consumer financing , an aspiration for personalised transport among women , children and senior citizens .
The strong measures by the central , state and city governments against conventional petrol and diesel technology to combat alarming pollution levels is also likely to drive demand for electric two wheelers .

Whistleblower says Pentagon putting KBR over soldiers ' Irregular ' oversight of KBR work alleged
Ex -Army official faults Pentagon on contract in Iraq and Afghanistan
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon 's oversight of Houston - based KBR's work in Iraq and Afghanistan has been " irregular and highly out of the ordinary , " a former Army contracting official told Senate Democrats Wednesday .
Charles Smith , the former chief of the Army Field Support Command with responsibility for overseeing KBR 's massive contract with the Army , contends he was forced out of his job in 2004 for objecting to the Pentagon 's treatment of KBR .
" The interest of a corporation , KBR , not the interests of American soldiers or American taxpayers , seemed to be paramount , " Smith told the Democratic Policy Committee , a Democrats - only panel .
Dan Carlson , a spokesman for the Army Sustainment Command , acknowledged that Smith was reassigned within the command .
Smith later retired .
Carlson said Smith 's allegations are " under investigation by appropriate authorities within the Army . "
KBR , the largest military contractor operating in Iraq , builds bases , serves meals and provides a host of other support services for U.S. troops .
To date , the company has been paid nearly $ 26 billion for its work under the contract , Army officials say .
During his tenure , Smith said , he saw KBR submit more than $ 1 billion in billings to the government that lacked the necessary documentation to merit reimbursement .
KBR had come under particular criticism for its bills for providing meals at base dining halls .
The Pentagon's own auditors , the Defense Contract Audit Agency , objected to $ 200 million worth of billings , Smith said .
But rather than pursue the issue , the Army agreed to change the contract , effectively barring the government from going after that money .
" It was at least a $ 200 million relief for KBR , " Smith said .
KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne , in a prepared statement , said the company " remains committed to providing high - quality service to our customer and conducting our business with ethics and integrity .
" The company in no way condones or tolerates anything to the contrary .
When questions have been raised about our work , we have fully cooperated with the government in providing information requested of us .
We remain committed to finding quick resolution to issues when they arise . "
Smith argued that rather than tighten control over the contract when billing issues arose , Army officials waived rules that would have allowed the government to withhold 15 percent of expected reimbursements until KBR provided the necessary documentation .
Sen. Byron Dorgan , D - N.D. , Democratic Policy Committee chairman , noted what he called " a concerted effort in the Pentagon to award huge contracts to certain companies and to protect it at all costs . "
Smith said the Pentagon essentially " outsourced " oversight of the contract to a firm called RCI , later acquired by Virginia - based Serco .
Serco spokesman Steve McCarney said the firm does not oversee any contractor .
" We simply provide independent economic cost analysis to our client , which is the U.S. Army , " McCarney said .
Carlson , the Army Sustainment Command spokesman , pointed to improvements in recent years , including deploying contracting officers overseas , establishing a requirement review process and improving contractor business systems to better meet the standards of the Defense Contract Audit Agency .
Underlying discussion of KBR 's treatment by the Army was apparent concern among at least some at the Pentagon that the company would , if pushed too far , withdraw from Iraq .
That would have dealt a huge blow to a war effort heavily dependent on the work of private contractors .
Smith discounted that notion , saying KBR would not risk its corporate reputation — and its business as a military contractor — by deserting the troops in the field .
After the hearing , Smith said that while he oversaw KBR 's contract , he occasionally heard from midlevel KBR officials complaining about cash flow and warning that the company might fail to complete tasks assigned under the contract .
These calls , however , invariably were followed by assurances from higher - level managers of the company 's commitment to the contract , Smith said .

When President Bush receives a bill he does n't like , instead of issuing a veto and challenging Congress to override him as School House Rock would have you believe , he issues a private " signing statement " setting forth how he plans on interpreting the new law .
The House Armed Services Committee has just released a report on the practice and the conclusions are not encouraging .
From the report ( .pdf )
The Bush Administration ’s use of presidential signing statements to indicate disapproval of enacted legislation has generated confusion and has undermined congressional oversight of national defense policy , the House Armed Services Committee said in a report this week
“ 78 percent of President Bush ’s more than 150 signing statements have raised constitutional or legal objections , compared with only 18 % of all of President Clinton ’s . ”
“ Signing statements may , if used appropriately , serve a legitimate function as a tool for continuing dialog between the President , Congress , and the public .
On the other hand , signing statements may be a mechanism to expand executive authority at the expense of the legislature , ” the Committee report said .
As the report makes clear , not all signing statements are bad .
Sometimes they 're useful and entirely appropriate , and sometimes they 're used for naked power grabs that are nearly impossible to challenge .
Well , it appears 78 % of President Bush 's fall into the latter category .
That begs the obvious question :
Which laws has Bush challenged ?
1 . A provision in the 2008 defense bill that would make it illegal to build permanent bases in Iraq .
The White House is currently pushing for 58 bases .
2 . A bill outlawing the use of torture on detainees .
McCain did a lot of grandstanding on the day this law " passed , " but he has n't said anything since about Bush 's refusal to abide it .
3 . A provision in the Patriot Act that requires the White House to inform Congress on how the FBI was using it 's new spying powers .
This one naturally led to the FBI severely abusing their power .
You know what happens after the President is called out on his lawbreaking , right ?
The White House should expect Congress ' Strongly Worded Letter™ any day now .

1. Sway : The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior
Why is it so difficult to sell a plummeting stock or end a doomed relationship ?
Why do we listen to advice just because it came from someone “ important ” ?
Why are we more likely to fall in love when there ’s danger involved ?
In Sway , renowned organizational thinker Ori Brafman and his brother , psychologist Rom Brafman , answer all these questions and more .
Sway introduces us to the Harvard Business School professor who got his students to pay $ 204 for a $ 20 bill , the head of airline safety whose disregard for his years of training led to the transformation of an entire industry , and the football coach who turned conventional strategy on its head to lead his team to victory .
We also learn the curse of the NBA draft , discover why interviews are a terrible way to gauge future job performance , and go inside a session with the Supreme Court to see how the world ’s most powerful justices avoid the dangers of group dynamics .
2. Predictably Irrational : The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions
What Ariely has done here is shift a lot of the thinking developed by such pioneers as Kahneman & Tversky who worked in behavioural economics , and moved it into the everyday sphere .
And he 's done a great , insightful job .
Where the behavioural economists are focused on financial decisions ( why we buy high and sell low - and confound the assumptions of the classic economists who assume ' the rational man , ) Ariely eschews the technical language and walks us through everyday examples of our often fuzzy and quite irrational decision - making .
3. The Paradox of Choice : Why More Is Less
I think " Paradox of Choice " does bring insight into shopping , but its range is actually much wider than that .
Schwartz discusses people making difficult decisions about jobs , families , where to live , whether to have children , how to spend recreational time , choosing colleges , etc .
He talks about why making these decisions today is much harder than it was 30 years ago , and he offers many practical suggestions for how to address decision - making so that it creates less stress and more happiness .
He even discusses how so much additional choice affects children , and how parents can help make childhood ( particularly young childhood ) less stressful .
4. Nudge : Improving Decisions About Health , Wealth , and Happiness
" Buy on apples , sell on cheese " is an old proverb among wine merchants .
Taking a bite of an apple before tasting wine makes it easier to detect flaws in the wine , and the buyer who does so will not as easily make the mistake of paying more than the wine is worth .
Cheese , on the other hand , pairs well with wine and enhances its flavor , so a seller who offers cheese may command a higher price for the wine ( and may even deserve it , if the wine is intended to be drunk with cheese ) .
The proverb captures important psychological nuances of choice .
The same product - a bottle of wine or a risky medical procedure - may be perceived differently depending on its context , and it is often possible to arrange the context to influence a choice while still maintaining the decision maker 's autonomy .
5. Quirkology : How We Discover the Big Truths in Small Things
Richard Wiseman is an experimental psychologist and professor of " public understanding of psychology . "
In this book , he discusses dozens of experiments performed by himself and other psychologists around the world over the course of the last hundred years .
All these experiments have in common is unusual research methodology or amusing results .
Topics include studies of personal ads and pickup lines , determining which are most effective , how to detect liars , manifestations of prejudice and hypocrisy ( are religious people or priests more honest or generous than others ?
it has been tested ) .
Wiseman even ran tests to see which experiments in the book are the most interesting , to help the reader know what would be the best conversation starters at parties .
6. Blind Spots : Why Smart People Do Dumb Things
Clinical psychologist Van Hecke has compiled a list of 10 mental glitches that have infiltrated contemporary society , afflicting even the smartest among us , limiting thought , success and relationships .
Van Hecke devotes a chapter to each blind spot , including " Not stopping to think , " " Not noticing , " " Jumping to conclusions " and " Missing the big picture . "
Examining each in detail , Van Hecke details the root causes of these unconscious habits ( " information overload , " " our tendency to habituate " ) and tactics for overcoming them , using humorous anecdotes and other real - life examples to drive her points ; the key is remaining open to new ideas and taking a step back from our busy lives in order to process information , situations and people .
Filling in " the big picture " herself , Van Hecke demonstrates how embracing and understanding our weaknesses can not only improve personal and professional relationships , but also entire communities ; this self - help is a welcome , highly readable first step .
7. Kluge : The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind
In " Kluge , " psychologist Gary Marcus looks to the many and varied foibles , inconsistencies , and inaccuracies of the human mind and concludes that our brains are not , in fact , models of brilliance and efficiency , but are rather cobbled - together systems , designed for one purpose and pressed into action for another - the classic definition of a kluge .
The most famous kluge is probably the case of the carbon scrubbers on the ill - fated Apollo 13 mission .
Crunched for time , engineers managed to create a system out of duct tape and socks ( seriously ) that worked adequately enough to clean the air on the space module - even though none of the materials they used were designed for , or optimal for , the job at hand .
The result was ugly and inefficient - but it kept the astronauts alive .
Likewise , Marcus argues , evolution has endowed humans with a hodgepodge of genetic material - the DNA equivalent of duct tape - with which to build all the sophisticated systems that supposedly set us apart from other creatures , like language , memory , and reason .
The result is , for example in the case of language , " a vocal apparatus more byzantine than a bagpipe made up entirely of pipe cleaners and cardboard dowels . "
8. The Drunkard 's Walk : How Randomness Rules Our Lives
The author writes to the layman , making the language of statistics , probability , randomness a fascinating read .
It 's clear that he's well aware of the fallacies and delusions ( and consequent harm ) to which most of us are easy prey .
But he leaves it to the reader to draw any philosophical - theological inferences about the need for greater humility .
His immediate goal is to help the reader understand the distinction between 1 . the " common - sense " logic employed by self - serving finite beings coping with problems in the material world and 2 . a " scientific method " that takes nothing for granted in a universe of perpetual flux .
More miraculous than either the accomplishments of the romantic hero or the intercessions of a supreme being ( everyday stuff for most of us ) is the rare discovery that two things ( or " events " in the spatial - temporal order ) suspected of being connected ( a hypothesis ) in fact cannot be shown " not " to have such a relationship ( the proof ) .
9. Guesstimation : Solving the World 's Problems on the Back of a Cocktail Napkin
Somehow , guessing at numbers is unsettling , even though I 've done it all my life .
John Adam is a professor of applied mathematics , with a degree in physics .
Larry Weinstein is a nuclear physicist .
Their book is devoted to proving that intelligent guessing is useful and fun .
The book lays out some general principles but its great strength lies in the interesting problems , a series of hints to help you solve each problem , and an interesting discussion of the pitfalls and triumphs involved .
10 . Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion
Cialdini believes that influence is a science .
This idea attracted me .
As a rhetorician , I have always thought of persuasion as more of an art .
Cialdini , however , makes a first - rate case for the science point of view .
But maybe most importantly , he makes his case in a well - written , intelligent , and entertaining manner .
Not only is this an important book to read , it is a fun book to read too .
He introduces you to six principles of ethical persuasion : reciprocity , scarcity , liking , authority , social proof , and commitment / consistency .
A chapter is devoted to each and you quickly see why Cialdini looks at influence as a science .
Each principle is backed by social scientific testing and restesting .
Each chapter is also filled with interesting examples that help you see how each principle can be applied .
By the end of the book , I had little doubt that these are six important dimensions of human interaction .

Weird $ 4 Gas Side - Effect
What Do People Do When Their Neighbors Win In Lottery ?
Oil is dropping again today and is currently below $ 133 .
Weekly US inventories rose far more than expected : 3 million barrels of oil and 2.4 million barrels of gasoline for the week .
The drop sent the DOW soaring .
Some reduction of inflation pressure is helpful , but at some point traders will likely remember that economic weakness is also bad for stocks .

Oil Drops Suddenly On Fears of Global Recession
Ready for $ 12 Gas ?
$ 500 Oil Inevitable , Says London Professor
Houston
AS we face $ 4.50 a gallon gas , we also know that alternative energy sources  coal , oil shale , ethanol , wind and ground - based solar  are either of limited potential , very expensive , require huge energy storage systems or harm the environment .
There is , however , one potential future energy source that is environmentally friendly , has essentially unlimited potential and can be cost competitive with any renewable source : space solar power .
Science fiction ?
Actually , no  the technology already exists .
A space solar power system would involve building large solar energy collectors in orbit around the Earth .
These panels would collect far more energy than land - based units , which are hampered by weather , low angles of the sun in northern climes and , of course , the darkness of night .
Once collected , the solar energy would be safely beamed to Earth via wireless radio transmission , where it would be received by antennas near cities and other places where large amounts of power are used .
The received energy would then be converted to electric power for distribution over the existing grid .
Government scientists have projected that the cost of electric power generation from such a system could be as low as 8 to 10 cents per kilowatt - hour , which is within the range of what consumers pay now .
Image Credit ... Paul Davis
In terms of cost effectiveness , the two stumbling blocks for space solar power have been the expense of launching the collectors and the efficiency of their solar cells .
Fortunately , the recent development of thinner , lighter and much higher efficiency solar cells promises to make sending them into space less expensive and return of energy much greater .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
OK , so maybe not all your tax rebate , but a big chunk of it .
Rising gasoline prices means that up to a third of your stimulus rebate check - designed to boost the U.S. economy through spending at stores , restaurants and other businesses - could be spent buying gasoline , most of which is imported from abroad .
" The rebate goes into the tank , and then finds its way into economies far from our own , " said Jared Bernstein , a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think tank .
In a move to avoid a recession , the federal government is sending over $ 100 billion in checks to most taxpayers across the nation .
The checks should arrive as early as May .
Middle income individuals with no dependents should get about $ 600 .
A middle income family of four will get about $ 1670 , according to the Treasury Department .
Gas prices are projected to jump 40 cents a gallon on average this year according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
In 2007 , the average driver consumed 578 gallons of gas per vehicle , according to the Federal Highway Administration .
So if gasoline consumption holds steady , it could cost $ 231 more to fuel a car in 2008 .
For a middle income single person , that represents over a third of their rebate money .
For the average American family with two cars , that 's $ 462 of additional spending on gas - over a quarter of their rebate .
If EIA 's projections are wrong , actual spending on gas could be much higher .
The agency low balled its 2007 estimates by 30 cents a gallon .
" Energy prices may eventually swamp most or all of the stimulus package , " said Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics , a Manhattan consultancy .
The stimulus package is designed to immediately boost consumer spending - which accounts for over two thirds of the country 's economy - until longer term fixes like lower interest rates have time to kick in .
If consumers instead spend the money on imported items such as gas - two thirds of the nation 's oil is imported , mostly from Canada , Saudi Arabia and Mexico - then the shot - in - the - arm for the U.S. economy is muted .
" There are various ways to spend your rebate dollars , " said Bernstein .
' If you spend them the wrong way , they end up stimulating someone else 's economy . "
He said things like haircuts , domestic vacations , and going out to eat would be more helpful in warding off a recession than buying imported items - be it gasoline or a pair of jeans .
ISLA DE ASIA , Peru 
The worldwide boom in commodities has come to this :
Even guano , the bird dung that was the focus of an imperialist scramble on the high seas in the 19th century , is in strong demand once again .
Surging prices for synthetic fertilizers and organic foods are shifting attention to guano , an organic fertilizer once found in abundance on this island and more than 20 others off the coast of Peru , where an exceptionally dry climate preserves the droppings of seabirds like the guanay cormorant and the Peruvian booby .
On the same islands where thousands of convicts , army deserters and Chinese indentured servants died collecting guano a century and a half ago , teams of Quechua - speaking laborers from the highlands now scrape the dung off the hard soil and place it on barges destined for the mainland .
“ We are recovering some of the last guano remaining in Peru , ” said Victor Ropón , 66 , a supervisor from Ancash Province whose leathery skin reflects his years working on the guano islands since he was 17 .

The 416 children taken from a ranch run by a polygamous sect will stay in state custody and , along with their parents , be subject to genetic testing to determine their relationships , a judge has ruled .
Child welfare officers said that after this adult mothers with children aged four and under , who had been allowed to stay together , would be separated from their children .
Only mothers aged under 18 will be permitted to remain with their offspring .
The rulings came after Judge Barbara Walther at the district court in San Angelo , Texas , heard 21 hours of testimony over two days in one of the largest and most convoluted custody cases in US history .
The genetic testing was ordered after child welfare officials told the court they were having difficulty determining how the children and adults were related because of evasive or changing answers .
A mobile genetic lab will take DNA samples tomorrow at the main shelter where children are being kept , and parents will be able to submit samples on Tuesday in Eldorado , closer to the Yearning for Zion Ranch in west Texas .

The ranch was raided on 3 April after someone identifying herself as a 16 - year - old girl with the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) , which operates the ranch , claimed her 50 - year - old husband beat and raped her .
Hundreds of children were taken from the the Mormon splinter group 's compound .
The judge summed up the hearing in one line : " The issue before the court is – can I give them back ? "
The scale of the case meant defence lawyers queued up in the court 's aisles to take turns asking their questions .
But the judge was able to exercise more control over the mass custody hearing than on Thursday , when the case descended into chaos , mainly due to hundreds of lawyers competing for clients .
Experts for the state had told the court that the girls entered into under - age marriages without resistance because they were indoctrinated from birth to believe disobedience would lead to damnation .
A psychiatrist , Dr Bruce Perry , an authority on children in cults , said the sect 's belief system was " abusive " .
" The culture is authoritarian , " he said .
But under cross-examination , he admitted that the sect mothers were loving parents and that there were no signs of abuse among younger girls or any of the boys .
Dr Perry stated that the girls he interviewed said they freely chose to marry young , but he added that those choices were based on lessons drilled into them from birth .
" Obedience is a very important element of their belief system .
" Compliance is being godly ; it 's part of their honouring God . "
Dr Perry was applauded by dozens of FLDS parents when he admitted that the children would suffer if placed in traditional foster care .
John Walsh , a witness for the parents , told the court that a bed in the retreat 's white temple was not used to consummate the marriages of under - age girls to much older men .
" There is no sexual activity in the temple , " he said .
Instead , he said , it was used for naps during the sect 's long services .
Mr Walsh also denied that the young girls had no say in who they would marry .
" They 're into matchmaking , " he said of the sect .
Girls who refused matches had not been expelled .
" I believe the girls are given a real choice .
Girls have successfully said ' No , this is not a good match for me ' , and they remained in good standing , " he said .
The children were seized in the raid on the desert compound because of evidence of physical and sexual abuse , including the forcing of under - age girls into marriage and childbearing , the judge was told .
Only a few of the children were teenage girls , but about 20 women or more gave birth when they were minors , some as young as 13 , authorities said .
The Child Protective Services agency argued that the teachings of the FLDS – to marry shortly after puberty , have as many children as possible and obey their fathers or their prophet , imprisoned leader Warren Jeffs – amounted to abuse .
Mr Jeffs is in prison for being an accomplice to rape and was convicted in Utah last year of forcing a 14 - year - old into marrying an older man .
Mr Walsh told the court that the sect did not promote under - age marriages until Jeffs took over as its " prophet " .
With Obama vacationing this week , the McCain campaign is planning on hammering him about jobs .
Odd that .
Because as this new DNC ad shows , jobs , at least , American jobs are definitely not a strong suit in McCain 's economy .
AFL - CIO blog : ( May '08 )
( W)e learned one of McCain 's fundraisers lobbied for the Colombian government , pushing an anti-worker trade deal that McCain supports ( despite the fact that dozens of union members are killed every month ) .
This week , it comes out that McCain is taking his economic advice from a former lobbyist for a bank with interests in the housing market .
And already there 's another revelation about someone on McCain 's campaign staff :
One of his top money men is responsible for outsourcing thousands of jobs .
Hat tip to Cliff Schecter at Firedoglake who yesterday wrote how McCain top adviser , Randy Altschuler , is the founder of OfficeTiger , a company based in Chennai , India .
OfficeTiger 's mission was to convince U.S. companies to outsource jobs to India - and it seems Altschuler has been quite successful in shipping out U.S. jobs .
In fact , McCain has been letting his lobbyists buddies control his attitude towards trade and jobs quite a bit , from Campaign Manager Rick Davis ' ties to DHL ...
Now , its business in a tailspin , DHL wants to combine operations with rival United Parcel Service and close its huge hub here .
If the merger goes through , community officials and union leaders warn , staggering job losses will eviscerate the economy and the social fabric of nine struggling counties in southeast Ohio .
" Never before have so many people been abandoned at once , " said ( Ohio resident Mary ) Houghtaling , who runs a local hospice .
" It is inconceivable to think about losing 10,000 jobs in the first wave , and the estimates run in the 30,000 range as the wave continues . "
But on Wednesday , the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that McCain 's campaign manager , Rick Davis , previously worked as a lobbyist for the German group , Deutsche Post World Net , and was paid $ 185,000 to help engineer the 2003 deal , plus another $ 405,000 for other work .
... to his work nixing the Boeing deal with the Air Force that may cost jobs in 40 states , but has benefited his lobbyist / campaigners :
But last week , McCain 's subsequent effort to redo the tanker deal was dealt a setback .
Government auditors ruled that the Air Force made " significant errors " when it rebid the contract and awarded the $ 35 billion project to Boeing 's chief rival , partners European Aeronautic Defense and Space Co. ( or EADS ) and Northrop Grumman .
It 's likely the Air Force will have to redo the bid yet again , which analysts say will delay the replacement of the fleet 's 1950s - era refueling tankers .
The auditors ' ruling has also cast light on an overlooked aspect of McCain 's crusade : five of his campaign 's top advisers and fund - raisers - including Tom Loeffler , who resigned last month as his finance co-chairman , and Susan Nelson , his finance director - were registered lobbyists for EADS .
Is n't that convenient ?
But he wants us to believe Barack Obama is bad on jobs ?
Blind and ill woman tased by Ohio police
A blind Ohio woman was tased by police who were looking for a robbery suspect , a TV station is reporting .
According to WHIO TV , " Dayton police said they went to an apartment building on Fernwood Avenue looking for a robbery suspect and ended up tazing the man 's mother who is legally blind . "
Police allege that 49 - year - old Denise Harris " refused to talk with them and became combative , striking out at an officer .
According to officers , when they tried to arrest her , she resisted and they tased her . "
Despite neighbors ' claims that the officers used unnecessary force on the woman , who is reportedly suffering from diabetes and cancer , Dayton police said Harris would be charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest .
The incident is under investigation .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) - MasterCard shares fell more than 10 % on Thursday morning after it reported a big charge to cover a legal settlement and analysts said the ongoing credit crisis is clouding the company 's near - term outlook .
Rival Visa shares also slipped , falling a more moderate 5 % in early trade .
MasterCard Inc. MA , - 0.63 % on Thursday said a $ 1 billion charge to settle an antitrust case with American Express Co. drove a second - quarter loss of $ 746.7 million , or $ 5.74 a share .
Excluding the charge , quarterly net income was $ 276 million , or $ 2.11 a share , the company said .
In the year - ago period , MasterCard reported adjusted net income , excluding special items , of $ 195 million , or $ 1.43 a share .
Second - quarter net revenue rose to $ 1.25 billion from $ 997 million .
" The impact of moderating cross border transaction growth ... as well as above - average expenses , resulted in below - typical quarterly revenue / EPS upside , " Cowen analysts said on Thursday .
" While the near - term outlook for these metrics may be uncertain , we believe that long term , MA 's results will continue to benefit from secular growth trends in the electronic payments arena .
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast net income of $ 273 million , or $ 2.02 a share , on revenue of $ 1.21 billion .
" The stock is down and some investors might have been expecting a larger beat in the quarter , " according to a KeyBanc Capital Markets research report .
MasterCard shares have risen almost 70 % in the last 12 months .
MasterCard said its gross dollar volume rose 12.8 % on a local currency basis , transactions rose 13.6 % to 5.2 billion and cross - border transactions rose 18.9 % .
" Businesses , consumers and governments around the world are demonstrating a growing preference for electronic payments , and our cross - border volumes remain healthy as cardholders come to rely on electronic payments , " MasterCard CEO Robert Selander said .
" More than 50 % of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S. , which helps to moderate the impact of an economic downturn in one particular region , " Selander added .
The growing use of debit cards around the world is boosting business at the world 's biggest transaction processors , as Visa reported a 41 % jump in second quarter earnings , and MasterCard said that excluding a legal charge it too earned more money this quarter .
Visa is where it wants to be
Late Wednesday , Visa Inc. reported a 41 % jump in quarterly net income late Wednesday as the payment - processing giant continued to benefit from increased use of debit cards and other plastic .
The company said fiscal third - quarter net income came in at $ 422 million , or 51 cents per Class A share , vs. $ 299 million a year earlier .
Visa was a private company a year ago , so it did n't have publicly traded shares .
Adjusting for certain costs from litigation and other issues , net income was $ 457 million , or 59 cents per Class A common share , in the latest quarter , the company said .
Visa V , - 0.43 % was expected to make 48 cents a share , according to a survey of 19 analysts by FactSet Research .
Visa shares fell 4.4 % , to $ 74.93 .
The stock has surged since the company sold shares at $ 44 each in a huge initial public offering in March .
Visa and MasterCard processes payments on debit cards and other types of payment cards and charges fees for these services .
Unlike credit card companies , they do n't lend money to anyone .
That means it has n't suffered as the global credit crunch begins to dent consumers ' ability to repay debt .
" The distance between Visa and other financial - service players can be attributed to two important factors -- a continuation in the decades - long conversion of cash to plastic and the simple fact that Visa not does underwrite credit , " Red Gillen , senior analyst with consulting firm Celent , wrote in an email that was sent to MarketWatch .
Net operating revenue in the fiscal third quarter 2008 rose to $ 1.6 billion , driven by strong contributions from service fees , data processing fees and international transaction fees as payment volumes and processed transactions rose across all regions worldwide , Visa said .

“ People always use that [ Grand Theft Auto ] as an example of violence in games .

Unfortunately , individuals will go against these types of games and will even go as far as to blame particular violent acts committed in real life on violent titles .

This case will focus mainly on crimes in one country , as opposed to the Milosevic case , which was enormous in its scope , dealing with wars in three countries and spanning a decade .
The evidence , experts say , is also much clearer .
Mr. Karadzic , even before the outbreak of war in Bosnia , often declared publicly that his mission was to “ protect ” Christian Serbs from Bosnian Muslims threatening to create an Islamic state .
He made virulent speeches , warning that if Bosnia broke away from Yugoslavia , its Muslim population could be decimated .
Image
The former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic appeared before the international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on Thursday for the first time .
After the war , the Bosnian Serb forces under his command destroyed many military records , but NATO troops swept through army barracks and police stations and nonetheless seized thousands of documents .
The prosecution has reams of material presented at the tribunal in almost two dozen other cases related to Bosnia .
Forensic experts have dug up mass graves .
There are intercepts of telephone and radio conversations between Mr. Karadzic and top politicians and commanders .
“ Karadzic was closer to the action than Milosevic , ” said Geoffrey Nice , the former lead prosecutor in Mr. Milosevic ’s trial .
“ He was there , he was vocal , he was in charge .
Milosevic was contributing from afar , through political and military support .
Karadzic used explicit and damning language in his public speeches .
I do n’t know if it is enough , but it ’s very powerful . ”
For the court , much is at stake in the trial of this new high - profile defendant , who will be judged as the tribunal , created in 1993 by the United Nations Security Council , moves toward closing down .
Some see it as a chance for the tribunal  often criticized for plodding and overcomplicated cases , Mr. Milosevic ’s in particular  to enhance its record .
“ With Karadzic coming in , it is a lot easier for the tribunal to make a strong and lasting impact , ” said David Kaye , who followed the court as an American diplomat in The Hague and now teaches law at the University of California , Los Angeles .
“ This is the chance to tell the full story of what happened in Bosnia .
Karadzic had the overall vision , the command structure and the direct responsibility for wartime events . ”
When the refrigerator mechanic and young conscript soldier Anatoly Babi was given the chance in the autumn of 1968 by his military superiors to ' see the world ' , he leapt at the opportunity .
The son of peasant parents born in the Soviet republic of Kirghizia , set off in an army lorry to Hungary , where he joined a large force of his fellow Soviet soldiers .
What Babi did not realise then was that he was part of a 100,000 - strong force of troops from the Soviet - led Warsaw Pact that , exactly 40 years ago this week , were to roll into Czechoslovakia and crush the ' Prague Spring ' , the liberalisation movement led by the country 's Communist party First Secretary , Alexander Dubcek .
His attempt to introduce democratic reforms into the rigid socialist state and give socialism a ' human face ' had captured the world 's imagination .
It led to six months of reform - from abolition of censorship to the recognition of human rights - an extraordinary period in Cold War history , which the Czech documentary film - maker and historian Jan Kaplan described to The Observer as ' a brief loosening of the straitjacket of party rule , a deep breath of fresh air before being submerged again ' .
Babi , then 26 , soon realised that his adventure was far more dangerous than his commanders had let on .
The Russian - Ukrainian soldier was with the artillery that was to go into action if full - scale war broke out .
' We were given gas masks .
We were told to sleep in our clothes .
We were told to expect big exercises .
But when we were given real bullets and set off in a convoy on rails , I understood that it was no game , ' the now retired father of five told The Observer in an interview at his house in the country outside Moscow .
' The commanders said there had been a coup , an uprising , and it was our job to make sure there was no repeat of Hungary 1956 , ' he said , referring to the revolt against Hungary 's Stalinist government .
' We were told we were fulfilling our international duty , ' he said .
He recalled the reception they received from Czechoslovak citizens .
' They threw bricks and cobblestones at us and even tried to set fire to our vehicles , ' he said .
' I understood then that they did n't see us as liberators . '
The hatred culminated in injury for Babi when an angry old Czech man threw a grenade at him while he was trying to disarm a band of resistance fighters .
In the week when tanks have again been dispatched by Moscow to another country , Babi has allowed The Observer to publish his snapshots of that time , including a ghostly image of his comrades in a pine forest and one of himself standing next to his lorry .
' Because we lived under communism , we assumed the Czechs were happy with that system too , ' he said .
' If I had known then what I know now , I would not have been so desperate to go ... but would have stayed at home and fixed fridges . '
The brothers Jan and Bohumil Hajny were among millions of Czech citizens who watched as the tanks rolled into the country and past the front door of their family house in the Prague district of Hostivar .
Factory worker Jan , also 26 at the time , recalled his shock at realising that the six heady months of the Prague Spring - when Czechoslovakia flirted with the dream that the communist system could be turned into ' socialism with a human face ' - were over .
' We received a phone call at 6 am that the Russians had arrived at the airport and were taking it over , ' Bohumil Hajny said .
The first reaction of the amateur photographers was to go out and capture the events with their cameras , a Chinon semi-automatic and a Praktika , despite the protests of their concerned mother .
The extraordinary shots for which they braved attack by the armed troops , and witnessed civilians being killed , were later put in the family photo album to which they have now given The Observer exclusive access after 40 years .
' We just realised that these were extraordinary events , and we wanted to set them down , ' said Jan .
Taken on 21 August and the fraught days thereafter , they track the invasion 's development and depict some of the most dramatic scenes ; of the headquarters of Radio Prague being heavily attacked by Soviet forces ; of Wenceslas Square and the National Museum , which the Russians mistook for the Communist headquarters , pummelling its façade with bullets ( the scars of which can still be seen ) ; and of the funeral of Jan Palach , the Czech student who set himself alight in January 1969 in protest at the Soviet occupation .
It is bizarre to see on some of the images how after several days Czechs began to return to their normal business .
Women in miniskirts clutch their shopping bags and walk past tanks , apparently oblivious to the troops , as if resigned to the fact that they are in for a long period of frosty oppression .
' We simply did n't understand why they had come , ' said Bohumil .
' We were so convinced we had been moving socialism in the right direction with the Prague Spring . '
Neither , recalls Jan , did the troops seem to know why they were there .
Many had been told they had been sent to save a country from Western imperialism , but little more , not even where they were .
' I spoke to some of the soldiers in Russian , ' said Jan .
' They did n't even know they were in Prague , but they said they had come to fight a counter - revolution .
When their commander saw us talking , he pointed a gun at me and told me to scarper . '
During those days the lives of Jan , Bohumil and millions of others , whether they chose to stay or to leave Czechoslovakia , were irreversibly changed .
' We had tasted freedom and the winds of change , ' said Bohumil , ' and suddenly it was taken away from us .
We were young , so we lost many years of living in freedom . '
The frost did not thaw for another 21 years .
His most painful memory was hearing the 10 o'clock news bulletin on the radio on 21 August .
' I remember the lady presenter informing us these were her last words , followed by the national anthem .
After that the whole family wept together .'
The brothers ' friend , Jan Kaplan the film - maker , who never returned to live in Prague after the invasion but made his life in London , has compared the disappointment of the destruction of the Prague Spring to a romantic failure .
' It was like a date for which you were so full of hope .
You were all loved up and definitely going to get laid , but then it did n't happen .
For Czechoslovakia it was an unsuccessful date with history .'

Britain's
Treasury chief has told a newspaper that the country is suffering its worst economic crisis for 60 years , and more pain is yet to come .
The Guardian newspaper has quoted Alistair Darling as saying the slump is ``going to be more profound and long - lasting than people thought ' ' .
In an interview for the paper 's weekend edition , Darling said the economic conditions faced by Britain and the world ``are arguably the worst they have been in 60 years ' ' .
Darling also acknowledged that voters were angry with the governing Labour Party , which has been in power for 11 years .
`` This coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the Labour Party has had in a generation , quite frankly , '' Darling said .
`` We 've got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections , and that is a huge problem for us at the moment . ''
Britain is suffering fallout from spiralling energy prices and the global credit crunch .
House prices are plummeting for the first time in more than a decade , and the fast - rising cost of fuel and staple foods has pushed inflation to more than double the government 's two percent target .
British economic growth ground to a halt between April and June , ending more than 15 years of continuous expansion , and the British Chambers of Commerce has warned that recession is likely within the next six to nine months .

Study of 53 cities across the world finds ' widespread ' use of waste water contaminated with heavy metals and sewage
At least 200 million people around the world risk their health daily by eating food grown using untreated waste water , some of which may be contaminated with heavy metals and raw sewage , according to major study of 53 world cities .
Urban farmers in 80 % of the cities surveyed were found to be using untreated waste water , but the study said they also provided vital food for burgeoning cities at a time of unprecedented water scarcity and the worst food crisis in 30 years .
The study from the UN - backed International Water Management Institute ( IMWI ) , said the practice of using waste water to grow food in urban areas was not confined to the poorest countries .
" It 's a widespread phenomenon , occurring on 20 m hectares across the developing world , especially in Asian countries like China , India and Vietnam , but also around nearly every city of sub-Saharan Africa and in many Latin American cities as well , " said IWMI researcher Liqa Raschid - Sally .
" Nor is it limited to the countries and cities with the lowest GDP .
It is prevalent in many mid-income countries as well " , she said .
The report , launched today at World Water Week in Stockholm , Sweden , found the practice " widespread and practically inevitable " .
" As long as developing countries lack suitable transport to deliver large quantities of perishable produce to urban areas , urban agriculture will remain important .
In the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water , urban farmers will have no alternative except to use … polluted water " , write the authors .
The report found that few developing countries have official guidelines for the use of waste water in agriculture .
Even if they do , monitoring and enforcement rarely happen and may not be realistic .
As a result , though the practice may be theoretically forbidden or controlled , it is " unofficially tolerated . "
Earlier in 2008 , the UN's World Health Organization stated that a global environmental and health crisis was unfolding with more than 200 m tonnes of human waste a year being dumped untreated in water systems , exposing hundreds of millions of people to disease .
The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , said on Sunday that rivers around the world are now seriously polluted " to the brink of collapse " .
" Many rivers in developing countries and emerging economies are now polluted to the brink of collapse .
For example , the Yangtze , China 's longest river , is suffering because of pollution by untreated waste , agricultural run-off and industrial discharge " , said a spokesman .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - The United States has turned down Israeli requests for military hardware to help it prepare for a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities , a frontpage report in Israel ’s Haaretz newspaper said on Wednesday .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad looks on as he waits for his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Tehran August 11 , 2008 .

The unsourced report said the Americans had warned Israel against carrying out any such attack and had refused to supply offensive military hardware .
Instead they had offered to improve the Jewish state ’s defenses against surface - to - surface missiles .
Interviewed on Israeli Army Radio , Defence Minister Ehud Barak did not deny the Haaretz story , but refused to discuss it .
“ It would not be right to talk about these things , ” Barak said .
The West accuses Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran denies this and says its nuclear program is only to generate electricity .
It has vowed to retaliate against Israel and the United States if attacked .
Israel , which is believed to have the Middle East ’s only atomic arsenal , says a nuclear - armed Iran could threaten its existence .
The Haaretz report , by one of its senior columnists , did not specify what weapons systems Israel had requested .
It said Washington had told Israel its aircraft would be denied permission to use Iraqi airspace to reach Iran .
Barak said Iran was a “ threat to the whole world order , and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures ” .
He said the United States “ does not see an action against Iran as the right thing to do at the moment ” , but shared Israel ’s view that “ no option should be removed from the table ” .
The United States said last week that Iran , by ignoring demands that it halt sensitive nuclear activities , had left the U.N. Security Council no choice but to increase sanctions .
A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declined to comment on the Haaretz report but said a stronger global diplomatic push was required against Iran .
“ Israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in Tehran to cease nuclear enrichment .
It ’s time for the international community to send a clear message to the Iranian leadership .
Only if diplomacy is exercised seriously , will diplomacy succeed , ” the spokesman , Mark Regev , said .
Another Israeli official familiar with the issue , speaking on condition of anonymity , said : “ The American military has made clear it does n’t want Israeli military action at this time ” .
Do you still use Microsoft Outlook or Eudora for your emails , or maybe something else ?
If you do , you probably are not having the most productive and user friendly experience that you could be having .
Up until about a month ago I had been using Outlook entirely for my emails , then I trialled Gmail ( Google ’s Free Email service ) for 2 weeks and since getting to know Gmail , I have not turned back … there are just so many more features that make Outlook ( and other similar email programs ) seem just unworthy .
Even Darren Rowse from Problogger has made the switch .
Although it may take a week or two to get used to gmail , over the many years to come , it will literally save you weeks of your time .
I highly recommend to switch to Gmail and below I give 12 reasons why .
12 Reasons To Switch To Gmail
Gmail spam filters block 99 % of the spam that usually makes it to your inbox .
Although Outlook 2007 had a good spam filter , I still usually got around 2 or 3 emails a week sneaking into my inbox … not with Gmail .
With Gmail you get to keep your old email account , and all incoming emails will be forwarded to your new Gmail account .
Also , emails that you send from your new account will have your old email account in the from area .
You can create Word docs , PDF ’s and spread sheets with Gmail via the use of GoogleDocs .
Gmail allows you to schedule events with the Google Calendar that will notify you by email to remind you of an appointment or meeting .
It can also send a reminder to the person or persons that you will be meeting with .
Gmail has something called ‘ Stars ’ and which allows you to tag emails you find important .
You can actually do a search for ‘ Starred ‘ emails and they all pop up , and as quick as a normal google search !
Your emails are tabbed into a thread , which means you no longer have to look for old emails … it is more like a conversation window .
You can archive old emails or whole conversations so that you can keep your Inbox clear .
You can set up filters and labels to keep your Inbox organised and clutter free .
It has a fast , easy search function which means you will never lose an email again .
The search is as fast a normal google search which is ace .
All your emails are online which means that you access your emails from anywhere , not just one computer .
Update : Forgot to mention how much space there is with Gmail … you will never have to delete an email again .
Update : The ‘ Canned Responses ’ aka drafts feature is great .
When you need to email something over and over , this function will save you a lot of time .
Learn About Gmail
Below are some great videos to get you started with Gmail .
If you have a website and an email related with your website you should be using Google Apps to set up your Gmail Account … the videos below will explain .
Using Gmail – Part 1 ( 5 m 38s ) - Learn about the basic features of gmail in this video .
Using Gmail – Part 2 ( 7 m 50s ) - Learn about how to retrieve other ( ie. your old email address ) email into Gmail , setup labels and filters , explain the Archive function and Gmail conversation .
Using Gmail – Part 3 ( 4 m 39s ) - Explore the more advanced settings options and some of the features coming out of Google Labs
Further Email Tips
Anyway I hope you give Gmail a try … it really is worth it .

Posted on August 27 , 2008 , Chris Blizzard Taking an ' Iterative , Organic Approach to Graphics Upgrades ' in WoW
It ’s not difficult to find any number of MMORPGs that look better than World of Warcraft from a technical standpoint .
You could argue looking “ better ” is a subjective matter and I ’d agree as someone who is a big fan of WoW ’s art style , but that does n’t change the fact that the game absolutely has room for improvement .
The concept of updating a game ’s graphics engine is n’t completely unheard of ( see : EverQuest ) , and WoW is actually receiving a facelift ( to an extent ) in the upcoming Wrath of Lich King expansion .
Surprisingly enough , that ’s not all Blizzard has in store for graphical improvements , but we should n’t count on being blown away by a single gargantuan upgrade .
Lead producer J Allen Brack clarified some recent comments on the subject :
First off , we do have some graphics updates coming with Wrath of the Lich King , namely in three areas : shadow system , shader technology , and view distance .
The shadow system will greatly improve the look of existing shadows , and players will be able to display both character and structure shadows .
The new shader technology we ’ve implemented enables the team to create even better looking terrain , as well as some cool ice effects .
And , the view distance has been increased , so players will be able to see farther than ever before in Northrend .
Right now our focus is on collecting beta feedback and getting Wrath of the Lich King ready to go for launch , so we ’re not ready at this point to talk about specific plans for future expansions .
However , it ’s important to note that in general we ’re taking an iterative , organic approach to graphics upgrades , going feature by feature as opposed to thinking in terms of an overall “ new graphics engine . ”
For example , we ’ve discussed plans for new visuals for water , but this would be for a future content update or expansion .
We also have other ideas for technical and visual improvements , but these would be for future updates / expansions as well .
So there you have it .
I ’ll be very happy to have greater draw distance once Lich King releases , and the prospect of seeing further graphical improvements is absolutely something I ’m looking forward to .
But to you , dear World of Warcraft fan / Gaming Today reader , I ask : would you welcome graphical updates to the game or do you consider yourself a purist who does n’t want to see the game touched ?
The other day on IRC we discussed the book " Higher Order Perl " and the Y combinator .
Aristotle wrote an excellent article about the Y combinator in Perl .
In short it 's a rather involved construction that allows you to write anonymous recursive subs that truly have no name .
If you read about it the first time , you might become scared by its complexity , and ask yourself " do I have to understand such things to become a good programmer ? " .
The good answer is , with Perl 6 you do n't , because there 's an easy way to avoid the complexity :
my $ factorial = sub ( Int $x ) { if ( $x < 2 ) { return 1 ; } else { return $ x * & ?
ROUTINE ( $ x - 1 ) ; } }
You see that Perl 6 cheats : although you never gave the sub a name ( except $ factorial , but you would n't even need that , for example when passing it as a parameter to another function ) , you can still access it through the & ?ROUTINE variable .
It contains the innermost routine definition ( sub , method , regex , submethod or whatever ) in the current lexical scope .
The & sigil stands for a Callable object , and the ?
twigil for a variable or constant that is known at compile time ( " Compiler hint variable " ) .
So let 's golf a bit .
Just for the fun of it .
First the if ... else can be replaced by the ternary operator ?? !! , and we do n't need explicit return 's :
my $ factorial = sub ( Int $x ) { $ x < 2 ?? 1 !! $ x * & ?
ROUTINE ( $ x - 1 ) ; }
For a golfed version you clearly do n't need a type signature , and the & ?ROUTINE thing has too long a name .
We can circumvent it by using a block instead of a sub :
my $ factorial = -> $ x { $ x < 2 ?? 1 !! $ x * & ?
BLOCK ( $ x - 1 ) ; }
Actually we do n't even need that -> $ x declaration ( a " pointy block " that other programming languages call " Lambda " ) , we can use a self - declared positional argument :
my $ factorial = { $ ^ x < 2 ??
1 !! $ ^ x * & ?
BLOCK ( $ ^ x - 1 ) ; }
On August 11 , the price of gold collapsed : down over $ 35 .
So did the price of silver , platinum , and palladium .
A lot of people are asking why .
On my site ’s page on gold ’s daily price , I make available a five - day chart of gold ’s price .
On that page , you will find my commentary on gold .
Beginning on the 18th of March , and posted on the 19th , I wrote that I believed gold had probably entered a bear market .
That call looked as though it was way too premature , since gold ’s intra-day high had been $ 1,037 on March 17 .
In the very early morning of March 17 , I ran an article on my site on how to short gold to protect your position in coins .
Here is what I posted on my gold price page .
If you have visited my page , you should recall this .
I think gold has entered a bear market .
I posted this article on March 19 , 2008 : The offsetting factor is fear of war with Iran .
See my Department : War With Iran .
Just for the historical record , here is what I wrote on March 18 and published on March 19 .
Gold could fall .
I expect it to fall .
So , you may pay a price for owning gold coins .
I expect to .
If you are not willing to pay the price , you should sell all or part of them , or short gold bullion to compensate you for the loss .
In short , count the cost .
This is a universal rule ( Luke 14:28 — 30 ) .
I think the precious metals are a bubble market today .
It is ending .
Here is a crucial sign that it is ending .
India is not buying .
When Indians stop buying gold , they must be replaced by new buyers .
Who might they be ? . . .
One day ’s move should not be regarded as a definitive turning point — not after a seven - year run .
But there are signs that the run is over for now .
It is time to think about recession and even price deflation .
As I have said for months , the FED is deflating .
We should expect prices to follow .
Silver and platinum also fell on March 18 .
They are moving together in lock - step , up and down , yet the economic fundamentals for the three are completely different .
So , something is driving them that cuts across individual markets .
But what ?
I think it is the last of Greenspan ’s bubbles : the commodity bubble .
I think the bubble is about to end .
But what about oil ?
Yes , even oil .
But the rate of declining price will be less than with other industrial commodities .
I think this will also be true of gold .
I believe in the Austrian School ’s theory of money , including the business cycle .
I have written a short book on this .
I am not so committed to a position proclaiming the ever - rising price of gold that I am willing to abandon Mises ’ theory of the boom - bust cycle in order to hold such a position .
Gold is ideal for Mises ’ inflationary crack - up boom , although not as good as a home with a garden in the country and a few thousand gallons of diesel .
This is not the crack - up boom .
There has to be monetary inflation for a crack - up boom to occur .
Today , there is n’t any .
If you wonder how I came to this conclusion , read my mini-book , Mises on Money .
I was convinced on March 18 that the recession caused by the Federal Reserve ’s relatively tight money policy would lead to a fall in the price of all commodities , especially the precious metals .
I believed that the commodity market was the last of the bubble markets .
The real estate market popped in 2006 , and had continued downward .
I was convinced that the last market of Greenspan ’s bubble economy was the commodities market .
Investors go from market to market , trying to find the next market that is going to boom .
This chase proves to be futile .
They chase bubble markets ; they get killed by bubble markets .
I was convinced that commodities were going to fall , and that this was the end of the road for the bubble markets .
In July , the commodities market did begin to fall .
I think this publicly marked the end of the commodity bubble .
One thing could bring it back : war with Iran .
That would be disastrous internationally , and it will push the price of oil and the precious metals much higher .
It was the threat of war with Iran that kept gold above $ 900 — not monetary policy , not the fundamentals of the market , not technical indicators , and not any of the other meaningless statistical indicators that are used by defenders of a bubble market to persuade investors that the market is anything except a bubble market .
You will no doubt see lots of reports on this or that indicator that shows that the correction in gold and silver and platinum and palladium and copper and zinc and all the other metals is temporary .
I do n’t think it is temporary .
I still worry about war in Iran .
I do n’t think people should ever discount too heavily the idiocy of governments regarding war .
The absolute stupidity of the President of Georgia in launching a military invasion of the Russian - dominated province of South Ossetia last Friday is indicative of what rulers do without counting the cost of their actions .
This is normal .
So , while the fall in prices of oil and the precious metals has given me some confidence that neither United States nor the State of Israel will launch a pre-emptory strike against Iran in the near future , I am certainly not willing to bet all of my money , including gold , on this assumption .
Nevertheless , I have been public in my warning since the middle of March that I believed that the bull market in gold and silver has ended .
If we are talking economic fundamentals , gold and silver have had their big run .
From now on and for months ahead , the pressure will be downward .
RECESSIONS AND GOLD
Why is this the case ?
Because the recession is real .
If the rest of the world moves into recession , as I think is likely , the demand for commodities will fall .
The value of commodities has nothing to do with value in themselves .
They are valuable only because the consumer goods that commodities are used to produce are expected to rise in price .
Manufacturers believe that there will be increasing future demand by consumers for these goods .
Therefore , they enter the market for raw commodities , land , and labor , and they bid against each other in an attempt to secure ownership of these producer goods .
Some people speak of the intrinsic value of gold .
Whenever you hear anyone say this , you can know for sure that you are dealing with someone who knows nothing about economic theory .
There is no such thing as intrinsic value .
There is only imputed value .
There can be historic value , but this historic value is based on long periods of time in which people have imputed value to a particular good or service .
There is no intrinsic value , meaning a fixed market price , for any commodity .
Commodities are valuable only in so far as the output of commodities is valuable .
This was a fundamental insight of the founder of Austrian School economics , Carl Menger .
In a recession , consumer demand falls .
The goods and services that had been demanded before are perceived as too expensive by consumers now facing a recession .
They reallocate their money to the most important uses in their household budgets .
They buy the most important goods and services , and they skip the purchase of marginal goods and services .
So , the tools of production that are used to produce the marginal goods suffer a price decline .
Demand for these producer goods falls .
Manufacturers look to the future , and they conclude that consumers will be buying far fewer of the items produced by the particular producer goods .
Producers also look at the price of commodities that are used to produce these goods , and they decide to purchase fewer of these commodities .
So , the price of commodities falls .
Gold and silver have been sold as hedges against price inflation , and sellers also have told customers that the Federal Reserve is dramatically increasing the money supply .
For almost two years , I have said that the Federal Reserve is not dramatically increasing the money supply .
It is barely increasing the money supply at all .
This is why I predicted there would be a recession .
This is why I predicted that consumer prices would not rise at anything like the increase in the supply of M3 and MZM .
I looked at the adjusted monetary base , and I concluded that the Federal Reserve was only increasing the monetary base by about 2 % per annum .
I looked at M1 , and I concluded that the money supply was barely climbing at all .
This led me to predict that consumer prices would slow down , and that commodity prices would fall as a result of a shift in consumer spending .
I post links to these statistics on my site ’s page , Federal Reserve Charts .
This is why , on March 18 , I decided that the bull run in gold and silver had ended .
Only war with Iran was likely to push gold back above $ 1,000 per ounce in 2008 .
I am not optimistic that gold would go above $ 1000 in 2009 , because I expect the real estate market will continue its downward fall , and I think that will continue at least in the 2010 , and it may continue into 2011 .
Therefore , I think this recession will be much longer than the average recession after World War II of 11 months .
Gold does not do well in most recessions .
Furthermore , neither does silver .
I realize that you have read a lot of reports from a lot of people that gold and silver were inevitably heading higher .
Well , they are not inevitably heading higher .
A CONSPIRACY ?
If you read that there is a conspiracy to force down the price of gold and silver , then you had better also be provided with a clear explanation for why this conspiracy has forced down the price of commodities across the board .
It is not just gold and silver that have fallen in price .
It is the entire Commodity Research Bureau index .
The CRB index is the standard index of commodities , and it has been falling since the beginning of July .
If conspirators are doing this , they surely are very powerful and very rich conspirators .
Writing in The Daily Reckoning on August 8 , Dan Denning reproduced the CRB chart for the year .
It is clear from this chart that the collapse is across the boards .
This is no conspiracy .
This is Austrian School economic theory in action .
I think we are entering a recession that will be known as the worst postwar recession since 1981 .
If China ’s central bank slows down its 20 % per annum increase in M1 , as I expect that it will after the Olympics , then we can expect this recession to be international .
If that is the case , then this recession could last longer , and actually be worse , in the 1980 — 81 recession .
It may not be worse in the United States , but it will be worse worldwide .
The United States has gotten rid of a great deal of manufacturing employment since 1981 .
We are more of a service - based economy .
This means that we are less threatened by decreases in consumer demand .
Consumer demand usually focuses on decreased purchases of goods rather than services .
This is why recessions have such a negative effect on commodity prices .
I think we are in only the preliminary stages of a housing recession .
Because we have not had falling housing prices nationally since the Great Depression , it is legitimate to call this a housing depression .
This is not happening only in the United States .
It is taking place all over the world .
It is especially taking place in English - speaking nations .
So , the supposed engine of economic growth , internationally and nationally , the housing market , has gone off the tracks .
It is not going to go back on the tracks in 2009 .
I will regard it as nearly miraculous if it goes back on the tracks in 2010 .
So , we had better be getting ready for a major recession that lasts for over a year , and could conceivably last for two years .
This is why I do not expect any additional bubble markets over the next two years .
We have seen that the real estate market was a bubble market .
It is in steady fall , and there is no indication that it is about to reverse .
When a bubble market pops , he does not recover soon .
Think of the NASDAQ stock index .
It peaked in March of 2000 at 5040 .
It is now around 2400 .
That was a classic bubble market , and has never recovered .
Those who thought it would recover find themselves down over 50 % in terms of their equity , and down over 20 % more in terms of purchasing power of the dollar .
Nevertheless , they hung on .
They thought the market would recover .
They were wrong .
CONCLUSION
The Federal Reserve System can and will eventually inflate .
I monitor the adjusted monetary base .
I post it on my website .
It has moved up sharply in the last month .
This does not mean that this is guaranteed to be a new trend , but it does indicate that the Federal Reserve System has inflated more rapidly than it has in over five years .
So , I do expect long - term price inflation .
But I do not expect this to take place over the next year or two .
I think price inflation will slow .
It is conceivable that we could get price deflation for a few months , depending on the severity of the recession .
The housing market is sufficient , in and of itself , to keep the American economy in a recession mode for the next year .
I expect to be a buyer of houses sometime over the next three years .
But this recession should not be underestimated with respect to commodity prices .
You should not expect the commodity bubble to reappear in the next 12 months , unless there is war with Iran .
Given what happened on Friday , August 8 , do not discount the possibility of war with Iran .
Governments do stupid things .
On Sunday evening , August 10 , “ 60 Minutes ” ran its earlier show on the possibility that the Israeli Air Force is prepared to attack Iran .
The first broadcast was scary enough .
The second was even more scary .

An anonymous garage in an industrial sector of Warwick is n’t the most obvious place to test a revolutionary piece of sonar technology .
Yet the inside of this storage facility has been turned into a makeshift laboratory by two scientists who spend more time in face masks and wet suits than the traditional goggles and white coats .
Fresh from a morning dive to retrieve a starfish - encrusted hydrophone ( underwater microphone ) from a nearby pier , Matthew Zimmerman and Matthew Coolidge turn their attention to testing a similar unit suspended on a pulley above the lab ’s showpiece : a 22,000 - gallon tank shaped like a rooftop water tower .
Once lowered into the custom - built vessel , the hydrophone barely creates a ripple .
But in the maritime world , FarSounder ’s sonar stands to make a big splash .
It ’s the first product to answer one of the basic questions in navigation : “ How deep is the water in front of me ? ”
Today ’s standard sonar , a depthsounder , only communicates the distance to the sea - floor directly beneath a ship .
( As someone at FarSounder puts it , it ’s like steering a car by only peering through a hole in the floor . )
Less commonly used is Forward - Looking Sonar ( FLS ) , a two - dimensional system for small boats that signals the range and bearing of a coming obstacle .
But though FLS can detect an object , it wo n’t describe exactly where it is , nor its dimensions and depth .
By contrast , FarSounder ’s new sonar combines all three dimensions – range , bearing , and depth – in a real - time view of the whole volume of water ahead of the ship .
By creating 3 - D images of flotsam and jetsam floating in or under the water , it ’s ideal for reducing collisions with the thousands of partially submerged containers that fall off cargo ships each year and , more important , avoiding whales .
It ’s a perfect tool for navigation through shallow ports and narrow straits .
Now , the “ ping jockey ” on a ship need never play a game of blind - man ’s bluff again .
“ It gives you a true underwater picture in real time , ” marvels Branson Bean , a maritime consultant and writer about technical subjects related to supersized yachts .
Such a product might have come in handy for The Empress of the North , a cruise ship that ran aground off Alaska last year .
It might also have warned the Queen Elizabeth II about the uncharted shoal off New England that scuppered its keel in 1992 .
And it may have saved the M/S Explorer , a cruise ship that guaranteed the journey of a lifetime , from sinking in November after it struck ice off Antarctica , briefly staining a pristine icescape with its red belly before it slipped from view .
In each instance , no lives were lost .
But just one calamitous incident could wreck the entire cruise industry , says Craig Eason , technical editor of Lloyd ’s List , a daily maritime news publication .
For that reason , cruise ships boast some of the most sophisticated bridge equipment available , he says .
No surprise , then , that vacation vessels are a primary market for FarSounder .
To date , four cruise ships have been retrofitted with the sonar system , including vessels that regularly voyage to territories such as ice fields .
The company also has commissions from luxury yachts , passenger ferries operated by the San Francisco Bay Area Water Transit Authority , and The World , the first luxury condominium cruise ship .
The US Department of Homeland Security has even tapped FarSounder to adapt the technology to detect enemy divers in ports .
It ’s a booming start for the 12 - employee firm .
And , for the most part , FarSounder expects smooth sailing ahead .
But it could run into a few jagged reefs as it seeks to expand its market .
One challenge is to get potential customers to understand that its product is fundamentally different from other forward - looking sonar systems on the market .
Those devices rotate echosounders in many directions and take several readings to manufacture a multifaceted collage of a small slice of water .
FarSounder ’s sonar , which fits into the bow of a vessel , does n’t have any moving parts and creates a real - time image of a 90 - degree field of view .
While the company wo n’t discuss how it created a technology that the US Navy has tried in vain to develop – “ It ’s a software solution on top of a hardware solution ” is all that CEO Cheryl Zimmerman will offer – FarSounder ’s cofounder , professor James Miller , says advances in computer processing power have been the key to juggling multiple channels of echosounder data for instant imaging .
The 3 - D sonar utilizes an array with about 100 receivers to record signal information .
Each “ ping ” picked up by the unit is transmitted to a computer and run through processing algorithms .
The signal information is filtered several times to intelligently extract potential targets .
As a ship rocks over the waves , the unit is able to compensate for up to a 20 degree pitch or roll of the vessel and is also able to sift out “ surface clutter ” such as air bubbles and waves .
Another obstacle for FarSounder could be persuading mariners that 3 - D sonar is essential at all – even if FarSounder sales guru Ian Bowles claims , “ We think it ’s done for sonar technology what radar and GPS has done for navigation above the ground . ”
A counterargument is that the contours of ports are meticulously mapped out and ships are able to use satellite navigation to plot exactly where they are , says Chuck Husick , a contributing editor to Guide to Marine Electronics and member of the advisory council of the US Boat Owners Association .
Still , Mr. Husick is enthusiastic about FarSounder ’s technology and observes that boats do occasionally run afoul of unchartered objects .
“ An oil tanker in the Delaware River , just south of Wilmington , Del. , [ hit ] an old anchor that nobody knew was there and tore a hole in its bottom [ in 2004 ] , ” he says .
FarSounder owes its origins to another oil spill .
The Exxon Valdez accident off Alaska in 1989 inspired Mr. Miller , a professor of ocean engineering at the University of Rhode Island , to seek a solution to ships running aground .
Unfortunately , the company ’s sonar still is n’t entirely suitable for tankers because its quarter - mile range does n’t give the slothful ocean behemoths much time to maneuver at normal traveling speed .
This short range may change .
FarSounder has a $ 2 million grant by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a two - mile range for large ships .
Inside the lab , Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Coolidge take measurements of the transducer ’s heartbeat on an oscilloscope , calibrating the transmit signal to proper specifications before they ship the unit to a client .
Zimmerman , who met Miller while studying at the University of Rhode Island and later cofounded the company , enthuses that one of the company ’s original goals was to reduce ship strikes , the leading cause of death of the endangered North Atlantic right whale .
“ Nobody had a system that could tell you where the whales were and where the rocks were , ” reflects Zimmerman .
“ So , we figured , ‘ Sure , we can figure out how to do that . ’
Of course , it took more time , more money , and was more difficult than expected .
But we ’re now doing that in real time . ”

PUERTO ORDAZ , Venezuela ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez backed Russia ’s recognition of two breakaway regions of Georgia on Friday , making Venezuela only the second nation to support Moscow ’s stance .

Russia ’s neighbor and close ally Belarus has expressed similar support for Moscow ’s decision to back the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia after a brief war between Russia and Georgia this month .
“ Russia has recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
We support Russia .
Russia is right and is defending its interests , ” Chavez said during a televised speech from an oil field along the Orinoco Oil Belt .
He stopped short of saying Venezuela recognized the regions .
Earlier on Friday , Russia said a security group of former Soviet states that it leads will discuss the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia at a meeting in Moscow next month .
Russia ’s recognition of the two regions , after chasing out Georgian troops trying to retake South Ossetia , plunged relations with the West to new lows .
Russia faced increased diplomatic isolation over its actions this week , with Asian allies failing to offer support and France saying EU leaders were considering sanctions .
Chavez , a fierce critic of the United States who has strengthened ties with Moscow in recent years , says Washington is using its ally Georgia to weaken a resurgent Russia .
Chavez has bought billions of dollars of weapons from Russia and supports its increased role on the world stage as a counter - balance to the United States .
Chavez frequently clashes verbally with Washington , but the United States still buys the bulk of the OPEC nation ’s oil .
The leftist president ’s foreign policy is based on forging alliances to counter American influence , although critics say he often simply appears to to take a stance because it is the opposite of the U.S. position .

CHICAGO , July 9 ( UPI ) -- Likely Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Barack Obama is facing an online mutiny by disappointed supporters , the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday .
The newspaper says its examination of an Obama campaign Web site shows thousands of one - time backers of the Illinois U.S. senator are now blasting him for his stance on upcoming terrorist surveillance legislation .

Obama modified his opposition to the bill once a compromise emerged giving legal immunity to U.S. telecommunications companies that allowed the Bush administration to wiretap suspect telephone calls without a warrant .
Obama opposed immunity , but once it was included , he decided to back the bill anyway , the Tribune reported .
His decision has triggered furious messages on the Web site , showing , perhaps for the first time , how a political campaign that uses the Internet extensively for fundraising and organizing can also be stung by it , the newspaper said .
" This campaign has an extraordinary group of committed supporters , and we greatly appreciate their willingness to share their time and ideas with us , " Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said .
" We believe that an open dialogue is an important part of any campaign . "
An advertising campaign launched on the London Underground during gay pride week earlier this month has caused a political storm in South Carolina .
Posters , displayed at Leicester Square and Covent Garden tube stations in the two - week period surrounding the festival , were designed to promote a gay tour operator and to increase tourism to various US destinations noted for being gay - friendly .
News of the campaign and a poster with the tagline " South Carolina is so gay " reached the state late last week where it was condemned by Senator David Thomas .
The state employee who approved the campaign has since resigned and Senator Thomas is calling for an audit of the tourism department 's advertising budget , which this year runs in excess of $ 10 m .
The tourism department has also refused to pay the $ 5,000 fee for appearing in the campaign and has asked that the advertising be removed .
" South Carolinians will be irate when they learn their hard earned tax dollars are being spent to advertise our state as ' so gay , ' " said Senator Thomas .
However , Ian Johnson , chief executive officer of Out Now , the gay marketing agency that created the campaign , claimed that the South Carolina Parks , Recreation and Tourism Department ( SCPRT ) " chased us to be included in the campaign late on .
We had to buy extra panels at Covent Garden to include South Carolina .
In addition , SCPRT hosted Andrew Roberts , the CEO of Amro , in South Carolina so that he could check that there were sufficient gay - friendly aspects to the destination before including it in the campaign .
Places like Charleston and Myrtle Beach have quite strong gay and lesbian communities . "
Armo Worldwide said they took the idea for the campaign to " several US tourism boards " late last year and " received a very positive response " .
They say the individual boards paid a cut - price fee to be featured , while they covered all other costs in a cooperative - style marketing campaign .
Other US destinations featured in Amro Worldwide 's campaign - including Washington DC , Las Vegas , Boston and Atlanta – have not reported any such backlash .
The Boston poster , which picked up on its status as capital of the first US state to legalise same - sex marriage , is thought to be expecting a huge gay - tourism boost if a ruling goes ahead to allow out - of - state gay marriages there as well .
Amro claim the adverts are enhancing the positive associations with the word " gay " .
" The expression ' That is so gay " [ is often used ] as a form of put down , not of gay and lesbian people directly , but rather as a general way to suggest that for something to be " gay " is negative or bad …
This campaign will ' reclaim ' the term ' so gay ' , " says their website .
South Carolinians , however , remain unconvinced .
" We 're so gay ? " asked one baffled resident when the story was put to him by a local television journalist .
" Nah , wrong state .
Go to California . "
At the Colorado appearance where he stressed his economic program , John McCain got a question about a vet that he did n't seem too happy about .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
The questioner , apparently a veteran , asks McCain about his voting against expansion of healthcare benefits to veterans for the years 2004 - 2007 , years in which we have Iraq and Afghanistan veterans adding exponentially to the VA rolls .
McCain testily reminds him that he has been endorsed by " all the organizations " and then launches into an explanation of his resistance to the Webb GI Bill that provided educational assistance to veterans .
Wrong bill , Gramps .
When the questioner reiterates that his question went to healthcare - - not educational -- benefits , McSame reiterate that all the veterans ' groups love him and blew him off .
Temper , temper .
McCain : I 've received every organization in America , their awards ...[ questioner says something - inaudible ]
Now , sir , I do n't ... I do n't know what you 're referring to nor do ...[ questioner continuing - inaudible ]
Sir , I 'm responding to your question and then I will let you speak again , if you 'd like , but you oughta ... the way we try to conduct these is let people finish and then I will go back to [ audience applause ] to you ... I 'll go right back .
So I do n't know what bill you 're referring to or what you 're referring to and I 'll be glad to have you refer to it .
But the reason why I have a perfect voting record from organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars , the American Legion and all the other veterans ' service organization is because of my support of them , but if you can go ahead and respond if you want to .
Go ahead .
Give him the microphone back .
Q : I 'll respond by saying this : that you do not have a perfect voting record by the DAV and the VFW .
That 's where these votes are recorded .
And the votes were proposals ... they were proposals by your colleagues in the Senate to increase healthcare funding of the VA in 2003 , 4 , 5 and 6 , for troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan , and you voted against those proposals .
I can give the specific Senate votes , the numbers of those Senate votes , right now .
McCain :
Well , I thank you and I 'll be glad to examine what your version of my record is .
But , again , I 've been endorsed in every election by all of the veterans ' organizations that do that .
I 've been supported by them and I 've received their highest awards from all of those organizations , so I guess they do n't know something you know .
So I thank you very much and I will continue to be proud of my support for the veterans of this country and proud of their support .
Transcript of full exchange below the fold :
Senator , veterans and all Americans admire your service in Vietnam .
We admire the fact that you 're the Straight Talk Express , but we know that you voted against ... well , actually , you did n't vote on the new GI Bill and you spoke out against it .
We understand you have a difference on that , but we do n't ... we have n't heard an explanation of why you voted against your colleagues ' proposals to increase healthcare funding in 2004 , 5 , 6 and 7 , when we had troops coming back from two wars .
McCain :
Well , let me say first of all , sir , on the issue of the GI Bill , I have great respect for Sen .
Webb and I appreciate his efforts and his service to our country .
The issue was we need to increase our educational benefits for our veterans .
And we were dedicated to that proposition .
The problem that some of us had , who were career military people , was that there were studies that showed that we did n't have incentives to for people become career military people .
I think those who have served understand the importance of the Non-Commissioned Officer and incentives for people to stay in .
So we argued for an ability of veterans after ... of active - duty service personnel after they 've been in for a period of time , they could transfer those educational benefits to their spouses and / or family members .
We felt that was one , appropriate , so a career military person does n't have to worry about providing educational benefits in that way and also an incentive to stay in .
Well , we reached an agreement .
In case you missed it , we reached an agreement and we passed the legislation and we will now not only have the increased educational benefits but we will also have incentives for people to become career military people and be able to transfer those benefits .
Now , I 'm disappointed that it only went back to 2001 .
Senator ... and I was disappointed that Senator Webb did n't support making it permanent .
Senator Graham and I and other veterans will be looking to trying to extend that to all veterans , not just 2001 .
I hope you 'll urge Sen .
Webb and others to agree with that .
Uh , my friend , I ... all I can say is I do n't know what you 're pointing to but I received every award from every major veterans ' organization in America .
I 've received every organization in America , their awards ...[ questioner says something - inaudible ]
Now , sir , I do n't ... I do n't know what you 're referring to nor do ...[ questioner continuing - inaudible ]
Sir , I 'm responding to your question and then I will let you speak again , if you 'd like , but you oughta ... the way we try to conduct these is let people finish and then I will go back to [ audience applause ] to you ... I 'll go right back .

A friend of mine recently slimmed down on Weight Watchers .
She joined two months ago , and in just a couple of weeks , she 'd shed 10 pounds .
She 'd been trying for a year to lose weight , but nothing worked – until now .
Why did Weight Watchers work so well ?
For a really fascinating reason : because it is n't a normal diet .
It 's something more .
Something fun .
It 's an RPG .
The Weight Watchers program is designed precisely like a role - playing dungeon crawler .
That 's why people love it , stick to it and have success with it .
And it points to the way that we could use game design to make life 's drudgery more bearable .
Let me unpack this a bit .
When I asked my friend to see how Weight Watchers works , she showed me the ingenious system .
" The best part is the web tool , " she said , pulling it up on her laptop .
When you first log in to Weight Watchers , it determines how much food you 'll be allowed to eat that day , expressed as a number of " points . "
My friend gets 23 points per day .
Each time she eats a piece of food , she enters it into the online database , and it calculates how many points she 's used .
A small apple is one point ; a piece of fried chicken is seven points .
When she first started the program , she was stunned at how quickly she burned through her daily points .
A single bagel was six points – more than 25 percent of her daily quota .
" How the hell am I going to do this without starving ? " she wondered .
But pretty soon she learned to hack her daily eating to suit the system .
She snacked on vegetables that took zero points – like bell peppers – or only one or two points , like a tasty brand of microwave popcorn .
Then she 'd save up the big points for a really decent dinner .
Better yet , Weight Watchers assigns her an extra 35 bonus points per week that she can use if she goes over her daily limit .
Or she can bank them for a big blowout restaurant meal on the weekend .
What makes this point - counting possible is Weight Watchers ' elegant online tool .
Type in any food you can think of – including brand - name snacks or boxed meals – and Weight Watchers has already calculated the points for you .
If she makes a special sandwich at home , she can calculate the ingredients , save it with a custom name , and then drag and drop it into her day every time she eats one .
As I watched her poke around on the screen , managing inventory , calculating points , staying within her range , it hit me :
Weight Watchers is an RPG .
Think about it .
As with an RPG , you roll a virtual character , manage your inventory and resources , and try to achieve a goal .
Weight Watchers ' points function precisely like hit points ; each bite of food does damage until you 've used up your daily amount , so you sleep and start all over again .
Play well and you level up – by losing weight !
And the more you play it , the more you discover interesting combinations of the rules that are n't apparent at first .
Hey , if I eat a fruit - granola breakfast and an egg - and - romaine lunch , I 'll have enough points to survive a greasy hamburger dinner for a treat !
Even the Weight Watchers web tool is amazingly gamelike .
It has the poke - around - and - see - what - happens elegance you see in really good RPG game screens .
Accidentally snack on a candy bar and ruin your meal plan for the day ?
No worries : Just go into the database and see what spells – whoops , I mean foods – you can still use with your remaining points .
And those 35 extra points you get every week ?
They 're like a special buff or potion – a last - ditch save when you 're on the ropes .
Indeed , I 'm in awe of the sheer brilliance of Weight Watchers in adopting the word points as its metric for measuring food .
The word immediately shoves the user into the semantics – and fun – of gameplay .
You regard losing weight as an intriguing challenge , as opposed to a mere grind .
This puts me in mind of the talk that Jane McGonigal – a brilliant and pioneering alternative - reality game designer – gave at this year 's South by Southwest conference .
She argued that game designers ought to put their skills to use in the real world by reshaping dull , everyday activities into fun challenges .
Why not a game that gives you points for walking your dog or jogging ?
" Games are an incredible language and system .
They should be everywhere , " she said .
" Why are we making games only for the bound pages for a computer screen or console ?
Why are n't we doing that to help people navigate and understand the world around us ? "
She could n't be more right .
As McGonigal points out , there are already some witty attempts – like Chore Wars , Wii Fit or Seriosity 's system that tries to limit corporate e-mail overload by forcing people to " spend " virtual totems to send a message .
I can think of tons of things I 'd love to see turned into a game : doing my taxes , dealing with my inbox backlog , being stuck in traffic .
And this stuff is clearly possible , because if Weight Watchers can turn something as unpleasant as dieting into a playful activity , the sky 's the limit .
Just ask my friend .

( NaturalNews ) United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has warned that without a comprehensive international agreement to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming , humanity faces " oblivion . "
" The world 's scientists have spoken with one voice : the situation is grim and urgent action is needed , " Ban said .
" The situation is so desperately serious that any delay could push us past the tipping point , beyond which the ecological , financial and human costs would increase dramatically .
" We are at a crossroads : one path leads to a comprehensive climate change agreement , the other one to oblivion .
" Ban spoke upon arriving on the Indonesian island of Bali to help break the impasse over negotiations for a new climate treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol .
Under Kyoto , 37 nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
Those goals are not on track , in large part because of the United States ' refusal to sign the treaty .
The purpose of the Bali meetings was to include a far greater range of countries -- 190 were involved in the gathering -- and set a framework , called the " Bali Roadmap , " for the next two years of negotiations , at which point a treaty is set to be finalized .
The controversy during the meetings resulted largely from a disagreement between the European Union , which favored setting strict mandatory emissions reduction goals , and the United States , which opposed mentioning specific targets and favors only voluntary emissions reductions .
The European Union pushed for the nations assembled to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
This is the change that the Nobel Peace Prize - winning U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said is necessary to avoid irreversible catastrophe .
But the United States opposed including such numbers .
Even a compromise on the wording , which would have mentioned the U.N. panel 's recommendation but not committed the Bali nations to meeting that goal , was ultimately removed from the Bali Roadmap at the insistence of the United States .
Tomgram : Six Questions about the Anthrax Case
[ A TomDispatch recommendation : Bill Moyers had Andrew Bacevich on his " Journal " for an hour Friday night , discussing his new book , The Limits of Power ( which is now the number one bestseller at Amazon.com ) .
It was nothing short of a tutorial for the American people on the three - pronged crisis that faces us -- economic , political , and military .
Believe me , it 's not to be missed and can still be watched at Moyers 's website by clicking here .
Make sure as well to check out Bacevich's two - part series on the American military crisis , excerpted from his book , which appeared at TomDispatch last week : " Illusions of Victory " and " Is Perpetual War Our Future ? " ]
Double Standards in the Global War on Terror
Anthrax Department
By Tom Engelhardt
Oh , the spectacle of it all -- and do n't think I 'm referring to those opening ceremonies in Beijing , where North Korean - style synchronization seemed to fuse with smiley - faced Walt Disney , or Michael Phelp 's thrilling hunt for eight gold medals and Speedo's one million dollar " bonus , " a modernized tribute to the ancient Greek tradition of amateurism in action .
No , I 'm thinking of the blitz of media coverage after Dr. Bruce Ivins , who worked at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick , Maryland , committed suicide by Tylenol on July 29th and the FBI promptly accused him of the anthrax attacks of September and October 2001 .
You remember them : the powder that , innocuously enough , arrived by envelope -- giving going postal a new meaning -- accompanied by hair - raising letters ominously dated " 09 - 11 - 01 " that said , " Death to America .
Death to Israel .
Allah is great . "
Five Americans would die from anthrax inhalation and 17 would be injured .
The Hart Senate Office Building , along with various postal facilities , would be shut down for months of clean - up , while media companies that received the envelopes were thrown into chaos .
For a nation already terrified by the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the thought that a brutal dictator with weapons of mass destruction ( who might even have turned the anthrax over to the terrorists ) was ready to do us greater harm undoubtedly helped pave the way for an invasion of Iraq .
The President would even claim that Saddam Hussein had the ability to send unmanned aerial vehicles to spray biological or chemical weapons over the east coast of the United States ( drones that , like Saddam 's nuclear program , would turn out not to exist ) .
Today , it 's hard even to recall just how terrifying those anthrax attacks were .
According to a LexisNexis search , between Oct. 4 and Dec. 4 , 2001 , 389 stories appeared in the New York Times with " anthrax " in the headline .
In that same period , 238 such stories appeared in the Washington Post .
That 's the news equivalent of an unending , high - pitched scream of horror -- and from those attacks would emerge an American world of hysteria involving orange alerts and duct tape , smallpox vaccinations , and finally a war , lest any of this stuff , or anything faintly like it , fall into the hands of terrorists .
And yet , by the end of 2001 , it had become clear that , despite the accompanying letters , the anthrax in those envelopes was from a domestically produced strain .
It was neither from the backlands of Afghanistan nor from Baghdad , but -- almost certainly -- from our own military bio -weapons labs .
At that point , the anthrax killings essentially vanished Poof !... while 9/11 only gained traction as the singular event of our times .
Those deaths - by - anthrax ceased to be part of the administration 's developing Global War on Terror narrative , which was , of course , aimed at Islamist fanatics ( and scads of countries that were said to provide them with " safe haven " ) , but certainly not military scientists here at home .
No less quickly did those attacks drop from the front pages -- in fact , simply from the pages -- of the nation 's newspapers and off TV screens .
Unlike with 9/11 , there would be no ritualistic reminders of the anniversaries of those attacks in years to come .
No victims , or survivors , or relatives of victims would step to podiums and ring bells , or read names , or offer encomiums .
There would be no billion - dollar ( or even million - dollar ) memorial to the anthrax dead for the survivors to argue over .
There would be little but silence , while the FBI fumbled its misbegotten way through an investigative process largely focused on one U.S. bio-weapons scientist , Steven J. Hatfill , who also worked at Fort Detrick and just happened to be the wrong man .
( Bruce Ivins , eerily enough , would work closely with , and aid , the FBI 's investigation for years until the spotlight of suspicion came to be directed at him . )
This essentially remained the state of the case until , as July ended , Ivins committed suicide .
Then , what a field day !
The details , the questions , the doubts , the disputed scientific evidence , the lists of kinds of drugs he was prescribed , the lurid quotes , the " rat 's nest " of an anthrax - contaminated lab he worked in , the strange emails and letters !
( " I wish I could control the thoughts in my mind I get incredible paranoid , delusional thoughts at times , and there 's nothing I can do until they go away , either by themselves or with drugs . " )
Case solved !
Or not ...
The " mad scientist " from the Army 's Fort Detrick bio -wars labs finally nabbed !
Or not ...
It was a dream of a story .
And the mainstream media ran with it , knowledgeably , authoritatively , as if they had never let it go .
Now , as the coverage fades and the story once again threatens to head for obscurity ( despite doubts about Ivins 's role in the attacks ) , I thought it might be worth mentioning a few questions that came to my mind as I read through recent coverage -- not on Ivins 's guilt or innocence , but on matters that are so much a part of our American landscape that normally no one even thinks to ask about them .
Here are my top six questions about the case :
1 . Why was n't the Bush administration 's War on Terror modus operandi applied to the anthrax case ?
On August 10th , William J. Broad and Scott Shane reported on some of the human costs of the FBI anthrax investigation in a front - page New York Times piece headlined , " For Suspects , Anthrax Case Had Big Costs , Scores of the Innocent in a Wide F.B.I. Net . "
They did a fine job of establishing that those who serially came under suspicion had a tough time of it : " lost jobs , canceled visas , broken marriages , frayed friendships . "
According to the Times ( and others ) , under the pressure of FBI surveillance , several had their careers wrecked ; most were interviewed and re-interviewed numerous times in a " heavy - handed " manner , as well as polygraphed ; some were tailed and trailed , their homes searched , and their workplaces ransacked .
Under the pressure of FBI " interest , " anthrax specialist and " biodefense insider " Perry Mikesell evidently turned into an alcoholic and drank himself to death .
Steven Hatfill , while his life was being turned inside out , had an agent trailing him in a car run over his foot , for which , Broad and Shane add , he , not the agent , was issued a ticket .
And finally , of course , Dr. Ivins , growing ever more distressed and evidently ever less balanced , committed suicide on the day his lawyer was meeting with the FBI about a possible plea bargain that could have left him in jail for life , but would have taken the death penalty off the table .
Whatever the pressure on Ivins or Hatfill , neither was kidnapped off a street near his house , stripped of his clothes , diapered , blindfolded , shackled , drugged , and " rendered " to the prisons of another country , possibly to be subjected to electric shocks or cut by scalpel by the torturers of a foreign regime .
Even though each of the suspects in the anthrax murders was , at some point , believed to have been a terrorist who had committed a heinous crime with a weapon of mass destruction , none were ever declared " enemy combatants . "
None were ever imprisoned without charges , or much hope of trial or release , in off - shore , secret , CIA - run " black sites . "
Why not ?
2 . Why was n't the U.S. military sent in ?
Part of the reigning paradigm of the Bush years was this : police work was not enough when the homeland was threatened .
The tracking down of terrorists who had killed or might someday kill Americans was a matter of " war . "
Those who had attacked the American homeland and murdered U.S. citizens would , as our President put it , be " hunted down " by special ops forces and CIA agents who had been granted the right to assassinate and brought in " dead or alive . "
Why then , when acts of murderous bio - terror had been committed on American soil , was the military not called in ?
Why were no CIA " death squads " -- the tellingly descriptive phrase used by Jane Mayer in her remarkable new book , The Dark Side -- dispatched to assassinate likely suspects ?
Why were no Predator unmanned drones , armed with Hellfire missiles , launched to cruise the skies of Maryland and take out Ivins or other suspects " precisely " and " surgically " in their homes ( whatever the " collateral damage " ) ?
Why , in fact , were n't their homes simply obliterated in the manner regularly employed in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Somalia , and elsewhere ?
( In fact , it seems to have taken the FBI two years after their first suspicions of Ivins simply to search his house and even longer finally to take away his high - level security clearance . )
Once U.S. weapons labs were identified as the sources of the anthrax , why were no special ops teams sent in to occupy the facilities , shut them down , and fly those found there , shackled and blindfolded , to Guantanamo or other more secret sites ?
Why , when the administration went to great lengths to squeeze off funding for terrorists elsewhere , was funding for those labs significantly increased ?
Why , when those swept up or simply kidnapped by the Bush administration and then discovered to be innocent , were -- after secret imprisonment , abuse , and torture -- regularly released without apology or reimbursement ( if released at all ) , did the U.S. government pay Hatfill $ 4.6 million to settle a lawsuit he filed in response to his ordeal ?
Why when , according to the Vice President 's " one percent doctrine , " no response was too extreme if even a minuscule chance of a catastrophic attack against the U.S. " homeland " existed , were no extreme acts taken with a WMD killer ( or killers ) on the loose , possibly in Maryland 's suburbs ?
3 . Once the anthrax threat was identified as coming from U.S. military labs , why did the administration , the FBI , and the media assume that only a single individual was responsible ?
Read as much of the coverage of the anthrax killings as you want and you 'll discover that the FBI has long taken for blanket fact that a single " mad scientist " was the culprit -- and , no less important , that that theory has been accepted as bedrock fact by the media as well .
No alternative possibilities have been seriously considered for years .
For instance , it is known that a set of the anthrax letters was sent from a mailbox in Princeton , New Jersey , some hours from Ivins 's home and the Fort Detrick lab in Frederick , Maryland .
The question the FBI puzzled over -- and the media took up vigorously -- was whether , on the day in question , Ivins had time to make it to Princeton and back , given what 's known of his schedule .
The FBI suggests that he did ; critics suggest otherwise .
No one , however , seems to consider the possibility that the lone terrorist of the anthrax killings might have had one or more accomplices , which would have made the " problem " of mailing those letters into a piece of cake .
Is it that Americans , as opposed to foreigners bent on terrorism , are assumed to be unstoppable individualists , loners canny enough to carry out plots by themselves ?
Does no one recall that the last great act of American terrorism in the United States , the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , was a crime committed by at least two American " loners " ?
( The earliest reports in that case , too , blamed Arab terrorists -- plural . )
There seem to have been no serious al - Qaeda " sleeper cells " in this country , but how do we know that there is n't a " sleeper cell " of American bio-killers lurking somewhere in the U.S. military lab community ?
4 . What of those military labs ?
Why does their history continue to play little or no part in the story of the anthrax attacks ?
In reading through reams of coverage of Ivins 's suicide and the FBI case against him , I found only a single reference to the work his lab at Fort Detrick had been dedicated to throughout most of the Cold War era .
Here is that sentence from the Washington Post : " As home to the Army Biological Warfare Laboratories , the facility ran a top - secret program producing offensive biological weapons from 1943 until 1969 . "
And yet , if you do n't grasp this fact , the real significance of the anthrax case remains in the shadows .
As with the continuing story of nuclear dangers on our planet , the terrors of our age are almost invariably portrayed as emerging from bands of fanatics , or lands like Iran said to be ruled by the same , in the backlands of our planet ( some of which also just happen to be in the energy heartlands of the same planet ) .
And yet , if we are terrified enough of loose or proliferating weapons of mass destruction to threaten or start wars over them , it 's important to understand that , from 1945 on , these dangers -- and they are grim dangers -- emerged from the heartland of the military - industrial machines of the two Cold War superpowers , the U.S. and the USSR .
Put another way , the most conceptually frightening attacks of 2001 came directly from the Cold War urge to develop offensive biological weapons .
Until 1969 , the Army 's biological - warfare laboratories at Fort Detrick were focused , in part , on that task .
Plain and simple .
After President Richard Nixon shut down the offensive bio-war program in 1969 , the Army 's scientists switched to work on " defenses " against the same .
As with defenses against nuclear attack , however , such work , by its nature , is often hard to separate from offensive work on such weaponry .
In other words , looked at a certain way , one focus of the Fort Detrick lab , which fell under suspicion in the anthrax attacks by the winter of 2001 , has long been putting bio-war on the global menu .
In that , it was evidently successful in the end .
There is irony here , of course .
In the post - Cold War era , our worries focused almost solely on the deteriorating , sometimes ill - guarded Russian Cold War labs and storehouses for biological , chemical , and nuclear war .
It was long feared that , from them , such nightmares would drop into our world .
But in this we were , it seems , wrong .
The labs with the holes were ours and -- what 's more terrifying -- the possibilities for leakage and misuse are still expanding exponentially .
5 . Were the anthrax attacks the less important ones of 2001 ?
If you compare the two sets of 2001 attacks in terms of death and destruction , 9/11 obviously leaves the anthrax attacks in the dust .
Thought about a certain way , however , the attacks of 9/11 , while bold , murderous , televisually spectacular , and apocalyptic looking , were conceptually old hat .
It was the anthrax attacks that pointed the way to a new and frightening future .
After all , the World Trade Center had already been attacked , and one of its towers nearly toppled , by a rental - van bomb driven into an underground garage by Islamists back in 1993 .
The planes in the 2001 assaults were , as Mike Davis has written , simply car bombs with wings , and car bombs have a painfully long history .
Even though in their targeting -- the symbolic mega - buildings of an imperial power whose citizens previously preferred to believe themselves invulnerable -- the 9/11 hijackers offered a new psychological reality to Americans , their most striking and unsettling feature was perhaps themselves .
Those 19 men had pledged to commit suicide not for their country , as had thousands of Japanese kamikaze pilots at the end of World War II , or even for a potential country like hundreds of Tamil suicide bombers in Sri Lanka , but for a religious fantasy ( behind which lay non-religious grievances ) .
On the other hand , the 9/11 attacks were but a larger , more ambitious version of , for instance , the suicide - by - boat attack on the U.S.S. Cole in a Yemeni port in 2000 .
On the other hand , the anthrax mailings represented something new .
( The Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cult had attempted to make and use bio-weapons , including anthrax , back in 1990s , but failed . )
If the al - Qaeda strike on 9/11 had only simulated a weapon - of - mass - destruction attack , with the anthrax killer , no imagination was necessary .
An actual weapon of mass destruction -- highly refined anthrax -- had been used successfully , then used again , and the killer (s ) remained at large , not in the Afghan backlands but somewhere in our midst , with no evidence that the supply of anthrax had been used up .
And yet , even as the Bush administration , the two presidential candidates , all of Washington , and the media remain focused on terrorism in the Afghan - Pakistani border regions , few give serious thought -- except when it comes to individual culpability -- to the terror that emerged from the depths of the military - industrial complex , from our own Cold War weapons labs .
To that , no aspect of the Global War on Terror seems to apply .
6 . Who is winning the Global War on Terror ?
The answer , obviously , is the terrorists .
Just last week , Mike McConnell , the director of national intelligence , made this crystal clear when it came to al - Qaeda .
He testified before Congress that the organization " is gaining in strength from its refuge in Pakistan and is steadily improving its ability to recruit , train and position operatives capable of carrying out attacks inside the United States . "
In fact , it 's been clear enough for quite a while that the Bush administration 's Global War on Terror has mainly succeeded in creating ever more terrorists in ever more places .
And yet , arguably , the anthrax killer or killers have , to date , gained far more than al - Qaeda .
Looked at a certain way , whatever the role of Bruce Ivins , the anthrax killings proved to be a full - scale triumph of terrorism .
One theory has long been that whoever committed the anthrax outrages was intent on drawing attention ( and probably funding ) to further research and development of U.S. bio-war " defenses . "
If so , then , what a remarkable success !
In the years since the attacks occurred , funding has flooded into such labs , whose numbers have grown strikingly .
On September 11 , 2001 , reports the Washington Post , " there were only five ' biosafety level 4 ' labs -- places equipped to study highly lethal agents such as Ebola that have no human vaccine or treatment -- a Government Accountability Office report stated last fall .
Fifteen are in operation or under construction now , according to the report .
There are hundreds more biosafety level 3 labs , which handle agents such as Bacillus anthracis , which does have a human vaccine . "
The few hundred people at work in the U.S. bio-defense program before 9/11 have swelled to perhaps 14,000 scientists who have " clearances to work with ' select biological agents ' such as Bacillus anthracis -- many of them civilians working at private universities " where , according to experts , " security regulations are remarkably lax . "
And do n't forget the Army 's own billion - dollar plan to " build a larger laboratory complex as part of a proposed interagency biodefense campus at Fort Detrick . "
We 're talking about the place where , as Ivins 's crew was evidently nicknamed , " Team Anthrax " worked and whose labs are reputedly " renowned for losing anthrax . "
In these same years , according to the New York Times , " almost $ 50 billion in federal money has been spent to build new laboratories , develop vaccines and stockpile drugs . "
Some of this money was pulled out of basic public health funds which once ensured that large numbers of people would n't die of treatable diseases like tuberculosis and redirected into work on the Ebola virus , anthrax , and other exotic pathogens .
In these years , not to put too fine a point on it , the Bush administration has exponentially expanded our bio-war labs , increasing significantly the likelihood that a new " mad scientist " will have far more opportunity and far more deadly material available to work with .
It has , in other words , increased the likelihood not just that terror will come to " the homeland , " but that it will come from the homeland .
Thanks to this administration , the terrorists won this round and future terrorists can reap the fruits of that victory .
Bruce Ivins , whatever you did , or whatever was done to you , R.I.P .
Your lab is in good hands .
And the likelihood is that , almost seven years after the first anthrax envelope arrived , the world is more of a terror machine than ever .
Tom Engelhardt , co-founder of the American Empire Project , runs the Nation Institute 's TomDispatch.com .
He is the author of The End of Victory Culture , a history of the American Age of Denial .
The World According to TomDispatch : America in the New Age of Empire ( Verso , 2008 ) , a collection of some of the best pieces from his site , has just been published .
Focusing on what the mainstream media has n't covered , it is an alternative history of the mad Bush years .
[ Note on readings : Oddly enough , back in December 2002 , as this site was going public , the very first TomDispatch guest writer , public health expert David Rosner , took up the issue of smallpox hysteria , pointing out that the disease was saved from total eradication on the planet by a U.S. / USSR agreement " to make sure that the virus that causes smallpox would remain in storage awaiting a new opportunity to terrorize the world .
For decades , both countries stored it , distributed it to various research labs and otherwise ensured that this public health victory would be turned into a potential human tragedy . "
He added : " Fear of smallpox has played nicely into the overall strategy of the Bush administration to militarize public health . "
It 's a piece worth revisiting , as perhaps is " It Should Have Been Unforgettable , " a post I wrote back in 2005 when the anthrax case had long fallen off the American radar screen .
More recently , Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com has done superb work on the anthrax story .
In 2007 , he wrote a striking column , " The unresolved story of ABC News ' false Saddam - anthrax reports , " on some crucially bad reporting by Brian Ross and ABC , and he followed up after Ivins 's suicide with a piece , ( " Journalists , their lying sources , and the anthrax investigation , " ) that has more unsettling questions about the anthrax case than any other 16 pieces I 've seen .
It 's a must read .
Jay Rosen , at his always interesting PressThink blog , took up Greenwald 's challenge to Brian Ross and ABC on its reporting and pressed the point home in two recent posts , here and here .
Finally , Elisa D. Harris , a senior research scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland , had a fine , thoughtful op - ed last week in the New York Times , " The Killers in the Lab " ( " Our efforts to fight biological weapons are making us less safe " ) , which laid out in an impressive way the expansion of U.S. bio-weapons research since 2001 . ]

What is it about the collegiate atmosphere that inspires pranks ?
Maybe it 's the lure of becoming a school legend , your hilarious exploits recounted ' round bonfires for years to come .
Or maybe it 's just the natural result of putting too many smart , hormone - addled young folk together in one place .
Whatever the reason , colleges ( and to a lesser extent , boarding schools ) are a breeding ground for awe - inspiring pranks -- and here are some of our favorites .
( Some of these entries appeared in the Mental_floss article " History 's Greatest Hoaxes " by Alex Boese , vol. 2 , issue 6 . )
1. The Explosives Were Just A Warm - Up
Alright , this is a high school prank , but it has all the hallmarks of a collegiate job ( think of it as AP pranksterhood ) .
Our very own John Green masterminded this elaborate , hilarious two - parter as a senior at his Alabama boarding school , and not only did it make he and his cohorts living legends at Indian Springs High School for years to come , it also became the basis for several major plot points in John 's debut novel , Looking for Alaska ( soon to be a movie ) .
Warning : some crude ( but contextually appropriate ) language .
2. Bonsai Kittens
" You no longer need be satisfied with a house pet having the same mundane shape as all other members of its species , "  declared the website Bonsaikitten.com , which debuted in 2000 .
" With Bonsai Kitten a world of variation awaits you , limited only by your own imagination . " 
According to the website , you could treat a young kitten in much the same way that you treat a young juniper : by sealing a furry friend inside a specially - designed glass jar , you could force Fluffy 's still - pliable bones to conform to the jar 's shape .
Special feeding tubes supposedly took care of all kitty 's nature - related needs ( just make sure you drill an air hole ! ) , and with a little careful pruning now and then , the rest would take care of itself !
Of course , the website was total hokum , devised by a group of bored MIT students and housed on the school 's servers .
Even after the site was found to be of questionably authentic origin , however ( it proved to be impossible to actually purchase said Bonsai Kittens ) , outraged emails kept pouring in .
The Humane Society and PETA both denounced the site publicly , and in 2001 the FBI subpoenaed all information about the site they could get from MIT .
No evidence of abuse was ever found , but even after Bonsaikitten.com had been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked as a prank , vitriolic emails from outraged animal lovers forced it site to bounce around from hosting service to hosting service for several years .
3. Lady Liberty Goes for a Swim
In February 1979 , the Statue of Liberty appears submerged in the waters of Wisconsin 's Lake Mendota .
It 's the brainchild of the infamous Pail & Shovel Party , a small group of ( mischief - prone ) undergrads running the University of Wisconsin at Madison 's student government that year .
As part of their election campaign , they had promised to bring Lady Liberty to Wisconsin , which they do ... sort of .
The group spends three days constructing the statue of of papier - mache and chicken wire .
When it appears peeking up from the lake , they claim it was flown in by helicopter from NYC , but after the rope snapped , it sent her crashing through the ice .
So did they make their fellow students proud ?
Not exactly .
The P&S party used $ 4,500 of student funds for the construction .
4. Hugo N. Frye , Father of the Republican Party
Hoping to make a statement about the superficiality of politicians , a pair of Cornell students in 1930 make special plans to honor one Hugo Norris Frye , father of the Republican party , at the school 's annual banquet .
Problem is , he does n't exist .
( " You go and fry " -- get it ? )
They print up letterhead for the H.N. Frye Sesquicentennial Committee and mail letters to many notable Republicans , asking that they issue statements honoring the important , if little - known , patriot on the occasion of his 150th birthday .
In response , they receive several letters of glowing praise for Frye -- including one from the Vice President of the United States , Charles Curtis -- which they read aloud to an amused crowd at their banquet .
It would have been harmless enough , but when the story landed on the front page of The New York World , the victims were exposed -- and they were n't laughing .
5. Greasing the Tracks
The night before an 1896 football game with their arch-rival Georgia Tech , a group of Auburn students set out for the local train station .
To greet the arriving Tech team , the Auburn kids decide to do a particularly impressive job of the old " greasing the tracks " prank , covering the rails around the station and well down the line heading out of town .
When the Tech train rolls in the next morning , it can't stop and reportedly slides for 10 miles , leaving the team an its accompanying fans well outside their intended destination .
Forced to walk into town for the game , the players are so exhausted when they finally reach the field , Tech loses 45 to nothing .
6 . The Crimson Sparks a Red Scare
A long - running rivalry between Harvard 's school papers , the Crimson and the Lampoon , came to a head with this 1953 prank .
Crimson staffers play one of their favorite pranks by stealing the Lampoon 's Ibis , the large bird statue perched on top of their office .
But this time , they send a letter to the Soviet consul in New York to report that the editors of the Lampoon wish to offer the Ibis as a symbol of friendship , billing the bird as " sort of an American peace dove . "
The Soviets accept , and the Ibis is handed off to a confused U.N. delegate in a formal ceremony .
Not wanting to be outdone , the Lampoon retaliates with a letter of their own .
With help from then - editor John Updike , they write to Joseph McCarthy , insisting the prank clearly proves the Crimson 's communist leanings and calling for a full investigation .
( CNN ) --
The woman who had an extramarital affair with former presidential candidate John Edwards wo n't seek a paternity test to prove whether he's the father of her 5 - month - old child , her lawyer said Saturday .
Rielle Hunter says she will not seek a paternity test to determine if John Edwards is the father of her child .
In a statement he provided to the Washington Post , attorney Robert Gordon said that Rielle Hunter is a private citizen and that she will not comment further on the media frenzy sparked Friday when Edwards publicly acknowledged the affair .
" She wishes to maintain her privacy " and the privacy of her child , Gordon said in the statement .
" Furthermore , Rielle will not participate in DNA testing or any other invasion of her ... privacy now or in the future . "
Gordon said Saturday that he would not immediately be releasing the statement to anyone else and will not be doing interviews about it .
After months of denying the affair , Edwards admitted making " a serious error in judgment " in 2006 when he had an affair with Hunter , a filmmaker who worked making videos for his presidential campaign .
Watch how Hunter started working with Edwards »
He said her child is not his , as had been claimed in tabloid reports , saying the timing of the affair would make that impossible .
A former Edwards campaign aide , Andrew Young , has publicly said the child is his .
Edwards said he was willing to take a paternity test to clear up the question .
" Happy to take a paternity test ... would love to see it happen , " he said in an interview with ABC News .
Edwards , a former senator from North Carolina , was the Democratic vice - presidential nominee in 2004 .
He made an unsuccessful bid for his party 's nomination in this year 's election and had been considered a possible vice presidential choice for presumptive nominee Sen.
Barack Obama -- or a contender for attorney general or another top government post if Obama wins in November .

War in Georgia : The Israeli connection
For past seven years , Israeli companies have been helping Gerogian army to preparer for war against Russia through arms deals , training of infantry units and security advice

The fighting which broke out over the weekend between Russia and Georgia has brought Israel 's intensive involvement in the region into the limelight .
This involvement includes the sale of advanced weapons to Georgia and the training of the Georgian army 's infantry forces .
The Defense Ministry held a special meeting Sunday to discuss the various arms deals held by Israelis in Georgia , but no change in policy has been announced as of yet .

" We are not operating in any way which may counter Israeli interests .
We have turned down many requests involving arms sales to Georgia ; and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized .
So far , we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures . " began selling arms to Georgia about seven years ago following an initiative by Georgian citizens who immigrated to Israel and became businesspeople .

' Do n't anger the Russians '
The Israelis operating in Georgia attempted to convince the Israeli Aerospace Industries to sell various systems to the Georgian air force , but were turned down .
The reason for the refusal was " special " relations created between the Aerospace Industries and Russia in terms of improving fighter jets produced in the former USSR and the fear that selling weapons to Georgia would anger the Russians and prompt them to cancel the deals .
Israelis ' activity in Georgia and the deals they struck there were all authorized by the Defense Ministry .
Israel viewed Georgia as a friendly state to which there is no reason not to sell arms systems similar to those Israel exports to other countries in the world .

A 21 - leaf clover discovered on June 3 by Iwate prefecture farmer Shigeo Obara has shattered the Guinness world record for most leaves on a clover stem ( Trifolium repens L. ) .
The current official record is held by an 18 - leaf clover that Obara found in his garden in May 2002 .
The record - breaking clover 's 21 leaves each measure about 1 centimeter long and overlap each other like rose petals on a 3 - centimeter stem .
Obara , a former food crop researcher , has been conducting independent research on clovers in his garden for over 50 years .
He first became interested in clover mutations after discovering an unusual patch of 4 - leaf clovers in 1951 .
Since then , Obara has been crossbreeding the plants in his garden to research the genes associated with leaf count , color , pattern and size .
Obara plans to file a new application with Guinness , although he is considering waiting a while .
" We are likely to find clovers with more leaves , " he says .
Last month , a family member claimed to have found a 27 - leaf clover , but the discovery was not confirmed .
While some say that 4 - leaf clovers symbolize happiness , 5 - leaf clovers symbolize wealth and 6 - leaf clovers symbolize fame , it is unclear what 21 - leaf clovers symbolize .

Integrity Bank , Alpharetta , Georgia , with $ 1.1 billion in total assets and $ 974.0 million in total deposits as of June 30 , 2008 , was closed today by the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance , and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was named receiver .
The FDIC Board of Directors today approved the assumption of all the deposits of Integrity Bank by Regions Bank , Birmingham , Alabama .
All depositors of Integrity Bank , including those with deposits in excess of the FDIC 's insurance limits , will automatically become depositors of Regions Bank for the full amount of their deposits , and they will continue to have uninterrupted access to their deposits .
Depositors will continue to be insured with Regions Bank so there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance .
The failed bank 's five offices will reopen Tuesday , September 2nd , as branches of Regions Bank .
However , for the time being , customers of both banks should use their existing branches until Regions Bank can fully integrate the deposit records of Integrity Bank .
Regions Bank has agreed to pay a total premium of 1.012 percent for the failed bank 's deposits .
In addition , Regions Bank will purchase approximately $ 34.4 million of Integrity Bank 's assets , consisting of cash and cash equivalents .
The FDIC will retain the remaining assets for later disposition .
Customers with questions about today 's transaction or who would like more information about the failure of Integrity Bank can visit the FDIC's Web site at http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/integrity.html, or call the FDIC toll - free at 1-800-523-0640 , today from 5 p.m. until 9 p.m. , Eastern Time , on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. , on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. , and thereafter from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m .
The FDIC estimates that the cost to its Deposit Insurance Fund will be between $ 250 million and $ 350 million .
Regions Bank 's acquisition of all deposits was the " least costly " resolution for the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund compared to all alternatives because the expected losses to uninsured depositors were fully covered by the premium paid for the failed bank 's franchise .
Integrity Bank is the tenth FDIC - insured bank to fail this year , and the first in Georgia since NetBank in Alpharetta on September 28 , 2007 .

Back to the Constructing our lives package >
This article is the winner of the university student category of the Plus new writers award 2008 .
Let 's face it .
Some things in life are certainties .
This is one of them :
Or so I thought .
" I do n't wanna die . "
See , when your plane is plummeting towards the Atlantic Ocean and dozens of oxygen masks are simultaneously popped from their compartments like orange tic tacs , that 's precisely what you 're supposed to be thinking .
That 's what most sane passengers on board Flight 888 were thinking , anyways , but not me ; personally , I was content to stare at the gorgeous woman sitting by my side and wonder — amidst all the screaming — whether , she'd be the type to favour wit and humour over a bulging biceps - and - rippling - abs physique .
Mind you , this was just the setup ( it turned out to be a false alarm , anyways , " Due to horrendous weather conditions , " said the pilot ) , but I wanted to give you an idea of the truly epic life - or - death scope of the story to come .
The real story , however , begins with her .
Even in the limited illumination of the cabin , her hair shone a rich , copper red .
This framed not only a perfect curving face , but also two of the bluest eyes I 'd ever seen .
But this was n't all .
The earlier theatrics had scared her and despite clear skies and smooth sailing , I could tell she was still on edge .
But this was perfect , you see , because it gave me a chance to swoop in and sooth her poor , tortured soul ( that 's how it 's supposed to work , anyways ) .
" Just a little turbulence , " I offered helpfully , " Nothing to be scared of — uh ... , " I trailed off , motioning expectantly towards her .
" Rhea . "
" Right .
Rhea .
It 's Jeff , by the way .
There 's nothing to be scared of , Rhea , " I assured her again .
She was silent for a moment ; then leaning over me , pointed a slender finger out the window .
" Nothing ? " she said , raising an eyebrow , " Yeah , nothing is what 's stopping us from plummeting , oh I dunno , twenty - thousand feet to the ground in a blazing tomb of shattering metal and death , right ? ... Jeff ? "
So it was going to be harder than I thought .
Ten minutes had passed since my disastrous attempt to heroically intervene , and by now , she was already nervously fingering her way through a Cosmo magazine .
I needed to do something — something drastic — or I was going lose her to another one of those ghastly how - does - your - love - life - stack - up quizzes .
" You 're wrong , " I blurted out , loudly .
She turned and looked at me , bemused .
" About what ? "
" What you said earlier .
About how nothing is holding us up . "
I ran my fingers through my hair .
" Look , flying was n't invented overnight , right ?
Da Vinci , Cayley , Lanchester , Joukowski , ... "
I rattled off a few more impressive - sounding names , " Thousands of the greatest minds conspiring over hundreds of years with the sole purpose of reaching one of mankind 's greatest dreams ... "
" So ? "
" So Rhea , today , aerodynamics , all this — , " I gestured out the window , " All this — is grounded in solid , rigorous mathematics .
It 's not nothingness that 's holding us up .
It 's maths . "
" Maths , " she repeated disinterestedly , " I 'm not very good at maths . "
" You do n't have to be , " I replied softly .
She picked up the Cosmo magazine from her lap and froze for what seemed like ages .
Then , seeming to have made a decision , she placed it in the pouch before her and leaned back in her seat , sighing .
" Okay , " she said , nodding , " Let 's talk . "
By now , we 'd both finished our creations : three crisp paper airplanes assembled with the enthused precision only a 10 - year - old could muster .
She threw hers and laughed as it flopped straight to the ground .
Mine careened suicidally into a bulkhead and the stewardess , having witnessed all our shenanigans , scowled in our direction .
As I held up the last plane , I explained .
" There are four aerodynamic forces we need to talk about : thrust , drag , lift , and gravity . "
I said , gesturing in each of the four directions .
" As air flows over the plane , pressure is exerted on the surface of the plane .
If there 's more pressure on the bottom than the top , lift is produced , and the plane stays aloft so long as the force is greater than gravity . "
" But this , " she said , waving at our surroundings , " is not made of paper . "
" Ah ha !
Obtaining lift is easy — heck , even a barn door raised at an angle produces lift .
The second problem is drag , and so flight is actually the problem of maximising lift , while minimising drag . "
" But how ? " I asked excitedly , " What kind of aerofoil design do we need , Rhea ? "
" Beats me , " she said , amused by my enthusiasm , " But I bet you 'll tell me all about it over dinner . "
It was like a date , really .
But with only two meal choices and really crappy wine .
" So ... " Rhea said , prodding her chicken suspiciously , " When the Wright Brothers managed the first ever flight in nineteen - hundred whatever , they did n't actually know how the maths worked ? "
With a fork , I poked my own in - flight meal timidly .
Half - expecting the chicken to wake up and start clucking hysterically , I wisely opted for the fruit cup instead .
" The Wright Brothers were at the forefront of experimental aerodynamics , " I corrected , " Using their own wind tunnel tests , they produced different aerofoils until they found one that worked .
Most importantly , it had to be curved ( or cambered ) so air flows faster over the top ; this reduces the pressure on the top and produces more lift . "
" But surprisingly , there were almost no meaningful aerodynamic theories at the time .
We had the right equations — but nobody knew what to do with them . "
" But this changed ? "
I pushed my meal back with a grimace .
" Oh , sure .
Theoretical aerodynamics was rampant only a handful of years later .
But , uh ... I dunno , " I said , teasing her , " You sure you 're ready for this stuff ? "
I leaned back and pretended to peer at her dubiously .
" I mean , it 's pretty wild . "
She just rolled her eyes and went back to eating .
The crew had turned off the lights and so most passengers were dozing quietly .
Not us , though .
We insisted on whispering softly , and with the lone reading light providing the only illumination , it had the eerie effect of making it seem like we were the only two passengers on board Flight 888 .
I scribbled something on a row of napkins .
" The three governing equations of fluid motion , " I explained , " are known as the Navier Stokes equations .
Together , they simply express three fundamental laws . "
" This one here , " I said pointing to the first equation , " says that the total amount of fluid — or , in our case , air particles — has to remain constant .
This is just conservation of mass .
Stuff can't disappear . "
" The second one here is Newton 's second law of motion : mass times acceleration is equal to the total applied force .
That 's just conservation of momentum . "
" And the last one is conservation of energy — the total energy in the system must remain constant . "
She looked disdainfully at the row of napkins strewn before her and pointed a single , perfectly manicured finger at one of them .
" What can we do with that ? " she asked .
" It 's tough , " I conceded , " These equations are too hard to solve directly .
And even for the two - dimensional problem ( flow around a cross section of the aerofoil ) , it 's still too complicated because of the geometry . "
" So what we do is we consider a simpler geometry , say , the airflow around a flat plate ; we solve the governing equations for this problem , then we construct a mathematical map that brings us back to the original , more difficult geometry . "
" It 's tough , I know .
But the point is , the maths is all there .
It 's not a mystery anymore ; not like it was for da Vinci or the Wright Brothers . "
That — believe it or not — was the last time we 'd talk about maths .
She was relaxed now , and her head was gently propped against a pillow resting on my shoulder .
But whether or not this zen - like state of relaxation was because of newfound understanding ( as opposed to sheer mental boredom ) ... well , I 'll let you decide .
In any case , it worked , and hell , she had n't touched that damn Cosmo since we both started talking .
" Are you asleep ? " I asked .
She took her time answering .
" Not yet . "
" Sooooo ... " , I said , stretching out the vowel and grinning sheepishly , " Tell me , what do you do ? "
At that , she whipped her head off and gave a look of such pure , seething outrage that ... well , I tell ya ' , it would have immediately sent lesser mortals fleeing .
" Oooooh , I get it , " she squealed , " Good looking stranger corners you on an airplane for a three hour balls - to - wall maths lecture , and then asks what you do .
Typical , " she sniffed .
" Wha&mdash ? " , I said , feigning mock hurt , " But I got you dinner and everything . "
She gave me a mischievous grin , punched her pillow , and put her head back .
" Admit it Jeff , " she said , " You 've been using me . "
I pushed the button on my armrest turning off the overhead lights and plunging the two of us into blissful darkness .
" Babe , " I said , " You 've no idea . "
Epilogue
About the author
Phil Trinh was once asked by his English teacher what he'd be doing after high school .
" I want a PhD in maths , " he said , nodding vigorously .
" Really ? " the teacher asked incredulously .
" People actually do that ?
PhDs in maths ?
Dear Lord , what on earth for ? "
Phil Trinh is now a doctoral student at Oxford 's Mathematical Institute .
He remembers this particular exchange fondly .
So fondly , in fact , that even now — years later — he feels like slapping his forehead and muttering , " Gagh ! "
Plus would like to thank the London Mathematical Society and the Maths , Stats and Operational Research Network , as well as the journal Nature for their kind support of this competition .
" I admit I was kicking off but I could n't believe he said that .
Luckily none of my mates out there were killed , but for all he knew my best friend could have died .
He does n't know anything and had no right to say something like that . "

Some people will go to any lengths for a pint - even if it involves supping in a tree .
This bar in the trunk of a Baobab has punters travelling from miles around for a brew .
It has been created in a huge 72ft high tree in this garden in Limpopo , South Africa , to keep thirsty locals happy .
Scroll down for more ...
But tourists flock to see the amazing bar inside the hollow 155 ft circumference of the trunk .
The tree even has its own cellar , with natural ventilation to keep the beer cool .
The huge tree , in the grounds of Sunland Farm , is so wide it takes 40 adults with outstretched arms to encircle it .
Scroll down for more ...
Carbon - dating , which can determine the age of organic materials , has shown the anicent tree is about 6,000 years old .
" This tree is likely to be older than the Giza Pyramids of Egypt , " said Heather van Heerden , owner of Sunland Farm .
" It is phenomenal to have such a magnificent tree in your back garden .
It is possibly the biggest living thing on earth . "
Scroll down for more ...
More than 7,000 visitors from all over the world come to see the majestic Baobab each year and have a drink in its bar , which has four metre high ceilings and comfortably seats up to 15 people .
Even though the tree trunk is hollow , it walls are up to two metres thick .
" One year we had a party and squashed 54 people inside , but I would n't recommend that , " said Mrs van Heerden .
She and her husband Doug came up with the idea of setting up a pub when they found a natural hollow inside the Baobabb shortly after they bought the farm in the late 1980's .
" When Baobabs are more than 1,000 years old , they hollow naturally , " said Mrs van Heerden .
Scroll down for more ...
While clearing out the hollow centre of the tree trunk , the van Heerdens found historical evidence of Bushmen , indigenous people of the Kalahari desert , who may have once lived in the tree .
They also found artefacts belonging to the Voortrekkers , the Dutch pioneers who travelled through South Africa in the mid-1800s .
" We found the remains of a Bushmen bed made from rocks , possibly in the 1700s , " says van Heerden .
" We could also gather that a Voortrekker once lived here who repaired ox wagons for the Great Trek because we found tools and wagon pieces . "
The Bushmen of the Kalahari always had a special relationship with the strange - looking tree , which stands leafless for most of the year , with its branches resembling a mass of roots pointing in the sky .
The Baobab is also called the Tree of Life because it is capable of providing shelter , food and water for the animal and human inhabitants of the African savannah .
Hundreds of birds , insects and small mammals live in the tree whose fruit , called " monkey bread " , is an important source of vitamin C for many animals .
Many myths and legends are told about this king of all trees .
" The Baobab is a sacred tree in African culture .
If a baby drinks a mixture of its bark and water , it is said to grow up mighty and powerful , " van Heerden explained .
Africans also believe that anyone who dares to pick a Baobab flower will be eaten by a lion .
But if a person drinks water in which the tree 's seeds have been soaked , he will be safe from a crocodile attack .
Yesterday , in Taxpayers Can Bear No More , we discussed the record public debt problem in the UK .
Chancellor Alistair Darling made it " clear that he thought that the only politically viable option was to increase borrowing , rather than to raise taxation . "
In the US , states are facing similar budget dilemmas .
New Jersey , whose median household income of $ 64,470 is second only to Maryland , is one of 29 states that ran short of revenue to balance this year 's budget , up from three in 2006 , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington found .
Lawmakers across the country , who previously sought to trim debt and cut taxes , are instead increasing borrowing as the slowest economy since 2001 erodes consumer spending and home values .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is looking to bridge a $ 17 billion budget gap by borrowing against future lottery profits .
Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich wants to issue bonds to plug a shortfall in pension - plan funding and cut spending on health care and education .
Corzine plans to borrow for school construction , and officials in Arizona may too .
Taxes are already so high that further increases may actually reduce collections , said former U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli , a New Jersey Democrat who recruited Corzine for his successful 2000 Senate campaign .
" People obviously do n't want higher taxes , " said Torricelli , who earlier this month hosted a fundraiser for Corzine 's 2009 re-election effort at his Delaware Township home .
" They never want spending cuts , and no one is lining up to make sacrifices . "
Flashback October 27 , 2007
Schwarzenegger 's latest scheme is to use lottery proceeds to expand health care .
Given that lottery proceeds now fund education , the governor 's proposal would replace money from the lottery that now goes to education with funds from the state 's general fund .
Schwarzenegger did not say what would be used to fund the shortfall in the state 's general fund .
Schwarzenegger 's Financial Wizardry
Lottery proceeds will be used to expand health care .
Education that used to be funded by lottery proceeds will instead be funded from the state general fund .
The question as to what will fund the shortfall in the state 's general fund , has now thankfully been solved : Lottery proceeds .
California Unemployment Rate Hits 6.9 %
Silicon Valley posted anemic job growth last month , but in a state that economists say is in a " jobs recession , " any growth is good .
More than 1.2 million Californians are unemployed , according to figures released Friday by the state Employment Development Department .
California 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.9 percent , up from 6.8 percent in May ; the valley 's rate jumped from a seasonally unadjusted 5.6 percent in May to 6.1 percent in June .
Many of the valley 's largest companies have been cutting jobs .
Layoffs combined with construction and financial unemployment boosted the number of people looking for work and unable to find it .
The state 's jobless rate " tells us that the California economy is in a recession , " said Stephen Levy of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy .
With data not yet in on the quarter for the state economy , Levy called it a " jobs recession . "

Aribert Heim 's crimes rank among the worst of the Holocaust , and after a hunt that has spanned almost half a century , Nazi - hunters believe they are closing in on him .
The search for the 94 - year - old former SS medical officer has taken investigators from Germany all around the world .
Besides his home country of Austria and Germany , where he lived after the war , tips have come from Uruguay , Spain , Switzerland , Brazil and Chile .
Heim in his earlier days - but how might he look now ?
Enlarge Image
Nazi-hunters are now confident that Heim - who was known for his sadism as a doctor at the Nazi's Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria - is seeing out his twilight years near his daughter in southern Chile , or across the border in Argentine Patagonia , the region between the Andes and the south Atlantic .
Acting on information about Heim 's whereabouts that he describes as " so significant that it has a high potential " , Efraim Zuroff , the Simon Wiesenthal Centre 's top Nazi- hunter , has travelled to the Chilean town of Puerto Montt , 657 miles ( 1,058 km ) south of the capital Santiago , where he says Heim 's 64 - year - old daughter lives .
He refuses to divulge the nature of the recent information .
Heim 's daughter has said that her father died in 1993 in Argentina , but a death certificate has never been produced .
Neither she nor her two brothers , who live in Germany , have claimed the estimated $ 1.5 m ( 900,000 euros ; £ 750,000 ) that sits in a European bank account in Heim 's name .
Bounty
On his way to board the flight to southern Chile , Professor Zuroff - who has been hunting Nazi war criminals and their collaborators for nearly three decades - told the BBC News website that he believes he is closing in on Heim .
Efraim Zuroff says he has received significant information
He was in the country back in November , when the centre launched Operation Last Chance , its final attempt to find Nazi war criminals in South America .
A reward of 315,000 euros , or almost $ 500,000 , is being offered jointly by the centre and the German and Austrian governments for information that will lead to Heim 's arrest and prosecution by the German government .
Mr Zuroff is optimistic that the size of the bounty could prove crucial to his capture .
He is now launching a newspaper campaign advertising the bounty in Chile and Argentina .
" By going closer to the area where we believe he may well be hiding , we are trying to increase the chances of finding someone with the critical information regarding his whereabouts , " he said .
" In the past , money has exposed Nazi war criminals , such as Schwammberger in Argentina .
This was a great success and we hope to add another one very soon . "
The offer of a reward in the late 1980s led investigators to notorious camp commander Josef Schwammberger who was extradited from Argentina to end his days in a German prison .
Germany extradition Mr Zuroff says he does n't expect to find Heim immediately .
Mauthausen concentration camp , where Heim was a medical officer " We 're putting in place certain initiatives which could reveal his hiding place within a couple of weeks , " he says .
" He would then be extradited to Germany to stand trial assuming that his health permits .
Everyone is fairly confident that it would go smoothly and quickly .
" Germany has created a special task force to find Heim .
He would be tried there and it would be the most important Nazi war crimes trial in the past 30 years . "
The Austrian - born physician has been indicted by Germany on charges that he murdered hundreds of inmates while serving as a doctor at Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria , where he earned the nickname " Dr Death " .
He is accused of killing Jews using exceptionally cruel methods .
According to Holocaust survivors , he performed operations and amputations without anaesthetic to see how much pain his victims could endure .
Injecting victims straight into the heart with petrol , water or poison was said to have been his favoured method at Mauthausen .
And when he was " bored " , he apparently timed patients ' deaths with a stopwatch .
After World War II , Heim practised medicine in the German town of Baden - Baden until 1962 , when he was indicted as a war criminal and fled the country .
' Passage of time '
One testimony from a camp survivor accuses him of cutting off the head of a murdered Jewish prisoner and boiling off the flesh to enable the skull to be used as an exhibit .
Stories like this abound .
One claims that the doctor removed tattooed skin from one victim and turned it into a seat cover .
Born 28 June , 1914 in Radkersburg , Austria , Heim joined the local Nazi party in 1935 , three years before Austria was annexed by Germany .
He later joined the Waffen SS .
If Heim is still alive , he would have just turned 94 .
Some may argue that it is wrong to put an a frail old man on trial for alleged crimes committed more than half his lifetime ago .
But Mr Zuroff is uncompromising : " The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the perpetrators , " he said in a previous interview with the BBC .
" Killers do n't become righteous gentiles when they reach a certain age .
And if we were to set a chronological limit on prosecutions , it would basically say you could get away with genocide . "
The centre believes there are dozens of Nazi war criminals and their collaborators in Latin America .
The reward for information leading to their arrest has just been increased from $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 .
But the investigators are working against time : most of the alleged criminals are in their late 80s or 90s .
They say that if they only get Heim , Operation Last Chance would have been a success .
In the next few days , Mr Zuroff will travel across the Andes to San Carlos de Bariloche in Argentina .
Nestled in Argentina 's snow - capped Andes , overlooking a vast lake , this scenic ski town has long been a favourite resort for wealthy tourists .
It was also known over the years as a haven for Nazis who fled Germany after World War II .
Former SS captain Erich Priebke , was discovered there in the early 1990s .
He had been living there for almost half a century .
For the hunter , Mr Zuroff , this will be his last trip to South America on the trail of the war criminals .
He acknowledges that the last push might fail completely .
But , for the moment , he is optimistic that he is closer to his prey than ever .

The three major mines that produce platinum are in South Africa , Siberia and the United States .
" If we go to more and more uses of platinum we 're going to need more than they can produce , " Professor Mavrogenes said .
" Existing reserves would meet less than 20 per cent of the world 's platinum demand if all cars went hydrogen . "
John Mavrogenes says a team of geochemists from the Australian National University has identified new methods to detect platinum deposits .
They are simulating the intense heat and pressure of the Earth 's magma to discover whether platinum can be extracted from other minerals .
" This work may help geologists find new reserves around the world in places that have n't been searched before , " he said .
Professor Mavrogenes says if the platinum price remains at its current high , Australia could mine lower - grade deposits .
...
An Australian researcher has warned that the drive to put cleaner , hydrogen - fuelled cars on the road will stall unless new reserves of platinum are found .
Platinum is one of the key components of catalytic converters , catalysing carbon monoxide from exhaust fumes .
It is also a critical component of fuel cells for hydrogen - powered cars .
However 80 per cent of the world 's reserves come from just three mines .
One Bullroarer at TOD ANZ a week or two ago featured an article from the ABC on the possibility of mining low grade Australian platinum reserves to supply rising demand for catalytic converters and hydrogen fuel cells - World ' needs Australia 's platinum to build cleaner cars ' .
The Hydrogen Economy
The dream of the hydrogen economy is one that has been around since the 1970's , and has been heavily hyped by sources ranging from Wired ( as a key component to their long boom vision ) , the European Hydrogen Association and Jeremy Rifkin to George W Bush ( who seemed primarily interested in supporting the gas and nuclear industries ) .
The term was originally coined by chemistry professor John Bockris ( also an alchemist , cold fusion researcher and winner of the Ig Nobel prize ) .
The basic vision is that hydrogen is used to fuel vehicles containing hydrogen fuel cells , rather than internal combustion engines , creating no pollution other than water .
Global hydrogen production is currently derived from natural gas ( 48 % ) , oil ( 30 % ) , coal ( 18 % ) and electrolysis of water ( 4 % ) .
Given that hydrogen is currently largely derived from fossil fuels , the first obstacle facing the " hydrogen economy " dream is shifting away from these sources to extracting hydrogen from water .
Hydrogen is also used for producing ammonia and cracking heavier grades of oil , which means that peak oil and gas pose a number of problems to the hydrogen dream - the primary sources of present day hydrogen become less plentiful , and demand for hydrogen increases as we resort to heavier grades of oil ( and coal to liquids ) to keep the habit going .
Criticisms of the hydrogen economy
Critics of the hydrogen economy are n't hard to find , with frequently raised objections including :
* The use of natural gas ( both from a global warming point of view and a depletion point of view )
* The inefficiency of electrolysis techniques in converting other forms of energy into hydrogen
* The difficulty of distributing and storing hydrogen
* The cost of setting up a hydrogen based infrastructure to replace the existing oil based infrastructure
* Safety concerns about storing hydrogen on board vehicles
* The cost and complexity of hydrogen fuel cells
* Availability of platinum for large scale use in fuel cells
Amory Lovins ' Rocky Mountain Institute ( pdf ) argues that many of these objections are either myths or can be overcome .
Fuel cell expert Ulf Bossel and energy commentator Joe Romm ( author of The Hype About Hydrogen ) are probably the most frequently cited critics , arguing that the inefficiency of the hydrogen conversion process is wasteful and compares unfavourably to alternatives - specifically the " electron economy " where electricity is the energy carrier of choice .
Bossel says
" In a sustainable energy future , electricity will become the prime energy carrier .
We now have to focus our research on electricity storage , electric cars and the modernization of the existing electricity infrastructure " .
The diagram above shows that both the efficiency of electrolysis and the efficiency of fuel cells are key factors in making hydrogen as a transport fuel less attractive than the electric transport option .
Peak Platinum
Even if we assumed that hydrogen fuel cells could be made significantly more efficient , and thus more competitive with the electric vehicle option than they are currently , we still have the issue of the scarcity ( and thus the cost ) of platinum to deal with , as platinum is the material traditionally used as the catalyst in cells .
In 2005 , South Africa was the top producer of platinum , accounting for around 80 % of world production , followed by Russia and Canada .
Significant deposits are also found in Zimbabwe , the United States and , as noted in the introduction , Australia .
South Africa has been expanding production rapidly to take advantage of soaring prices - causing some controversy in affected townships .
When discussing rare metals , the subject of peak minerals is usually quick to arise .
The idea has been covered at a number of venues in recent years - including The Oil Drum , New Scientist ( with some good graphics here and here ) and WorldChanging .
The New Scientist article estimated that there are 360 years of platinum reserves available if we continue to extract it at the current rate of production - however this drops to 15 years if predicted growth in demand is taken into account .
One analyst at Resource Investor has predicted that we may have already reached " peak platinum " production , though this seems to be predicated on the belief that production of hybrid and electric vehicles will remove the demand for both fuel cells and catalytic converters in future years , rather than a firm belief in supply constraints .
Another analyst at the UK Department For Transport , looked at the platinum supply situation for fuel cell vehicles and concluded :
The above projections , coupled with the statements from Cawthorn ( 1999 ) about accessible platinum reserves in South Africa , suggest that platinum availability should not be a constraint to the introduction of hydrogen fuel cell cars .
If South Africa alone can deliver up to 5 % per year additional platinum supply between 2000 and 2050 , this equates to an additional 13.6 million oz in 2030 , 24.8 million oz in 2040 and 42.9 million oz in 2050 , which is sufficient to meet demand under any of the scenarios considered .
However there are many important assumptions and uncertainties built into this model .
For example , this additional South African platinum supply would be insufficient to meet worldwide platinum demand by 2040 under Scenario 2 ( realistic penetration ) if any one of the following alternative assumptions is made : * South African supply can only be increased by 4 % per annum instead of 5 % .
* Jewellery demand grows at more than 2 % per annum - it is currently assumed to remain constant but grew by an average of 6 % per annum between 1994 and 2001 .
* Fuel cell stacks require more than 0.3 oz of platinum per car in 2040 - it is currently assumed that only 0.2 oz will be required but this is a factor of 10 less than current stack technology .
* The demand for cars grows by more than 55 % per decade - it is currently assumed to increase by 45 % per decade based on USDOE projections .
The platinum loading for fuel cell stacks is an important factor in determining the commercial viability of fuel cell cars as well as determining potential platinum demand constraints .
The price of platinum is not likely to be a constraint to the introduction of fuel cell vehicles if the expected reductions in platinum loadings are achieved .
At current platinum prices and the target platinum loading of 0.2 oz per car , the platinum required for a single car would cost about $ 90 or $ 1.5 / kW , compared to a cost target of $ 50 / kW for the whole fuel cell engine .
In the wake of the New Scientist article , the Wall Street Journal noted that if the most dire predictions are true , recycling of rare metals will be the only way to manufacture some types of machinery .
Hazel Prichard , a geologist at the University of Cardiff in the UK , is developing ways to extract platinum from the dust and grime of city streets - apparently , urban grit contains 1.5 parts per million of platinum .
Its worth noting the contrarian view of metals depletion , expressed by Herman Kahn in his book " The Next 200 Years " , which points out that reserves data for minerals is often very dubious when there is sufficient known supply available to meet hundreds of years of demand - and that recycling can change the picture dramatically in any case .
Either way , the platinum supply concern may not be an insoluble problem , as recent reports from Japan claim Nisshinbo Industries and the Tokyo Institute of Technology have developed a platinum - free , carbon - based catalyst for fuel cells which they hope to commercialise in 2009 ( first for home use , later for use in vehicles ) .
Their catalyst is made from nanospheres of carbon .
While 10 times as much carbon is required compared to the platinum equivalent , the cost is one 10th of using platinum .
Diahatsu also claims to have a platinum free catalyst , using cobalt or nickel .
Another platinum free alternative being pursued is being researched at Monash University , where chemist Bjorn Winther - Jensen is looking at layering an active conducting polymer onto Gore - tex to make a cheap catalyst .
Alternative Methods For Producing Hydrogen
The discussion following the Australian platinum supply article at TOD ANZ noted the recent , highly publicised , research into a new catalyst for electrolysis at room temperature using cobalt and phosphate which MIT modestly described as a
" ' Major discovery ' from MIT primed to unleash solar revolution " .
The process also requires platinum , which seems to limit the potential for cheap and universal application of the technique .
The news was covered extensively pretty much everywhere - see Technology Review , Green Car Congress , The Guardian , The Press Association , Wired , Renewable Energy World , EE Times and Scientific American , with much of the coverage being heavy on hype and short on facts and accuracy .
Joules Burn at The Oil Drum was less impressed , cynically commenting on the story in Local Scientist Splits Water , Saves World , Gets On TV .
Bruce Sterling did n't see what the big deal was either , and nor did Joe Romm , who was positively scathing about the news .
There are other schemes for generating hydrogen that do n't require electrolysis , at various stages of maturity .
A group at the University of Birmingham in England is looking at using microbes to produce " biohydrogen " from waste , and claim their technology has an added bonus - leftover enzymes can be used to scavenge precious metals from spent automotive catalysts that can then be used to make fuel cells .
Another biotechnology based approach to hydrogen generation is being pursued at the University of Queensland and Berkeley University , in this case using algae .
So Is Hydrogen Worth Pursuing At All ?
Whether or not the MIT discovery , or any of the other alternatives , really does lead to cheap , abundant hydrogen seems open for debate for the time being .
If we assume for a moment that it is possible to generate hydrogen on a large scale in a reasonably cost effective manner , the issues around distribution , storage and fuel cells still remain - particularly when comparing a hydrogen fueled transport system to one using electric cars .
The car industry , apart from BMW and Honda , seems to have pretty much given up on using hydrogen for vehicles , but enthusiasm remains for using fuel cells in some niche applications where problems are minimised , such as buses , which are refueled at a central location and have fewer concerns about weight and storage size .
Another niche where distributed hydrogen generation may be applicable is cogeneration ( CHP ) at home , something Jamais Cascio noted in his comment on the MIT announcement .
Japan would seem a likely candidate for proving this on a large scale given that they seem to be the most enthusiastic about using hydrogen at home .
The other likely candidate for using hydrogen is energy storage in renewable energy generation - though perhaps not for home scale PV the way Nocera has been suggesting .
An Australian company called WHL ( previously Wind Hydrogen ) has been looking at building wind farms which store excess energy in the form of hydrogen and use it to generate power later , when the wind is n't blowing .
The Lolland Hydrogen Community in Denmark has been experimenting with a similar concept , as has a ship called the Hydrogen Challenger .
Melbourne based company Solar Systems is also looking to combine hydrogen energy storage with a solar power plant , using excess heat to improve the efficiency of electrolysis .

McCain watchers see fresh presidential ambition
By Judy Keen , USA TODAY
Sen .
John McCain is playing an intriguing role in the 2004 campaign that has some Republicans wondering if he 's planning another run for the presidency .
Sen . John McCain , R - Ariz. , left , shakes hands with Vice President Dick Cheney on July 16 .
By Al Goldis , AP
The Arizona Republican has a close friendship with Sen. John Kerry , a fellow Vietnam veteran .
He has had a tense relationship with President Bush since their bitter rivalry for the Republican presidential nomination four years ago .
McCain has sometimes seemed torn between the two men .
In March , he defended Kerry after Bush supporters said the Massachusetts Democrat compromised troops ' safety by voting against $ 87 billion in funding for them .
Kerry considered asking McCain to be his running mate .
But just as speculation about a bipartisan ticket peaked , McCain campaigned with Bush in Washington state and Nevada .
He praised Bush 's " moral clarity and firm resolve " — a tribute that was quickly turned into a Bush TV ad .
Then , as Washington buzzed with rumors that Vice President Cheney might be dumped — and replaced with McCain or Secretary of State Colin Powell — McCain joined Cheney at campaign rallies .
At a July 15 appearance in Michigan , McCain dampened the speculation by calling Cheney " one of the most capable , experienced , intelligent and steady vice presidents this country has ever had . "
McCain will speak at the Republican convention .
He 'll travel with Bush and Cheney leading up to the Republican convention next month and through the fall .
He also will campaign on his own for Bush in key states .
As usual , McCain 's moves are prompting questions and conjecture about his motives .
What does he want ?
The answer is simple , he said in an interview : " I want ( Bush ) re-elected and I have stated interminably that I want him re-elected . "
McCain has disagreed with Bush on tax cuts , the size of the federal budget deficit , the need for a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage and the adequacy of the number of U.S. troops sent to Iraq , but he has steadfastly supported the war .
Some Republicans think the answer is more complex .
" John wants to prove where his loyalties lie for anyone who questioned that , " says Bill Dal Col , a Republican strategist who ran Steve Forbes ' 2000 presidential campaign .
Others think McCain , who is 67 and has fought skin cancer , may want to run for president again .
" He 's clearly looking downstream , " says Scott Reed , a Republican strategist who managed Bob Dole 's 1996 presidential campaign .
" Being a good Republican who 's very popular with independents and Democrats is an attractive package for a future run for national office .
McCain 's team is aggressively working to keep as many options on the table as possible . "
McCain issues a standard disclaimer .
" I 'm running for re-election to the Senate and I do n't have any ambitions beyond that , " he says .
But quoting his late friend Morris Udall , a former Arizona congressman and Democratic presidential candidate , he adds , " Presidential ambition is a disease which can only be cured by embalming fluid . "
If Bush wins in November , the race for the 2008 Republican nomination will be wide open .
Cheney has been clear that he 's not interested .
But if Kerry wins , McCain will have to decide whether he wants to challenge his friend .
The national popularity and excitement that McCain generated in 2000 could become the foundation for another presidential campaign and is the reason both candidates have competed for his support this year .
" He is popular with independents or ticket - splitters and also has great credibility on national security issues , " says Charlie Black , a Republican strategist who advises the Bush campaign .
Dal Col says some voters might be more inclined to support Bush when they see McCain at his side .
McCain 's heroism in Vietnam , where he was a prisoner of war for more than five years , helps neutralize Kerry 's status as a decorated veteran , he says .
" It also shows that no matter what took place in the past , McCain can put it behind him , " Dal Col says .
" It may make voters think , ' I can do that , too . ' "
McCain says Bush strategists must think he still appeals to voters .
" Otherwise , obviously , I would n't be asked " to campaign for Bush , he says .
He says his continuing popularity stems from " a certain independence and honesty that people find a bit refreshing in this day of programmed campaigns and messages . "
There 's some political intrigue and diplomacy behind McCain 's new public role in the Bush campaign .
It evolved after a meeting this spring between Karl Rove , Bush 's top political adviser , and John Weaver , an adviser to McCain who became a Democratic consultant after the 2000 campaign .
Weaver and Rove had a falling - out more than 20 years ago when both were Republican strategists in Texas , and their rivalry in 2000 further strained their relationship .
After the spring meeting , which amounted to a peace conference for the two old colleagues , Weaver told McCain that the Bush team wanted him to appear with the president .
Despite their differences , McCain says , he and Bush now have a friendly relationship .
" For me to look back in anger would be dong a disservice to the people I represent , " he says .
" And Americans do n't like a sore loser . "
Theresa Gerstner can recall how suspicion crept slowly into her mind .
It was peculiar to see boys climbing into Rev. Neil Doherty 's car for a trip to the movies .
Then she learned the St. Vincent Catholic Church pastor took boys to his mother 's house in West Palm Beach and even to his uncle 's cabin in New Hampshire .
It seemed downright wrong when Doherty mentioned having given a massage to a boy who he claimed was sore from playing baseball .
" I knew about the sexual misconduct for years , " says Gerstner .
" But I could n't prove it .
It was only my opinion , my observation . "
Shortly after Gerstner 's claims about Doherty were published in the Miami Herald , the archdiocese dismissed her .
Her claims seem to show the Archdiocese of Miami singled out and punished an employee who dared to expose a priest 's malfeasance .
" You do n't go against these people , " says Gerstner .
" They 're like the Mafia . "
Doherty 's attorney , David Bogenschutz , did not return calls seeking comment about Gerstner 's claims .
A spokeswoman for the archdiocese declined to comment , citing legal concerns for pending criminal cases .
Gerstner is likely to testify against Doherty in one of the most sordid Catholic sex abuse trials , which is expected to take place by year 's end .
Gerstner , who is 61 and lives in Clearwater , moved from New Jersey to Margate in 1972 with her husband and two sons .
That 's when she joined St. Vincent Catholic Church on NW 18th Street .
It was the closest parish to her family 's home .
At mass , Gerstner gave readings from the liturgy and served as a Eucharistic minister .
She volunteered to teach religion to high school students , chaperone their dances , be president of the church women 's club , and even clean the place .
At Easter and Christmas , Gerstner decorated the chapel .
She took a job as an assistant secretary in 1986 , when the parish was led by Rev. William Gunther , and by 2000 was the office manager , a role that included hiring church staff and balancing accounts .
When Doherty arrived in 1991 , he struck Gerstner as " arrogant , " she says .
He chased away longtime staffers and criticized those who stayed .
" No matter what you did , it was n't good enough for him , " Gerstner states .
Then one day , someone showed her a newspaper ad placed by the church at Doherty 's behest seeking a clerical worker .
She told Doherty she would fight to keep her job .
That threat kept her employed , she believes .
Then there was the abuse .
Gerstner says Doherty had the windows to his office covered by a film that made it impossible to see in from the outside .
It was there he counseled adolescent boys who were having trouble at school or home .
Investigators would later learn of more than a dozen boys who had been raped or otherwise abused by the pastor .
In nearly every victim 's version , Doherty encouraged use of alcohol and drugs .
Some boys reported waking to the sight of Doherty raping them .
Others reported soreness or bleeding from their rectums .
Soon , Gerstner learned Doherty was misusing the church finances , partly to give cash to the boys he counseled and allegedly abused .
Gerstner claims the priest snatched a $ 12,000 check made out to the church , deposited it in a bank account for his private use , and spent the money on taxes for his uncle 's cabin in New Hampshire .
She did n't take her concerns to the archdiocese because Doherty had well - placed friends , such as Chancellor Gerald LaCerra , whose job was to investigate claims of misconduct .
( LaCerra died in 2000 , before the matter became public . )
Besides , the parish men's club had complained to Archbishop Edward McCarthy and to his successor , John Favalora , about Doherty 's financial improprieties , but nothing was done .
So she said nothing and waited .
Gerstner would not know until later that Doherty had amassed about 30 years of abuse complaints .
Some were filed with the archdiocese by alleged victims .
Others were initiated by their parents .
( These were detailed April 17 in New Times in " Lambs to Slaughter . " )
Finally , in April 2002 , as the child sex scandal rocked Boston 's churches , the Archdiocese of Miami removed Doherty .
Gerstner remembers the day attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and Monsignor Tomás Marín arrived at the office .
Doherty left soon after on the pretext that he was attending the funeral of a priest in Maine .
In fact , Doherty had been placed on administrative leave .
In the months that followed , he phoned the office , mostly to rage about Gerstner 's refusal to place money in his Publix grocery account .
It was a perk reserved for the church pastor , and as far as Gerstner was concerned , he was no longer functioning in that capacity .
" He told me that he is still pastor of the church and as soon as he comes back , I will be fired , " she says .
But the same year , lawsuits against the archdiocese by alleged victims of Doherty began to pile up .
Doherty returned only to clean out his office .
As church attorneys began settling some of the cases in 2004 , he retired on a pension that paid $ 3,600 a month , says Gerstner , and his health benefits were paid in full for the rest of his life .
It was an unusually soft landing .
A Broward Sheriff 's detective named Eric Hendel arrived at the St. Vincent office in December 2005 .
He was investigating a victim who alleged Doherty had drugged and raped him at the priest 's home when the boy was 8 years old .
Hendel wanted to talk to Gerstner .
The next month , Gerstner gave a wide - ranging interview to Hendel .
In July 2006 , her statements were made public as part of Doherty 's indictment for felony sexual battery against a child .
On July 31 , about a week after Gerstner 's statements were quoted in South Florida newspapers , an archdiocese official arrived at the office .
He ordered Gerstner to give him her keys and leave the premises immediately .
She was being investigated for criminal mismanagement of church funds , he said .
Gerstner says it was retaliation : " To keep me silent , they fabricated this allegation of misappropriation of funds .
It 's not true . "
A new round of articles appeared containing the archdiocese allegation that Gerstner was a thief .
" Witness Under Investigation " was the headline in the Herald .
" Church whistleblower put on leave , " explained the Sun-Sentinel .
The Margate Police Department investigated the archdiocese report and delivered its findings to the State Attorney 's Office , which has not filed criminal charges .
Records are sealed from public view because , police explain , there 's an ongoing investigation .
In August 2007 , Gerstner received a letter stating her employment with the archdiocese would end the last day of that month .
It mentioned nothing about the allegation of misusing church funds .
She received no severance package and would face the coming months without health benefits — a dangerous proposition for a woman her age .
What 's more , her retirement plan lay in ruins .
" If I had stayed working there until I was 65 , as I had planned , I would have gotten a pension check of about $ 1,300 per month , " Gerstner says .
Instead , she gets nothing .
This month , the archdiocese sent a letter denying her request for pension funds .
She can't afford an attorney to challenge the archdiocese , and she can't afford to retire .
In March , Gerstner moved to Clearwater , where her husband had found work .
She puts in 12 hours a day at a doctor 's office .
" I will never be able to retire , " she says .
After a year 's hiatus , Gerstner has returned to the Catholic Church .
She looks forward to testifying in Doherty 's criminal trial .
And she relishes the chance to expose the leaders of the Miami Archdiocese for the sake of the boys she believes Doherty abused .
" I truly do not care what they have done to me — it 's over ; I have moved on , " she says .
" My main focus is to open the eyes of the people who truly do not know what has happened and what is still going on in the Archdiocese of Miami and to stop [ church members ] from giving money to support this immorality and corruption . "
Doherty , meanwhile , is under house arrest as he awaits trial .

Penguin calls
Last Friday , OpenMoko launched its highly anticipated FreeRunner smartphone , a Linux - based handset that 's completely open in both hardware and software , and is designed to encourage third - party modification and customization .
Although the FreeRunner 's software platform is still incomplete , the device has attracted considerable attention from mobile software developers and Linux enthusiasts .
The FreeRunner handset is obviously a powerful tool for prototyping mobile software , but it is n't clear yet whether it's also ready for adoption as a personal smartphone .
We wo n't have a conclusive answer until we get a handset to test , but we decided to take an early look at the OpenMoko software platform to get a glimpse of what it offers at launch .
In many ways , OpenMoko 's platform strategy mirrors the diversity of the Linux desktop software ecosystem .
There are a multitude of parallel options with many layers and varying degrees of overlap .
This provides end users with an enormous amount of flexibility , but it also creates a lot of complexity .
The choices are difficult to navigate , and the lack of a cohesive direction contributes to fragmentation and redundancy .
OpenMoko 's potential for success will be heavily predicated on the ability to turn choice and diversity into an asset rather than an impediment .
There are currently three separate software stacks that are available for OpenMoko handsets .
The original OpenMoko software environment was built on top of GNOME Mobile and Embedded technologies including the GTK + toolkit .
As the FreeRunner launch date approached and the development priorities began to shift towards a stronger emphasis on mainstream consumer adoption , OpenMoko reevaluated its approach and decided to build a new stack on top of Trolltech 's proven Qtopia mobile environment .
The third stack , which will implement the FreeSmartphone.org APIs , is part of a long - term framework initiative that OpenMoko hopes will eventually ameliorate the problems created by fragmentation and redundancy while still offering developers a full range of choices .
Because the FreeRunner is a completely open device , users will be able to choose which platform they want to use .
They will also be able to adopt any third - party software platforms that emerge in the future .
We have already seen an impressive variety of Linux desktop environments and graphical shells ported to Nokia 's Internet Tablet devices , so it is likely that we will see similar innovation on OpenMoko 's handsets .
Indeed , developers of the KDE desktop environment have already started working on experimental OpenMoko ports .
OpenMoko's GTK - based stack
The GTK - based OpenMoko stack , which is referred to as om2007.2 , offers a moderately conventional finger - oriented interface and a variety of standard productivity , Internet , and entertainment applications .
It is a reasonably intuitive environment and it adheres to a very high level of visual consistency .
There are a lot of similarities between om2007.2 and Nokia 's Maemo platform — both are based on GTK + and use OpenedHand 's lightweight Matchbox window manager .
OpenedHand also developed several other important pieces of the om2007.2 stack , including the personal information management suite , which is called Pimlico .
The om2007.2 web browser uses Apple 's open source WebKit rendering engine .
As many readers are already aware , I 'm a big fan of the GTK +
WebKit port and I 've been very impressed with its small footprint and excellent support for standards .
In addition to all of the standard applications one would expect to see on a smartphone , a terminal application that supports entering commands with an on - screen keyboard is also included .
Users have full root access to a BusyBox shell with all of the standard scripting tools like sed and awk .
The stack also comes with a multitude of games , a media player application , a calculator , a package manager for installing additional software , and other tools .
Booting om2007.2
The home screen
The dialer interface
OpenMoko's WebKit - based browser
The application launcher
The media player
The terminal utility
To build new applications for om2007.2 , developers will need to set up a cross-compilation toolchain on a Linux system .
The OpenMoko wiki offers detailed instructions for this process and also describes how to compile and package a program .
Developers who want to go further and modify the underlying platform can use the OpenEmbeded infrastructure , which provides an elaborate build engine for generating package sets .
The platform exposes phone capabilities through the gsmd daemon , which sits between the GSM modem and userspace applications .
Instructions can be sent to the daemon through standard UNIX sockets .
The libgsmd library is an abstraction layer that wraps the instruction protocol with a simple API .
There is also a gsmd command shell tool for testing and debugging that gives the user interactive control over the daemon .
A wide range of functionality is accessible through the daemon , including the ability to dial and answer calls , toggle the phone 's vibrator , detect signal strength , read and send SMS messages , and retrieve the phone 's battery status .
For rapid prototyping and avoiding the hassle of having to set up a compiler toolchain , developers can use Python to create OpenMoko applications .
Python is n't officially supported , but the interpreter is available from the main repositories and GTK + bindings are available from third - party repositories .

Turns Out He 's a Flip - flopper , Not a Maverick , And Was a Bad Fighter Pilot
What 's Left ?

Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
In its May 29 edition , the New York Times contributed another meme to the myth of John McCain .
The Times ' front - page profile led with this :
At a meeting in his Pentagon office in early 1981 , Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman told Capt .
John S. McCain III that he was about to attain his life ambition : becoming an admiral .
But Mr. McCain , the son and grandson of revered Navy admirals , was having second thoughts about following his family ’s vocation .
He had spent the previous four years as the Navy ’s liaison to the Senate , sampling life in the world ’s most exclusive club ...
He had found a sense of purpose in an apprenticeship to some of the Senate ’s fiercest cold warriors .
And in Senator John G. Tower , a hawkish Texas Republican , he had found a new mentor , beginning a relationship that many compared to the bond between a father and son .
With Mr. Tower ’s encouragement , Mr. McCain declined the prospect of his first admiral ’s star to make a run for Congress , saying that he could “ do more good there , ” Mr. Lehman recalled .
But Mr. Lehman knew duty was only part of the reason .
“ He just loved it up there , ” Mr. Lehman recalled .
“ Like very few military people , John heard the music up there , and he really wanted to do it . ”
Got that ?
McCain gave up the opportunity to become the first third - generation admiral in order to become a lowly congressman .
Sounds plausible but , writing in Huffington Post , Jeffrey Klein calls this story " highly improbable . "
Reasons for doubt include the fact that in his memoir , Worth Fighting For , McCain did not mention that he had nobly turned down a promotion to admiral , with all its dynastic implications , to pursue a career in public service .
In fact , McCain 's own assessment was he was very likely unqualified to be an admiral .
Klein also cites the fact that , over the years , none of McCain 's close friends has ever mentioned his turning down the promotion --- and the fact that a promotion for McCain at that juncture would have gone against the Navy 's strict pecking order , leapfrogging him to the top of the ranks past others who had waited their turns .
And , Klein says , John Lehman a ) had only been on duty as secretary of the Navy for two months at that point and b ) , as secretary , he was not in charge of who got promoted to admiral .
Finally , Klein notes that the Times article failed to point out that Lehman is now a McCain adviser .
Myths about John McCain die hard , and you can bet that this shiny new bullet - point is now a fact in his resume , even if it is not true .
And yet there has been considerable chipping away at the McCain mythologies lately , much of which has been coming from an unexpected source : the candidate himself .
In fact , John McCain has done more to expose the reality behind the fabulations that he is a straight - talking maverick than his political enemies ever could .
The prime instance of this is the fantasy that he is a straight talker .
In this month alone , McCain has contradicted himself in public statements no less than 10 times .
The list of McCain 's flipflops as of June 16 , which was compiled by by Jon Perr , writing at Crooks and Liars , ranges from the media 's treatment of Hillary Clinton to privatization of Social Security , to the estate tax , domestic spying , restoring the Everglades , opposing investigations into Hurricane Katrina and more .
And then there is the myth that McCain is a maverick --- you know , the sort of maverick who voted with his Dear Leader 95 percent of the time last year .
Underpinning the McCain mythos is his service in the military .
But in his Huffington Post article , Jeffrey Klein found that a close examination of McCain 's time in the service reveals faint echoes of George W. Bush 's approach .
Like Bush , McCain was admittedly more focused on partying than on duty , God and country , and , like Bush , he used highly placed connections to receive plum assignments that should have gone to more qualified men .
Klein writes :
Despite graduating in the bottom 1 percent of his Annapolis class , McCain was offered the most sought - after Navy assignment --- to become an aircraft carrier pilot .
According to military historian John Karaagac , " ' the Airdales , ' the air wing of the Navy , acted and still do , as if unrivaled atop the naval pyramid .
They acted as if they owned , not only the Navy , but the entire swath of blue water on the earth 's surface . "
The most accomplished midshipmen compete furiously for the few carrier pilot openings .
After four abysmal academic years at Annapolis distinguished only by his misdeeds and malfeasance , no one with a record resembling McCain 's would have been offered such a prized career path .
McCain had more than his share of flight mishaps --- five fighter jets he was piloting were totaled , each of which cost the military ( and the taxpayers ) multiple millions of dollars .
Klein notes that , according to John McCain , a favorable biography by Robert Timberg , McCain lost three jets due to what might be called " single - jet accidents " :
[ A] fter a European fling with the tobacco heiress , John McCain reported to flight school at Pensacola in August 1958 ... [ H ] is performance was below par , at best good enough to get by .
He liked flying , but did n't love it .
What he loved was the kick - the - tire , start - the - fire , scarf - in - the - wind life of a naval aviator ...
One Saturday morning , as McCain was practicing landings , his engine quit and his plane plunged into Corpus Christi [ Bay ] .
Knocked unconscious by the impact , he came to as the plane settled to the bottom ...
McCain was an adequate pilot , but he had no patience for studying dry aviation manuals ...
His professional growth , though reasonably steady , had its troubled moments .
Flying too low over the Iberian Peninsula [ near Gibraltor ] , he took out some power lines , which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral ... [ In 1965 ] he flew a trainer solo to Philadelphia for the Army - Navy game .
Flying by way of Norfolk , he had just begun his descent over unpopulated tidal terrain when the engine died .
' I 've got a flameout , ' he radioed .
He went through the standard relight procedures three times .
At one thousand feet he ejected , landing on the deserted beach moments before the plane slammed into a clump of trees . "
In addition to the three crashes for which McCain was responsible to some degree , he was also involved in an incident onboard the aircraft carrier , the USS Forrestal .
On July 29 , 1967 , off the coast of Vietnam , McCain was in the cockpit of his A - 4 Skyhawk waiting for takeoff on a bombing mission when a rocket on another plane accidentally fired and hit his jet .
He escaped but 134 sailors died in the explosions that resulted .
About 20 aircraft were destroyed and the ship almost sank .
The fifth and final Navy jet lost under McCain 's command was the one he was flying when he was shot down over Hanoi .
Which brings us to the most sensitive area of the McCain myth :
His status as a war hero .
In 1997 , on " 60 Minutes , " McCain famously described his contribution to the war effort this way :
“ I am a war criminal ... I bombed innocent women and children . ”
After his capture in Hanoi on Oct. 26 , 1967 , he was treated for his wounds and tortured :
In August of 1968 , a program of severe torture began on McCain .
McCain was subjected to repeated beatings and rope bindings , at the same time as he was suffering from dysentery .
After four days , McCain made an anti-American propaganda " confession . "
He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable , but as he would later write , " I had learned what we all learned over there : Every man has his breaking point .
I had reached mine . "
His injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head .
He subsequently received two to three beatings per week because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements .
Other American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated in order to extract " confessions " and propaganda statements , with many enduring even worse treatment than McCain .
Here 's HuffPost 's Jeffrey Klein on McCain 's POW years :
The genius of McCain 's mythmaking is his perceived humility amid perpetual defiance .
Having been a rebel without cause , and often a rebel without consequences , McCain apparently was not surprised when his Vietnamese captors went relatively easy on him compared to his fellow POWs .
The Vietnamese military secretly and frequently filmed the American POWs to learn their propensities .
Col. Pham Van Hoa of the Vietnamese People 's Army Film Department was in charge of the filming .
Asked recently for his dominant impression of McCain , the now - retired Van Hoa said that McCain " seemed superior to other prisoners . "
How so ?
" Superior in attitude towards them . "
Perhaps it was this feeling of superiority that McCain projected toward his fellow POWs that fueled the residual hatred many of them directed back at him in 1992 , when a Senate select committee on which McCain served held hearings into the treatment of war prisoners and the status of soldiers missing in action in Vietnam .
Led by Rep. " B1 Bob " Dornan , the Republican firebrand from Orange County , Calif. , and the select committee 's Republican vice chair , Sen . Bob Smith of New Hampshire , the ex-POWs made incendiary charges against McCain , accusing him of collaborating with the enemy when he was in the camps .
They also said the Vietnamese government suppressed evidence of McCain 's betrayal --- the transcripts of interviews he gave to the communist media while he was a POW --- in return for his support of the U.S. - Vietnam normalization treaty .
( For more on the accusations against McCain , there is a new story at Counterpunch , John McCain : War Hero or North Vietnam 's Go-To Collaborator ? , by Douglas Valentine .
You 'll also find a video , with transcript , here from 1992 , in which the ex-POWs presented their allegations . )
The charge that McCain was a collaborator is unlikely to show up in attacks ads from liberal groups in 2008 similar to the conservatives ' Swiftboat ads against John Kerry in 2004 .
And yet Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan has stated plainly that the RNC plans to smear Barack Obama 's tenuous association with William Ayers , the Vietnam - era radical who was accused of bombing government buildings in the 1970s .
McCain himself said he reached his breaking point as a POW , implying that he cracked under the brutal treatment and did things he was ashamed of .
Leaving the question of his alleged collaboration moot , his experience in the camps still prompts a question about his integrity :
Why would McCain , a victim of years of torture 40 years ago , vote to permit the torture of other people today ?
The answer is politics .
McCain voted to cover Bush 's waterboarding policy to appeal to the GOP 's terror - crazed base , whom he will need if he is to be elected in November .
It was a decision made against principle in order to gain power --- a choice that signals McCain 's willingness to compromise his integrity in the expediency of the moment .
Since McCain lost to Bush in the 2000 Republican primaries , his integrity --- the straight talk , his maverick positions , his principled stands --- have all slowly disappeared --- just like the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland , who " vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone , " leaving us to wonder if there had ever been anything real there at all .
McCain : Bringing Troops Home from Iraq “ Not Too Important ” …
Get a good look .
Within a day or so he wo n’t have said it .
( CNN ) --
Pre -dawn clashes in a remote northwestern county Sunday killed at least eight people , including a security guard , after assailants using handmade explosives attacked police and government facilities , China 's state - run Xinhua reported .
A bombing broke windows and scattered debris Sunday at Hualin Market in northwest China 's Kuqa County .
Chinese authorities cordoned off the area and ordered all businesses closed in Kuqa County , located in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region , which borders Tibet .
The county is home to about 400,000 people .
Xinhua reported that seven attackers were among those killed , four of them by suicide .
Last month , officials said they cracked five terrorist groups in the autonomous region that allegedly were plotting to sabotage the Summer Olympics in Beijing , about 1,740 miles ( 2,800 km ) from Kuqa County .
Sunday 's attacks began about 2:30 a.m. with an explosion at a public security bureau .
The blast killed a security guard and wounded two police officers and two civilians , Xinhua said .
Watch how the region has become volatile »
Police fatally shot one of the attackers and captured another one .
A third bomber killed himself , the news agency reported .
Hours later , police located five attackers hiding under a market counter and shot two of them dead .
The other three committed suicide , Xinhua said .
Authorities said 15 people -- using explosives made of pipes , gas canisters and liquid gas tanks -- took part in 12 bombings .
An attack in the same region Monday killed 16 police officers and injured 16 more when two men crashed a dump truck into a group of police officers before throwing at least five homemade bombs into their barracks .
The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region -- also called East Turkistan -- is home to a Sunni Muslim ethnic minority .
Uighurs in Xinjiang are supposed to enjoy regional autonomy , as guaranteed by China 's constitution , but some seek independence .
Millions of Han Chinese , the country 's dominant ethnic group , have migrated into Xinjiang over the past 60 years , prompting complaints that they dominate local politics , culture and commerce at the Uighurs ' expense .
The dissatisfaction has turned violent at times , including several sometimes - deadly bus bombings in 1992 in the provincial capital , Urumqi .
Officials blamed such incidents on Uighur groups seeking an independent Muslim state .
China insists that only a small minority of Uighurs support the separatists .
The regional public security department said it received intelligence suggesting that the " East Turkistan Islamic Movement " planned to make terrorist attacks between August 1 - 8 , Xinhua reported .

EDWARDS ' STATEMENT EDWARDS ' STATEMENT
August 8 , 2008 -- Chapel Hill , North Carolina
In 2006 , I made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs .
I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman , and I asked for her forgiveness .
Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family , I did not tell the public .
When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story , I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it .
But being 99 % honest is no longer enough .
I was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices , and I had hoped that it would never become public .
With my family , I took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today I take full responsibility publicly .
But that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 .
It ended then .
I am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that I am not the father of any baby , and I am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established .
I only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby .
I also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested , agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby .
It is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that I am sorry , as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that I am sorry .
In the course of several campaigns , I started to believe that I was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic .
If you want to beat me up feel free .
You can not beat me up more than I have already beaten up myself .
I have been stripped bare and will now work with everything I have to help my family and others who need my help .
I have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so , will have nothing more to say .
Edwards ' political future in doubt after admitting affair WASHINGTON 
The admission by Democrat John Edwards of an extramarital affair and his repeated denials about it during his presidential campaign cast doubts about his political future , analysts say .
" I think essentially his political career is over , " said Kerry Haynie , a political scientist at Duke University .
" I do n't see him coming back from this . "
POLITICS BLOG : More detail on Edwards ' statement Edwards , his party 's 2004 vice presidential nominee , acknowledged an affair with Rielle Hunter in an ABC interview to be broadcast tonight on " Nightline . "
The former North Carolina senator denied to ABC that he fathered her child and said his wife , Elizabeth , has known about the affair since 2006 .
In his statement , Edwards denied making any payments to Hunter or " or to the apparent father of the baby . "
Late Friday , Dallas - based attorney Fred Baron , former national finance chairman for Edwards , said in a statement he decided on his own to " help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own . "
Baron , who did not return messages left by The Associated Press , did n't mention anyone by name in his statement .
He said the assistance was offered and accepted without the knowledge of Edwards or anyone else .
Hunter , who is in her 40s , is a former campaign videographer who had been paid by Edwards ' political action committee .
In Oct. 2007 , the National Enquirer reported that Edwards and Hunter were having an affair .
In response to questions about the story , Edwards said , " It 's completely untrue , ridiculous . "
In a statement released Friday , Edwards acknowledged the affair and said he had " made a serious error in judgment . "
Edwards said the affair occurred — and ended — in 2006 .
Hunter has not issued a public statement .
Her attorney , Robert Gordon , did not return a call for comment .
CBS TV's Bob Schieffer reported Friday that he spoke with Elizabeth Edwards and that when he asked how she was doing she said " this is really , really tough . "
Friday evening , Elizabeth Edwards posted an update to her diary at DailyKos.com .
In it , she said her husband had made a " terrible mistake " and asked the public to " give me and my family the privacy we need at this time . "
MORE : Elizabeth Edwards reacts Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama , on arrival in Hawaii for a vacation , was asked this evening by reporters about Edwards ' admission .
Obama said it was a " personal matter " that Edwards would have to deal with , and in a short clip aired on CNN , he added that it would be a " top priority " for the Edwards family to " work through that process of healing . "
Obama aide Hari Sevugan declined to comment about whether Edwards would speak at the Democratic National Convention , which begins Aug. 25 in Denver .
Schieffer , on CBS , reported Friday evening that Edwards says he has no plans to attend the convention .
Ferrel Guillory , director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill , said the acknowledgment of the affair " does n't disqualify " Edwards from future office , noting that successful politicians have survived " marital issues . "
But " if he wants to have a future in politics , he 's going to have to work at it and recoup some good will , " Guillory said .
Former Edwards campaign manager David Bonior said he was angry and disappointed .
" Thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and he's let them down , " said Bonior , a former congressman from Michigan .
" They 've been betrayed by his action . "
At the start of the 2008 campaign , Edwards was considered a leading contender for the Democratic nomination .
He had focused on poverty and issues affecting the working class since President Bush won a second term in 2004 .
Edwards had opted to stay in the race even after he and his wife , 59 , announced that she had a recurrence of cancer .
Edwards , 55 , ended his second presidential bid in January .
He had come in second to Obama at the Iowa caucuses , where his populist message resonated .
But Edwards did n't catch on much with voters elsewhere and he had complained that it was hard to break through when two " celebrity " candidates — Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton — were attracting the most voter support and attention from reporters .
At the time , he did not rule out a future in politics .
Edwards , a trial lawyer who had won millions of dollars for clients suing corporations , had vowed he would continue to work on the behalf of the poor and middle class .
Edwards waited until May to endorse Obama , after saying for months that he had a " very high opinion " of his former rivals .
But Obama was the candidate who came closest to Edwards ' vision for change in government .
The endorsement came at a critical time for Obama , who had just been trounced 2 - 1 by Clinton in the West Virginia primary , largely because of the support she got from working - class voters .
" There is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America and not two , and that man is Barack Obama , " Edwards said , with Obama at his side , during a rally in Dearborn , Mich .
The Edwardses , who have been married for more than three decades , have three children — Cate , 26 , who is in law school ; Emma Claire , 10 ; and Jack , 8 .
Another son , Wade , died at age 16 in a 1996 car accident .

In a rare gesture of openness , Apple has revealed data about iPhone application sales and confirmed the existence of a " kill switch " to disable malicious applications .
CEO
Steve Jobs told the Wall Street Journal that the iPhone 's App Store has sold 60 million applications , or two million downloads a day , since its launch one month ago .
Altogether this netted about $ 30 million in revenue
( which means that for every one of the eight copies of I Am Rich , Apple probably shifted plenty of freebies , too . )
Apple took a relatively modest 30 percent of the pie , or just enough to cover credit card processing fees , Jobs said .
Whichever way you cut it , that 's a lot of apps , even if , as Gigaom 's Om Malik suggests , people are n't actually using most of those applications .
Even more interesting , though , is the strangely open and forthcoming answer Jobs gave when asked about the remote kill switch for iPhone applications .
He confirmed that it is indeed possible for
Apple to reach into your phone from afar and disable malicious applications .
" Hopefully we never have to pull that lever , but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull , " he told the WSJ .
An example of a malicious application would be one that stole users '
personal information , Jobs explained .
While it 's comforting to know that a harmful application can be immediately purged from all iPhones at the press of a button , it 's a little worrying , too .
Given the level of secrecy inside Apple , some have speculated the company could use " malicious " as a blanket term to disable any applications as it so pleases .
The application that immediately comes to mind is NetShare , which violates
AT&T's Terms of Service agreements by turning your iPhone into a wireless modem for laptop tethering .
Apple removed NetShare from the
App
Store shortly after it appeared in the App Store , and this ban is most likely permanent since Apple is reviewing user contracts with AT&T .
The question arises :
What about all the people who downloaded the app before its disappearance – users who will continue violating
AT&T's TOS ?
Then there is the question of how exactly Apple will determine which applications are " malicious . "
We have a picture in our heads of some kind of virtual Guantanamo Bay inside
One Infinite Loop , where bad applications are kept locked up indefinitely and tortured to find their secrets .
" Oh , you like phishing , do you ? " the ex-CIA interrogator will ask as he tips the imprisoned code back on a board and reaches for a bucket of water .
" Then why do n't you take a SWIM ? " he 'll shout , up - ending the bucket on the victim 's face .

If you ask any twenty - something what their favorite TV shows were as a kid , nearly 100 % of all respondents will include Saved by the Bell on their list .
When I think about the cast of that show , I learned so much from each of them during my childhood .
Kelly Kapowski was my first crush , and she set the expectations for my first girlfriend way too high .
Jessie Spano taught me at a very young age that chicks can be a lot to put with , and yet you will do it anyway just to have a girl at the end of the day / episode .
Zach Morris was pretty much my fucking idol .
Screech Powers showed me that sometimes nerds can actually bring something to the table .
A.C. Slater trained me in the art of sitting backwards in a chair to look cool .
Lisa
Turtle made me realize the importance of being really good friends with rich people .
And I know for a fact that every single one of you was dissapointed as shit when you started 9th grade and found out that high school in real life was NOTHING like life at Bayside High .
There are so many classic episodes of Saved by the Bell that it ’s tough to choose just one as my favorite .
However , to me one episode has always stood out in my mind : “ The Last Dance . ”
There were just so many life lessons to be extracted from this episode .
I ’m not going to retell the entire story in great detail , so I ’ll just summarize it for you .
Bayside
High is having a costume ball , and Zach and Kelly are obviously going together .
Kelly really needs some extra cash , so she decides to take a job at The Max .
Her boss is this guy , Jeff , who is some asshole douche bag college guy that starts hooking up with Kelly .
Now Kelly starts liking Jeff , and starts acting weird towards Zach .
After winning King and Queen of the costume ball , Zach and Kelly go outside and talk .
Kelly admits she is seeing Jeff , breaks up with Zach , and the two share one last dance as Slater and Jessie lip - synch “ How Am I Supposed To Live Without You . ”
The now broken - up couple embrace and say one last tearful goodbye to one another as the credits roll .
“ The Last Dance ” is full of genuine life lessons that have served me well in my trials and tribulations with the opposite sex :
There Is Always Some Asshole Douche Bag Like Jeff Waiting In The Wings : Even Zach Morris is capable of having his girl scooped up by “ some dude ” ( who happens to bear a striking resemblance to John Stamos ) .
Always be on the lookout for potential threats to your relationships , guys and girls .
If you are dating a Kelly Kapowski , you can be sure that there will be dudes lining up around the block for a crack at your girlfriend .
No one is saying be some possessive , controlling jerkface .
That kind of behavior just invites vultures like Jeff to swoop in and steal your Kelly .
Just recognize who your social rivals are and do n’t fall asleep at the wheel while speeding down the highway of love .
If Your Girlfriend Is Acting Weird , There Is Usually A Reason For It :
As a general rule , people are not very good liars , especially when having to lie to someone you have spent a lot of time with .
If your girlfriend starts acting distant ( balking at attending social events she normally relishes , making constant excuses to avoid seeing you , being a total bitch to you at the costume ball ) , then you have to confront the situation .
Pull her aside and really talk to her ; her eyes will always be a dead giveaway .
Kelly broke down as soon as Zach took her outside , looked her in the eyes , and asked her what the hell was going on .
The truth will inevitably follow , as painful as it may be .
The Fact That It Feels Like It ’s Going To Last Forever Does n’t Mean Shit :
When I watched this episode as a kid , I could n’t believe it .
Zach and Kelly … broken up ?
They were the perfect couple !
I honestly thought that they would be together forever ( or until the show was cancelled , whichever came first ) .
This is a tough lesson to learn , and it ’s one that we all had to struggle with after that first love got away from us .
Love always feels like forever .
The truth is , every relationship in your lifetime ( except for the last one ) is doomed to fail .
Plan accordingly .
Take The Breakup Like A Man :
You will notice that in this episode Zach remains a complete gentleman throughout this whole ordeal .
He never becomes a foaming , jealous maniac .
He does n’t scream at Kelly and call her a “ bitch ” ( or worse ) when she delivers the bad news to him .
It ’s okay to express your disappointment , but do n’t devolve into a man with no class .
The last thing you want to do is to make a spectacle of the whole thing .
Try to put the complete emotional breakdown on hold until after she leaves .
Even if the relationship is now over , at least if you conduct yourself with the utmost dignity , the cheater ’s shame will eat at them like a parasite .
Zach does an excellent job here of maintaining his cool , considering the circumstances .
“ The Last Dance ” is n’t an episode that stuck with me because of its humor ( just the usual lame Screech gags in this one ) .
It has remained my favorite because the emotions between the characters are so raw and real : love , lust , betrayal , shame , jealousy , sadness , confusion , heartbreak .
It ’s all there , and even as a kid I was moved by the intensity of the emotion woven within this usually light - hearted teen sitcom .
It taught me a lot about the harsh realities of love and gave me some great advice that remains valuable to me today in my mid-twenties .
Now here ’s the part where I ask the readers of Put Up Your Dukes for a little participation .
What is your favorite Saved by the Bell episode ?
What life lessons did this awesome TV show give you that have stuck with you into your adult life ?
Or am I just completely nuts for looking way too deep into a fucking Saved by the Bell episode ?

I usually enjoy Charlie Stross 's work when he 's getting his otaku geek on .
But man , what a chaotic clusterfuck this book is .
With Saturn 's Children , Stross has attempted to concoct some bizarre cross - genre hybrid of cloak - and - dagger spy novel , hentai anime , socio- historical commentary , and post - cyberpunk space opera .
And in the attempt , he slips and falls splat on his ass like Britney Spears after one too many Jägermeister shots .
This novel wants it all .
And , considering that swell books like The Atrocity Archives and Iron Sunrise have shown Stross is a guy who can pull this kind of thing off if he really sets his mind to it , I find myself scratching my pointy little head over how crazily he let the whole excessive affair get away from him .
Too many deadline - pushing late nights , chugging too many No- Doz and Jolt Colas , perhaps ?
Naturally , it all begins promisingly .
Ditching , at last , the Singularity as any sort of relevant theme , Stross imagines a post - human future in which humanity 's own insouciance , hubris , and ( in heroine Freya 47's words ) misplaced priorities led us to develop intelligent robots as slave labor , after which we promptly ( and mysteriously ) went extinct , leaving them with no one to serve .
In subsequent years these robots have evolved their own civilization and adopted all our own worst traits .
A class of " aristos " lords it over everyone , creating , developing , and enslaving their own " arbeiters " in turn .
Stross 's point here is to comment on the doomed nature of slave states .
Not that this is much of a controversial theme , but it could be put to good speculative use in imagining to what ends humanity might put intelligent robots should we ever invent them .
Thing is , Blade Runner did this a quarter - century ago , without nearly such a narrative hodgepodge .
Saturn 's Children has one of those madly overworked plots so many people think cloak - and - dagger fiction needs .
It 's complicated and twisted nearly to the point of parody .
If this were a video game — and it could well be — it'd be one of those that , four or five levels in , you realize you can't beat unless you have the goddamn walkthrough on your lap .
So many characters — many of whom are duplicates and siblings of one another — come into play , that a flow chart is almost necessary to keep track of who 's on what side , who 's switching sides , who 's an ally / enemy this chapter , and what they all want at the end of the day .
( Stross 's distracting habit of throwing in nudge - wink references — like name - checking John Scalzi and Heinlein — are a little too on - the - nose , though I did get a kick out of one really obscure Gary Numan reference . )
The short version is this : Freya 47 , a sex robot with no human upon whom to imprint her programmed affections , finds herself on the run after she pisses off a powerful aristo named the Domina .
Accepting a job as courier for some shady enterprise called the Jeeves Corporation , she ends up zipping throughout the inner and outer system , eventually all the way out to the remote and frozen dwarf planets past the Kuiper Belt , all in aid of a frightening scheme to recreate an actual living human by even more mysterious , clandestine cartels .
Certainly , for a while , the confusion lends the story a degree of suspense .
Who really are the Jeeves Corporation , and do they want the biological sample they 've entrusted to Freya preserved or destroyed ?
What is up with Juliette , one of Freya 's older " siblings " — both of them were built from the original template of their " mother , " Rhea — and why has she gone missing ?
Or has she ?
One problem the story runs into is that so many of its characters are the same character , just in different incarnations depending on which " soul chip " they 've got plugged in to their minds .
It eventually becomes a real chore simply to tell who 's who .
Jeeves has siblings on many of the worlds Freya visits — Mars , Callisto — but one of them is a traitor ... or is the original the one with something to hide ?
Look , I do n't mind complex , multilayered plots with secrets lurking beneath the surface — love 'em , in fact .
But this simply redefines " overkill . "
Towards the end it gets to be a lot like taking a hit of LSD , spinning around in a circle for a full minute , then trying to walk a straight line through speeding traffic .
So Juliette is really this character and the Domina is really this other person , and ... ah , screw it .
And while we 're at it , if the fear that the robot aristos have , concerning the arrival on the scene of a living human ( a " pink goo replicator , " one of the moments of true Strossian wit that shines through the plot 's strobe - light lunacy ) , is that it will drive them all into their default " helpless slave " programming , why does the group Freya finds herself involved with seem to think they can possibly control one , and use it to dominate other aristo factions ?
The notion of free will , and how , like , not having any really sucks , is touched upon , but only superficially .
( The book opens with Asimov 's Three Laws helpfully , but rather pointlessly , reprinted . )
The whole question of whether anything we can sensibly call " free will " even exists at all is one that has kept philosophers employed for a few millennia now , and Saturn 's Children adds little meaningful to the debate .
Mostly there 's lots of dashing about space willy - nilly , some pretty steamy robot sex ( someone 's been enjoying his collection of Heavy Metal magazines from the 70's ) , and more dashing about , with Freya menaced by this , that , or the other baddie , about whose real identity and motives we 're never completely sure .
Yee !
I 'll tell you what I did like , and that was Stross 's physical realization of his robotic future .
If nothing else , this is a tremendously imagined milieu , with imagery often deeply haunting , such as in the necropolis built out on a remote and lonely stretch of Martian desert , commemorating the final failed human missions to that world .
Or the city on tracks that rumbles slowly across the equator of Mercury .
Or the experimental habitats on Eris , a bleak and frozen worldlet in the dark vastness beyond the Kuiper Belt .
I drank these environments in lustily .
It 's a lucid , textured , breathing artificial future that often utterly hypnotized me , and the sort of thing I wish more authors had the imagination to bring to their own space operas .
If only Stross had given his future a story far less a shambles than this , he'd have had a next - gen SF classic on his hands here .

Why not paint a fire hydrant ?
Artists in Cleveland , Ohio painted fire hydrants as part of a project called ‘ Sparx in the City ’ .
The fire hydrant was developed over a period of many years by many people as far back as the 1600s .
The first fire hydrants resembled faucets and were used for public water supply from the earliest water systems .
This fire hydrant art was part of a project done in Cleveland , Ohio a few years ago as part of a series of art events done around town .
I thought it was interesting to include this because art can take on many forms , even with objects that are everyday items that we see all the time and do n’t even think twice about .
I also found this artwork amusing because it made me wonder if dogs would get confused seeing this type of fire hydrant and then wonder where to lift up their leg !
I wonder if I can paint a self - portrait of my gorgeous mug on one of these fire hydrants .
Of course , I ’d probably get fined for scaring the public , if there is such a thing .
My favorite fire hydrant art is the one that looks like a Dalmatian .
Which one do you like the best ?
Have you seen any of these where you live ?

A gene variant has been identified that appears to be associated with female - to - male transsexuality – the feeling some women have that they belong to the opposite sex .
While such complex behaviour is likely the result of multiple genes , environmental and cultural factors , the researchers say the discovery suggests that transsexuality does have a genetic component .
The variation is in the gene for an enzyme called cytochrome P17 , which is involved in the metabolism of sex hormones .
Its presence leads to higher than average tissue concentrations of male and female sex hormones , which may in turn influence early brain development .
Clemens Tempfer and his colleagues at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria discovered the variant after analysing DNA samples from 49 female - to - male ( FtM ) and 102 male - to - female ( MtF ) transsexuals , as well as 1669 non-transsexual controls .
Advertisement
The variant was more common in men than women , although it does n’t seem to be implicated in MtF transsexuality as the proportion of MtF transsexuals with it was similar to that in non-transsexual men .
In women , however , there were some differences : 44 % of FtM transsexuals carried it , compared with 31 % of non-transsexual women .
Testosterone boost
While there are many women with the variant who are not transsexual and many FtM transsexuals who lack it , the finding raises the possibility that the variant makes women more likely to feel that their bodies are of the wrong sex , and that this is a result of their brains having been exposed to higher than average levels of sex hormones during development .
“ It may increase the likelihood that people will become transsexual , ” says Tempfer .
But he stresses that their cultural environment is also important .
“ The present study found that a mutant gene that ultimately results in higher testosterone levels is overrepresented in female - to male transsexualism , says Mikael Landén of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden .
“ This is in line with what we previously know about masculinisation of the brain and is therefore less likely to be a chance finding ” , he says .
“ Hence , the study is important and adds to the notion that gender identity is influenced by sex hormones early in life , and that certain gene combinations make individuals more vulnerable to aberrant effects . ”
Motive fears
However , Janett Scott , former president of the Beaumont Society , a UK support group for transgender people , is concerned that positing a biological basis for transsexuality may encourage people to try and cure it .
“ Nature may have made us the way that we are , but nurture is what gives us a problem , ” she says .
Tempfer strongly denies any such motive for his research : “ That is completely out of the question , ” he says .
Nonetheless , he says , if other gene variants with a stronger association to transsexuality are identified , establishing a diagnosis might become easier .
This might allow gender reassignment surgery or hormone therapy to start earlier in life .

Amazon.com ’s U.S. retail site became unavailable around 10:25 AM PST , and now appears to be back up .
Amazon ’s not naming names — all that director of strategic communications Craig Berman would say was that : “ Amazon ’s systems are very complex and on rare occasions , despite our best efforts , they may experience problems . ”
Berman did confirm , however , that neither Amazon Web Services nor international sites were affected .
So what happened ?
Let ’s look at the facts .
Traffic to http://www.amazon.com was getting there .
So DNS was configured properly to send traffic to Amazon ’s data centers .
Global server load balancing ( GSLB ) is the first line of defense when a data center goes off the air .
Either GSLB did n’t detect that the main data center was down , or there was no spare to which it could send visitors .
When traffic hit the data center , the load balancer was n’t redirecting it .
This is the second line of defense , designed to catch visitors who were n’t sent elsewhere by GSLB .
If some of the servers died , the load balancer should have taken them out of rotation .
Either it did n’t detect the error , or all the servers were out .
This is the third line of defense .
Most companies have an “ apology page ” that the load balancer serves when all servers are down .
This is the fourth line of defense , and it did n’t work either .
The HTTP 1.1 message users saw shows something that “ speaks ” HTTP was on the other end .
So this probably was n’t a router or firewall .
This sort of thing is usually caused by a misconfigured HTTP service on the load balancer .
But that would happen late at night , be detected , and rolled back .
It could also happen from a content delivery network ( CDN ) not retrieving the home page properly .
So my money ’s on an AFE or CDN problem .
But as Berman notes , Amazon ’s store is a complex application and much of their infrastructure does n’t follow “ normal ” data center design .
So only time ( and hopefully Amazon ) will tell .
Site operators can learn from this :
Look into GSLB , and make sure you have geographically distributed data centers ( possibly through AWS Availability Zones . )
It ’s another sign we ca n’t take operations for granted , even in the cloud .

Music Biz * Still * Trying to Kill Web Radio
If you 're a fan of new music and easily offended by corporate thuggishness , you may not want to read my colleague Peter Whoriskey 's story from Saturday 's paper about the possible demise of the Pandora Web - radio service .
This is only the latest chapter in a sad saga that 's been dragging on for most of this decade : how a largely unaccountable regulatory body and a trade group dominated by representatives of major record labels have tried to inflict a punitive system of royalty payments on Web- radio broadcasters .
The unfairness and irrationality of this idea seemed obvious when I first devoted a column to it , back in 2002 .
More than six years later , nothing seems to have changed .
In case you 've tuned out of this story , here 's a quick recap :
1 . The royalty payments at stake are supposed to compensate performers ( and their record labels ) for the use of their music , much as songwriters have long received a small royalty payment for the use of their work .
2 . But unlike royalties paid to songwriters , these " performance royalties " do n't apply to FM or AM -- whether analog or digital HD Radio broadcasts -- but do cover satellite , cable and Internet broadcasts .
3. Cable and satellite broadcasts pay a simple percentage of their revenues .
4 . The proposals cooked up by the Copyright Royalty Board -- a panel of judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress to settle certain intellectual - property disputes -- and backed by SoundExchange , the theoretically nonpartisan group charged with collecting these royalties , would impose a per-song , per-listener fee that many Webcasters say would put them out of business .
( See , for example , musician and Webcaster David Byrne 's analysis . )
5 . Maybe this is all one big coincidence , but in terms of political clout and lobbying efforts , FM and AM broadcasters vastly outweigh satellite - and cable - based music outlets , who in turn easily outrank Webcasters .
As I wrote a year ago , when the CRB reaffirmed this foolish idea , choking off Web radio by imposing discriminatory and disproportionate fees is just about the last thing the music industry needs .
Webcasters like Pandora are far more effective at exposing listeners to new music than the playlist - choked wasteland of commercial FM and AM -- so of course we should tax them to extinction , ensuring record labels and musicians a one - time profit , followed by years of much poorer exposure for new musicians .
Seriously , who comes up with this kind of strategy ?
It 's one thing for the CRB to lose its collective mind , it 's another for businesspeople who ought to know the market to start sawing their own feet off .
It 's not as if they 'd even make much money in the process :
The Web radio industry just is n't that rich .
The people at SoundExchange do not help their cause when they continue to spout melodramatic hyperbole like this line , from Whoriskey 's story :
" Our artists and copyright owners deserve to be fairly compensated for the blood and sweat that forms the core product of these businesses , " said Mike Huppe , general counsel for SoundExchange .
" Blood " ?
Give me a break .
You represent musicians , not the Marine Corps .
I 'm past tired of seeing this story refuse to die .
There 's only so many times you can see such obvious , blatant abuse of power before you want to find the people responsible , grab them by the lapels , and ask : " What 's wrong with you ?
Why do you hate America ? ! "
There is , however , one simple and fair way out of this : Congress and should finally pass the Internet Radio Equality Act , which would vacate the CRB ruling and apply the same per-revenue scheme to cable , satellite and Internet broadcasters alike .

Soaring energy prices will yield sharp increases for corn and soybean production next year , cutting into farmers ' profits and stretching already high food costs , according to a new University of Illinois study .
Costs to get crops in the ground will jump by about a third in 2009 , fueled by fertilizer prices expected to surge 82 percent for corn and 117 percent for soybeans , said Gary Schnitkey , an agricultural economist who conducts the annual survey of input costs .
Fertilizer – the biggest non-land expense for corn and soybean farmers – is tethered to the same cost spiral that has driven steep gasoline and heating price increases over the last few years , said Schnitkey , a professor of agriculture and consumer economics .
" Roughly 80 percent of the cost of producing nitrogen fertilizer is natural gas , so as natural gas costs have gone up so have the costs of those inputs , " he said .
" Phosphorus and potassium are mined , and as energy costs increase , mining costs increase . "
With commodity prices high , the increased production costs should merely trim farm profits rather than sinking balances into the red , said Schnitkey , who predicts farmers will likely post solid earnings again in 2009 .
" But it 's one of those things , " he said .
" When are the good times going to end ?
Could it be next year ?
And what happens if a drought or some other disaster cuts yields dramatically ? "
While farmers will likely absorb some of the added costs , Schnitkey says consumers also should expect to pay more for products ranging from cereals and syrups to grain - fed beef .
" There 's not going to be a reduction back to lower food costs as long as we have these higher production costs , " he said .
" Energy prices are driving a lot of what 's going on and ultimately that hits the consumer . "
Along with fertilizer , grain farmers also will see hefty cost increases next year for inputs ranging from seed to fuel for tractors and other machinery , according to the study .
The study projects non-land production costs for corn will total $ 529 an acre next year , up 36 percent from 2008 and nearly 85 percent higher than the average of $ 286 per acre from 2003 to 2007 .
At $ 321 an acre , soybean input costs are projected to rise 34 percent from 2008 and more than 78 percent from the 2003 - 2007 average of $ 180 an acre .
Schnitkey says the per-acre costs are based on high - producing farmland in Central Illinois , but corn and soybean farmers across the country will see similar increases .
Assuming cash - rent fees of $ 200 an acre , the study projects a break - even price of $ 3.82 a bushel for corn in Central Illinois , based on an average yield of 191 bushels an acre .
Soybeans would break even at $ 9.65 a bushel , based on yields of 54 bushels per acre .
Schnitkey says 2009 prices should be significantly above break - even prices .
Based on futures markets , corn should sell for about $ 6 a bushel next year , with soybeans in the $ 13 to $ 14 range .
" Looking further ahead , though , a lot of things could happen to bring that down , " he said .
" Demand could bring on more land in Argentina and Brazil , or the Ukraine might get its act together and increase production . "
Higher production costs will likely force farmers to try to hold down cash - rent payments , monitor commodity markets closely to sell at the best price and consider increasing crop- insurance levels , Schnitkey said .
" Input prices will have doubled in just a few years and that 's a major investment for farmers , " he said .
" If something bad happens that hurts yields , their downside risk is much higher now . "

Overclocking a computer — tweaking its internal clock speed to boost performance — has been a tradition of modders and hackers since the early days of PC clones in the 80s .
Overclocking Macs has n't had quite the same level of popularity , in part because Apple tended to make it difficult to do .
But some brave folks have taken to overclocking their Macs ; I moved around some tiny surface - mount resistors on my iMac to overclock it 33MHz , back when that was a significant improvement .
But these days , it 's possible to tweak CPU and bus speeds via software tools .
The folks at ZDNet . de have put together an overclocking tool for anyone to use , not just those with " hardcore knowledge . "
Now , before you salivate at the chance to get a " free " performance boost , remember you rarely get somethin ' for nothin ' .
Overclocking works because most chips used in computers are rated at a speed at which they are guaranteed to work ; many can work at higher speeds , though slight differences in manufacturing means there is no way to know 100 percent without trying it first .
ZDNet.de tested the tool with a few Mac Pros and found performance gains of up to 20 percent .
But pushing the pedal to the metal on your computer can result in instability .
In particular , tests show that no -name or cheaper memory upgrades tend to not work as well as pricier , name - brand memory when overclocked .
That is because cheaper memory uses chips that typically operate just fast enough to pass testing , without having much overhead .
Trying to push it beyond its rating will make it fail , and when your RAM fails , so will your computer .
Another major caveat is that due to the way Macs keep track of time , the clock on your computer will start to speed up .
Some Mac
Pros can overcome this by rebooting after overclocking via the software tool , but some cannot .
If your boss is easily fooled , however , you may be able to take advantage of the time speed - up by getting to leave work early .
If you have a 2.8GHz or higher Mac Pro or Xserve , though , even a relatively modest 10 percent performance boost might be worth the time to try the tool and check for stability .
Because the tool works via software , and not hardware , the changes can be reset after a reboot .
So , it 's relatively safe compared to changing jumpers or soldering resistors on your logic board .
Even if you 're not the type to throw caution to the wind , with this tool , you can now give overclocking a shot .
If you 're not keen on hauling the company Xserve to the Genius Bar after you tweak it beyond recommended limits , however , you may want to just stick with the factory settings .
At least 200,000 people have died in five years of conflict in Darfur
China 's special envoy on Darfur told the BBC that Beijing accounted for just 8 % of Sudan 's total arms imports .
Liu Guijin said the US , Russia and UK were the biggest arms exporters to developing countries including Sudan .
About 200,000 have died in the five years of conflict between rebels , the army and pro-Khartoum militias .
In an exclusive interview with the BBC's China analyst Shirong Chen , Mr Liu said Chinese weapons were not fuelling the conflict .
" Sudan is the third largest conventional arms producer in Africa next only to South Africa and Egypt .
" And there are seven countries selling arms to Sudan .
So even if China stopped its sale , it still wo n't solve the problem of arms in Sudan , " he said .
Territorial integrity
Mr Liu , who is currently in the UK , is expected to travel to Sudan as part of an apparent diplomatic push to counter international criticism over Darfur .
He told the BBC that he would advise Sudan to co-operate on the deployment of a UN - African Union force .
The UN peacekeeping mission to Darfur , Unamid , began deploying in January but the force still lacks most of the 26,000 personnel planned for the mission .
China has strong trade and military links with Sudan , which is accused of backing militias that have raped and murdered in Darfur .
Critics say Beijing should use these links to pressure Khartoum on this issue .
China says it is already doing all it can .
Mr Liu said that as a permanent member of the UN Security Council , China had been asked to help find a long - term solution to the Darfur issue , but that it had done so with respect for Sudan 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
It was during China 's tenure of presidency at the council that a controversial precondition was passed that Sudan must give its approval to the deployment of the Unamid force .
Is this Britain 's worst family ?
Head of clan with 250 convictions stole sister 's identity to net £ 85,000 in benefits
A mother whose notorious family were dubbed the worst in Britain for amassing close to 250 criminal convictions was facing jail yesterday over an £ 85,000 benefits swindle .
Dawn Shackleton , a 47 - year - old serial shoplifter , boasted of holidays in the Mediterranean , owned a 52 - inch plasma television and yet claimed she was short - changed by the state .
Even when she and her three children were evicted from their home after a 10 - year campaign of terror against neighbours she insisted that it was they who were the real victims .
Scrounger : Dawn Shackleton , pushing a pram , with son Mark and daughter - in - law Cheryl Hall outside court today
But behind the pitiful statements Shackleton , whose youngest son was convicted of burglary aged 11 , was paid thousands of pounds every year after stealing her sister 's identity .
For more than a decade she claimed for income support , jobseeker 's allowance , child benefit , housing benefit and council tax benefit - on top of the state handouts she was entitled to herself .
Unaware of the scam her sister , Julie Menzah , was thousands of miles away in Kenya , having moved there in 1989 after meeting her second husband while studying in Newcastle .
An analysis of computer systems revealed that between 1995 and November 2007 , Shackleton was claiming benefits in her sister 's name - adding the names of four children to get even more .
Investigators launched a probe after receiving a tip - off from a member of the public .
They contacted Shackleton 's sister who confirmed she had only returned to the UK once in 1994 .
Cheat : Shackleton used some of the cash to pay for a 52in TV
Mrs Menzah , a mother of five whose maiden name is Julie Karen Shackleton , said she had no idea her sister was claiming benefits using her name and had not used her passport since 1995 .
Further investigations revealed Dawn Shackleton 's fingerprints to be all over claim forms submitted in her sister 's name , while handwriting experts concluded that she was almost certainly the one who had been filling them in .
Officers from the Department for Work and Pensions monitored the post office she used to make the claims and watched as she withdrew money from Mrs Menzah 's account on three occasions .
Although investigators believe she pocketed more than £ 85,000 in bogus claims she agreed to plead guilty to eight offences of forgery and false representation crimes worth £ 40,000 .
Until last year Shackleton , who has the names of her three sons , Gary , Mark and Paul Alderson , tattooed on her arms , lived in Benwell , Newcastle - upon - Tyne .
But after the Shackletons racked up 40 arrests between them in less than six months Shackleton , her children and partner , Colin Alderson , became the first in the area to be evicted from a private property in July last year .
Whilst Shackleton herself has a lengthy list of 21 shoplifting convictions to her name , her partner and her children 's stepfather has criminal record stretching back 30 years and includes 21 offences , including attacking police officers , burglary and drunken disorder .
Her eldest son , Mark , is the most prolific of the three brothers with 92 convictions .
His criminal record dates back to 1994 , when at the age of 14 he was convicted of burglary , vehicle interference , theft of a car and driving without a licence or insurance .
The 28 - year - old also has a string of convictions for common assault and has spent time in jail .
His sibling , Paul , 26 , was convicted of dwelling house burglary in 1993 , when he was 12 .
In 2000 , he was found guilty of going equipped to steal , two counts of criminal damage , a public order offence , perverting the course of justice , breaching a conditional discharge and a string of driving offences .
Incredibly , Gary Shackleton is the only member of the family to have an Asbo .
The 21 - year - old got his first conviction at the age of 11 for burglary and has not looked back since .
His offences range from being found on enclosed premises to possession of cannabis .
He became notorious for tearing around in stolen cars and hurling drunken abuse at passers - by .
Accepting their mother 's guilty plea at Newcastle Crown Court , Judge Michael Cartlidge said : ' I am granting you bail but you cannot take this as an assurance you will not receive a custodial sentence . '
Shackleton will be sentenced later .

The charge is false on its face : " Did knowingly cause a disturbance / disorderly conduct to wit : acts in a violent or tumultuous manner toward another , placing such person(s ) in fear of safety by refusing to show proper I. D. when voting "
He did show proper ID .
This will be throw out .
What matters is , Will this situation be corrected in 89 days ?
Perhaps a legal action can hasten that necessary solution by seeking a judicial order .

The worst part of it is that the arresting officer knew damned well that HE was committing an illegal act .

was gotten , and a suit for false arrest brought .

As of the last canvas prior to this most recent election , Kansas City ( Jackson County ) has purged nearly 50,000 from the voter roll since Nov. 2004 .
They are working overtime to keep us from voting .
I hope this victim goes after the election judge at the precinct and the cops who arrested him for voting rights and civil rights violations .
If I were in his place I 'd start suing right now .
If Lindsey decides to go after him , I 'll be happy to throw some $ $ in the hat .
Only by going after the individuals will there be any influence on the behavior of the election workers and police officers .
They 're only tempted to abuse their authority when they think they can do it with impunity .

I got a card in the mail telling me that Photo ID was required .
I 've voted three time since and no one has asked me for my ID .
I called the county office and was told that yes this was correct , so I then emailed Carnahan 's office and received the reply that yes , I was required to show the photo id .
I never saw any law that was changed to allow it since it was struck down in 06 .
There have been signs at my polling place telling you to have your photo id .
I wish I would have taken pictures , but did n't think about it , because I was told by Carnahan 's office this is legal .

Almost the same thing happened to me .
I live in Missouri and left my home with my ID card which I received in the mail .
Normally I would have also brought along a copy of my utility bill but after leaving home I realized that I forgot the utility bill .
I figured okay I would just show the voter ID card which I received in the mail .
The election judge asked for a drivers license .
I told him that I had no drivers license ( a lie ) but instead gave him my voter ID card .
He said since it was not signed he could not accept it .
I offered to signed it and he said it had to be signed before I came in .
I offered to leave and sign it and then return .
The judges said it was too late .
Did I have any other signed ID .
After looking through my billfold I found an old and outdated ( but official ) travel agent ID card .
They said they would not accept that .
I did have my photo on it and since it was about five years old it was obviously my photo .
I then continued to search my billfold until I found a signed copy of my medicare card .
It did not have a photo but after some period of consultation the judges allowed me to cast my vote .
I choose paper !
I guess in retrospect I am lucky that I did not also end up in jail .
The voting booth was located in city hall .
The police department is also in city hall .

I took my notification card to my St. Louis Missouri precinct but the judges wanted other identification also .
I have in the past been asked for a photo ID .
In 2000 I was purged from the voter rolls and a provisional ballot was not offered .
I am not the typical target demographic for vote suppression either , I 'm caucasian and live / vote in a middle class suburb .
I do though identify myself as Democratic for the purpose of the primaries .
This happened to at least 2 other voters that I know in my precinct in 2000 and I do n't know more than a handful of voters in my pricienct .
I also visited ShowMeTheVote.org and the site is a complete mess and does not seem to work .
I 'd been there many months ago and it was in working condition so I have no way of knowing if these are recent problems with the site or not .

( another big long rant by phil - enjoy ! )
Violently showing election card ID ?
I never heard of that before .
Was it just made up on the fly ?
It 's amazing nobody got any paper cuts from that dangerous election card .
The next thing you know they 'll be arresting people for violent dice throwing at a craps game .
Or arresting people at park tables for slamming dominoes on the table .
I have to wonder if these actions magically get you on the " no - fly list " as well ?
The way things stand , it would seem that in November the steps to vote " ought " to be :
Steps
1 . Call the police
2 . Show the police the state law that is about to be broken .
3. Attempt to vote
4 . Be unconstitutionally refused
5 . Nullify the election
5 . Arrest the rogues or a common sense
5 . Cop tells pollworker they are wrong , and your allowed to vote .
But what will actually happen is 1 .
Call the Police ( They will either arrest you for false reporting , or deny sending someone out , not take you seriously , or deny jurisdiction )
2. Attempt to vote ( if your not in jail from step one )
3 . Allow the rogues to rig the count , and deny voters .
4 . The corporate media will report the numbers feel like , and your jailing wo n't be on the news at 5 pm .
5 . After everyone is sworn in and the new measures , and laws are passed , the lawsuits will be filed that take another 8 years before anyone even bothers to begin to do anything .
When they finally do something it will be another crappy hastily crafted piece of junk that will pass right though .
And for the POTUS race , if we always go to the ( Well Stacked ) Supreme court
Am this what they call whining ?
Must be .
Should be a way to rescind laws , and remove sworn in officials when facts change .
And to do it quickly .
But this would be common sense , we can't have that .
Too bad there was no place in all that for a video camera to document it .
Or a TV station with actual news journalists to broadcast it .
It seems to me this exposes the kink in the flaw that is plaguing all United States elections .
The flaw is that the SoS hires pollworkers , and enlists pollwatchers , and state troopers to escort the ballots , but if a law is being broken in the process , there 's nobody with authority to stop it .
Sure sometimes there might be someone there to document it , but documenting does n't alter the crimes !
And Corporate Media documenting whenever it amazingly manages to exist , always seems to be out of context , or biased , but usually just not reported .
There needs to be a cop that knows the laws and enforces them .
That 's why it 's called " law enforcement " I thought .
The focus of this election cop should not be so much with eyes on the voters as focused on those running the election itself .
The voter , or pollwatcher should be able to CALL this cop .
I think this election stuff does n't happen frequently enough that anyone can justify creating election cops .
I do n't really like the idea of having a modern day version of Zorro watching the ballot box , but it 's actually what might be needed to protect the votes .
While all these methods of caging , interfering , disrupting , and rigging elections and manipulating voters might be different , consistently a plethora of half - measures , reasons and lame excuses conveniently deny justice and there 's never cops on the scene at the time when they happen , with knowledge of the laws and the authority to swiftly act correctly , or even use common sense .
It 's like everyone involved plays a faux game where submission ( even if illegal ) begets respect , and where dissent begets getting framed , judged and punished for imaginary violent acts .
Rogue Officials always escalate things disproportionately , it never comes out good for the protester .
And again , you have to wonder how many different agency " watch lists " you 've been added to , for simply questioning authority and pointing out when things are not right .
Then there 's that communications problem that cropped up as well .
With all this technology we have we still can't reach someone in authority when needed .
If someone can't use a cellphone to call the Secretary of State , at an official office should n't someone use the phone in that OFFICE ?!
This should have been de-fused early on , yet again common sense consistently goes out the window when the end game is to deny citizens voting rights and have it actually counted correctly .
If it was me , I probably would n't have been offered a provisional ballot because I would still have been in jail without money for bail .
That 's a nice clean way to shut people up .
The way I see it , there is n't any part of this election system that can be trusted .
If that 's really the case then voters , and pollwatchers need some kind of law enforcement authority .
I am not suggesting they do it themselves , we already have cops , why not election cops ?
Or course there 's plenty of people that read this and say our elections can be trusted fully and authentically validated .
In my opinion , they 'd be wrong .
What a mess .

i am an election judge in Jackson County , Missouri .
much of what has been reported here at this blog seems to be from the denied voter 's perspective .
from what i understand , the voter took the voter notification card he received in the mail to the poll & tried to use that to identify himself as a registered voter .
up until recently these cards have stated in large print at the top of the card " voter i.d. card " .
if those from Mo. will take out the cards they recently received & look at them , they will see that now the top line reads " voter notification card " .
these cards are only meant to inform the voter that they are indeed registered to vote & where their precinct is located .
they are not valid forms of i.d .
there are 20 valid forms of i.d. available to post card voters & 23 valid forms of i.d. available for regular voters .
in the training sessions i attended , all election judges were specifically told not to use the verbage " driver 's liscense " when asking for i.d. & to have all valid forms of i.d. posted at the 1st station of the sign in table .
many people asked if a driver 's liscense was acceptable & the answer is yes .
however , it is not required as there were many other options one could choose in this process .
sadly , it seems to me that the election judges / supervisors did n't pay attention at the training classes .
it also seems to be a misunderstanding on the voter 's part for not reading his now voter " notification " card a little more closely .

The only identification a sane state requires at the polls is a signature that matches the one on the voter registration books .
How difficult is that to understand ?
It 's never been challenged in my ( former ) state .
But it does make it very difficult to block inconvenient voters from the polls .

They told the judges not to specifically say " driver 's license " because it 's illegal .
They think they can get away with it saying it the other way .

Well it seems that some people in Missouri have been VERY successful in muddying up the waters on the " proper ID " issue .
According to the Missouri SoS website one of the four options for proper ID is : " A copy of a current utility bill , bank statement , paycheck , government check or other government document that contains the name and address of the voter "
Now I do n't know what the election judges in MO are being told about these " voter notification cards " , but whether the card says " voter ID card " or " voter notification card " it still would seem to fall under the category of " government document that contains the name and address of the voter " .
Jacki are you telling me that the SoS will allow utility bills and bank statements as ID , but not a government - issued voter notification card ?
Come on that sounds like BS to me .
In addition the orginal story on Democratic Underground says the election worker asked for ID with a signature - no such requirement on the SoS website
The prospective voter also stated he had both utility bill and bank statement in addition to the voter id / notification card .
Now obviously we have n't heard the other side of the story ( and probably wo n't for a while since it sounds like there are grounds for a voting rights lawsuit ) .
So granted there may be more to the story .
If we just look at what HAS been reported though it is VERY obvious - election judge was WRONG and voter was RIGHT .

With regards to the claim that Mr. Lindsay was having a fit at the precinct , I would be hesitant to believe anything that a FOX News affiliate is reporting , especially when it 's only based on the testimony of an election board official who was n't even present during the incident .
In addition , if I was denied my legal right to vote by some moron who is supposed to know what the rules are , I would be furious as well .
I mean , come on !
If you are n't intelligent enough to pick up on the fact that a legal form of ID doens't need ot have either a signature nor a photo , then maybe you should n't be allowed to be an election judge , or the training is highly flawed .
People who take it with a smile when their Constitutional rights are stepped on embolden further assults on the rest of us .
If everyone who was denied the RIGHT TO VOTE started to scream at their polling places , I think we'd have a lot better chance of having fair elections .
At the very least , this might rouse the MSM from their exit polling and come on in to see what the disturbace was all about .
Hey , people might even realize that they had been turned down inappropriately in the past , and come back to cast their votes .
Change wo n't happen by passively sitting around and hoping that people will do the right thing .
The Democrats have been trying that for 8 years , and look where it 's gotten us .
Change is often times obtained through conflict .
If you are denied the right to vote , scream , shout and yell !!

no one has asked the important Q of as to why the voter " i.d. " cards were changed to voter " notification " cards ( not a valid form of i.d. ) - which , in my oppinion , has been the root cause of most of this particular snafu .

Again , recourse to the courts is indicated .
Cops get awfully sick when they are forced to justify illegal behavior in court .
If a well - publicized case is brought , other cops think a few times before repeating the illegal behavior - providing they know it 's illegal .
Also , the election official who invoked the illegal arrest should be made a party to the lawsuit , so that officials will be put on notice that their position does not make them immune from punishment for illegal activity .
This is supposed to be a " Nation of Law , not Men . "
But , if the victim of illegal activity does not seek recourse , the scofflaws are emboldened .

The officials at the poll should be removed from office and sued for malfeasance in office .

The reason he could n't vote and was arrested was because of the irresponsibility of the poll officials and they should pay the penalty and it should be stiff .

The posting makes two good points .
Add a signature line ( if signiture is required in your State ) and an instruction to sign it before bringing it to the polls and the problem is solved .
The danger is that the party in power ( Election Commissioner is generally an appointed / patronage position ) will just print up ' extras " and hand them out to winos to commit election fraud .
A variation of that used to happen in my city in my youth .
Nothing new there and not much of a problem either compared to the sophistication and efficiency of the methods used today .
Suppression and a malleable technology are more effective than fraud involving an army of co-conspirator's .
If you want good judges at the polls then sign up to do the job .
If you work that could pose a problem regarding taking off but if enough people can sign up it would be step in the right direction .
And , um , watching FOX for news is like closing the garage door before you turn off your cars ' engine ; needless and harmful pollution to an otherwise healthy system .
Srsly .

loddakatz # 42 my 1st response to your post would be that Missouri used to require proof of signature , but the laws keep changing on us .
as recently as our 2 previous elections the i.d. laws kept coming back as more redefined , but not concrete .
signiture is not required now .
this is possibly the 2nd mistake the election judge made .
firstly , to ask 4 photo i.d. as to when we required signatures on the voter i.d cards , you would n't believe how many people did n't sign the cards even though they were clearly directed to ( if they had read their cards ) .
many were told that these cards were no longer valid i.d. on their own , & probably threw them away .
however in our most recent primary these cards would have been acceptable on their own .
the 2nd response would be about how companies used donate employees hours so that their people could go & run the polls .
persons that worked on election day got kick backs from their company - like paid leave ...
i'd like to see more companies look into that & encourage their employees to sign up to help .
it could also be a great fundraiser to donate all or part of your earnings to a charity .

here 's a thought , maybe half a thought ... if the Republicans are so bent on having people produce official ID at the polls , can we not move to make driver 's licenses ( or state ID ) FREE ?
If ID is required in many daily circumstances simply to navigate , voting aside , should n't this be a service provided to everyone free of charge ?
Is n't the main argument against providing ID at the polls that it is biased against those who can't afford ID ?
Correct me if I 'm wrong .

Your wrong , Soul Rebel .
Sort of .
For example , in Indiana , where they have the most draconian of Photo ID restrictions ( now approved by the SCOTUS ) in order to keep folks from voting , they offer FREE ID to those who can't afford a drivers license , etc .
Only prob ?
To get those ID 's you have to a ) be able to afford to drive to the county seat to get one and b)
Have a birth certification ( about $ 20 ) or a passport ( about $ 100 , and you 'd need a birth cert to get one of those ! )
These are poll taxes plain and simple , meant to keep perfectly legal ( largely Democratic ) voters from being able to cast a vote .
Some 40 year ago , SCOTUS turned down a $ 1.50 poll tax .
Today , they allowed the Indiana law .
If MO could have adopted that same law prior to recessing this year , they would have .
So they 're doing all they can to keep folks from voting anyway .

The eastern jackson county board of elections informed me that they are switching to a system which one notification card is sent to a residence for multiple people with the same surname .
This card is not going to be a Voter ID card .
However the Help America Vote
Act states that a voter may use " other government document that shows the name and address of the voter " .
The notification is from the government and has the name and address of the voter so it should be accepted under federal law .
The Missouri Sec. of State 's website says the same .
The notification card , under Missouri law should also work .
What it comes down to is poll worker training .
This whole problem could have been avoided if the poll worker would have known his / her duties .
If poll worker training is streamlined statewide , the 116 different local election authorities in Missouri may get on the same page .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Drudge has the scare headline up today .
And pundits across the world are speculating about why Obama has n’t blown McCain away yet .
Yet I ’m still confident in Obama ’s campaign .
One of my first blog posts – and my first blog post to gain a sizeable readership – ran last October 12 when Obama was trailing Hillary by sizable margins and was entitled : “ Why I Am Confident About Obama . ”
My conclusion – despite the media ’s almost universal consensus that no one could take down the Clinton juggernaut at that late date ( with a 20 point lead nationwide and a slim lead for Clinton in Iowa ) – was :
Clintonian hubris , an Obama strategy to put the pressure on Clinton late , with Iowa in a statistical dead heat , and a ton of other primaries following hard - upon Iowa .
It seems to me that Obama has a good chance of winning even if he does n’t hit his stride .
The overall perception driving me to this conclusion was that Obama was the natural candidate for this time – that his candidacy and person fit the moment in a way no other candidate ’s did .
George F. Will , among a few other astute observers of American politics , saw this too .
Obama was the candidate that fit the times – and he had a smart and hard - nosed plan for getting the nomination from Hillary and the presidency from any Republican .
The intellectual ferment , the grassroots enthusiasm , and the international support for Obama all confirm that he is the candidate of the zeitgeist .
These fundamentals have not changed .
Which is why , now , with McCain ahead of Obama by five points nationally ( the first lead he has had against the presumptive Democratic nominee ) and with McCain outspending Obama in many key states , and with many media supporters of Obama beginning to panic and conservatives beginning to gloat , and McCain finally finding his voice given the prospect of a war with Russia – I am still confident about the Obama campaign .
I trust the Obama campaign ’s game plan .
They have run one of the best campaigns in recent memory – they are confident and they have a plan .
They beat the feared Clinton machine .
And they knew it after Super Tuesday – months before anyone else .
They strategized perfectly and executed their plans almost flawlessly .
No other campaign this election cycle can say that .
Obama will get more bounce from the Democratic National Convention next week than McCain will get from the Republican National Convention the week after .
Why ?
Because Obama does not have George W. Bush and Dick Cheney speaking at his convention .
Contrary to the “ conventional wisdom ” of the right - wing opinionsphere , Obama has more to gain from debates with McCain than McCain .
Obama ’s presence and answers will stand in stark contrast to the terrifying image of “ Barack Hussein Obama . ”
Just as Ronald Reagan did not take a clear lead over incumbent Jimmy Carter until just after their sole debate ( in the last week of the campaign ) – so Obama will capitalize on his debates .
Reagan was running as a change agent light on specifics , high on rhetoric and hope , against a reformer who defended a good deal of the status quo whose party had been blamed for significant foreign policy and economic disasters at a time when most people felt their country was going in the wrong direction .
Many people did n’t feel comfortable with Reagan until they saw him stand side - by - side with Carter and felt he seemed reasoanble .
The same dynamic seems to be working now .
Obama ’s supporters discovered in July and August that he ’s not a perfect candidate .
He supported the FISA compromise ; he explained again that he was in favor of individual gun rights ; he reiterated his longstanding support for faith - based programs ; he went back on his ( slightly hedged ) promise to participate in the federal financing program for the general election campaign .
They ’ve been getting antsy .
But with the serious prospect of a McCain presidency , most of those who care about liberal values will discover how much better Obama is than the alterative .
McCain does n’t do frontrunner well .
Polls are only as good as their turnout models .
Obama ’s supporters come from those demographics least likely to have a landline – and thus , many of his supporters are not taken into account in polls .
Plus , if black Americans and young Americans turn out at higher than predicted levels – given that both groups are extremely energized by the Obama campaign – this could tip the election further .
If McCain is understood to be the frontrunner , his gaffes suddenly take on a new importance – and the media will be much tougher in covering him .
Thus far , they ’ve treated him with kid gloves – and mainly ignored his negatives ( because they ’ve been ignoring him altogether . )
Where is the Iraq - Pakistan border again , Mr. McCain ?
Although McCain is outspending Obama now in some key states , Obama will have far more money down the stretch – and already has a more significant campaign organization in each state than Kerry or Gore did .
Right now , he is spending most of his money on creating boots on the ground and campaign infrastructure which he can call on in November to turn out the vote .
Once McCain ’s spending is restricted , Obama can saturate any market he wants with ads .
Obama ’s supporters are more enthusiastic .
McCain ’s are too old to be enthusiastic , and most do n’t like him all that much anyway .
Much of the public still sees McCain as a maverick rather than as someone who “ totally supports ” Bush on “ the transcendent issues ” like Iraq .
Most of the public does not know that McCain has flip - flopped on torture and on economic policy – and that four more years of McCain promise to be no better than four more years of Bush with regards to the economy .
Finally – and the biggest reason – neither Obama nor his surrogates have started to attack McCain yet .
They have local issue ads up in many states already .
But the Vice Presidential nominee ’s number one job will be to take the fight to McCain .
McCain is wide open to attacks on so many fronts –
I trust the Obama campaign has a plan and that they will execute it well .
That plan will include hitting McCain hard when he has less money to spare .
There ’s no guarantee , but Obama ’s chances are still very good – and he has been consistently doing better in the polls than Gore or Kerry at similar times in the race .
Obama has said that he is in this to win .
I hope so – and I know I will do all I can to ensure that he does .

Yves Leterme took office in March after nine months of political deadlock Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme has tendered his government 's resignation to the king after failing to carry out political reforms .
Mr Leterme had set a 15 July deadline to push through measures to devolve more power to the regions .
He took office in March - after nine months of political deadlock - as the head of a coalition of Dutch and French - speaking parties .
King Albert II has yet to decide whether to accept the resignation .
The government coalition includes Mr Leterme 's Flemish Christian Democrats from the north as well as Socialists from the French - speaking region of Wallonia in the south .
It appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible
Yves Leterme
Belgian Prime Minister
The prime minister was due to present a state reform deal in a speech to parliament on Tuesday .
Before last June 's general election , Mr Leterme had promised his supporters even more devolved powers for regional governments in a country that is already Europe 's most decentralised state .
In French - speaking Wallonia - where unemployment is higher and the economy sluggish - there are fears this would leave their region worse off .
" It appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " Mr Leterme said in a statement .
He added that " state reform remains essential " .
' Total chaos '
His French - speaking coalition partners said they hoped the government could be kept together .
DIVIDED BELGIUM
Three federal regions : Dutch - speaking Flanders in the north ; French - speaking Wallonia in the south ( which has a German - speaking minority ) ;
Brussels , the capital , officially bilingual Federal state has national responsibility for justice , defence , federal police , social security , nuclear energy , monetary policy Regional governments oversee education , employment , agriculture , transport , environment " I think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " said Deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders .
" Otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" The king now has to be given time to consult a number of people .
It 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
The newspapers reflected the atmosphere under headlines like " Total Chaos " .
" No one can predict what is going to happen now , " said the centre - left daily De Morgen .
Belgium 's Dutch and French - speaking communities seem to exist side - by - side , but with little interaction , says the BBC's Dominic Hughes in Brussels .
No single party bridges the linguistic and geographic gulf between Belgium 's two regions .
Traditionally , the prime minister comes from one of the majority Flemish parties .

Portuguese barn houses 180 cars , all covered with decades of dust
Huge collections like the one in Portugal do n’t just happen .
Cars are accumulated by someone with a purpose
By Tom Cotter
One day this January , I received at least ten forwarded email attachments to a web site that featured photos of an eclectic collection of old cars in a decaying building .
For the next week it seemed the web was literally blanketed with these images , each giving a similar story :
“ Imagine moving into an old farmhouse in the Portuguese countryside , and , while walking around “ the lower 40 ” of your new investment , you come across an old building .
Curious as to what may be inside , you pry open the rusted door and for the first time in decades , one of the largest hordes of old cars ever discovered is exposed to sunlight . ”
I did n’t believe that story for a moment .
Huge collections of cars do n’t just happen .
Cars are accumulated — sometimes lovingly , sometimes not — by someone with a purpose .
I was sure this collection was not assembled by accident ; nobody would simply sell an old farm and fail to mention to the new owners the stash of old cars in the barn .
I decided to investigate .
I searched the web and ultimately came to an English language dead end at the Mazda Miata Club Norway web site .
But I kept going , sending emails in English and hoping that some kind recipient would take a few moments to answer some questions .
All indications were that the cars were hidden somewhere in Portugal , so that ’s where I focused my investigation .
Through a Cobra buddy , Don Silawski of Washington , DC , I contracted with a Portuguese translator , Clara Dixon .
Clara would be my tour guide and try to unearth some of the naked truth regarding this huge stash .
Clara also checked the Internet for news stories that may have been written in Portuguese newspapers about the cars .
I was beginning to feel like a CIA sleuth …
I must admit that for me , a lifelong barn - finder , a collection this large would be the discovery of a lifetime .
My 15 - year - old son , Brian , even tried to convince me to hop a flight to Portugal to see if I could actually find the collection myself .
I was eventually able to contact the photographer who was contracted by the cars ’ owner to shoot the photographs that would ultimately appear on millions of car - guy computer monitors beginning on January 20 .
THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY
Manuel Menezes
Morais shot the photos , but he was sworn to secrecy about the cars ’ location and the owner ’s name .
However , he was able to obtain permission from the elusive owner to give me the following information :
The owner of the cars was a car dealer in the 1970s and 1980s , and decided to save the more interesting cars that came through his doors .
When the barn was full , he padlocked and “ soldered ” the doors shut .
( Perhaps welding was too permanent . )
Web sites varied on the number of cars : 58 , 100 , and 180 were speculated .
According to Morais , there are 180 cars in the barn .
And , aw shucks , none of the cars is for sale .
Clara was able to determine that the cars are located somewhere in the area of Sintra , near Lisbon .
I asked Morais if he could ask the owner if he had a favorite car .
“ He has lots of good cars in very good condition , ” he says , “ but he loves the Lancia Aurelia B24 .
He has two . ”
I would ask that a European - based SCM subscriber pick this story up and help fill in the blanks .
And let me know what you find ( tomgcotter@roadrunner.com ) .
I ’d like to include the true story in a future
In the Barn book , as well as in SCM .
So , what ’s in there ?
TOM COTTER is a contributing editor to Road & Track .
The sequel to Cotter ’s book Cobra in the Barn , to be called The Hemi in the Barn , will be published by Motorbooks this fall .
The takeover will create the world 's biggest brewer The US brewer Anheuser - Busch has agreed to be taken over by Belgium - based InBev , in a move that will create the world 's largest beer maker .
The $ 52bn ( £ 26 bn ) takeover bid by InBev , which makes Stella Artois beer , was accepted by Anheuser 's board .
The combined company will now be called Anheuser - Busch InBev .
Anheuser makes Budweiser - the most popular beer in the US - and some US politicians had expressed anger at the prospect of a foreign takeover .
' Unrivalled brands '
In a concession to political concerns about the deal , Budweiser 's headquarters will remain in St Louis , Missouri while none of Anheuser 's US breweries will be closed .
COMBINED BRAND MENU Stella , Budweiser , Beck's , Hoegaarden , Leffe , Brahma , Staropramen , Michelob , Rolling Rock
Brazilian background to mega -deal InBev is offering to pay $ 70 a share for Anheuser in a deal which must be approved by shareholders of both businesses .
The combined business will have annual sales of $ 36.4bn , equivalent to 46 billion litres of beer a year .
It will bring a host of popular brands including Beck's , Hoegaarden and Staropramen - in addition to Budweiser and Stella - under one roof .
In Bev , itself formed by a giant merger of Brazil 's AmBev and Belgium 's Interbrew several years ago , described the deal as " historic " .
" Together , Anheuser - Busch and InBev will be able to accomplish much more than each can on its own , " said InBev 's Brazilian boss Carlos Brito , who will become chief executive of the new firm .
" This combination will create a stronger , more competitive global company with an unrivalled worldwide brand portfolio and distribution network , with great potential for growth all over the world . "
Anheuser boss August Busch said the transaction would " enhance global market access for Budweiser , one of America 's truly iconic brands " .
Job concerns
There are widespread fears that the deal will lead to substantial job losses in the US Midwest at a time while the threat of recession is hanging over the economy .
The two firms have said the deal will generate annual savings of $ 1.5 bn but have suggested that job losses will be kept to a minimum because there is little current overlap between the two businesses .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Anheuser - which employs 6,000 staff - currently controls nearly half of the US market , while InBev is strong in Western European and Latin American markets .
Anheuser also owns stakes in Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo and Chinese brewer Tsingtao .
The deal should give Budweiser a platform to boost its growth in Europe where , apart from a number of markets like the UK , it has been relatively weak .
Analysts broadly welcomed the deal .
" The synergies are better than expected , $ 70 is a reasonable price and InBev has avoided a long , drawn - out battle in the courts , " said Wim Hoste , from KBC Securities .
The beer market has been rapidly consolidating in the face of cost pressures and declining sales in many mature markets .
Scottish & Newcastle , the UK 's largest brewer , was recently bought out by Heineken and Carlsberg .

What are these ?
Al - Shymaa Kway - Geer ( right ) is a former airline clerk Tanzania 's first albino MP has told the BBC of her surprise at being nominated by the president - and her determination to fight the discrimination that she and other people with albinism suffer .
Twenty people with albinism have been murdered in the past year in Tanzania , where there is a widespread belief that the condition is the result of a curse .
But a crackdown on the witch doctors who encourage the killing of people with albinism was recently announced - and as part of this , 48 - year - old Al - Shymaa Kway - Geer was appointed .
" It was something very great for me - I did n't expect it , " Ms Kway - Geer told BBC World Service 's Outlook programme .
" I think the president chose me because he believed in me - I 'm a very hard - working woman .
" The president chose me at this time , when albinos are being killed and abused . "
The BBC's Vicky Ntetema in Dar-es - Salaam said that people were " amazed " when the president made the surprise announcement of Ms Kway - Geer 's appointment .
' Zeru '
Instead of having dark skin and black hair , people with albinism are blond with pale skin , because their skin lacks pigment .
As well as the belief that albinism is a curse , witch doctors in the country use body parts from albinos in magic potions they claim will bring people good luck or fortune .
We must find out how many albinos there are all over Tanzania , so that they get education and health
Al - Shymaa Kway - Geer
Ms Kway - Geer was herself victimised when young .
" When I was at primary school , people used to laugh at me , tease me - some did n't even like to touch me , saying that if they touched me they would get this colour , " she said .
" People used to abuse me on the road when I took the buses to school .
They would run after me - crowds of kids following me - shouting ' zeru , zeru ' . "
" Zeru " is a Swahili word for albino .
Tanzania 's albino society says that traditionally , this is a word for ghost - like creatures and is derogatory .
Since the beginning of 2000 , the word has been banned .
Ms Kway - Geer says she hopes to educate people about albinism to end the discrimination , and called for a census of albino people .
" First we must find out how many albinos there are all over Tanzania , so that they get education and health , " she said .
Albinos are at particular risk from skin cancer and often suffer from poor eyesight .
" Many albinos are poor , and therefore they need help from the government , " said the new MP .
Arrests
Our correspondent says that in some parts of the country , people think albinos bring bad luck to the whole community .
While there have not yet been any prosecutions regarding the recent spate of murders , 172 were last month arrested in connection to the cases - 71 of whom said they had been told by witch doctors to bring them albino body parts .
They remain in custody .
" We are still waiting to find out how far these arrests will go , and how many people will be brought to book , " our correspondent says .
She adds that the police do n't want to talk about the case for fear of jeopardising their enquiries .

Want to work in a shop ?
You may be vetted
By Jon Kelly
BBC News
Workers accused of theft or damage could soon find themselves blacklisted on a register to be shared among employers .
It will be good for profits but campaigners say innocent people could find it impossible to get another job .
To critics it sounds like a scenario from some Orwellian nightmare .
An online database of workers accused of theft and dishonesty , regardless of whether they have been convicted of any crime , which bosses can access when vetting potential employees .
But this is no dystopian fantasy .
Later this month , the National Staff Dismissal Register ( NSDR ) is expected to go live .
Individuals would be treated as criminals , even though the police have never been contacted
Hannah Reed of the TUC Organisers say that major companies including Harrods , Selfridges and Reed Managed Services have already signed up to the scheme .
By the end of May they will be able to check whether candidates for jobs have faced allegations of stealing , forgery , fraud , damaging company property or causing a loss to their employers and suppliers .
Workers sacked for these offences will be included on the register , regardless of whether police had enough evidence to convict them .
Also on the list will be employees who resigned before they could face disciplinary proceedings at work .
The project has attracted little publicity .
But the BBC News website can reveal that trade unions and civil liberties campaigners are warning that it leaves workers vulnerable to the threat of false accusations .
TUC policy officer Hannah Reed says that while criminal activity in the workplace can never be condoned , she fears such a system is open to abuse .
WHAT WILL GET YOU ON IT
Theft or attempted theft of money , merchandise or property from company , suppliers or customers Falsification or forgery of documents Fraudulently obtaining money , services or information Damaging company property " The TUC is seriously concerned that this register can only lead to people being shut out from the job market by an employer who falsely accuses them of misconduct or sacks them because they bear them a grudge .
Individuals would be treated as criminals , even though the police have never been contacted .
" The Criminal Records Bureau was set up to assist employers to make safe appointments when recruiting staff to work with vulnerable groups .
The CRB already provides appropriate and properly regulated protection for employers .
Under the new register , an employee may not be aware they have been blacklisted or have any right to appeal . "
James
Welch , the legal director of human rights group Liberty , also says that he is concerned that the register does not offer sufficient redress to the falsely accused .
" This scheme appears to bypass existing laws which protect employees by limiting the circumstances when information about possible criminal activity can be shared with potential employers . "
Data protection
The register is an initiative of Action Against Business Crime ( AABC ) , which was established as a joint venture between the Home Office and the British Retail Consortium " to set up and maintain business crime reduction partnerships " .
The Home Office says it stopped funding the scheme last year , having granted it almost £ 1 m during its first three years .
A Home Office spokeswoman says the register is a " commercial scheme " and it was not consulted .
Selfridges has signed up Set up by Surrey - based firm Hicom Business Solutions , the database will allow employers to search for potential workers by name , address , date of birth , national insurance number and previous employer .
Records on individuals - accessible online via an encrypted password system - will be kept for a five - year period and can include photos .
Mike Schuck , chief executive of AABC , says that theft by members of staff costs the British economy billions of pounds each year and rejects the notion that the register is a blacklist .
He says that all participating companies will be obliged to abide by the Data Protection Act and that workers named on the database , maintained by AABC , will have the right to change their entries if they are inaccurate .
Should a dispute take place between an employee and an employer about whether an incident occurred , Mr Schuck adds , the worker will be able to appeal to the Information Commissioner 's Office .
" We are limiting access to the database to employers who can comply with the Information Commissioner 's employment practices code , " he says .
" We 're not going to allow Mr Smith 's hardware store .
We 're quite open about this .
People will be told when they apply for jobs that they may be checked as part of the application process .
" Theft in the workplace hurts staff as much as employers because it puts everyone under suspicion . "
Nonetheless , many workers may get a nasty surprise when old allegations return to haunt them when they next apply for a job .
Below is a selection of your comments .
This is appalling .
I know of a girl falsely accused of stealing by an employer because she refused his advances .
If this database goes live innocent folk like her could be blacklisted .
This should be stopped now .
Too many innocents could be caught up in it .
only those convicted of dishonesty or assault on co-workers should be included .
Innocent until proven guilty .
Carol Jay , Grangemouth , Scotland
At the age of 18 I was falsely accused of taking money from a till while working in a nightclub ( and searched in front of my colleagues , but that was another matter ) .
I left the job immediately after this incident feeling humiliated and disgusted .
The idea that someone could use a false accusation like this ( which , as anyone knows who works in retail or leisure knows is a common occurrence ) against me in securing future employment is disgusting .
Especially when a criminal record does n't stop someone being employed .
All it will do is leave more young people unemployed and feeling hopeless .
AllInGoodTime , Glasgow Surely this can't be allowed under the Data Protection Act .
Putting the issues of ex-employers with a grudge , the implications for fraud are horrendous .
How can employers disclose so many personal details about human beings without their permission .
ID fraud is possible with much less information than is supposedly being put on this website ; and presumably without the employees consent .
Stuart Hunter , Cambridge
You can ask they remove your details under the Data protection Act :
Right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress ( 1 ) Subject to subsection ( 2 ) , an individual is entitled at any time by notice in writing to a data controller to require the data controller at the end of such period as is reasonable in the circumstances to cease , or not to begin , processing , or processing for a specified purpose or in a specified manner , any personal data in respect of which he is the data subject , on the ground that , for specified reasons -
( a ) the processing of those data or their processing for that purpose or in that manner is causing or is likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress to him or to another , and ( b ) that damage or distress is or would be unwarranted .
(2) Subsection ( 1 ) does not apply -
( a ) in a case where any of the conditions in paragraphs 1 to 4 of Schedule 2 is met , or ( b ) in such other cases as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State by order .
(3) The data controller must within twenty - one days of receiving a notice under subsection ( 1 ) ( ¿the data subject notice¿ ) give the individual who gave it a written notice - ( a ) stating that he has complied or intends to comply with the data subject notice , or ( b ) stating his reasons for regarding the data subject notice as to any extent unjustified and the extent ( if any ) to which he has complied or intends to comply with it .
Anon , UK
In a recent well publicised case , a shop manager for a large company was sacked for giving away a bunch of flowers that were due to be thrown away .
She was accused of theft .
There would be nothing stopping a company from blacklisting people for similar reasons , leaving the blacklisted with no redress .
At the same time , we all know those employees responsible for huge thefts and loss making will seldom have their details added to any blacklist for the simple reason that the companies they have defrauded will not want the publicity it would attract .
John Bunnett , Swansea
This may have very unpredictable results .
Only the police should have possession of this type of information .
Already , completely innocent people get blacklisted by credit agencies for the wrong reasons .
From an employers point of view , while I would like to know whether someone has been caught stealing during their previous employment , there 's a simple way of checking , just call up the previous employer to see what they were like .
That is after all what references are for in the first place .
Brian , Dublin , Ireland
This is crazy .
It 's bad enough that CRB checks ( entirely sensible for working with children and vulnerable adults ) have crept into virtually very job making the Rehabilitation of Offenders legislation a virtual waste of time .
Now a private concern can cause misery by blacklisting someone over what can be very subjective views .
The majority of employers are small firms .
What is to stop an employer with a grudge , or an employer after a bust up with faults on both sides , just entering the ex-employee on the list and ruining their life ?
Yes , you can correct it , but by then the damage is done you 've lost that job you were shortlisted for or spent months having CVs rejected before you knew why .
Indeed , how will an employee get access to the database .
Mark , London
The concept is fine and will be a useful tool for employers with their suitability checks on would - be employees .
BUT any individual suffering because of an incorrect / false entry on the database must have full redress - including the right to sue for defamation against the old employer , the AABC and Hicam Business Solutions .
John Andrews , London , England I left a local council on entirely amicable grounds at the end of a temporary contract .
However , one of the senior staff there obviously did not like me and despite handing I a glowing personal reference , when I was offered a job in another council and they contacted my past employer , the job offer was withdrawn because of comments made .
A couple of years later , I was offered another job and that to was withdrawn at the last moment ; because information had that had been received from somebody .
Legal challenges got me nowhere .
Sorry to delude people but this immoral practice already goes on , blacklist have been around for years , they are just not in the public domain .
The CRB is an acceptable method of checking people 's suitability ; any other unregulated authority is immoral , will be open to abuse and should be outlawed .
Neal Underwood , Harrow I own a retail business , I would n't employ anyone who has stolen from a previous employer or damaged the property of a previous work place .
But what happens if one of my existing staff turns up on the data base ?
Is that grounds for a sacking ?
Steve , Stockport , Cheshire , England About time employers had a means to see if a prospective employee is worthy of employment .
A bit miffed as to why something like this has n't happened until now .
If someone says that they feel like they 're being treated like a criminal then that is more than likely because that they are in fact , really are a criminal .
Now , all we need is something just like this but in regards to illegal migrants and the means to report those attempts an illegal migrant makes to gain employment .
Big brother state ?
I 'm all for that as at the end of the day , it makes society safer and fairer and gives criminals a harder time ; if you have nothing to hide then why should you be worried ?
Les , Elgin To Les in Elgin , do you have curtains ?
Do you close them ?
Why ?
What do you have to hide ?
Silas , London , UK
This is crazy , we live in a country where we are " innocent until proved guilty " , this scheme blows that out of the water .
If the police can not convict someone then there can be no slur on an individuals name .
Peter Gansbuehler , Swindon Blacklisting - great scenario : much profit for lawyers and profits down for all of society , because people who are not proved guilty are nevertheless not earning so they cannot spend .
Capitalism ; you know it makes sense .
Cheap foreign ( illegal ) labour ?
Anything about you in print is subject to data law ; it can be reviewed and corrected .
Refusal to employ on the basis of suspicion is harder to stop , but such employers will get the staff they deserve in time .
So , we could have shops staffed only by those with enough nerve and PC clout to fight , whether honest or not .
That makes sense - sure it does .
Secondly , when do we get a register of all the bullies and perverts who use seniority at the workplace ?
When THEIR misdemeanours are " proved " ?
Thank goodness I 'm not 25 again .
Mike Bovingdon , London
This is not funny .
When I was a teenager , I was convicted for GBH in a fight .
Nobody got hurt , a couple of bruises on each of us , but never the less I was convicted .
Here we are 22 years later , I am grown up married with a family and a responsible member of society .
Last year I lost my job with a local council over the incident , it was devastating .
This database will only marginalise people in society and lead to more crime as these people will feel unemployable .
Paul
The cry in favour of the erosion of our civil liberties used to be " The innocent have nothing to fear " .
Well now it seems they do .
A single malicious individual can destroy someone 's career .
And there are people like that in even large and well respected companies .
An absolutely disgusting example of the increasingly paranoid culture that successive governments have forced upon us .
Ian , Redditch
There should not be an appeals process , an entry should not be made until it has been fully investigated .
The damage that could be done in the interim could be to severe to rectify , the implications have the potential to be absolutely horrendous .
Most people have had at least one nightmare boss , imagine if that person could mar you for the rest of your life ?
This is worse than 1984 .
Lisa Ford , Telford , Shropshire I would be interested to see the reaction of employers should a similar website be launched containing information about employers ' mistreatment of staff - including discrimination , bullying , unfair terms and conditions , outrageous pay rises for principal staff whilst below - inflation rises are given to general workers etc .
Dawn , England
In 2004 I was dismissed from a teaching job in a school for " gross misconduct " .
They had to use that charge to get rid of me .
I had made serious allegations against my employer to a number of authorities .
After my dismissal I took that employer to the Employment Tribunal and won unfair dismissal on 14 different counts and also won under the Public Interest Disclosure ( Whistleblowing ) Act .
For performing this painful public service will I now be on a list that makes me unemployable ?
The government should make such a list illegal .
But they wo n't .
The UK is becoming a truly horrible place to live .
KB , Croydon I 'm a headhunter , and try quite hard to get the facts on people and know I do n't get the whole story .
That 's with individual checks done one by one .
A mass database cannot hope to get all its records right .
But the Data Protection Registrar is the least effective regulator in Britain .
None of the high profile data breaches have caused them to do anything more than send a friendly e-mail asking " you Ok mate ? " to the HMRC and the various banks who have shown a cavalier attitude to personal info .
The idea that they can regulate this sort of business is like a blind traffic warden in Baghdad .
Dominic Connor , London I certainly do not agree with this as employers will stick together and ultimately it will be the word of the employee against that of the employer , so how can an employee prove the allegations are false ???.
I can see legal actions being brought as a result of this register .
This could be an employers way of getting back at someone they do n't like .
Karen Morgan , Cardiff
Is there any requirement for an individual to be notified that they appear on the database ?
If not they may never know that they are on it and as such wo n't think to challenge the information stored .
It sounds like a formalised old boys network .

While the whole world has been focusing on Prime Minister Putin ’s brutal slaughter of the Russian economy , a whole slew of other lesser , but oh so much more graphic , crimes have crept by undetected .
We ’re here to put a stop to that .
The launch of EXILED ONLINE has put the gore sleuths of the infamous Death Porn Bureau back in business .
Oh , gone are the good ol ’ days .
We ’re not as well staffed as we once were and ca n’t have our coffee brought to us by one of our lovely DP girls .
In fact , I ’m the only one left .
I wo n’t have time to cover all DP happenings that cross my desk , but it does n’t mean I wo n’t try .
For this historic relaunch , we ’re going with a DP classic that never gets old : the good ol ’ vodka - fueled murder spree .
And in these hot and humid summer months , there ’s a lot of them to go around .
As every seasoned DP hand knows , mixing 100 - degree weather with 100 - proof spirits makes for one hell of a bloody masha cocktail .
Click map to see the scene of the crime from space !
This week ’s gore fest comes out of St. Petersburg , Russia ’s northern capital , and involves 33 - year - old male ( the police have not yet released his identity , so we ’ll call him Dima ) .
Dima was a real Dostoevsky type of character .
He was unemployed , had a depressive streak in him and was prone to regular bouts of the zapoi .
On April 7 , 2008 , Dima visited his family ’s grave in a cemetery on the northern edge of town for a mid-day grief drink and ran into a like - minded soul who was doing the same .
The two men put their bottles of vodka into one pot and sealed their budding friendship with a few rounds of toasts .
The merriment , like always , did n’t last long and the friendship quickly de-evolved into a raging argument .
The details are hazy , but our experience tells us it had something to do with the fact that they ran out of drink .
Or maybe Dima ’s new buddy refused to throw down for another bottle of vodka .
Who knows .
But whatever it was , Dima found it necessary to render the other man unconscious , probably with one of the empty vodka bottles he had at hand , and then strangle him .
Funny thing is , Dima used the guy ’s own shirt to do the deed .
Makes you wonder if they were doing a bit more than just drinking , especially given that the man ’s lifeless body was found totally naked .
Dima fed the scene , but he did n’t panic , remembering to grab his victim ’s mobile phone as well as the 100 rubles he found in his pocket .
Kill # 2
Dima ’s second kill came in late May , almost two months after the first one .
As he was walking through a WWII monument to the people who died during the blockade of Leningrad , taking swigs from a bottle of vodka , Dima noticed a drunkard lying passed - out in one of its dark corners .
It was nighttime and no one was around ; it was the perfect opportunity for a quick robbery .
But in the land of DP , things rarely work out the way you want them to .
You probably guessed that the drunk had the misfortune to wake up just as Dima was rifling through his pockets .
Naturally , the man attempted to resist , but Dima would have none of it .
Picking up his bottle , he bashed the drunk on the head until he was knocked unconscious and then proceeded to strangle him with his bare hands .
According to the police , Dima made away with a cellphone and 300 rubles in cash .
( How the police were able to establish the exact amount escapes us . )
Kill # 3
It seems that Dima started to enjoy his new - found method of conflict resolution , because his third kill had all the trappings of premeditation .
His live - in girlfriend had just gotten into a fight with her friend over money and Dima , being the strong masculine type that he is , decided to defend his woman ’s honor .
On June 2 , he invited his chick ’s friend over for a talk and drink behind a huge transformer in the woman ’s heavily wooded yard .
They had a few rounds and then a few more , but the vodka peace offering did n’t seem to influence her any and even gave her the courage to dole out some backtalk .
Dima did n’t like that one bit .
He flew off the handle and beat her on the face until she became unconscious .
Making sure no one was watching , he took out a belt from the woman ’s raincoat and strangled her with it .
( He was a budding sociopath and was still working on his kill “ signature ” : strangling victims with their own clothing . )
He then ripped off her gold chain and calmly walked up the street to his own pad for dinner .
Kill # 4
It ’s not clear if Dima ’s 44 - year - old girlfriend knew about her friend ’s untimely death , but we ’d wager she did and was damn proud of her hubby for standing up for her , too .
She was so proud , in fact , that she decided to get pregnant .
Almost two months later , on July 22 , after serving Dima a meal — maybe some hot kotletas and a cool bottle of vodka straight from the freezer — she triumphantly announced that she was going to have his baby .
But Dima did n’t take it as well as she expected .
He accused her of being a no - good cheating whore and then grabbed a kitchen knife — the DP weapon of choice — and repeatedly stabbed her in the breasts and neck .
He then grabbed all the valuables he could lay his hands on and split .
When the police caught up with him a week later , Dima justified the murder by saying he could n’t have been the father .
It appeared that all the heat and booze had made the poor chap impotent .
MORE than most countries , Japan thinks of itself as uniquely homogenous and , in terms of language , culture and origin , ethnographers broadly agree .
But the fair - skinned Ainu — supremely hairy of body , with luxuriant beards on the men and tattooed lips on the women — are the notable exception .
EPA
Belatedly recognised
Or were .
The Ainu 's traditional heartland is Hokkaido , the northernmost of Japan 's four main islands , on which the G8 summit has just been held .
Not long ago , they were also found in Sakhalin and the Kurile islands .
Although there had been a Japanese presence in south - west Hokkaido since the Middle Ages , it was only in the 19th century that it was annexed to become what the West was for America : a new frontier to be opened by persecuting the hunter - gatherers already there .
While the Ainu called their place Ainu Mosir , “ the land of human beings ” , Hokkaido means “ the road to the northern sea ” , and the Japanese settling of their new frontier was every bit as brutal as America's .
Today only 24,000 call themselves Ainu , most of them of mixed blood .
Only ten native Ainu speakers remain , while a solitary century - old woman is thought to have a tattooed lip .
The Ainu 's origins are vague .
Certainly , they are related to ethnic groups in Russia 's far east .
But one genetic marker is shared only by people in Tibet and the Andaman Islands .
Jared Diamond , a biogeographer , says their mystery makes the Ainu the world 's most studied indigenous group .
One thing is increasingly clear : they are more obviously the descendants of Japan 's original inhabitants , the Jomon , inventors of the world 's earliest pottery , than are modern Japanese , who are descended from later settlers from Korea .
This infuriates Japan 's racial chauvinists .
So only now — and partly because of the spotlight from hosting the G8 — has Japan 's parliament passed a resolution recognising the Ainu as a people in their own right .
The first law about the Ainu that was passed , in 1899 , defined them as aborigines in need of assimilation .
But until the law 's repeal in 1997 , Japan officially denied having any indigenous minorities .
The recognition , says Tadashi Kato , head of the Ainu Association of Hokkaido , comes dangerously late .
But it may encourage more Ainu to admit to their identity , having concealed it because of discrimination at school and work , and in the marriage market .
Mr Kato thinks that maybe ten times more than the official number think of themselves as Ainu , even if many are of mixed blood .
He argues that the parliamentary resolution is just a first step .
It offers no legal protection , and carries no obligations for the state .
There is little talk yet of an apology for Japan 's past treatment of the Ainu , let alone a restitution of lands or hunting rights .
Today , the Ainu 's dances , handicrafts and animist beliefs are on display mainly for touristic consumption .
Their traditional respect for nature is much in vogue with urban Japanese in search of a more innocent Japan .
But it is unclear how these purists would take to a revival of what once was the Ainu 's central ritual , called iyomante .
This involved the public sticking of a giant bear , considered a god whose spirit could return to heaven only through prolonged taunting and death .
My 11 - year - old has been bugging me all summer to talk his mother into letting him buy an Airsoft gun ( I am , of course , an assumed yes ) .
When I was a kid I had a BB gun , as did most of my friends .
We promised to be careful , and then we shot each other in the butt and accidentally put some holes in windows .
But nobody lost an eye , and it seemed like just part of a normal childhood .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Today ’s Airsoft guns , by contrast , use little plastic pellets rather than metal BBs and are thus safer , but they can still put out an eye .
They come in spring , compressed air and electric versions , but they all basically work the same way , which is to use compressed air to launch the pellets at an impressive velocity , simulating the gun experience without being able to kill anyone .
The pro case is that letting him have the gun is an opportunity to teach serious gun safety , which will be an important lesson that will serve him well in later life .
The con case is , well , everything from the aforementioned eye to encouraging more of a gun obsession than the Nerf guns have already inspired .
Plus we do n’t want to get a reputation as the " gun family " in the neighborhood when all his buddies start asking their own parents for one .
Putting aside the broader issues of guns yay or nay for the moment , we ’re wondering about the age appropriateness of Airsoft .
So , a poll :
WHEATON , Ill . 
Of all the reasons a beloved professor could be leaving the college where he has taught for the last 20 years , the one for Kent Gramm ’s departure is peculiar :
He is getting divorced , the college demands an explanation , and he refuses to give one .
So Dr. Gramm is packing up his office at Wheaton College , an evangelical Christian liberal arts school where everyone signs an agreement to uphold certain biblical standards of behavior , and divorce for reasons other than adultery and abandonment is grounds for firing .
Rather than be fired , Dr. Gramm , a professor of English and creative writing , has resigned effective the end of this semester .
“ Why are college administrators better able to judge my divorce than I am ? ” Dr. Gramm , who has been married for 34 years , asked in an interview .
“ If I had thought this was the wrong thing to do , I would n’t have done it . ”
Dr. Gramm ’s departure has prompted hand - wringing , a petition drive by students on his behalf and deep reflection on this peaceful campus about 20 miles west of Chicago , where visitors are welcomed by the towering pillars of the Billy Graham Center , named for the evangelist and 1943 Wheaton alumnus .
Wheaton students vow not to smoke or drink on campus , and until 2003 , they had to promise not to dance .
( Now they can do so , but only if it is not “ immodest . ” )

Raja , I wish I knew
the cause of that malady .
For years I could not accept
the place I was in .
I felt I should be somewhere else .
A city , trees , human voices
lacked the quality of presence .
I would live by the hope of moving on .
Somewhere else there was a city of real presence ,
of real trees and voices and friendship and love .
Link , if you wish , my peculiar case
( on the border of schizophrenia )
to the messianic hope
of my civilization .
Ill at ease in the tyranny , ill at ease in the republic ,
in the one I longed for freedom , in the other for the end of corruption .
Building in my mind a permanent polis
forever deprived of aimless bustle .
I learned at last to say : this is my home ,
here , before the glowing coal of ocean sunsets ,
on the shore which faces the shores of your Asia ,
in a great republic , moderately corrupt .
Raja , this did not cure me
of my guilt and shame .
A shame of failing to be
what I should have been .
The image of myself
grows gigantic on the wall
and against it
my miserable shadow .
That 's how I came to believe
in Original Sin
which is nothing but the first
victory of the ego .
Tormented by my ego , deluded by it
I give you , as you see , a ready argument .
I hear you saying that liberation is possible
and that Socratic wisdom
is identical with your guru's .
No , Raja , I must start from what I am .
I am those monsters which visit my dreams
and reveal to me my hidden essence .
If I am sick , there is no proof whatsoever
that man is a healthy creature .
Greece had to lose , her pure consciousness
had to make our agony only more acute .
We needed God loving us in our weakness
and not in the glory of beatitude .
No help , Raja , my part is agony ,
struggle , abjection , self - love , and self - hate ,
prayer for the Kingdom
and reading Pascal .
Berkeley , 1969

The British mercenary Simon Mann today told an Equatorial Guinea court that Mark Thatcher , the son of the former prime minister , was a committed member of the group that organised the attempted coup in the oil - rich west African state in 2004 .
Giving his first detailed account of the planning for the coup , in a clear and confident voice he said Thatcher " was not just an investor , he came completely on board and became a part of the management team " .
He said Thatcher had provided $ 350,000 ( £ 178,000 ) in funding for the coup .
In further testimony , Mann claimed that Spain and South Africa , with the endorsement of the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , had supported the plot .
By January 2004 , two months before the attempted coup was put into action , it was , Mann said , " like an official operation .
The governments of Spain and South Africa were giving the green light : ' You 've got to go , you 've got to do it . ' "
Spain , he said , was prepared to recognise the new government the day after the coup and to send in large numbers of military police .
Outside the court , the Spanish ambassador , Javier Sangro , said he had no comment .
Senior members of the Equatorial Guinea army , police and cabinet were also implicated , Mann said , and he was given details of President Teodoro Obiang 's daily movements and his health problems .
From the Pentagon in Washington , and from the CIA and the big US oil companies , came tacit approval for regime change , according to Mann .
Their message , conveyed by one of his colleagues who went to Washington discreetly to test the waters , was that " the political situation in Equatorial Guinea was very unsatisfactory and very dangerous and that a well - conducted change of government would be welcomed " , he said .
At the end of his four - hour examination , with the help of an interpreter , Mann made his plea for clemency after it was recommended yesterday he serve a prison sentence of 32 years .
" I am very sorry for what I did in 2003 and 2004 .
I am very sorry for what I 've done .
I am also very happy that we failed , that it did n't work , especially now that I am here and I 've met you all . "
Referring to his incarceration in Zimbabwe after being arrested with a plane - load of mercenaries en route to Malabo , the Equatorial Guinea capital , he said : " I 've been in prison for four years and I 'm not the same man that I was . "
Although he delivered his story with flashes of humour , emphatic gestures and at times almost with relish , he was apparently suffering from a hernia , gripping his lower abdomen as he stood before the attorney general .
After two hours , the presiding judge allowed him to sit down .
The name of Lady Thatcher 's son cropped up when he was asked about planning meetings in South Africa .
Both Mann and Thatcher lived there at the time .
Thatcher , who now lives in a gated estate in southern Spain , accepted a plea bargain from the South African authorities in 2005 after he admitted helping to finance a helicopter that he suspected " might be used for mercenary activities " .
Thatcher was fined $ 450,000 and given a four - year suspended sentence .
He left the country shortly afterwards and has refused to elaborate on his role .
The Equatorial Guinea government has tried to get an international warrant for his arrest .
In the months leading up to the coup , Thatcher attended many meetings , Mann said , " because at this stage he came on board " .
Mann took
Thatcher to the Chelsea home of Ely Calil , the Lebanese businessman who is alleged to have been the main financier of the plot .
He named the management board as Calil , himself , a London property developer , Thatcher and a Lebanese colleague of Calil who lives in Beirut .
Although Calil currently rents a mansion in Hampstead , he is thought to be in Beirut .
He has always denied involvement in the coup plot but has never given an interview about the allegations .
The plan involving the helicopter was dropped .
But Thatcher 's money was used to buy a small plane that would transport the new provisional president , Severo Moto , from his opposition exile in Spain to Malabo via the Canary Islands .
Mann said Calil had initially asked him , in May 2003 , to assassinate Obiang and to launch a guerrilla war or a coup .
" I said I would not do it , on ethical grounds , and also because it was a very stupid thing to do , " Mann said .
He accepted he was doing the job for money – said to be $ 15 m - but he claimed he was sympathetic to the story he was told that oil money was not reaching the people .
" I believed it was right . "
At the beginning of his testimony , in answers to questions from the prosecutor , Jose Olo Obono , the attorney general , Mann agreed he had been well treated since his extradition from Zimbabwe in February .
Asked if he agreed with the proposed sentence of 32 years , he replied : " I do n't agree with that , no . "
And he added a long and plaintive : " Please . "
Anyone who follows investing knows the so - called smart money is n't always so smart .
Examples of misfires by big hedge funds or acquisitive corporations abound in recent years .
It 's unsettling , though , to find out that sometimes the smart money does n't even seem to try very hard .
After all , one assumes the big investors engage in detailed fundamental research , undertaken by talented and knowledgeable analysts , or that they rely on ultra-sophisticated mathematical models .
Maybe both .
The mistakes occur , we assume , when the analysis rested on flawed assumptions or the models overlooked important factors .
Or the manager 's ego simply ran out of control .
But a recent article in the Financial Times cites an even more troubling reason : Sometimes the analysts and mathematical models are n't even consulted .
Instead , the big shots occasionally invest simply because their buddies are doing so .
Two weeks ago , the Financial Times reported that after buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management bought a majority stake in GMAC and took that firm private , it later sold most of its exposure to a variety of other investors in order to reduce its own risk .
Fair enough .
But how did those other investors decide whether they wanted in on the deal ?
According to several of them , a group of hedge - fund managers were invited to a private meeting with Cerberus , and most decided - - rather quickly -- to join in without making any true investigation of their own .
" It was a ' trust me ' kind of trade , " one investor who bought a small piece of GMAC told the Financial Times .
" You had no time to do real due diligence .
But it was a hot deal and everybody wanted in as part of the gang . "
There was another reason , too .
" Many of the people who took part in the deal , " said the Financial Times , " were friends of Steve Feinberg , founder of Cerberus , and said they invested as a sign of faith in him . "
One investor who , unlike most , declined the offer to participate , now says , " There was an element of the greater fool theory to it . "
So far , the investors ' eagerness to pull the trigger has led only to grief .
( If their results had been happier , they probably would n't be talking to the press about it . )
A key reason is that ResCap , the mortgage - finance part of GMAC , has run into trouble , as have so many other players in the mortgage arena .
Thinking for Themselves ?
So what does this episode mean for ordinary mutual fund investors ?
For one thing , it provides yet another hint that you need not envy those with the millions to invest in hedge funds and other vehicles off - limits to the masses .
It 's easy to feel you 're missing out because the big hedge funds -- whose minimum investment levels , I assume , put them off - limits to nearly everyone reading this -- must have topnotch talent , exceptional resources , and first - rate connections .
Well , in many cases , they do .
But human nature can foil those advantages .
They can still dive into a lousy deal for the wrong reasons .
They are n't automatically superior to the good mutual fund managers available to all .
That said , how can one know that a mutual fund manager , too , is n't simply using a follow - the - leader investment strategy ?
One way is to look at the fund 's portfolio and see if it closely resembles the relevant index , or the portfolios of other active fund managers with similar mandates .
A fund that differs is n't necessarily going to succeed .
But at least you 're getting some independent thinking for your money .
To gain more insight , take a look at the manager commentaries included in annual and semi-annual fund reports , and often provided more frequently on fund - company Web sites .
Mutual fund managers should be able to explain clearly and persuasively why they are buying or selling -- or holding onto -- the securities in their portfolios .
Does their reasoning sound logical and thoughtful ?
Do the moves fit into a well - established , and well - articulated , strategy ?
Or does the manager seem to be providing run -of - the - mill reasons to justify buying a popular stock that lots of other people already own ?
Granted , managers are n't going to tell you they bought a stock because they 're friends with the guy who pitched it to them .
( Many years ago , though , a fund manager did confess to me in an interview that she had invested in a shaky foreign company - - a move that had backfired -- mainly because a big Wall Street firm had made a large , public investment in the company and she figured they must know what they 're doing . )
Nevertheless , by evaluating portfolios , comparing performance against indexes and rival funds during specific time periods , and reading the manager 's discussions and explanations , you at least can get an inkling whether the managers you 're paying to think for themselves really are doing so .

When Russian troops eventually pull out of Georgian towns such as Gori and Zugdidi , ordinary Georgians will heave a sigh of relief .
Russia 's military has emerged a clear victor in the latest conflict
But that will also be the moment that they take on board the fact that the two territories at the heart of the conflict with Moscow , South Ossetia and Abkhazia , although formally still regarded internationally as Georgian territory , are now essentially lost to them .
The people who will suffer most in the long term from this conflict are more than 20,000 ethnic Georgians from a mosaic of villages in South Ossetia who have now mostly fled .
Relatively few Georgians left during or after the small - scale 1990 - 92 conflict over South Ossetia and despite intermittent skirmishes and incidents , neighbourly contacts continued .
Reporters who have passed through many of the villages in the last few days say they are now in ruins .
The Russian authorities and their South Ossetian allies are now saying that they will not allow the Georgians back any time soon .
A Russian foreign ministry statement on August 18 said , " It is clear that some time  and not a short period of time  must pass in order to heal the wounds and to restore confidence .
Only after this , the conditions will be created for discussing practical aspects related to the problems of refugees . "
Hundreds of South Ossetians also lost their homes in the Georgian military assault of 7 - 8 August and , it appears , in the ensuing Russian counter - attack - but they have the small consolation of knowing they can start rebuilding them .
Russian leverage
The prospect is also now much bleaker for the 240,000 or so ethnic Georgians who were registered as displaced from the 1992 - 3 conflict in Abkhazia .
Refugees have flooded into Georgia 's capital from areas near South Ossetia
Their hopes of return were predicated on a successful peace agreement which now looks more elusive than ever .
Around 50,000 Georgians live in Abkhazia 's southernmost Gali district under an Abkhaz administration .
So far they have managed to stay in their homes , but their future is also more precarious .
It is not just a matter of Georgian control .
It will also be harder now to maintain an international presence in the two disputed regions .
The final point in the six - point ceasefire plan reads : " Pending an international mechanism [ in South Ossetia ] , Russian peacekeeping forces will implement additional security measures . "
That effectively puts an end to the former Joint Peacekeeping Forces , which had a Georgian contingent .
It also gives Moscow even more leverage than before over the shape of any security arrangements for the region .
Moscow is already insisting it can have the only real security presence there .
" We are of course not against international peacekeepers ... but the problem is that the Abkhaz and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except Russian peacekeepers , " Russian president Dmitry Medvedev told German chancellor Angela Merkel .
Unattainable dream The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the only international organization with a mandate in South Ossetia , wants to dispatch an additional 100 monitors to South Ossetia .
Abkhaz fighters were backed by Russian forces against the Georgians But Russia has dragged its feet , saying it wanted to agree the terms of their deployment in more detail and the OSCE has so far agreed to send just 20 more monitors .
The OSCE had just nine military monitors on the ground in South Ossetia when fighting started there on 7 - 8 August .
The European Union , with French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner taking the lead , also says it want to provide peacekeepers , but Mr Kouchner 's Swedish counterpart , Carl Bildt , admitted this might not work .
" There are no signs of the Russians letting in anyone else , " he said .
In Abkhazia , the United Nations has a small contingent of around 130 unarmed monitors , who were bystanders in the recent crisis .
When the Abkhaz , with Russian support , wanted to capture the mountainous Upper Kodori Gorge district from the Georgians , they merely gave the UN monitors there a 24 - hour warning to leave .
The EU has approved small aid programmes for both Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the last few years , but they have looked relatively modest when compared to the vast amount of Russian money coming into both regions .
Abkhazia is bigger and more diverse than South Ossetia with a lively media and many non-governmental organizations .
Many Abkhaz intellectuals dreamed of having some kind of independence free of both Georgia and Russia and with links across the Black Sea to the EU but that now looks unattainable .
' Double standards '
Internationally mediated peace talks over both disputes had stalled and there is little chance of them resuming properly any time soon .
Faced with a tightening Russian grip , Western leaders can only fall back on expressing support for Georgia 's right to these territories .
US President George W Bush made this commitment on 16 August , saying : " Georgia 's borders should command the same respect as every other nation's .
There 's no room for debate on this matter . "
This becomes a moral argument , with the Russians answering that after supporting Kosovo 's unilateral secession from Serbia , the West is guilty of " double standards " in the Caucasus .
Caught in the middle of these international wrangles are the current and former populations of both Abkhazia and South Ossetia  Abkhaz , Ossetians and other nationalities such as Armenians on the one hand , and the displaced Georgians on the other .
They often get along fine when they have a chance to engage in low - level meetings arranged by foreign organisations or across market stalls .
Now , unfortunately , they are being wrenched apart further than ever by conflict .

“ What we have in this situation is a very disappointing attorney who is pushing a different agenda than what her client wants , ” Mr. Jessop said .
He said he did not know exactly what the relationship was between Raymond Jessop and the girl , and he said his information about the accusations had come from the girl ’s mother .
The children of the polygamist group , which split off decades ago from the main branch of Mormonism , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , were ordered released to their parents on Monday by Judge Walther after two court decisions last month that rebuked child protection officials for acting beyond the evidence they had at the time .
The twist involving Mr. Jeffs comes as leaders of the sect are working hard to distance themselves from child marriage .
On Monday night , at a news conference at the group ’s compound , the Yearning for Zion ranch in Eldorado , Willie Jessop read a statement that he said was meant to clarify the sect ’s position .
“ In the future , the church commits that it will not preside over the marriage of any woman under the age of legal consent in the jurisdiction in which the marriage takes place , ” Mr. Jessop said .
“ The church will counsel families that they neither request nor consent to any under - age marriages .
This policy will apply churchwide . ”
Asked by reporters if Mr. Jeffs had been involved in the announcement or its message , Mr. Jessop said he did not know .
In another development on Tuesday , DNA test results from nearly 600 sect members  462 of them from children  began arriving at Judge Walther ’s court here .
The tests were ordered in an attempt to determine parental linkages , and specifically to see if girls under age 16 had been married in violation of Texas law .
Europe ’s highest court has ruled that spouses of European Union citizens who are not themselves citizens of the EU may live in Ireland .
The case involved four couples who appealed a decision by the Government to deport them because the husband in each case is not an EU citizen and has never lived lawfully in another EU state .
The ruling delivered this morning by the European Court of Justice said Irish laws , requiring a spouse from a outside the EU to have lived in another member state , were incompatible with a directive on the free movement of EU citizens .
None of the spouses issued with “ notice of intent to deport ” orders are married to Irish citizens but are married to citizens of other EU states .
In each case the couples were married in the Republic and the non-EU national husbands had all unsuccessfully applied for asylum .
The four couples lodged an appeal with the High Court against the “ notice of intent to deport ” orders , arguing they breach EU law , and particularly their right to live and work in any EU state .
The High Court referred legal questions arising from the cases to the ECJ .
The ECJ ruling sets a precedent for thousands of other couples residing in Ireland and , more widely , better defines the rights of EU states to manage their own immigration policies .
Under the EU directive on free movement of citizens , all citizens may reside in another member state as workers or students if they have sickness insurance and sufficient funds that they do not become a burden on the social welfare system .
Family members of a citizen of the European Union also have the right to move and reside in the member states with that citizen .
The ECJ ruled today that application of the directive is " not conditional on their having previously resided in a member state " .
" The directive applies to all union citizens who move to or reside in a member state other than that of which they are a national , and to their family members who accompany them or join them in that member state .
The definition of family members in the directive does not distinguish according to whether or not they have already resided lawfully in another member state , " the ruling stated .
The court also held that a " non-community " spouse of an EU citizen who accompanies or joins that citizen in the host country can benefit from the directive " irrespective of when and where their marriage took place and of how that spouse entered the host member state " .
The Department of Justice had argued that a previous ECJ judgment in 2003 in the case of Hacene Akrich provides the legal basis to deport non-EU spouses of EU citizens .
The Department claimed last month that the Akrich case stated that to avail of the freedom of movement of EU workers and family members a “ non -EU citizen must be lawfully resident in a member state when he moves to another member state to which the citizen of the Union is migrating or has migrated ” .
Welcoming the judgement this afternoon , the European Commission said the ruling clarified the rights of free movement of European Union citizens and their family members throughout the EU .
Report : Bush administration milked untruths about Tillman , Lynch during sour times Nick Juliano
Published : Monday July 14 , 2008

The Bush administration willfully pushed fictional portrayals of Pat Tillman 's death in Afghanistan and Jessica Lynch 's capture in Iraq to create " compelling public narratives " at times when public opinion was starting to sour on the wars , Congressional investigators have found .
The House Oversight Committee on Monday released a draft report on the sagas of Tillman and Lynch .
The public did not learn that friendly fire had killed Tillman , a former NFL player , until more than a month after his death , and an apocryphal tale of Lynch bravely battling her Iraqi captors circulated for more than two months before key aspects of it were revealed to be false .
" Our nation also has an inviolate obligation to share truthful information with a soldiers family and the American people should injury or death occur ....
That standard was not met in either Corporal Tillmans or Private Lynchs cases , " the report says .
" Neither case involved an act of omission .
The misinformation was not caused by overlooking or misunderstanding relevant facts .
Instead , in both cases affirmative acts created new facts that were significantly different than what the soldiers in the field knew to be true .
And in both cases the fictional accounts proved to be compelling public narratives at difficult times in the war . "
The committee reviewed scores of e-mails and interviewed officials at all levels of the government .
When their inquiry took them inside the White House though , it was stymied by a spate of faulty memories .
The Committees investigation adds many new details to the Tillman story .
But on the key issue of what senior officials knew , the investigation was frustrated by a near universal lack of recall .
The Committee interviewed several senior officials at the White House , including Communications Director Dan Bartlett , Press Secretary Scott McClellan , and chief speechwriter Michael Gerson .
Not a single one could recall when he learned about the fratricide or what he did in response .
Similarly , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld told the Committee :  I dont recall when I was told and I dont recall who told me .
The highest - ranking official who could recall being informed about Corporal Tillmans fratricide was former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers , who said ,  I knew right at the end of April , that there was a possibility of fratricide in the Corporal Tillman death . 
General Myers testified that it would have been logical for him to pass this information to Secretary Rumsfeld , but said  I just do n't recall whether I did it or not . 
Regarding Tillman 's death , which came toward the beginning of President Bush 's re-election campaign , the report found the White House was eager to portray the former Arizona Cardinal who joined the Army Rangers as a hero .
The apparent desire within the White House was so strong that they did not bother to even verify Tillman 's death with the Pentagon before commenting , nor did Bush administration officials recognize a standard 24 - hour delay the military observes before commenting on a soldiers ' death to give families time to grieve privately .
Bush / Cheney campaign advisers also were eager to help with the response , the committee found .
Several high - level staff members of President Bushs reelection campaign contacted White House officials to suggest public responses to Corporal Tillmans death .
Matthew Dowd , the campaigns chief strategist , sent an e-mail to Mr. Bartlett , writing ,  You hear about pat tilman ?
Potus should call his family or go to Arizona or his hometown . 
Mark McKinnon , the campaigns media advisor , also e-mailed Mr. Bartlett , saying :  Realize President really shouldnt do anything that he hasnt done for any other soldier killed in the military , but certainly think he could say something about he exemplifies the ultimate in humility , heroism and sacrifice .
HARTFORD 
It was here in the third - floor billiard room where America ’s greatest humorist used to hole up when the bustle of his house , and the nursery one flight below , became too great , leaving strict orders not to be disturbed .
Seated at a desk tucked behind the billiards table , he wrote and rewrote in longhand such masterpieces as “ Huckleberry Finn , ” often beseeching his editors to stop cleaning up his language and restore the earthier vernacular he preferred .
But now the fanciful , three - story confection that was built by Mark Twain in 1874 at the height of his success may be forced to close because it is running out of money .
In a reversal of fortune that seems ripped from the pages of Twain ’s classic “ The Prince and the Pauper , ” the nonprofit organization that has long run the 14,000 - square - foot house as a museum told its trustees last month that it was “ facing significant challenges ” that could force it to shut down .
Election Officials Finally Acknowledge Voting Machines Problems , But Seem Unwilling to do Much About It ...
NYTimes Incorrectly Lays The Blame For A Lack of New Voting System Improvements On Federal Certification Process
John Gideon Byon

Guest Blogged by John Gideon , VotersUnite .

The New York Times has again given a platform to the voting machine vendors to voice their displeasure with a system that is forcing them to actually provide voting systems that are fully tested and certified .
The vendors , and some election officials , seem to want to continue the old system of poorly tested and rubber - stamped voting systems counting our votes .
In his article , Ian Urbina , quotes Jennifer Brunner , who says :
“ We need the federal oversight to create consistent standards and to hold the manufacturers to a certain level of quality , but we also have to be able to get the equipment when we need it .
Right now , that equipment is not coming , and we ’re left making contingency plans . ”
If Brunner expects high quality and consistent standards , all she needs to do is look to the vendors and question them on why they put out a product that fails in testing .
Her state 's recent countersuit of Premier / Diebold was a start , but why did she wait until she was sued by the vendor before taking that step ?
As we asked recently , why did she ignore the pleadings of Election Integrity Attorneys and computer scientists who counseled her to file a suit against Premier / Diebold for breach of contract for so long ?
Brunner also needs to question the National Association of State Election Directors ( NASED ) qualification system ( most often referred to as " federal certification " by most officials and vendors ) and those involved in the process as to why they allowed non-compliant voting systems to be given their stamp of approval on behalf of the federal government in the first place .
If the so - called federal Independent Test Authorities and NASED had done their jobs prior to 2007 , the machines used in Ohio and the rest of the nation would not now be constantly failing , and the voters would have far more confidence in the electoral system .
Doug Chapin of the Pew Center project electionline.org must have just come from last week 's Election Center conference , where election officials and vendor representatives gather and talk about issues of importance to the lucrative American Voting Industry .
He is quoted in the Times with this remarkable comment ...
" The problem is that the pace of innovation is outstripping the pace of regulation .
Federal certification is intended to help election officials manage voting technology , but right now it ’s getting in the way instead . ”
The problem is not that " the pace of innovation is outstripping the pace of regulation , " but rather that the pace of " innovation " by the vendors has outstripped their technical ability .
If Diebold / Premier had not presented a voting system that had 79 flaws found during testing and 2 of those being fatal flaws , they might have one of their newer systems certified right now .
All of the vendors seem to be having the same issues .
Product certification testing is not supposed to be a system of doing alpha and beta testing for the vendors , yet that is what is clearly happening .
Alpha and beta tests are to be done by the vendors before the federal laboratory product testing , the final step towards federal certification , takes place .
NASED allowed the flawed system in the past , and rubber stamped voting systems approved under flawed testing protocols .
The fact is , as Urbina reports , the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) has " said the current system left states on their own to discover voting machine problems .
The report calls for Congress to revise the Help America Vote Act and provide the commission with the authority and resources it needs to resolve problems with machines that were certified before the commission took over the process . "
Urbina reports that Chris Nelson , Secretary of State in South Dakota , told him :
In 2006 the ballot - marking devices used by disabled voters incorrectly marked 50 to 100 ballots , Mr. Nelson said .
The machine maker says it has fixed the problem but the state cannot install the fix without certification , said Mr. Nelson , who added that he had also not decided how to proceed .
Why has n’t the state of South Dakota taken the supplier of the state ’s AutoMark ballot marking devices , Election Systems and Software ( ES&S ) , to court for selling them flawed voting machines ?
Nelson admits that the state has been using those same flawed voting machines in every election to date since they found out they did n’t work properly .
Apparently , he must not be concerned as to wether that the state 's disabilities community gets to have their ballots accurately counted .
And what about every other state that uses those same machines ; do they have the same problem ?
And what have they done about it except to ignore the fact that the problem even exists ?
Then Urbina reports this :
In Chicago , election officials say they are frustrated that they cannot upgrade the software that runs their optical scan machines so that it will perform more smoothly for disabled voters .
The software change will also more accurately count ballots cast in voting precincts that sit on the fault line between two Congressional or judicial districts .
Besides the obvious fact that no software on optical scan machines will affect the performance of those machines for disabled voters , as compared to non-disabled voters , there is , again , the acknowledgment of a jurisdiction admitting to using a voting system that they know does not accurately count the votes .
Officials in South Dakota and Chicago must be held accountable for knowingly using voting machines that do not accurately count the votes .
The vendors must be held responsible for selling systems that do not accurately count the votes .
Yes , many states bought voting systems that need " bug fixes " and software updates .
The question must be , why do they needs those fixes and updates ?
Why was n't their system working properly when they sold it ?
Why did the previous qualification system allow faulty voting systems to be put into the " voting market " in the first place ?
Perhaps someone needs to follow the money trail .
The real solution must be for congress to act on the GAO report and for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) to begin to take action with regard to failing voting systems .
In the mean time , counties and states need to plan on ensuring paper ballots are available in every polling place , in every election , in place of the flawed voting systems now in use across America .

New York City has long been the highest tax jurisdiction in the United States , but California politicians are proposing to steal that brass tiara .
California faces a $ 15 billion budget deficit and Democrats who rule the state Legislature have proposed closing the gap with a $ 9.7 billion tax hike on business and " the rich . "
There 's a movie that describes this idea : Clueless .
The plan would raise the top marginal income tax rate to 12 % from 10.3 % ; that would be the highest in the nation and twice the national average .
This plan ...

Hundreds of comic strips have been published in newspapers .
The majority are terrible , and almost all the rest are mediocre .
There have been maybe four or five good comic strips in the history of the world .
So saying that Calvin and Hobbes is the best comic strip ever does n't really hold a lot of weight .
And it 's really a shame that it 's so difficult to quantify this strip 's greatness .
I can confidently state that Calvin and Hobbes outclasses the rest of the comic strip world more than anything else has ever outclassed the rest of its medium .
Sans this strip , the industry is characterized by guys sitting on rocks making stupid puns , a Family Circus kid misunderstanding the meaning of a word , or an overweight father playing golf while telling jokes such as I LIKE GOLF and GOLF IS HARD .
It 's a medium that does n't really deserve something as good as Calvin and Hobbes , but it got it anyway , and the newspaper - reading world was made a better place by it .
Calvin and Hobbes ran from 1985 to 1995 .
Bill Watterson drew thousands of strips , and while I wish like hell that he would come back and draw more , it 's probably best to reflect and be thankful for what he 's done .
Below we have showcased , in no particular order , some of our favorite Calvin and Hobbes strips of all time .
If you love them as much as we do , let us know if you think there are any that we should have included .
And if you missed out , well , hopefully we can give you some idea of why Mr. Watterson is our hero .

Calvin is an unbelievably intelligent six - year - old .
Hobbes is his tiger friend who plays the role of Jiminy Cricket , casual observer , and savage beast .
This strip introduces their dynamic rather well .
Calvin's a grossly misbehaving child , and no matter how he tries , he can't betray his nature .
It 's kind of refreshing to see a strip that does n't feel the need to have an uplifting message , or feel like it needs to point out that it 's mean to whack an innocent person upside the dome with a snowball .

One of the top classic Calvin strips .
It serves as an example of what set C&H apart from other comics :
It 's not a simple set - up to a punchline in the last panel , but a whole and complete work that uses every inch of space .
Not only that , but tonally it 's a huge departure from other strips of the time ( or of today , for that matter ) .
I can only imagine the initial reaction across the country to a dark , gothic tale of supernatural creation and destruction , wedged between Gasoline Alley and Mark Trail .

Pretty much the voice of Bill Watterson dictating the current state of our school systems .
Dead on if you ask me .
The school system is more of a test for being able to acquire knowledge than preparation for anything worthwhile .

Calvin and Hobbes is sometimes at its best when it 's bizarre , and this is definitely one of the more bizarre strips .
There are some subtleties in this strip that I like , such as the guy in the third panel doing the " end is nigh " pose and the futuristic spacecraft revealing an old - timey loudspeaker .
Hobbes ' bizarre reply is the icing on the cake .
Perhaps it stems from his disdain for humanity 's willingness to stomp over nature to gain the extra dollar .

The " realistic " art style and dramatic angles of comic strip soap operas like Rex Morgan , M.D. are funny enough when they 're real , so Watterson did n't have to stretch too far for a parody .
I mean , look at this .
I would n't listen to two real people talk about whether to put their kid in day care , why would anyone actually read this ?
Also , that second panel is scary and I think Rex is driving so fast because his passenger has to hurry and get back to The Human League .

The Duplicator Story .
Some of the stories told in this strip last weeks , and this was one of them .
Calvin and Hobbes is n't particularly unique in this respect ; after all , the last ten years of " Funky Winkerbean " have chronicled him making his bed .
Calvin and Hobbes stories are so great because they give the strip the opportunity to spin completely out of control .
In this story , Calvin invents a device which allows him to instantly duplicate himself .
His intent is to create a clone that will do all the hard work for him , but hell unleashes when he realizes that the clone , being exactly like him , is just as much of an asshole as he is .
Calvin # 2 manages to create Calvins # 3 - 6 , and they all cause chaos because they know that Calvin # 1 will have to pay for it .
It 's just about the best alibi a kid could have .
It probably reaches its climax when Calvin 's mom sees # 4 glued to the television when he 's supposed to be doing chores and yells , " What are you doing watching TV ? " # 4 replies casually , " Why , are you taking a survey ? "
If I had responded like that to either of my parents when I was a kid , they would have shot me in the kneecap .
Needless to say , this is where we got the name of this website .

Figures that she shits all over him at the same time .

The Transmogrifier Story .
Ahhhhhh , The Transmogrifier .
The Transmogrifier was composed of several strips , and was even made more efficient when held within the parameters of a squirt gun .
This is my favorite Transmogrifier strip , because Calvin is adorable .
This was also the strip where I realized that all Calvin and Hobbes strips were written in all - caps .

Also setting Calvin and Hobbes apart was how surprisingly literate it was , especially for a comic that was not a specific commentary piece like Doonesbury or Bloom County .
Watterson admitted in the Calvin and Hobbes 10th Anniversary collection that he had held quite an interest in art for many years , and always had sort of a bemused fascination with the amount of bullshit people build around it .
I 'm , uh , paraphrasing , of course .
Sad to say , there are many people who would find the " artwork " in these two strips to be utterly brilliant and pay a ton of cash for them .
Then they 'd melt .
The art , that is .
Or maybe the people who bought it too , hell , I dunno .

When I was six years old ( Calvin 's age ) , my mom dragged me to swimming lessons all summer .
It was without doubt the worst experience of my entire life ( and it 's quite terrible to think that I had to suffer the worst experience of my life at the age of six ) .
I hated water .
I hated the cold .
I hated getting up early every morning .
I hated the peer pressure .
I was scared shitless of drowning .
The drive from my house to the pool was about half an hour .
I memorized all the landmarks on the way , and as each one passed my wish that I was dead would grow more fervent .
I honestly anticipated swimming lessons like one would anticipate a lethal injection .
After coming home on the second or third day , I came across the first Calvin and Hobbes collection .
The first page I opened to was the beginning of the story of Calvin 's experience with swimming lessons .
I identified with it immediately .
It was incredibly spot-on .
No matter how horrible my day was , I could at least take solace in the fact that my struggles were shared by someone else , even if he were a drawing .
This story reminds me that I 've been able to relate to " Calvin and Hobbes " more than just about anything else in the world .

It 's hilarious to see Calvin take a huge shit on the hunting industry 's favorite rationalization .
This is a prime example of the animal - loving influence that Hobbes has had on Calvin .
Huge kudos to Bill Watterson for graphically murdering a guy in the funny papers .

I always identified with Calvin as a child ( I suppose you could say I still do ) , and this strip pretty much sums up what being a kid like Calvin is like .
Constantly feeling out of sync with the rest of the world , and thus retreating to the world you create for yourself in your mind .
If you think about it , Calvin was really quite an anomaly in popular entertainment -- not just in comics , but in anything , be it movies , TV , etc .
He has no friends , and no extracurricular activities ; the only people he ever sees are his parents , who he has a strained relationship with , and Moe , Susie , Rosalyn , and Miss Wormwood , all of whom he detests and all of whom detest him .
The only person he ever has any real interaction with exists only in his head .
He is , for all intents and purposes , completely alone .
And he 's fine with that .
The kind of kid most people would entirely ignore all through school is not generally the kind you make the star of your show , and yet the strip became hugely successful .
I know that people of all ages enjoyed Calvin and Hobbes , but I have to think that it meant even more to those of us who grew up with him .
Going to school every day and seeing all the ways we did n't fit in , it was nice to see someone like us , who was intelligent and independent , and did n't need to be a smile - plastered Mouseketeer to enjoy life .
Though numerous motivational posters and guidance councelors and after - school specials had said it again and again , it was Calvin who managed to truly express the idea — without being preachy , without being sappy , perhaps even without trying — that it was okay to be different .

This strip has become a personal philosophy for me the as of late .
Before I moved to Virginia , I used to watch every single Red Sox game with my father , and one day , while the Red Sox held a small lead on their opponents , he asked me " If you could have anything in the world , what would it be ? "
I answered , " For the Red Sox to have a 4 - 3 lead in the bottom of the 6th . "
He called me a dingbat .

This was possibly the first great Calvin and Hobbes strip .
Childhood mischief had always been played out by assholes like Dennis the Menace and Jeffy from Family Circus .
The difference is that those two were well - meaning kids .
It 's already been established that Calvin 's a smart kid , and here he is just wantonly being an asshole .
To see a child genius sit there and nonchalantly bang the shit out of a coffee table is hilarious .

Just like every six - year - old kid , Calvin daydreams a lot , and just like me , he usually daydreamed about dinosaurs .
Dinosaur strips were some of the most beautiful that Bill Watterson ever drew .
It really exhibits his depth as an artist , not only in his ability to render things well , but in the spacing of his panels .
Before Calvin & Hobbes came around , Sunday comics were just :
TITLE PANEL > THROWAWAY JOKE > BUILDUP > BUILDUP > BUILDUP > BUILDUP > PUNCHLINE
Watterson is the only newspaper cartoonist to ever convince me that he approaches his comic strip as a work of art and not just a bunch of joke boxes .
He uses half the allotted space to draw Calvin as a pterodactyl , which is awesome , and the real - life storyline at the bottom being placed as an inset toward a panoramic rendering of the pterodactyl flying away is just perfect .

Try to work it into conversation at least once a day .

Thanks , Mr. Watterson .
When investors from oil - rich Abu Dhabi purchased the Chrysler building in June , many waxed indignant .
Perhaps they 'll be happier about the latest " America For Sale " news :
The New York Post reveals that an unidentified sovereign wealth fund is looking to buy thousands of foreclosed U.S. homes .
The Post :
One sovereign fund , said to have earmarked $ 29 billion to purchase foreclosed residential real estate , recently hired a West Coast mortgage broker and is starting to search for bargains , The Post has learned .
The search , which is being carried out , in part , by Field Check Group mortgage consultant Mark Hanson , who was retained by the broker , Steve Iversen , is concentrating on single - and multi-family REO ( real estate owned ) homes , or homes that have already been taken over by the mortgagee
Neither Iversen nor Hanson would disclose the name of the client , but sources told The Post it 's a sovereign fund .
Foreclosed properties are already selling at prices between 60 and 80 cents on the dollar .
Added to this discount is the relative weakness of the dollar , which makes the investment even more attractive for international buyers .
This is good news for the housing market , which will be bolstered by clearing some of these unwanted properties off of inventories .

Below are the seemingly prophetic words and a short video of Dr. Frank Baxter , or , “ Dr. Research , ” who was best known for the series of educational films called The Bell Laboratory Science Series .
Remember , this happened in 1958 :
“ Even now , man may be unwittingly changing the world ’s climate through the waste products of his civilization .
Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year , of more than 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide … our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer . ”
According to Wikipedia , the Bell Labs Science Series :
“ [ C ] ombined scientific footage , live actors and animation to convey scientific concepts and history in a lively , entertaining way , and the bald , bespectacled and affable Dr. Baxter served as narrator , lecturer and Master of Ceremonies . ”
Okay , so they were teaching this stuff in schools in the late 50’s and early 60’s ?
Granted , Dr. Research was a professor of English , but it is clear he ’s not making the stuff up himself .
It seems that “ the bald , bespectacled and affable ” Dr. Baxter was on to something , huh ?

Tell most people a volcano is erupting and you can bet most of them will start running in the opposite direction before you finish the sentence .
But not in the case of pro-surfer C J Kanuha , who grabbed his board and paddled out to sea to get a closer look as the lava of the world 's most active volcano , Kilauea , hit the waters .
Tentative at first , the adrenalin - junkie paddled to within 20ft of the lava , before moving back from water that reached 200C in places , melting the wax on his surfboard and burning his feet in the process .

Kilauea , meaning ' much spreading ' , has been continually erupting in Hawaii since 1983 , but more molten rock than usual is flowing from an outbreak that started last November .
Lava has been spewing as high as 150ft in the air at temperatures up to 1,200C and a surface flow is snaking east from the crater .

Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory have also reported an ' unusually high amount of sulphur dioxide gas ' emerging from one of the craters .
Kilauea is a low flat shield volcano .
It is the youngest on Big Island and sits on the south - eastern side .
The volcano has its own magma- plumbing system , extending to the surface from more than 60 km deep in the earth .
The near constant eruptions have proved an invaluable resource to geologists but the volcano has proved to be a dangerous neighbour .
Kilauea releases a volcanic gas , known as vog , which can irritate respiratory problems .
High levels of the noxious fumes have killed several people in the past .
In 1993 , a tourist died when the portion of cooled fresh lava on which he was standing broke away and fell into the ocean .
The lava flow has also destroyed homes and sections of the coastal highway over the last two decades .
Kilauea is the home of Madame Pele , the Hawaiian volcano goddess .
Hawaiian chants and oral traditions tell of the many eruptions created by an angry Pele before the first European , the missionary Reverend William Ellis , saw the summit in 1823 .

The NYT ’s David Kirkpatrick had a very strong piece yesterday on John McCain ’s foreign policy worldview , his embrace of neoconservatism , and his response to the attacks of 9/11 .
It applies a little more scrutiny than McCain is probably accustomed to receiving .
[ By the afternoon of Sept. 11 , 2001 ] , Mr. McCain , the Vietnam War hero and famed straight talker of the 2000 Republican primary , had taken on a new role : the leading advocate of taking the American retaliation against Al Qaeda far beyond Afghanistan .
In a marathon of television and radio appearances , Mr. McCain recited a short list of other countries said to support terrorism , invariably including Iraq , Iran and Syria .
“ There is a system out there or network , and that network is going to have to be attacked , ” Mr. McCain said the next morning on ABC News .
“ It is n’t just Afghanistan , ” he added , on MSNBC .
“ I do n’t think if you got bin Laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared , ” he said on CBS , pointing toward other countries in the Middle East .
Within a month he made clear his priority .
“ Very obviously Iraq is the first country , ” he declared on CNN .
By Jan. 2 , Mr. McCain was on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the Arabian Sea , yelling to a crowd of sailors and airmen : “ Next up , Baghdad ! ”
Just to clarify , by October 2001 , McCain was already a cheerleader for invading Iraq .
This was his reflexive response to the terrorism perpetrated by al Qaeda .
It ’s an anecdote that reminds us of so many questions surrounding McCain , including his temperament , his judgment , and his “ hothead ” personality .
“ He has the personality of a fighter pilot : when somebody stings you , you want to strike out , ” said retired Gen. John H. Johns , a former friend and supporter of Mr. McCain who turned against him over the Iraq war .
“ Just like the American people , his reaction was : show me somebody to hit . ”
And while that may strike some as appealing , the problem with McCain ’s approach is its indiscriminate attitude — he looks for somebody to hit before he actually thinks about the merit and / or consequences .
Looking back at this period also reminds us of just how wrong McCain has been .
While pushing to take on Saddam Hussein , Mr. McCain also made arguments and statements that he may no longer wish to recall .
He lauded the war planners he would later criticize , including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney .
( Mr. McCain even volunteered that he would have given the same job to Mr. Cheney . )
He urged support for the later - discredited Iraqi exile Ahmad Chalabi ’s opposition group , the Iraqi National Congress , and echoed some of its suspect accusations in the national media .
And he advanced misleading assertions not only about Mr. Hussein ’s supposed weapons programs but also about his possible ties to international terrorists , Al Qaeda and the Sept. 11 attacks . [… ]
[ A ] fter Mr. Bush declared he would hold responsible any country condoning terrorism , Mr. McCain called his leadership “ magnificent ” and his national security team the strongest “ that has ever been assembled . ”
A few weeks later , Larry King of CNN asked whether he would have named Mr. Rumsfeld and Colin L. Powell to a McCain cabinet .
“ Oh , yes , and Cheney , ” Mr. McCain answered , saying he , too , would have offered Mr. Cheney the vice presidency .
Even during the heat of the war in Afghanistan , Mr. McCain kept an eye on Iraq .
To Jay Leno in mid-September , Mr. McCain said he believed “ some other countries ” had assisted Osama bin Laden , going on to suggest Iraq , Syria and Iran as potential suspects .
In October 2001 , when an Op - Ed page column in The New York Times speculated that Iraq , Russia or some other country might bear responsibility for that month ’s anthrax mailings , Mr. McCain interrupted a question about Afghanistan from David Letterman on that night ’s “ Late Show . ”
“ The second phase is Iraq , ” Mr. McCain said , adding , “ Some of this anthrax may — and I emphasize may — have come from Iraq . ” [… ]
[ W ] hen the Czech government said that before the attacks , one of the 9/11 hijackers had met in Prague with an Iraqi intelligence official , Mr. McCain seized the report as something close to a smoking gun .
“ The evidence is very clear , ” he said three days later , in an Oct. 29 television interview .
( Intelligence agencies quickly cast doubt on the meeting . )
On Friday , McCain told the NYT , “ I believe voters elect their leaders based on their experience and judgment — their ability to make hard calls , for instance , on matters of war and peace .
It ’s important to get them right . ”
That would sound more compelling if McCain had n’t been so wrong for so long .
Wil Wheaton sez ,
Starting this month , the Los Angeles Metro Metrolink will be infected with some super - neat security theater : random bag searches will inconvenience the new crop of MTA riders who are turning to Metro to escape high gas prices .
The thing is , the searches will " randomly " target different stations , where signs will announce to everyone ( except , presumably , illiterate terrorists ) that they should go to a different station if they do n't want to be searched .
Explain to me again how this makes us safer ?
8 Great Villains We Want in the Next Batman Movie Jul. 23 by Aaron_Koehn
With The Dark Knight set to break box - office records , a sequel is almost certainly in the works .
With Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhardt 's masterful performances as The Joker and Two - Face , respectively , finding another villian or two to ably face off against the caped crusader , while staying true to Christopher Nolan 's darker tone wo n't be an easy task .
Here 's 8 villains that may be able to pull it off .
8 - Dr. Hugo Strange
Character 's effectiveness and value : While Dr. Hugo Strange might not be very physically intimidating or threatening , his mental prowess and ingenuity make him a credible foe .
His comic book schemes have included massive , genetically - engineered monsters that attack upon command , and the discovery and attempted auction of Batman 's secret identity .
He was also one of the first reoccurring Batman villains , appearing before both the Joker and the Catwoman .
Character 's potential for realistic portrayal :
The not - so - good doctor would easily lend himself to a practical portrayal , especially since his costuming would probably only include a lab coat and some Windsor glasses .
There also seems to be a degree of mistrust with today 's medical field and its practitioners , and the filmmakers could certainly tap into that fear when developing this character .
Influence of previous interpretations : Aside from one or two animated Batman episodes , Dr. Strange has been sparsely utilized on screen making him a character that has little previously - established bias .
7 - The Penguin
Character 's effectiveness and value :
One of the most glaring weaknesses of the Penguin is his lack of menacing qualities .
He 's short , obese , and chain smokes , meaning his athletic prowess is pretty low .
That being said , he does have an extremely rich history in Batman lore , and his character has been thoroughly fleshed out resulting in more depth than your average villain .
Character 's potential for realistic portrayal : The Penguin is another character that would translate fairly easily into film .
He seems to favor formal clothing , but given his physical attributes , masking his insecurities with feigned affluence seems natural .
At one time the Penguin was rumored to be cast in The Dark Knight as a British arms dealer , which lends further credence to the idea that he could be done realistically .
Influence of previous interpretations :
There have been a myriad of Penguin portrayals all of varying degrees of quality , so it would be tough to escape any foregoing prejudice and this could be seen as another weakness for the character .
Hopefully that wo n't dissuade the usage of him because there is an underlying creepiness with the Penguin , and as we saw with Christopher Nolan 's Joker , creepiness is something that he seems to do well .
6 - Mr. Whisper
Character 's effectiveness and value : Mr. Whisper was said to be an ancient monk who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for eternal life , and an immortal would likely make a very formidable villain .
In the comic Batman : Gothic , the shadowless Mr. Whisper runs amuck in Gotham , slaying numerous mob bosses in an attempt to win back his soul .
Batman repeatedly does battle with Whisper , but it 's especially tough to defeat someone who 's death - resistant when you 've taken a vow not to kill .
Character 's potential for realistic portrayal : Mr. Whisper 's outside appearance would not be a problem in terms of rational depictions , but the fact that he survives falls from skyscrapers and head - on collisions with trains might seem a bit too improbable for the next Batman movie .
An ambiguous approach to Mr. Whisper 's perceived powers might be the best way to portray the character on film , keeping the audience guessing whether or not he really is superhuman .
Influence of previous interpretations :
As previously mentioned , Mr. Whisper can only be found in the graphic novel Batman : Gothic , and as a result there have n't been any distorted interpretations done .
So if Mr. Whisper was utilized , no audience member would have any preconceived partiality .
5 - Zsasz
Character 's effectiveness and value : Zsasz is a serial killer who cuts tally marks into his skin after each subsequent murder .
He regularly refers to his victims as zombies and he insists that he 's liberating them from pointless existence by slitting their throats .
He briefly appeared in Batman Begins as an inmate in Arkham Asylum where he was identified as a hitman for the mob .
During the film , his recognizable scars could momentarily be seen during his escape from Arkham .
Character 's potential for realistic portrayal :
His potential is obviously very high since he has already been imagined and introduced into the film 's universe .
Influence of previous interpretations :
Beyond the comic books , the only other source where Zsasz can be found is in the Batman Begins movie , and as a result the character has n't yet been tainted by any earlier distortions .
So a more fleshed out and prominent role in the ensuing film would set the cinematic interpretation standard .
4 - Deacon Blackfire
Character 's effectiveness and value :
While less of a preacher and more of a cult - leader , Deacon Blackfire led a band of brainwashed Gotham citizens into what he described as a war on crime .
Eventually this cult took over all of Gotham resulting in its segregation from the rest of the country .
At one point a weakened Batman had even become an indoctrined sect member ; however , by the end of the story he realizes the error of his ways and beats the reverend senseless .
Character 's potential for realistic portrayal :
There really is n't anything too unusual or improbable about the deacon to warrant not including him in the movie .
While Blackfire makes claims that may seem too sensational for the film , specifically regarding the immortality he receives by bathing in blood , by the end of the comic we find out that indeed the deacon was more of a conman than immortal , firmly grounding the story in reality .
Influence of previous interpretations :
The graphic novel Batman : The Cult is the only source where Deacon Blackfire can be found , so again , there are n't any other representations of this character to muddle his prospects .
3 - Catwoman
Character 's effectiveness and value :
The Catwoman is one of Batman 's oldest foes and on occasion she 's portrayed as a love interest and ally .
She is known for being a master thief and as a result she is often cleverly referred to by others as a cat - burglar , although her crimes are often given noble intentions similar to a black - spandex - clad Robin Hood .
Overall , she is one of the most popular Batman figures , having appeared in more adaptations than any other villain .
Character 's potential for realistic portrayal : The Catwoman is another character in the Batman mythos who , like the caped crusader himself , possesses no special powers .
This makes her easily translatable into Christopher Nolan 's very grounded Batman films .
She also has costuming that is traditionally very similar to Batman's , so her acceptance based on attire in this universe would be no less likely than his .
Influence of previous interpretations : Being the Batman villain that has seen the most adaptations means the Catwoman comes with lots of baggage .
From her appearances in several movies ( notably , the terrible film starring Halle Berry ) to countless television show spots , the Catwoman has become an ingrained pop-culture icon .
And ultimately , it 's this familiarity that becomes the biggest drawback when considering the likelihood of this character 's utilization .
2- The Riddler
Character 's effectiveness and value :
The Riddler is another Batman villain that strikes little fear into the hearts of do - gooders .
This could be due to his lack of physical weapons , or his insistence on leaving riddle - based clues at his crimes that always result in his schemes being revealed and then thwarted .
That being said , the cerebral nature of the character seems to lend itself well to Christopher Nolan 's more mature and thoughtful approach , and the character 's rich history provides abundant potential .
Character 's potential for realistic portrayal : Provided enough green fabric can be found to create an olive suit and matching Bowler hat , there really is n't anything too unusual about this character .
Certainly a less cartoony , more mature interpretation would be necessary to make this character believable , but if an audience can buy a grown man fighting crime under the guise of a humanoid bat , it should be able to accept a criminal fond of riddles .
Influence of previous interpretations : Again , this is a character that has been done before and to limited success .
So if the Riddler was going to be again seen on a movie screen , a deep reinterpretation would be necessary .
There have been recent allusions made by several cast members though , indicating that indeed this character could be the next Batman villain .
1 - Black Mask
Character 's effectiveness and value : Black Mask is a deranged mob boss in Gotham city who wears a skull - like mask carved from his mother 's ebony coffin .
Growing up , Black Mask had a parentally forced - friendship with Bruce Wayne , one which he despised and which grew into a deep resentment of the Waynes .
Black Mask frequently uses torture not only for personal gain but for personal satisfaction , often resulting in the death of his victims .
Character 's potential for realistic portrayal :
While some might see the skull - like mask to be a bit of a stretch in regards to realism , the motive of personal resentment and subsequent revenge certainly is n't .
This is a very dark character and one can easily picture him fitting into the darker tone established in these Batman movies .
As a mob boss , he also easily fits in with plots and themes used in the earlier films .
Influence of previous interpretations : While Black Mask has been used a number of times in comics , his universal recognition is pretty limited .
To the diehard fan he is pretty significant in the Batman canon , but to those who are only casually interested in the Caped Crusader , he would be a complete unknown .
To put it simply , Black Mask has a lot of theatrical potential .

War kills .
People die in wars .
Soldiers get captured in wars .
All of the above are facts … no one can dispute them .
In the last war in Lebanon , Israel came out the loser as far as the government was concerned .
Over one thousand Lebanese people lost their lives
in that war , a majority of which were innocent civilians .
Forty four Israeli civilians were killed .
The Olmert administration was scolded for not handling the war properly ….
WTH is that supposed to mean ?
See section 12 of
this linked report
For years it has been a joke that news in the United States is terrible : obsessed with trivia and celebrity ; fronted by Botox bimbos ; forever interviewing citizens about some artefact of small - town life when a major news story is breaking elsewhere .
Well , the truth is that it 's far , far worse than that .
There are a multitude of news channels - CNN , MSNBC , CBS , NBC , PBS , Fox .
But after an hour of flipping between them during lunchtime last week , this was the sum total of information gleaned : there are two US presidential candidates ; they have produced campaign ads ; people have made video parodies and posted them on the internet ; a US TV news host appeared on a US TV chatshow last night ; and someone said something controversial ( read ignorant ) on a different TV show the day before .
In the meantime , one of the most sought - after war criminals in the world had been arrested and sent for trial ; several new scientific breakthroughs had been announced ; Zimbabwe edged carefully toward shared government ; the Indian government dealt with votes of no-confidence and terrorist attacks ; and countless other real stories came and went .
For millions of Americans , these events appeared as 15 - word tickertapes at the bottom of their 36 - inch widescreen TVs .
It 's not the absolute dearth of real news that is the problem , however .
It 's the fact that the news that is presented is n't news but mindless , misleading gossip .
The clearest example of this is when one of the ( between two and six ) commentators on any given story provides their " analysis " .
This comprises of showing a video clip and then talking with the assumed voice of the person in the clip .
So , for example , Barack Obama gave a press conference .
A clip of around four or five seconds of what he said is shown and then the TV studio people take over .
News anchor : " So what he 's saying is ' Hey , I 'm the guy in charge here - I 'm the person who decides what to do , not you . '
Is that right ? "
Commentator : " I think what he was saying was : ' If I become president , then I 'll be the person that calls the shots . ' "
Commentator
Two : " I do n't agree .
He 's saying : ' I am going to listen to others – that 's what I 'll do – but make no mistake I 'll be the person who makes the final decision . ' "
This goes on and on with people making up dialogue and pretending to be Obama ( or John McCain or anyone else that comes to mind ) rather than broadcasting what was actually said .
But it gets worse :
• Unfair comment :
The analysis of what someone has said is clearly bent by the reporters themselves along ideological lines .
Unrelated facts and events are attached and then attacked , and the original news point ends up as little more than a launching pad for the experts ' own political perspectives .
So a sober report on , say , house prices ends up as a criticism of the Republican party 's fiscal policy ( without any details of that policy being provided ) .
In the worst cases , something with no news value at all is introduced in order to score political points – such as McCain eating at a German restaurant , or Obama knocking fists with his wife .
• Tail - chasing and navel gazing :
The media reports constantly on itself .
And that really does mean constantly .
Anything reported on the TV news instantly becomes something to be reported on .
For an entire day the lead on most TV networks was whether the media was giving Obama too much coverage .
The second day comprised of whether the coverage given to Obama was too uncritical .
By the third day , much of the coverage was about the previous two days ' coverage , complete with clips of how rival networks were covering the " news " .
News hosts also regularly appear on other news hosts ' shows , and then feature that appearance on their own show .
• Never let the story get in the way :
The focus is entirely on the back story , and the actual news is given lip - service .
So you 'll hear more about how a decision was arrived at than what the actual decision was , or what impact it might have .
The idea is that you are getting the real juice .
The reality is you are forced to drink a pint of conjecture concentrate .
Presidential campaign ads have become lead stories .
A one - second image flash of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton in a recent ad implied that Obama was no more than a celebrity .
It led to hours of primetime news speculation , while the ad's central claim that Obama would raise taxes if elected was ignored .
• The Jerry Springer school of journalism :
There is never a neutral statement - it is always an extreme perspective .
If you are the news anchor , you can speak in a third - party voice and add a question mark on the end to suggest impartiality .
But otherwise , wild claims are balanced with an equally wild claim at the other end .
If someone attempts to point out logical inconsistencies , they are almost always faced with personal mockery by the other commentators .
Just one example of this bizarre , school - bully behaviour :
When one commentator , speaking from Las Vegas , tried to point out why an offshore drilling bill ( which had been misrepresented as a reason why the Democrats were responsible for high petrol prices ) , had not been passed by Congress , he was told by the anchor that he had clearly spent too much time at the craps tables .
He was told soon after by another commentator he had spent too much time at the bar .
The substance of his argument did not of course merit discussion .
• The gold ( fish ) rush :
There is absolutely no effort to provide historical context .
The news is paced so frenetically that anything beyond soundbites is not tolerated .
News anchors consistently talk over the top of anyone that does n't provide a punchy point every 10 seconds .
Swooshing graphics and dance music add to the general level of pace – which effectively masks the fact that almost nothing is being provided beyond personal opinion .
• When did you stop beating your wife ?
Coverage is deeply cynical in the sense that people are assumed to have a hidden and planned agenda even when the connection drawn would have been impossible to predict as it does n't follow logical reasoning .
Speculation with no foundation in logic or fact is opened up as a serious news item with the simple inclusion of the phrase " Did [ insert name of person ] know about [ insert event ] ? "
The answer – if there was ever any attempt to actually arrive at it – will always be " No " .
• Fight !
Fight !
Fight !
There is no effort to reach a greater understanding .
Instead , the sole intent is to provoke disagreement and partisan perspective - with the anchor used solely to egg on disagreement .
Nearly every segment ends with the anchor shutting off argument and promoting the idea that they will have to agree to disagree .
So where do you get your news while living in the US ?
News - starved Americans usually hold up National Public Radio , NPR , as the best option .
But with interlude music fresh from the 1920s and a twee , kitchen - table - chat approach , this is news wrapped in a tea cosy .
Two comedy programmes , the Daily Show and the Colbert Report , fill a peculiar niche of serious analysis with gags and are possibly the main news source for people under 30 .
They both viciously lampoon the news media , which pretends not to notice and runs clips from them on their own shows .
There is hope however .
The non-news cycle is increasingly being broken by the internet .
Thanks to cheap digital technology and fast net connections , online video is a simple prospect and means it is possible to get your fix of moving images with real news thrown in .
Not that TV news is concerned .
The internet , and YouTube in particular , is a network 's dream : an Aladdin 's Cave of uninformed , one - sided and aggressive gossip and commentary , all of it searchable and requiring minimal expenditure of time or money .
And so every day you can find news anchors running short clips of the very best the internet can offer before turning to the experts to give their views .
Back in April , Antifascist Calling reported on the proposed shut - down of the Pentagon ’s controversial Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) office that illegally spied on the antiwar movement .
That office was officially “ disestablished ” August 4 by the Department of Defense ( DoD ) .
Simultaneously , it “ activated ” the Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center ( DCHC ) “ under the direction of the Defense Intelligence Agency . ”
DCHC will “ combine CIFA resources and responsibilities with longstanding DIA CI and HUMINT capabilities . ”
DCHC director Army Maj. Gen .
Theodore Nicholas says that “ the realignment of CIFA ’s functions and resources into DIA strengthens the close historical and operational relationship between counterintelligence and HUMINT . ”
According to the Associated Press , DIA ’s new office will engage in what it calls “ offensive counterintelligence ” to identify what terrorist operatives or foreign intelligence officers are up to and thwart their activities .
The DoD stresses that “ CIFA ’s designation as a law enforcement activity did not transfer to DIA .
The new center will have no law enforcement function . ”
In other words unlike CIFA , if we ’re to believe the Defense Department , DCHC will not spy on Americans ’ or subvert their constitutionally - protected rights of free speech and assembly .
But unlike DCHC ’s classified budget , talk is cheap and the devil is in the details which are few and far between .
CIFA : mired in cronyism , scandal and corruption
The brainchild of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone , CIFA was mired in cronyism , scandal and corruption .
Indeed , disgraced Congressman Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham ( R - CA ) , now a convicted felon cooling his heels in a federal penitentiary , was caught in a cash - and - hookers - for - contracts scandal along with Mitchell Wade , the notorious ex-chairman of MZM Inc .
Cunningham , a member of the House Appropriations and Intelligence Committees , chaired the subcommittee on Human Intelligence Analysis and Counterintelligence that had authority over CIFA operations .
Like any good congressman dedicated to “ fighting the terrorists over there , so we do n’t have to fight them here , ” Cunningham showered MZM with some $ 16 million in dubious “ earmarks ” for contracts with CIFA before being run to ground .
One MZM deal would have allegedly provided the Pentagon office with a data - mining and storage system , the usual suite of “ tools ” for illegal spy operations we ’ve come to expect from the Bush regime .
The problem was , MZM ’s “ product ” was useless and was never installed .
According to U.S. News & World Report ,
Wade ’s shady dealings extended deep into CIFA ’s dark heart .
Wade enjoyed a “ special ” relationship with a company named Gray Hawk Systems Inc .
The firm , according to investigative journalist Chitra Ragavan , “ obtained several lucrative and questionable contracts from CIFA , which it then shared with MZM . ”
To sweeten the grift , “ three senior CIFA officials with influence over the contracting process left the agency and joined Gray Hawk , ” according to Ragavan .
With knowledgeable insiders in place , Wade was then able to “ craft earmarks for Cunningham , ” who then inserted them into appropriations bills worth tens of millions of dollars .
After that , Cunningham was able to pressure “ Pentagon officials to award the contracts to Gray Hawk and MZM . ”
Pretty neat trick , eh ? Unfortunately for Wade , his extracurricular activities earned him an eight year sentence in federal prison like his buddy , the “ Dukester . ”
Gray Hawk was purchased in 2005 for $ 100 million by ManTech International Corp. in an “ all cash acquisition , ” according to Washington Technology .
Approximately 90 % of the firm ’s employees hold security clearances which , as we ’ve previously described , are marketable commodities .
No charges were ever brought against Gray Hawk or its corporate officers .
But wait , there ’s more !
Before the smoke cleared , Kyle “ Dusty ” Foggo , the CIA ’s Executive Director , former Iran-Contra operative and close confidant of both ex-CIA Director Porter Goss and convicted fraudster Brent Wilkes , the former CEO of ADCS Inc. , was indicted in 2007 on charges of fraud , conspiracy and money laundering .
On February 19 , 2008 , Foggo ’s poker - playing pal Wilkes was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for his role as Mitchell Wade ’s “ subcontractor ” in CIFA shenanigans , according to the San Diego Union - Tribune .
However , the execution of a search warrant on a top CIA official by San Diego U.S. Attorney Carol Lam in May 2006 , proved too much for the Bush administration and their close political allies in the Republican party .
In addition to Cunningham , Wade , Foggo and Wilkes , Lam ’s net now was closing around several other congressmen involved in CIFA sleaze .
Indeed Kyle Sampson , Alberto Gonazales ’ Chief of Staff , was enmeshed in the scandal over fired U.S. Attorneys by the Bush regime .
When the Justice Dept. learned of the Foggo search warrant , the very next day Sampson wrote an e-mail to his political masters stating the need to discuss “ the real problem we have right now with Carol Lam . ”
Shortly thereafter , Lam was forced to resign and became one of the first victims of the “ Attorneygate ” scandal that eventually led to Gonzales ’ forced resignation as U.S. Attorney General .
Foggo ’s 2007 indictment was superseded when the CIA ’s former No. 3 was indicted on new charges filed May 20 , 2008 by federal prosecutors .
The new indictment charged Foggo with accepting tens of thousands of dollars in “ gratuities ” and “ sexual companionship ” ( the hookers in “ hookergate ” ) in exchange for helping Wilkes secure plum government contracts .
His trial is currently pending .
Small world …of crony capitalist grifting on a grand scale !
CIFA targets the antiwar movement
But the “ hookergate ” scandal was the least of CIFA ’s problems .
The office was caught red -handed spying on Americans when the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) obtained documents detailing the Pentagon ’s illegal domestic spying operation .
Multiple news reports beginning in late 2005 revealed that CIFA , with 400 full - time DoD workers and 900 “ outsourced ” contractor employees and a classified budget , had been authorized to track “ potential terrorist threats ” against DoD through reports known as Threat and Local Observation Notices ( TALON ) .
As it turned out , “ nonvalidated ” TALON reports were maintained in a huge database that compiled information on antiwar activists who organized demonstrations and vigils near U.S. military bases .
Even when supposed “ threats ” were designated “ not credible , ” the office retained the files nonetheless .
Examples of TALON reports were subsequently published by The National Security Archive on their website .
According to Archive analyst Jeffrey Richelson ,
There were approximately four dozen reports concerning anti-war meetings or protests , including reports that remained in the database long after it was concluded that the targets were unrelated to any threat .
Among the meetings that attracted the attention of military counterintelligence authorities were a large anti-war protest in Los Angeles in March 2005 , a planned protest against military recruiters in Boston in December 2004 , a planned demonstration outside the gates of the Fort Collins , Colorado , military base , and a planned protest at McDonald ’s National Salute to America ’s Heroes–a military air and sea show in Ft. Lauderdale , Florida .
It was concluded that the Ft. Lauderdale protest was not a credible threat and a column in the database noted that it was a “ US group exercising constitutional rights . ”
( “ The Pentagon ’s Counterspies , ” The National Security Archive , September 17 , 2007 )
The TALON database was shut down in September and future “ threat reports ” would now “ be funneled to an FBI database known as Guardian , ” Wired reported last August .
Guardian and its related e-Guardian database will be available for sharing “ certain unclassified information ” with state and local law enforcement officers .
“ Once sharing agreements are signed , ” according to SourceWatch , “ police chiefs and sheriffs will be able to query local terrorism threats and also submit terrorism information to the FBI through e-Guradian . ”
However , “ in accordance with intelligence oversight requirements , ” even though CIFA is now closed , DoD “ will maintain a record copy of the collected data , ” SourceWatch revealed .
In other words TALON reports , including data illegally collected on antiwar activists , will continue to exist somewhere deep in the bowels of the Defense Department .
The ties that bind ( and pay handsomely in the process ! )
Though CIFA is gone , the DoD ’s new office will retain many of the characteristics of its predecessor , including DIA ’s reliance on outsourced contracts to private defense and security firms .
According to a July 22 , 2008 Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England obtained by Cryptome ,
On August 3 , 2008 , all DoD CIFA CI missions , responsibilities , functions , and authorities as well as all associated resources including all personnel , support contracts and contractors , and appropriate records and archives shall transition in place to DIA .
Personnel transfer notifications , as appropriate and required , shall be accomplished in advance of the August 3 , 2008 , transfer from DoD CIFA to DIA .
[ emphasis added ]
Major CIFA contractors included QinetiQ , a British - owned defense and intelligence firm based in McClean , Virginia .
Investigative journalist Tim Shorrock reported in January for CorpWatch that QinetiQ ’s “ Mission Solutions Group , formerly Analex Corporation , had just signed a five - year , $ 30 million contract to provide a range of unspecified ‘ security services ’ . ”
Interestingly enough , Cambone became a QinetiQ vice president when he left the Pentagon and CIFA signed the QinetiQ deal a scant two months after he was hired .
Just a coincidence , I ’m sure .
CIFA ’s brief included a Directorate of Field Activities , tasked with “ preserving the most critical defense assets ; ” the Counterintelligence and Law Enforcement Center , designated as the office to “ identify and assess threats ; ” and Behavioral Sciences , the office that provided “ a team of renowned forensic psychologists [ who ] are engaged in risk assessments of the Guantanamo Bay detainees , ” according to Shorrock .
Will the CIFA shut - down and the transference of its intelligence brief to DIA mean that a privatized military - surveillance complex is now a relic of the corrupt Bush regime ?
Hardly .
According to estimates , some 30 - 40 % of DIA personnel are outsourced contractors themselves .
Indeed , Washington Technology reported that “ the Defense Intelligence Agency is planning a billion - dollar contract for information technology and services . ”
According to the brief report , the contract “ to be known as the Solutions for Information Technology Enterprise , will be open to Defense Department intelligence agencies , the Army , Air Force , Navy and Marines Corps as well as non-DOD agencies involved in intelligence . ” ( emphasis added )
Back in April , the publication reported that eight giant multinational defense and security firms “ won prime contracts ” from DIA “ for military intelligence analysis services . ”
The companies included BAE Systems Inc. , Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. , CACI International Inc. , Concurrent Technologies Corp. , L - 3 Communications Corp. , Northrop Grumman Corp. , Science Applications International Corp. and SRA International Inc .
In other words , the usual suspects !
Interestingly enough , two items that appeared last week in the federal insider and high - tech defense industry press paint DIA “ partner ” Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) in a less than favorable light , to say the least !
The first item was an August 5 piece in Washington Technology , that detailed how the Department of Homeland Security had to “ suspend a procurement ” for the upcoming TopOff 5 ( Top Officials ) “ national disaster drill to investigate improprieties in the contracting process . ”
According to Alice Lipowicz ,
… lawmakers said a contractor who apparently wrote parts of FEMA ’s request for proposals for the Topoff 5 contract might also be a bidder on the contract .
If so , that would present an unfair competitive advantage due to an organizational conflict of interest , and possibly other ethics infractions .
The senators also said FEMA officials did not recognize the potential conflict nor approve a mitigation strategy , such as firewalls , that would have mitigated it .
The contractor has not been named , but sources identified it as SAIC , which confirmed it submitted a bid for the Topoff 5 work .
( “ FEMA Suspends TopOff , SAIC Drops out of Competition , ” Washington Technology , August 5 , 2008 )
The second item appeared the very next day , when Federal Times revealed that SAIC had been found guilty of violating the False Claims Act “ and ordered the company to pay the government $ 6 million in damages . ”
Elsie Castelli reports ,
SAIC failed to disclose conflicts of interest that could have biased the company ’s work assisting the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , the jury found .
SAIC was hired by the agency to help it develop a rule to govern the recycling of radioactive waste from nuclear facilities .
The jury ruled the company concealed its relationships with private firms that would benefit from the rule , and made 77 false statements and claims to obtain payment on two NRC contracts in the 1990s .
( “ SAIC Found Guilty of False Claims Act Violations , ” Federal Times , August 6 , 2008 )
The second case is far more serious since “ companies found liable ” for submitting false claims “ are subject to suspension or debarment , ” Federal Times reports .
SAIC , No. 5 on Washington Technology ’s “ Top 100 List ” of Federal prime contractors , clocked in with $ 4,919,829,998 , more than two thirds of which were defense and security related .
“ No such actions have been taken against SAIC , according to the government ’s Excluded Parties List , which tracks suspensions and debarments , ” according to Federal Times .
Would anyone care to wager whether or not the San Diego - based defense and security giant will be suspended or debarred from future government contracts ?
I did n’t think so .
While the Defense Department claims that the Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center will “ have no law enforcement function , ” the question remains : with a massive domestic intelligence apparatus aimed like a Borg death - ray at America ’s democratic Republic , where has the Pentagon ’s “ law enforcement function ” been transferred ?
According to investigative journalist Erin Rosa ’s report in The Colorado Independent , “ the military will … be sharing intelligence information and providing support through U.S. Northern Command , ( NORTHCOM ) a unit stationed at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs that was created in 2002 for homeland defense missions , ” during the upcoming Democratic National Convention later this month in Denver .

Introduction
This is an introductory tutorial for Java web developers who are new to the Dojo Grid component .
This tutorial shows you how to populate a grid component with data retrieved from a servlet in the JavaScrip Object Notation ( JSON ) format .
This tutorial displays a grid with a list of roleplaying games ( RPG ) .
Here is a screenshot of the grid you will build in this tutorial :
Know the Grid
Grids in dojo are defined based on a structure and a model .
The structure is used to specify the type of data to be displayed , its format , position and how it is being displayed .
The model on the other hand holds the actual data that you get from the server .
The Structure
From the book of dojo :
“ In the world of Grid , the structure is the largest unit .
Structures are composed of views .
Views are composed of cells . ”
This is nice and simple , however , you often need to combine a number of cells into a row .
You might also need to group rows into one giant row that can be selected .
// a view can be composed of a single cell var rowBarView = {type : ' dojox . GridRowView ' , width : ' 20 px'} ; // a subrow is composed of a number of cells var subrow = [ {name : ' Title ' , field : ' title ' , width : " 300 p x " } , {name : ' Developer ' , field : ' developer ' , width : " 150 p x " } , {name : ' Score ' , field : ' score ' , width : " 75 px " } ] ; var subrow2 = [ {name : ' Platform ' , field : ' platform ' , width : " 300 p x " } , {name : ' Release Date ' , field : 'releaseDate ' , width : " 150 px " } ] ; // one or more subrows can be grouped into a view // the grouping of subrows forms a single selectable row var contentView = { rows : [ subrow , subrow2 ] } ; // a structure is composed of views var gridStructure = [ rowBarView , contentView ] ;
In dojo terminology a row combining a number of cells is a subrow while the combination of the subrows forms the selectable row .
Line 02 above defines a simple view with a single cell .
The cell has a width of 20 pixels and is of type dojox .
GridRowView which provides a selectable region for grid rows .
Lines 04 through 14 define the cells holding your data .
Each cell has a name used as a header and a field attribute that defines the mapping of the data with the model defined below .
The two subrows are combined into a view called contentView so that they can be selected and highlighted at the same time .
Finally , you define an array of views as the structure of your grid .
The Model
A model is an object that holds data in a format the grid can understand .
In dojo you get the data from a data source , a servlet in this case , using a data store .
Data stores are JavaScript objects that can get data from different sources such as arrays , files , and databases .
After getting the data you use a model which acts as the point of interaction between the grid and the data store .
Performing operations related to data retrieval and manipulation are done using the model .
For example , you can set a query on the model to limit the amount of data retrieved from the back - end .
Define the Grid
To have a grid component you need to define three div tags with the required dojoType attribute .
You also need to set the js Id attribute to define the associations between the tags .
The first tag defines your data store , the data source and the http method to use .
Lines 02 and 03 below define a data store of type QueryReadStore that can be used to send query parameters to the data source .
The url parameter specifies the address of the servlet to get data from , it is the same value defined in the url - pattern defined under the servlet - mapping tag in web.xml .
You can also specify the HTTP method to use for the request .
The second tag of type DojoData is used to define the model of the grid .
It has a number of useful parameters that can be set to perform operations locally using JavaScript such as sorting .
You may also use the query attribute to specify some parameters to send to the data source as show in Line 08 .
The third tag defines the grid as show in lines 11 and 12 .
To have the grid populated you need to specify the set the values of the structure and the model attributes .
<!--
Data stores read data from a data store such as a servlet --> < div dojoType=" dojox.data.QueryReadStore " jsId =" store " url= " GameDataProvider " requestMethod = " get " ></div > <!--
A model is the point of interaction between the grid and the data store --> < div dojoType=" dojox.grid.data.DojoData " jsId =" model " clientSort = " true " rowsPerPage = " 20 " store = " store " query = " {genre : ' Traditional RPG'} " ></div > <!--
A grid displays data and offer useful operations such as client sorting --> < div autoWidth = " true " autoHeight = " true " dojoType = " dojox .
Grid " model= " model " structure = " gridStructure " jsId=" gridWidget " ></div >
The RolePlayingGame Class
This is a simple JavaBean class with some properties and a toJSONObject method that returns a String representation of the object in JSON format .
import org.json.JSONException ; import org.json.JSONObject ; public class RolePlayingGame { private String title ; private String developer ; private Date releaseDate ; private int score ; private Platform platform ; private transient SimpleDateFormat dateFormatter ; public RolePlayingGame ( ) { dateFormatter = new SimpleDateFormat ( " dd MMMM , yyyy " ) ; } // getters and setter omitted public JSONObject toJSONObject ( ) { JSONObject json = new JSONObject ( ) ; try { json. put ( " title " , title ) ; json.put ( " developer " , developer ) ; json.put ( " releaseDate " , dateFormatter.format( releaseDate ) ) ; json.put ( " score " , score ) ; json.put ( " platform " , platform.value ( ) ) ; } catch ( JSONException e ) { e.printStackTrace ( ) ; } return json ; } }
The RolePlayingGame class uses the JSONObject class from the json.org library to create a json object .
The created json object can be easily returned as a string as shown in the code below .
The order you put the properties in the json object is not important since the JSONObject class uses a HashMap internally to store them .
{ " platform " : " PlayStation 2 " , " title " : " Persona 3 : FES " , " releaseDate " : " 19 April , 2007 " , " developer " : " Atlus " , " score " : 98}
Sending Data using a Servlet
To send data back to dojo you simply need to get a string in JSON format of the RPGs you want to display on the grid .
In this tutorial , the getSampleGames method defined in line 31 constructs the list of RPGs and add them to an instance of JSONArray .
Note that you need to call the toJSONObject object on each object before adding it to the json array as shown in lines 44 and 53 .
After adding all the RPGs to the json array you need to add it to an instance of JSONObject under the name items , use a different name and your grid will not display any data .
The body of the doPost method is simple as it calls the toString method on the json object returned by the getSampleGames method and writes it back to the browser .
import org.json.JSONArray ; import org.json.JSONException ; import org.json.JSONObject ; public class GameDataProvider extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet implements javax.servlet.Servlet { public GameDataProvider ( ) { super ( ) ; } protected void doGet ( HttpServletRequest request , HttpServletResponse response ) throws ServletException , IOException { doPost ( request , response ) ; } protected void doPost ( HttpServletRequest request , HttpServletResponse response ) throws ServletException , IOException { // print out the parameters sent from Dojo Enumeration e = request.getParameterNames ( ) ; while ( e.hasMoreElements ( ) ) { String name = e.nextElement ( ) .
toString ( ) ; System.out.println ( " name : " + name + " value : " +request.getParameter ( name ) ) ; } response.setContentType(" text / plain " ) ; response.getWriter().write(getSampleGames ( ) .toString ( ) ) ; response.getWriter ( ) . flush ( ) ; response.getWriter().close ( ) ; } private JSONObject getSampleGames ( ) { JSONObject json = new JSONObject ( ) ; JSONArray games = new JSONArray ( ) ; GregorianCalendar gc = new GregorianCalendar ( ) ; RolePlayingGame game = new RolePlayingGame ( ) ; game.setTitle ( " Persona 3 : FES " ) ; game.setDeveloper ( " Atlus " ) ; gc.set ( 2007 , Calendar .
APRIL , 19 ) ; game.setReleaseDate(gc.getTime ( ) ) ; game.setScore(98 ) ; game.setPlatform( Platform.PLAYSTATION2 ) ; games.put(game.toJSONObject ( ) ) ; game = new RolePlayingGame ( ) ; game.setTitle( " Shin Megami Tensei : Digital Devil Saga " ) ; ; game.setDeveloper ( " Atlus R&D1 " ) ; gc.set ( 2004 , Calendar .JULY , 15 ) ; game.setReleaseDate(gc.getTime ( ) ) ; game.setScore(93 ) ; game.setPlatform( Platform.PLAYSTATION2 ) ; games.put(game.toJSONObject ( ) ) ; try { //
The attribute name has to be items , using games does not work json. put ( " items " , games ) ; // json.put ( " games " , games ) ; }catch ( JSONException e ) { e.printStackTrace ( ) ; } return json ; } }
You need to define your servlet in web.xml and give it the value GameDataProvider so that the QueryReadStore can access it .
< servlet > < servlet-name>GameDataProvider</servlet-name > < servlet-class>com.osplayground.dojo.GameDataProvider</servlet-class > </ servlet > < servlet - mapping > < servlet-name>GameDataProvider</servlet-name > < url - pattern>/GameDataProvider</url-pattern> </ servlet - mapping >
That ’s it , you now have simple grid accessing a servlet to display a list of roleplaying games .

Women Lived a Year Undetected in Man ’s Closet
It is a scary thought that someone you do not even know , could be living with you undetected in your own home .
That is exactly what happened to one Japanese man recently .
The man was puzzled when he noticed food was missing from his house .
Living alone and having never seen a rat , he could not understand how the food was disappearing .
In an effort to figure out what was going on , he set up security cameras around his house that would transmit images to his mobile phone while he was out of the house .
Shortly after setting up the cameras , he noticed some movement through the images and believing it to be a burglar , he called the police .
Police where shocked to find the house locked and secure upon arrival , but when they entered the house , they discovered something both amazing and scary at the same time .
“ We searched the house … checking everywhere someone could possibly hide , ” Itakura said .
“ When we slid open the shelf closet , there she was , nervously curled up on her side . ”
a 58 year - old homeless woman had let herself into the home one day , when the owner had failed to lock the door .
She moved a futon into the small closet space , took showers , and ate the owners food while living out of the closet undetected for over a year .
The women was arrested and forced to leave the closet that she had come to call her home .

Robots will soon invade Antarctica , thanks to Ayanna Howard of Georgia Tech .
Ayanna is working a robot called SnowMote .
This small ski mobile shaped robot will be used to collect temperature , radiation and wind speed readings from Antarctica .
This will help scientists study why the ice shelves are melting .
Ayanna envisions a fleet of SnoMotes invading the frozen south pole .
The robots will communicate with each other and decide on their own what place is best to investigate , while the scientists stay warm inside .
The robots will navigate by using lines from snow banks as markers .
Ayanna hopes to be able to make these robots for about $ 10,000 each .
Sure , first they invade the south pole , then the rest of the world .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Cuba ’s Angel Valodia Matos was banned for life from taekwondo on Saturday for kicking a referee and a Chinese favorite was knocked out in a controversial ruling as the final bouts of the Olympic tournament descended into chaos .
Angel Valodia Matos of Cuba kicks out at referee Chakir Chelbat of Sweden during the men's +80 kg bronze medal taekwondo competition against Arman Chilmanov of Kazakhstan at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games August 23 , 2008 .

The confusion overshadowed victory for Cha Dong - min , who took South Korea ’s fourth taekwondo gold medal at the Beijing Games in the men ’s +80 - kg category , and Mexico ’s Maria Espinoza , who won gold in the women ’s +67-kg .
Leading 3 - 2 in the men ’s +80 - kg bronze - medal bout against Kazakhstan ’s Arman Chilmanov , Matos slumped to the floor rubbing his leg and was disqualified for exceeding a minute ’s injury time , prompting the Cuban ’s coach to rush onto the mat .
After a heated exchange , Matos struck the referee in the head with a high kick .
He also kicked another official before being escorted out of the arena .
A tournament official announced the life ban for Matos and his coach over a loudspeaker a few minutes later .
“ It was an insult to the Olympic vision , to the spirit of taekwondo and for me , an insult to mankind , ” said Jin Suk Yang , general secretary of the World Taekwondo Federation ( WTF ) .
Jin qualified that the ban was pending approval from the IOC and that the Cuban team could appeal .
He also said that the WTF would seek legal action against the Cuban team , and that the referee needed stitches for a cut lip .
Chilmanov was awarded the bronze by default .
Greece ’s Alexandros Nikolaidis took the silver and Chika Yagazie Chukwumerije of Nigeria took the other bronze .
The women ’s competition was almost as tumultuous .
Chinese double Olympic champion Chen Zhong was eliminated in controversial fashion , following a protest by the team of her British quarter - final opponent , Sarah Stevenson .
Chen had her victory over Stevenson overturned after tournament officials ruled that referees missed a scoring kick in the dying seconds that would have won the Briton the match .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
The ruling , announced over a loudspeaker , prompted enraged Chinese spectators to chant “ kangyi ! ” ( protest ! ) for several minutes .
Taekwondo officials had consulted the Chinese team before making the decision , Jin said .
“ Their response was : ‘ we are a hosting country and believing in sportsmanship , we are willing to accept any outcome from the decision ’ , ” said Jin .
Stevenson eventually took a bronze after defeating Noha Abd Rabo of Egypt , amid a chorus of jeering from Chinese spectators .
Norway ’s Nina Solheim took the silver after losing 3 - 1 to Espinoza , and Brazil ’s Natalia Falavigna took the other bronze .
Absolutely chuffed !
What happened when 30 grown men gave up 18 years to build a steam train
Ask any child to draw a picture of a train and you will invariably get the same result : a cylindrical boiler shape , with some big wheels underneath , a cab and a chimney belching steam and smoke at the front .
In other words , the classic railway locomotive .
Nobody draws a picture of a diesel or an electric train .
To a child there is only one noise a train can make : ' choo choo ' .
Plenty of enthusiasts love old cars and planes , but only a steam engine has the ability to make everyone - young and old , male and female - sigh with pleasure as it chuffs past .
They 're just loco : Michael Hanlon in front of Tornado , the new A1 steam locomotive
Steam enthusiasm is certainly not unique to Britain , but there are more clubs and preservation societies here than anywhere else .
Perhaps because we invented the mighty steam engine , its power is engraved upon our psyche .
But it 's still all very odd .
No one much under the age of 45 can possibly remember the days when Britain 's last , clanking steam trains - blackened , rusty and unloved - plied their dying trade along British Rail 's tracks .
But here in Darlington , steam never went away .
Here , in this small and unassuming North - Eastern town an extraordinary labour of love is coming to an end after 18 years .
It 's a project which makes no sense on paper - but it has created 90 tons of polished , gleaming , shining nostalgia .
Above all , it means the world to the small team behind it .
Their aim ?
It 's ambitious , to say the least .
To build , by hand , the first new full - sized mainline steam express locomotive in Britain for half a century .
Since 1990 , a team of around 30 enthusiasts , contractors , volunteers and staff - under the banner of the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust - have turned up every day to an old shed and happily milled and turned , cast , drilled , bored , welded and torqued mountains of gleaming brass , copper and nickel - silver steel to create a machine that belongs in another age .
In a few weeks , all being well , the boiler will be fired and their locomotive , christened Tornado , will turn its wheels for the first time .
The whole project is delightfully bonkers , so utterly British that just stepping through the doors of the workshop and getting a whiff of oil and acetylene , hot brass and stove enamel is enough to blow away the cynicism that comes from living in the 21st century .
Eighteen years of solid graft :
The members of the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust
This is the world of blue overalls and mugs of tea , lathes and people who talk in pure engineering - speak .
' This is the nearest humanity has got to reproducing itself in metal , ' says the project 's engineering director David Elliott .
As he takes me around this behemoth I can see what he means .
You can't help but be struck by the sheer size , the massive Brunellian weight , the precision .
I run my hands along one of the valve rods , two yards long .
Elliott notices , with some distress , a tiny dint in the brute steel , maybe a quarter of an inch long .
' Oh dear , someone 's dropped something , we 'll have to get that dressed out . '
Perfectionism to an almost surreal degree is the order of the game here .
A steam engine is fundamentally a simple device ( light a fire , boil water , use the steam to push a piston back and forth and turn the wheels ) , but these enthusiasts make it sound like nuclear physics .
I shimmy around underneath , everything is bright and clean , red - and - shiny steel .
But it wo n't be like this ever again .
Once Tornado is up and running , this pristine space will become a nightmarish hell of blackened hot metal , dripping oil and glowing cinders .
This is no restoration of an old engine .
Everything , save a couple of gauges and dials , has been made from scratch , using original engineering plans .
Tornado is now the only existing example of the Peppercorn A1 , one of the last big 3,000 - horsepower express passenger locomotives built by the London and North - Eastern Railway in the 1940s , and operated along the East Coast Main Line by BR until the 1960s .
Why this engine ?
For a start , the A1 was perhaps the ultimate post - war steam locomotive .
And because only the A1 class , among all the other big locos , have no other surviving examples left .
Forty - nine were made - and all were scrapped in the ruthless cull that followed BR 's decision to abandon steam in the Sixties .
The new steam engine that was 18 years in the making
To my surprise , David Elliott is no misty - eyed steam fundamentalist .
' Oh no , you could n't bring back steam .
Economically , it was the right thing to do to bring in diesel and electric power . '
Die -hard enthusiasts may lament the passing of an era - but the reality was British Rail had no choice .
On scrapping steam , BR 's fuel bill fell from £ 27 million a year to £ 9 m .
Reality trumps romance .
The problem stems from the physics of steam power .
When the world 's first passenger trains ran from here in Darlington to nearby Stockton in 1825 , ushering in the age of motorised transport , the primitive engines managed to harness less than 4 per cent of the energy in the coal into locomotion .
By 1900 the technology had improved these figures to 5 per cent .
By 1948 , when LNER Chief Engineer Arthur Peppercorn built his fleet of A1s , steam was reaching the giddy heights of 8 per cent efficiency .
Good , but nowhere near as good as the 20 per cent you get from diesel .
And one question they certainly would n't have asked back in 1825 was my next one : ' What 's the carbon footprint of this thing ? '
' I 'd hate to think , ' says David Elliott .
A quick calculation reveals that , by burning a hundredweight of coal every 21/2 miles , Tornado churns out - in modern emissions - about 15,000 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre travelled .
That 's 90 times the emissions of a small car .
Still , with the ability to haul 12 coaches at 100 mph the carbon footprint per passenger is still tiny compared to even the most economical car .
At the moment Tornado is not alive .
Like a science - fiction monster , a steam engine like this starts to breathe only when the fire is lit , the steam pressure builds and when its retinue of staff begin to pander to its every whim .
( In fact when the boiler was first tested , the fire was lit by the widow of original designer Arthur Peppercorn ) .
Driving a steam locomotive has been likened to conducting a thunderstorm .
Controlling a huge , angry animal might be a better analogy .
It is nothing like operating any other kind of machine and feels like a mixture of a workout at the gym , a stint on a church organ and an exercise in concentration .
Get it wrong and you will be killed or very badly hurt , indeed .
The controls , for example , are not the simple devices you find in a car or a plane or even a motorboat .
Steam engines have to be tuned , coaxed , cosseted and occasionally threatened and prodded into obeying your orders .
I had a go once , on a much smaller , simpler engine .
I was exhausted after a few miles .
How these men drove one of these for eight hours at a stint is a bewilderment .
Turn a brass handwheel , wrench a lever , open a valve and rarely anything happens instantaneously .
No wonder it takes months , years even , to learn how to drive one of these magnificent beasts properly .
In contrast , a child could get the hang of stopping and starting a modern diesel in minutes .
For a start you cannot just turn a steam locomotive on or off .
It is n't even just a case of filling it with water , lighting the fire and waiting for it to boil .
Steam locos have to be kept dormant , rather than left to fall dead , when they are not being used .
They must be kept warm and fed with a trickle of coal , issuing a faint hiss of escaping vapours as they spend the night in the engine shed .
The skill of the driver is matched by the sheer physicality that is the fireman 's job .
On an incline , at full tilt , he will have to shovel coal into the gaping maw of the burner at the rate of a sack every minute or so .
For mile after mile , hour after hour .
Creature comforts are zero .
There is a seat , but little else .
It is hot , dirty , painful , muscle - wrenching and suffocating work .
Hard edges and burning metal everywhere .
And no facilities .
' What do they do on a long run ? '
I ask .
' Out the side , or on to the shovel and into the fire . '
' And what about food and drink ? '
' Well , there 's a billycan of tea .
And they would cook their food , er , on the shovel .
The same shovel . '
Despite the hardships and dangers , driving or firing a passenger express train was , in the golden age of steam , perhaps the creme de la creme of working - class jobs .
These men were lionised , and very well - paid .
In an era when rail travel was still glamorous , driving a train was the ambition of millions of boys who were otherwise destined for the safe and comfortable world of the professions .
In 1938 , driving an engine like the world record - breaking Mallard ( a streamlined LNER design ) was roughly akin to being an astronaut .
Now a select band of people will get a chance to relive the romance .
After its first run in August , Tornado will be put through a series of safety trials , before being put into service to earn a living hauling enthusiasts .
She will be able to travel on Britain 's mainline express routes and , the Trust hopes , will be allowed to run at three - figure speeds .
There are even plans to take Tornado aboard , on to the tracks of France and Germany , through the Channel Tunnel .
All this has been achieved for the sum of £ 3 million , raised through a mixture of company sponsorship and hundreds of private donations .
Despite the inefficiencies of steam power , the railways of the 1960s were in many ways a delight compared to today .
They were certainly cheap and , in subsidy terms , a bargain for the taxpayer as well .
David Elliott is scathing about the post - privatisation mess that is today 's railway .
' The way it was handled was a nightmare , ' he says .
Britain's 108 preserved railways are models of calm efficiency , polite service and value for money compared to today 's shambolic ' real ' railways .
Travelling by train in Britain today , one gets the impression that the people who run our railways have nothing but contempt for their passengers .
Perhaps they should hand the whole lot over to people like David Elliott and his team .
Someone who blanches at a near - invisible dint in a bit of valve gear would , one suspects , sack the lot of them and start again .

Tom Engelhardt Asks Six Good Questions About the Anthrax Case ...
Brad Jacobson Byon
8/19/2008 , 10:52 am PT
Guest blogged by Brad Jacobson of MediaBloodhound
Do not miss Tom Engelhardt 's article , " Double Standard in the Global War on Terror : Anthrax Department , " in which he poses and explores six questions regarding the anthrax case .
These questions , however , are not ones we 're conditioned to ponder .
Prefacing his queries , Engelhardt writes :
Now , as the coverage fades and the story once again threatens to head for obscurity ( despite doubts about Ivins 's role in the attacks ) , I thought it might be worth mentioning a few questions that came to my mind as I read through recent coverage --- not on Ivins 's guilt or innocence , but on matters that are so much a part of our American landscape that normally no one even thinks to ask about them .
His overall thesis is encapsulated in the first question :
Why was n't the Bush administration 's War on Terror modus operandi applied to the anthrax case ?
Engelhardt first cites the hardships that suspects endured during the course of the investigation :
On August 10th , William J. Broad and Scott Shane reported on some of the human costs of the FBI anthrax investigation in a front - page New York Times piece headlined , " For Suspects , Anthrax Case Had Big Costs , Scores of the Innocent in a Wide F.B.I. Net . "
They did a fine job of establishing that those who serially came under suspicion had a tough time of it : " lost jobs , canceled visas , broken marriages , frayed friendships . "
According to the Times ( and others ) , under the pressure of FBI surveillance , several had their careers wrecked ; most were interviewed and re-interviewed numerous times in a " heavy - handed " manner , as well as polygraphed ; some were tailed and trailed , their homes searched , and their workplaces ransacked .
Under the pressure of FBI " interest , " anthrax specialist and " biodefense insider " Perry Mikesell evidently turned into an alcoholic and drank himself to death .
Steven Hatfill , while his life was being turned inside out , had an agent trailing him in a car run over his foot , for which , Broad and Shane add , he , not the agent , was issued a ticket .
And finally , of course , Dr. Ivins , growing ever more distressed and evidently ever less balanced , committed suicide on the day his lawyer was meeting with the FBI about a possible plea bargain that could have left him in jail for life , but would have taken the death penalty off the table .
But he then offers a chilling reminder of how Bush 's War on Terror affected those accused of far less than masterminding the deadliest bio -terror attack on U.S. soil in our nation 's history ...
Still , tough as life was for Mikesell , Hatfill , Ivins , and scores of others , here 's an observation that you 'll see nowhere else in a media that 's had a two - week romp through the case :
In search of a confession , none of the suspects of these last years , including Ivins , ever had a lighted cigarette inserted in his ear ; none of them were hit , spit on , kicked , and paraded naked ; none were beaten to death while imprisoned but uncharged with a crime ; none were doused with cold water and left naked in a cell on a freezing night ; none were given electric shocks , hooded , shackled in painful " stress positions , " or sodomized ; none were subjected to loud music , flashing lights , and denied sleep for days on end ; none were smothered to death , or made to crawl naked across a jail floor in a dog collar , or menaced by guard dogs .
None were ever waterboarded .
Whatever the pressure on Ivins or Hatfill , neither was kidnapped off a street near his house , stripped of his clothes , diapered , blindfolded , shackled , drugged , and " rendered " to the prisons of another country , possibly to be subjected to electric shocks or cut by scalpel by the torturers of a foreign regime .
Even though each of the suspects in the anthrax murders was , at some point , believed to have been a terrorist who had committed a heinous crime with a weapon of mass destruction , none were ever declared " enemy combatants . "
None were ever imprisoned without charges , or much hope of trial or release , in off - shore , secret , CIA - run " black sites . "
Why not ?
His remaining questions include : 2 ) " Why was n't the U.S. military sent in ? " ;
3 ) " Once the anthrax threat was identified as coming from U.S. military labs , why did the administration , the FBI , and the media assume that only a single individual was responsible ? " ;
4 ) " What of those military labs ?
Why does their history continue to play little or no part in the story of the anthrax attacks ? " ;
5 ) " Were the anthrax attacks the less important ones of 2001 ? " ; and 6 ) " Who is winning the Global War on Terror ? "
Engelhardt not only further exposes the predominantly vapid , deficient and misleading coverage of the Ivins case , but , like most of the writing on TomDispatch , also pushes American citizens to think more deeply about the very real forces at work " in the shadows . "

As online news consumption grows , the methods by which we find and evaluate our news continue to evolve .
" Social news " has become increasingly popular , especially with the advent of Digg , Reddit , StumbleUpon , FriendFeed , and more that let users vote on and evaluate each other 's shared items .
Two more takes on social news have gone public this week , bringing along their own approaches on how to present the " best " news while allowing the users to interact with the stories .
The first is NewsCred , first launched privately in May and opened to the public today .
NewsCred acts as a sort of news aggregator like Google News , except with a number of twists .
For one , NewsCred allows you to choose among a handful of news and blog sources that you 'd like to see news from .
More importantly , however , is the fact that NewsCred uses an algorithm to rank stories on the page based on the credibility of the story , the publication , and then author .
How is credibility determined ?
Users get to rank that too , giving NewsCred an idea of how much each story and source can be trusted .
" Our algorithms analyze this data , and unlike other social news sites , we use the data to present the news based on quality , not popularity , " the company said in an e-mailed statement .
This structure means that users do n't get to vote up stories to the front page like they do on some other sites , but they still get to offer input that ultimately affects what gets shown on the main site .
The second is more along the lines of what we 're already familiar with .
Yahoo Buzz has now opened up to all sites as well , allowing anyone to submit content that they think is interesting into the buzz machine .
Previously operating as a closed beta to select publishers ( including Ars ) , Buzz allows users to " buzz up " stories they find interesting , similar to Digg .
However , not just any stories will end up getting buzzed , but when they do , they get posted to the front page of Yahoo.com .
That 's some pretty major exposure , and the level of traffic driven by Yahoo once something gets buzzed is exponentially higher than most other social news sites , including Digg .
Now that Yahoo Buzz is open to the public , there will be more stories available to vote up , and hopefully a more diverse selection to choose from , too .
Unlike NewsCred ,
Yahoo does n't claim to promote stories based on credibility , although so far , the stories that are promoted to the front page of Yahoo tend to be from news sources that are considered well - known and trustworthy .
Whether that will change once there 's an influx of blog posts and other content submitted to Buzz remains to be seen , but both of these sites offer differing takes on social news that will likely keep the masses busy for some time .
Analyst Richard Bove has stated Lehman CEO Richard Fuld has " lost control of the game . "
That is something I completely agree with as it should be obvious to all .
Bove went on to say " If he does n't do something this weekend , as of next week , the game is on . "
That makes absolutely no sense .
Nor does
Bove 's price target of $ 20 per share .
Yes , Lehman has been shopping around for buyers , but buyers have been balking .

Lehman 's Crown Jewel For Sale
Five days ago in a will he , wo n't he debate Financial News reported Lehman Brothers to keep Neuberger Berman unit .
Lehman Brothers is not looking to sell Neuberger Berman , an asset management business , according to analysts who met with Herbert McDade , the bank 's new president and chief operating officer .
So much for that idea .
CNBC is reporting Lehman May Have Trouble Selling Neuberger Stake .
The same way sovereign funds balked over Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld 's terms to sell them a chunk of the firm , some private equity firms are balking over Fuld 's terms to sell them a part of Lehman 's investment management business , which includes the firm 's crown jewel , the Neuberger & Berman asset management unit , sources have told CNBC .
As first reported by CNBC , Fuld , Lehman 's long - time chief executive , is looking to sell a 70 percent stake in the investment management division and have an option to buy it back at a later date .
As a carrot to the potential buyer is a warrant to purchase a 20 percent stake in Lehman that could be cashed in when the credit crisis abates and the firm 's stock price recovers .
But potential buyers — which include nearly every major private equity firm — are starting to balk at Lehman 's initial offer , according to Wall Street executives familiar with the matter .
Their problem is the price .
Lehman is pricing the investment management division at around $ 10 billion , meaning a 70 percent stake would cost $ 7 billion .
But the real cost will be much more than that , because asset management firms are only worth something if employees remain with them following such a transaction .
Potential bidders believe that unless they set up a large retention pool — something in the neighborhood of $ 400 million to $ 500 million to keep employees at their jobs — the talent will walk , these people say .
Meanwhile , many of the firm retail brokers , who are part of the firm 's investment management division , have been offered jobs by the likes of Morgan Stanley , plus bonuses to jump ship .
Without a retention package , many might just leave Lehman , particularly as the firm 's prospects grow dimmer .
Fuld Wants His Cake And Eat It Too
Korea Back In The Game
Aug. 22 ( Bloomberg ) -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , the fourth - largest U.S. securities firm , rose the most in two weeks in New York trading after Korea Development Bank said it's " considering " an investment in the company .
Lehman climbed $ 1.44 to $ 15.16 at 11:43 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading , after reaching $ 15.93 .
Shares of the New York - based firm dropped almost 80 percent this year before today , the worst - performer on the 11 - company Amex Securities Broker / Dealer Index .
" KDB is considering all kinds of options , including Lehman Brothers , " a KDB spokesman said today , declining to elaborate .
A Reuters report earlier today cited a spokesman saying that the government - controlled bank is " open to " possibilities , including a purchase of Lehman .
" I would be very surprised by any deal that would lead to complete control , " said Stuart Eizenstat , a partner at Covington & Burling LLP in Washington and former U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury .
" That would elicit a lot of questions and political blowback .
I 'm sure that 's not going to happen . "
Is This Good News ?
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Some International Olympic Committee officials cut a deal to let China block sensitive websites despite promises of unrestricted access , a senior IOC official admitted on Wednesday .
Persistent pollution fears and China ’s concerns about security in Tibet also remained problems for organizers nine days before the Games begin .
China had committed to providing media with the same freedom to report on the Games as they enjoyed at previous Olympics , but journalists have this week complained of finding access to sites deemed sensitive to its communist leadership blocked .
“ I regret that it now appears BOCOG has announced that there will be limitations on website access during Games time , ” IOC press chief Kevan Gosper said , referring to Beijing ’s Olympic organizers .
“ I also now understand that some IOC officials negotiated with the Chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered Games related , ” he said .
Attempts at the main press centre to access the website of Amnesty International , which released a report on Monday slamming China for failing to honor its Olympic human rights pledges , continued to prove fruitless by mid-week .
Other websites , including those relating to the banned spiritual group Falun Gong , are also inaccessible .
Beijing organizers said censorship would not stop journalists doing their jobs in reporting the Games .
“ We are going to do our best to facilitate the foreign media to do their reporting work through the Internet , ” BOCOG spokesman Sun Weide told a news conference .

“ I would remind you that Falun Gong is an evil , fake religion which has been banned by the Chinese government . ”
Reporters without Borders , a Paris - based media watchdog , said it was increasingly concerned that there would be many cases of censorship during the Olympics .
“ We condemn the IOC ’s failure to do anything about this , and we are more skeptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely , ” the group said in a statement .
SMOG -WATCH
But the admission that the Internet will be partly censored is sure to lead to more criticism for the Olympics host nation , which is already deflecting barbs over everything from the quality of its air to its human rights record .
On Wednesday , Chinese experts said they were working on emergency plans to keep Olympic skies clear , including keeping cars off the roads in nearby provinces , but expected not to need them unless unusual pollution - trapping weather continued .
The city has already banned cars from roads on alternate days under an odd - and - even license plate scheme , suspended some factory production and opened new subway lines to try to clear its notorious pollution .
“ The likelihood of needing stronger measures is very small , ” said Zhu Tong , a professor at Peking University and leader of a technical group advising Games organizers on air quality .
Slightly cooler temperatures and rain on Tuesday have thinned the haze , but with below - par air quality readings on several days since the emergency measures took effect on July 20 , worries remain about athletes wheezing air laced with fumes and dust .
Experts said that given the size of Beijing , the volume of pollutants that flow into the city from other parts of China , and the short time period before the Games open on August 8 , there was little more that could be done .
“ In this short a time - frame , even if you took all the personal cars off the highway , you might see another 10 percent improvement , but it would be small , ” said Staci Simonich , an analytical chemist at Oregon State University who has been studying Beijing ’s air quality .
“ The best thing that could happen during the Games is to have it rain every night , ” she said .
China also has other issues on its mind , including security in the restive region of Tibet , where official media said Chinese police had been mobilized to ensure “ absolute security without a single lapse ” .
The remote region erupted into rioting in March that sparked protests across China ’s ethnic Tibetan areas and brought into focus international criticism of Beijing ’s policies on the issue .
The Tibet Daily announced on Wednesday tough policing during the Games on top of a sweeping security crackdown already in place .
China is at pains to avoid any shows of defiance by pro-Tibet independence groups that could embarrass the government before a worldwide audience .

Washington will sell $ 90 million worth of anti-ship missiles to Taiwan , ending what some analysts said has been a U.S. freeze on arms sales that was designed to ease cross-strait tension between China and Taiwan .
The Department of Defense has given the go - ahead for the purchase of 60 Harpoon Air Launch missiles made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. for delivery in 2009 , Taiwan ’s Central News Agency reported Wednesday .
The announcement comes at a time of improved relations between China and Taiwan .
Since taking office in May , Taiwanese President Ma Ying - jeou has pledged to improve economic and political relations with China even as he has promised to maintain the island ’s defense capabilities .
The Harpoon missile deal is in addition to a $ 12 - billion arms package sought for Taiwan that has been stalled for years .

“ This sends a message that Washington is committed to Taiwan ’s defense , ” said Andrew Yang , secretary - general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies , a think tank in Taipei , the Taiwanese capital .
“ And with some sort of framework for improved cross - strait relations under consideration , Taiwan needs to bargain from a position of strength . ”
Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war .
Beijing considers the island part of its territory and has threatened to use force if necessary to prevent the Taipei government from declaring independence .
Analysts said China ’s military , the People ’s Liberation Army , is spending aggressively to modernize , putting pressure on Taiwan to maintain a credible deterrent .
Ma also wants to send a signal to Taiwanese voters that he is paying attention to the island ’s safety and well - being amid concern that he might become too cozy with Beijing .
The Harpoons are designed to raise the potential cost of a Chinese amphibious attack and deter a maritime blockade .

“ But the fact is , unless these Harpoons have some sort of magical power , anything that costs $ 90 million is n’t going to dramatically tip the balance one way or the other , ” said Justin Logan , an analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington .
Taiwan has successfully launched Harpoon missiles from F - 16 aircraft , but the weapons are ideally suited for P - 3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft , designed to skim the surface before sinking ocean - going warships .
This suggests that the U.S. will go ahead and deliver 12 P3 - C aircraft tentatively approved in 2007 .
These are used in anti-submarine warfare , a perceived weakness in Taiwan ’s defensive posture , as well as in anti-surface warfare , maritime surveillance , naval fleet support and search - and - rescue work .
Analysts said the timing of the Harpoon announcement appeared aimed at lessening the blow in Beijing .
Some added that there has been no outright freeze on arms sales to Taiwan .

“ My guess is that the administration was waiting until the Olympics were over so as not to embarrass President Hu Jintao and the Chinese leadership , ” said Richard Bush , a Brookings Institution analyst and former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan , the United States ’ de facto embassy .
President Bush presumably used his trip to the Olympics this month to warn the Chinese that this was coming , analysts added .
“ Now that Bush has returned , my expectation is that we will see a number of sales move ahead to Congress for review in the weeks ahead , ” said Alan Romberg , a senior associate at Washington ’s Henry L. Stimson Center .
The U.S. is committed by law to defending Taiwan , although exactly what that means and how much responsibility the island bears is subject to interpretation .

One weapon system the U.S. will probably think twice about is the F - 16 C/D fighter aircraft , 66 of which were requested by Ma to replace aging F - 5s .
Their sophistication probably would elicit protests from Beijing that could increase tensions , analysts said .
“ It seems there is n’t urgency to move forward and perhaps even a preference to leave this decision to Bush ’s successor , ” said Bonnie S. Glaser , an analyst with Washington ’s Center for Strategic and International Studies .
The Harpoon deal also signals improved relations between Washington and Taiwan .
These were strained under former Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian , known for his provocative policies and inflammatory statements .

While the world looks elsewhere , Somalia is in flames .
The nation just topped a list of the world ’s most unstable countries by Foreign Policy magazine , and the United Nations has declared the humanitarian situation there “ worse than Darfur . ”
In the next three months the number of people requiring immediate food aid will reach 3.5 million .
Over one million refugees have fled their homes .
Due to a raging insurgency against the current transitional government – which has support from both the West and Ethiopia – Somalia ’s capital , Mogadishu , has earned the nickname , “ Baghdad on the sea . ”
In Somalia , there are no diplomatic superstars like Condoleezza Rice or Kofi Annan , who rushed to Kenya to settle its election crisis ; there are no celebrities like Mia Farrow or Jim Carrey to urge international action and awareness as they did in Sudan and Burma .
Instead , Somalia ’s crisis has elicited a collective yawn of indifference .
Just mentioning the country ’s name is enough to cause even the most dedicated diplomat or aid worker to throw up their hands in desperation .
Ironically , unlike the above conflicts , the current crisis in Somalia has developed in part due to America ’s " war on terror " and failure to grasp some of the nuances of Islam .
The Muslim world is not a monolith ; there is an ongoing struggle among Muslims with differing interpretations of the religion .
Somalia is a traditionally Sufi country – the mystic , open form of Islam distinct from more conservative interpretations as those seen in places like Saudi Arabia .
But in Somalia , a more conservative movement developed under the secular dictatorship of President Siad Barre and during the anarchy that followed his ouster in 1991 .
The resulting Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) implemented Shari ’a law , and although its stricter tenants were opposed by many Somalis , the grassroots movement gained strength because people sought order and justice in a country marred by starvation , warlord violence , and tribal conflict .
Despite internal differences in the interpretation of Islam , the UIC created a state of relative stability that led to the return of Somali businesses , united conflicting tribes and ended piracy off Somalia ’s perilous shores .
But the ascension of the UIC worried the United States , which believed the group was sheltering Al - Qaeda members seeking a safe haven in Somalia .
The United States intervened by backing secular warlords – reportedly some of the same individuals it had fought during 1993 ’s “ Black Hawk Down ” incident – against the UIC , strengthening , rather than isolating , extremism in Somalia .
Despite their ample firepower , the warlords were defeated by the UIC in mid-2006 .
In December 2006 , UIC extremists threatened Somalia ’s traditional archrival Ethiopia , which they accused of intervening in Somali affairs .
Already concerned the UIC would support a domestic ethnic Somali insurgency , Ethiopia invaded .
The United States backed Ethiopia ’s invasion and its ensuing occupation with intelligence , air strikes , Special Forces , and rendition of terror suspects to Guantanamo Bay .
An Iraq - style insurgency soon began inside Somalia , mainly drawn from UIC elements but also members of the Hawiye clan , the tribal base of the UIC .
These tribesmen believe the United States and Ethiopians are attacking them by supporting the Somali transitional government , run largely by tribal rivals the Daarood .
Because they are Muslim , they believe Islam is under attack and seek to defend it .
Somalia faces many profound challenges , but a recent ceasefire – which calls for an end to the insurgency ahead of an eventual Ethiopian troop withdrawal in favor of U.N. troops – has brought some hope .
The recent momentum in Somalia for a shift to religious conservatism – and sometimes militant extremism – mirrors similar shifts around the Muslim world .
However , with quick and responsible action , the United States can still help shift it back .
The United States should first pressure Ethiopia to withdraw and bring all Somali factions to the negotiating table .
It can also work within traditional tribal structures to reach out to Somalia ’s people , effect political change and distribute aid .
By reaching out to Somali moderates who would be happy to challenge the extremists themselves , and funding development programs that show a renewed respect for local customs and religion , the United States can help swing the pendulum away from extremists who preach that Islam is under attack from the West .
To do this , the United States must immediately change a failed policy .
Instead of effectively fighting those individuals who wish America harm , it has taken on the Somali people .
The United States should learn from its disasters in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan that using force to myopically crush “ terrorists ” at the expense of entire populations only strengthens extremists .
These days any attention given to Somalia is encouraging .
But to create a stable society that would alleviate the suffering of Somalis and address Western security concerns , something more is required : a true understanding of what has gone wrong and the will to effect positive change .
Frankie Martin is Ibn Khaldun Chair Research Fellow at American University ’s School of International Service in Washington , DC .
He did field work among Somalis in Kenya for the book Journey into Islam : The Crisis of Globalization by Akbar Ahmed ( Brookings , 2007 ) .

Update : Commodore BASIC as a Scripting Language for UNIX and Windows – now Open Source
Recently , we reconstructed a perfect copy of Apple I BASIC , the first piece of software Apple ever sold – in 1976 .
Now it is time to make something useful out of it .
Would n’t it be nice if you could use Apple I BASIC to replace , say , Perl ?
Would n’t it be nice if you could do this :
$ cat reverse .bas #!/usr/bin/apple1basic
10 DIM A$ ( 100 ) 20 INPUT A$ 30 FOR I = LEN ( A$ ) TO 1 STEP -1 40 PRINT A$( I , I ) ; 50 NEXT I 60 PRINT 70 END $ chmod a+x reverse.bas $ echo MICHAEL STEIL | ./reverse.bas LIETS LEAHCIM $
Here is Apple I BASIC as a scripting language for Mac OS X Intel :
apple1basic_osx.zip
Just yet another Apple I emulator for Mac ?
No , it is not .
There are some very important differences :
The “ apple1basic ” executable is a statically recompiled version of the original binary .
All code is running natively .
“ apple1basic ” plugs right into UNIX stdin and stdout .
You can pass “ apple1basic ” the filename of a BASIC program to run .
You can run BASIC programs like shell scripts .
Let ’s play with it for a bit .
First , copy “ apple1basic ” to /usr / bin :
$ sudo cp apple1basic /usr / bin
Let ’s try direct mode first :
$ apple1basic > PRINT" HELLO WORLD ! " HELLO WORLD ! >
Now let ’s write a small program :
$ apple1basic >10 FOR I = 1 TO 10 > 20 TAB I : PRINT " HELLO WORLD ! " >30 NEXT I >40 END > RUN HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD ! >
We can tell apple1basic to run a BASIC program from a file , too :
$ cat hello.bas 10 FOR I = 1 TO 10 20 TAB I : PRINT " HELLO WORLD ! " 30 NEXT I 40 END $ apple1basic hello.bas HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD !
HELLO WORLD ! $
apple1 basic can be interactive :
$ cat name .bas 10 DIM N$ ( 20 ) 20 PRINT " WHAT IS YOUR NAME " ; 30 INPUT N$ 40 PRINT " HELLO , " ; N$ ; " ! " 50 END $ apple1basic name .bas WHAT IS YOUR NAME ?
MICHAEL HELLO , MICHAEL ! $
apple1 basic supports redirection of stdin and stdout .
Note that if stdin is a pipe , “ INPUT ” does n’t print the “ ? ” :
$ cat reverse.bas 10 DIM A$ ( 100 ) 20 INPUT A$ 30 FOR I = LEN ( A$ ) TO 1 STEP -1 40 PRINT A$( I , I ) ; 50 NEXT I 60 PRINT 70 END $ echo MICHAEL STEIL | apple1basic reverse.bas LIETS LEAHCIM $
Which brings us back to our first example :
You can even use apple1basic as a UNIX script interpreter by adding the hashbang as the first line :
$ cat reverse .bas #!/usr/bin/apple1basic
10 DIM A$ ( 100 ) 20 INPUT A$ 30 FOR I = LEN ( A$ ) TO 1 STEP -1 40 PRINT A$( I , I ) ; 50 NEXT I 60 END $ chmod a+x reverse.bas $ echo MICHAEL STEIL | ./reverse.bas LIETS LEAHCIM $
Some more programs
These games , written for the Apple I in the 1970s , have been taken from this and other sites and converted from tokenized hexcode into ASCII .
21.bas : Blackjack
aceyducey.bas : Card Game
bowl.bas : Bowling Game
buzzword.bas : Buzzword Generator
crap.bas : Crap Game
slots.bas : Slot Machine
startrek.bas : Star Trek
You can also download hanoi- apple1.bas , a fixed version of Amit Singh ’s BASIC program from his Hanoimania project .
How it is done
My static recompiler takes the Apple I BASIC binary as an input and produces a native executable .
This file does not contain the original 6502 code and runs 100 % natively .
On a 2 GHz machine , it runs about 2000 times faster than a 1 MHz Apple I , so it can run one 6502 clock cycle per native cycle .
( In the best case , an interpreter can only get up to 1/10 of an emulated cycle per native cycle . )
Accesses to the Apple I terminal ( keyboard and screen ) are handled by functions that implement a few hacks .
Depending on the program counter and the stack , I can discard some output ( like terminal echo , 80 column forced line wrap ) and redirect files and stdin to keyboard input , depending on context .
For example , if there is a filename on the command line , keyboard emulation passes these characters into BASIC , and adds the “ RUN ” command .
All following input will be read from stdin , and as soon as the code to print the “ > ” prompt is detected , the output handler quits the application .
Commodore BASIC / Microsoft BASIC 6502
I have done the same thing to the 9 KB Microsoft BASIC for 6502 taken from the Commodore 64 ROM .
cbmbasic_osx.zip
$ cbmbasic **** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 **** 64 K RAM SYSTEM 38911 BASIC BYTES FREE READY . _
It has many of the same features as Apple I BASIC :
It discards the banner and the “ READY . ” prompt output when runnig in non-interactive mode , accepts a BASIC file as a parameter , and can be used as a script interpreter .
But … why ??
I love the idea of reusing old code .
Emulation is nice , but it rarely integrates well into modern systems .
Most code out there has either a very lightweight ( or well - understood ) interface to the hardware ( like the Apple I ) or the opertaing system ( like Commodore BASIC , as well as all programs from the GUI era ) , so hooking it up with modern operting system services can work out very nicely .
Also , emulation of vintage systems rarely cares too much about performance any more , since it is usually fast enough , i.e. as fast as or faster than the original system .
But computers have always been slow , and running very old code can have the advantage of working with really fast software .
And yes , I think there is a lot of useful vintage code out there .

At the heart of Europe , police have begun fingerprinting children on the basis of their race - with barely a murmur of protest from European governments .
Last week , Silvio Berlusconi's new rightwing Italian administration announced plans to carry out a national registration of all the country 's estimated 150,000 Gypsies - Roma and Sinti people - whether Italian - born or migrants .
Interior minister and leading light of the xenophobic Northern League , Roberto Maroni , insisted that taking fingerprints of all Roma , including children , was needed to " prevent begging " and , if necessary , remove the children from their parents .
The ethnic fingerprinting drive is part of a broader crackdown on Italy 's three - and - a - half million migrants , most of them legal , carried out in an atmosphere of increasingly hysterical rhetoric about crime and security .
But the reviled Roma , some of whose families have been in Italy since the middle ages , are taking the brunt of it .
The aim is to close 700 Roma squatter camps and force their inhabitants out of the cities or the country .
In the same week as Maroni was defending his racial registration plans in parliament , Italy 's highest appeal court ruled that it was acceptable to discriminate against Roma on the grounds that " all Gypsies were thieves " , rather than because of their " Gypsy nature " .
Official roundups and forced closures of Roma camps have been punctuated with vigilante attacks .
In May , rumours of an abduction of a baby girl by a Gypsy woman in Naples triggered an orgy of racist violence against Roma camps by thugs wielding iron bars , who torched caravans and drove Gypsies from their slum homes in dozens of assaults , orchestrated by the local mafia , the Camorra .
The response of Berlusconi's government to the firebombing and ethnic cleansing ?
" That is what happens when Gypsies steal babies , " shrugged Maroni ; while fellow minister and Northern League leader Umberto Bossi declared : " The people do what the political class is n't able to do . "
This , it should be recalled , is taking place in a state that under Benito Mussolini 's fascist dictatorship played a willing part in the Holocaust , during which more than a million Gypsies are estimated to have died as " sub - humans " alongside the Nazi genocide perpetrated against the Jews .
The first expulsions of Gypsies by Mussolini took place as early as 1926 .
Now the dictator 's political heirs , the " post - fascist " National Alliance , are coalition partners in Berlusconi 's government .
In case anyone missed that , when the Alliance 's Gianni Alemanno was elected mayor of Rome in April , his supporters gave the fascist salute chanting " Duce " ( equivalent to the German " Führer " ) and Berlusconi enthused : " We are the new Falange " ( the Spanish fascist party of General Franco ) .
So you might have expected that Berlusconi would be taken to task for his vile treatment of the surviving Roma of Europe at the G8 summit in Japan this week by those fearless crusaders for human rights , George Bush and Gordon Brown .
Far from it .
Instead , Bush 's spokesman issued a grovelling apology to the Italian prime minister on Tuesday for a US briefing describing his " good friend " Berlusconi as " one of the most controversial leaders of Italy ... hated by many " .
It has been left to others to speak out against this eruption of naked , officially sanctioned racism .
Catholic human rights organisations have damned the fingerprinting of Gypsies as " evoking painful memories " .
The chief rabbi of Rome insisted it " must be stopped now " .
Roma groups have demonstrated , wearing the black triangles Gypsies were forced to wear in the Nazi concentration camps , and anti-racist campaigners in Rome this week began to bombard the interior ministry with their own fingerprints in protest against the treatment of the Gypsies .
But , given that the European establishment has long turned a blind eye to anti-Roma discrimination and violence in the Czech Republic , Hungary and Romania , along with the celebration of SS units that took part in the Holocaust in the Baltic states , perhaps it 's no surprise that they ignore the outrages now taking place in Italy .
The rest of us cannot .
There are particular reasons why Italy has been especially vulnerable in recent years to xenophobic and racist campaigns - even while crime is actually lower than it was in the 1990s ( and below the level of Britain ) .
The scale of recent immigration from the Balkans and Africa , an insecure and stagnant job market and the collapse of what was previously a powerful progressive and anti-fascist culture have all combined to create a particularly fearful and individualistic atmosphere , the leftwing Italian veteran Luciana Castellina argues .
But the same phenomena can be seen to varying degrees all over Europe , where racist and Islamophobic parties are on the march : take the far right Swiss People 's party , which on Tuesday succeeded in collecting enough signatures to force a referendum on banning minarets throughout the country .
In Britain , as Peter Oborne 's Channel 4 film on Islamophobia this week underlined , a mendacious media and political campaign has fed anti-Muslim hostility and violence since the 2005 London bombings - just as hostility to asylum seekers was whipped up in the 1990s .
The social and democratic degeneration now reached by Italy can happen anywhere in the current climate .
Italy has a further lesson for Britain and the rest of Europe .
Berlusconi 's election victory in April was built on the collapse of confidence in the centre - left government of Romano Prodi , which stuck to a narrow neoliberal programme and miserably failed to deliver to its own voters .
Meanwhile , centre - left politicians such as Walter Veltroni , the former mayor of Rome , pandered to , rather than challenged , the xenophobic agenda of the rightwing parties - tearing down Gypsy camps himself and absurdly claiming last year that 75 % of all crime was committed by Romanians ( often confused with Roma in Italy ) .
What was needed instead , as in the case of other countries experiencing large - scale immigration , was public action to provide decent housing and jobs , clamp down on exploitation of migrant workers and support economic development in Europe 's neighbours .
That opportunity has now been lost , as Italy is gripped by an ominous and retrograde spasm .
The persecution of Gypsies is Italy 's shame - and a warning to us all .

" So did you hear about Governor Spitzer ? "
" Yeah , Jeremy , I did , but I want you to explain something to me .
What exactly did he do ? "
" I 'm not totally sure of the details , but they 're saying he was involved in a prostitution ring .
So , he used some company -- I do n't know if you 'd even call it a company -- organized crime , some sort of group of people who charged money for people to use their prostitutes .
And he called them and arranged to have sex with one of their prostitutes . "
" So all he did was use a prostitute for sex ? "
" Um , yeah , I think ... but , like , as part of a bigger thing , so , different from , I do n't know , someone finding a prostitute on the street , which would obviously also be a scandalous thing , but , yeah , I guess . "
" He was n't making money from other people using the prostitutes ?
Was he involved with the financial matters of this prostitution ring ? "
" I do n't think so , no , I do n't think he was * running * a prostitution ring , no . "
" So what 's the big deal ? "
" Well , it 's illegal .
Besides being disgusting and completely at odds with what he 's always claimed to stand for in his public life , and completely terrible for his wife and kids , and , um , really illegal .
He 's being indicted . "
" For just using a prostitute for sex ?
You mean to tell me that 's illegal ? "
" Yes . "
" So , wait , let me get this straight .
If a man goes to a prostitute , he can be arrested . "
" Yes . "
" Well , what about the prostitute ?
How can she --"
" That 's illegal too . "
" Are you sure ? "
" Yeah , I 'm pretty sure . "
" But what about the hundreds and hundreds of prostitutes you see ? "
" What ?
Where do you see prostitutes ?
In the senior center ? "
" In the movies , there 's always prostitutes . "
" At the theater ? "
" Well , no .
But in the movies . "
" It 's illegal ! "
" I did n't think that was illegal !
I just thought it was something , you know , not good , but the kind of thing people sort of turned a blind eye to .
Everyone goes to prostitutes !
How long has it been illegal ? "
" I do n't know ... but I assume for your entire life ... "
" That ca n't be .
In my day , everyone went to prostitutes . "
" What are you talking about ?
Who goes to prostitutes ? "
" Oh , come on , when I was young , my father had a bunch of men over to the house every week to play cards , and I would hear what they would talk about , and they would always be very blase about it , they would say that when their sons got to a certain age , and they started getting sexual urges , they would just send them to a prostitute in the neighborhood and they could deal with those urges .
And the men would talk about going themselves too .
As long as you knew the woman and she was in the neighborhood , it all seemed perfectly normal . "
" I have no idea what you 're talking about . "
" You mean to tell me none of your friends go to prostitutes ? "
" Not as far as I 'm aware , no . "
" Well , that 's why I never got the feeling you could go to jail just for going to a prostitute .
How did they catch Spitzer anyway ? "
" The government was tapping the phones of this prostitution ring , and he was one of the people on the line . "
" So they just heard his voice ? "
" I 'm not sure of the details . "
" Well , that 's certainly unlucky ! "
" I 'd use a different word , but , sure . "
" Oh , then I think this will hurt his reputation . "
" Yeah , he 's going to resign . "
" Over a prostitute .
Imagine . "
" Grandma , I seriously do n't believe this conversation . "
" You just live in a different generation , that 's all .
And how much did he pay ? "
" Like $ 5,000 . "
" Oh , that 's ridiculous .
You can get one for a lot less than that ! "
Aviation Industry Continues to Explore Alternatives
July 14th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
Last Friday Tim Hurst wrote an article entitled ‘ Soaring Fuel Prices Spur Aviation Industry to Explore Alternatives ’ , wherein he focused our attention on Rolls - Royce and British Airways attempts to search for alternative fuels .
Though probably not entirely humanitarian in nature , it is nice to see another industry getting in to the alternative fuel game .
With the start of a new week however , I get to bring to your attention the efforts of France ’s LISA Airplanes and solar cell maker Trinia Solar Ltd .
Monday just gone saw Trinia Solar announce that it would provide nearly 300 photovoltaic cells to LISA for its
Hy - Bird solar and fuel cell powered airplane .
According to the website , the “ Hy - Bird project plans to fly around the world with a 100 % clean electric airplane powered only by renewable energies : solar energy and hydrogen . ”
Trinia ’s photovoltaic cells will be attached to the wing and horizontal tail of the plane .
According to Trinia ’s website , the cells “ will supply sufficient energy to complete the fuel cell power for takeoff and for on - board power supply . ”
It adds that the electric engine onboard the Hy - Bird will be more effective at higher altitudes than heat engines .
I had to ask a Twitter friend to ensure I got this right , but according to Kahunablair , “ gas engines depend on the burning of gas / oxygen mixtures .
Higher altitude = less oxygen = not efficient engines . ”
And though that has to be put through the “ 144 characters or less ” filter , the reason that electric engines are better at such altitudes becomes obviously clear .
Either way , it ’s good to see more and more innovation in more and more industries .
Here ’s hoping our air fares will drop sometime soon .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Using words like " misdirection , " " obfuscation , " " absurd " and " verbal gymnastics , " the Federal Communications Commission released its formal decision Wednesday ordering Comcast to stop throttling BitTorrrent traffic , a practice the carrier has repeatedly denied performing .
Buried in the commission 's vitriolic - filled 67 - page decision – which was announced three weeks ago and formalized in written form on Wednesday – lurks an open invitation to internet service providers to filter content .
In essence , the commission said carriers cannot discriminate against file sharing protocols , but they may act as a traffic cops and block illegal material and " transmissions that violate copyright law . "
The commission on Wednesday reiterated that Comcast violated net neutrality rules when it blocked BitTorrent file transfers .
In no uncertain terms , however , the commission endorsed throttling internet traffic .
Consider an excerpt of page 31 of the order ( .pdf ) :
" We also note that because consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice , providers , consistent with federal policy , may block transmissions of illegal content ( e.g. , child pornography ) or transmissions that violate copyright law .
To the extent , however , that providers choose to utilize practices that are not application or content neutral , the risk to the open nature of the internet is particularly acute and the danger of network management practices being used to further anticompetitive ends is strong . "
And if those words were not enough evidence of the FCC 's endorsement of internet throttling , blocking , filtering – call it what you will , the written comments Wednesday from commission Chairman Kevin Martin drive home the point .
Martin said when the commission decides whether an internet carrier violated net neutrality rules , it " considers whether the network management practice is intended to distinguish between legal and illegal activity .
The Commission ’s network principles only recognize and protect user ’s access to legal content .
The sharing of illegal content , such as child pornography or content that does not have the appropriate copyright , is not protected by our principles .
Similarly , applications that are intended to harm the network are not protected . "
Still , network - level filtering technology is n't ready for prime time .
It 's emerging and being endorsed by Hollywood and internet carriers whose willingness to block content is already known .
Most of the nation 's largest internet carriers , in a recent deal with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , have already removed from their servers web sites hosting child pornography and have begun filtering smut from Usenet news groups via hash - marking technology or shuttering the groups altogether .
What 's more , at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January , representatives from NBC , Microsoft , digital filtering companies and AT&T said the climate was ripe " to start filtering for copyrighted content at the network level . "
Internet service provider AT&T has been discussing with technology companies , members of the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America about " implementing digital fingerprinting techniques . "
And in October , Google adopted a copyright filtering system for its popular YouTube video sharing site .
Sony and Universal have begun embedding their music downloads with watermarks that can easily be traced via peer - to - peer file sharing networks .
Microsoft is betting on watermarking 's future – last year winning a patent for a " stealthy audio watermarking " scheme called El Dorado .
The FCC 's vision of net neutrality : throttling , blocking , filtering – call it what you will .

I ’ve decided it ’s time to jettison entirely the words “ Left ” and “ Right ” when used with reference to political ideologies .
I came to this conclusion after a very interesting discussion with my mother .
While we were talking about the military Junta in Burma , she let drop the fact that she believes that all tyrannies come from the political Right .
I was taken aback , especially when my mother explained to me that the Soviets , Nazis and Italian Fascists were all tyrannies from the Right .
I could understand her confusion about the Nazis and the Italian Fascists — after all , Jonah Goldberg wrote a whole book trying to educate people out of their confusion on this subject — but her statement about the Soviets perplexed me .
Further questions and answers elicited this line of circular reasoning , which I ’m absolutely certain is not unique to my mother :
All military dictatorship are , by definition , from the Right .
Socialism , which is by definition from the Left , is an economic and class theory that does not have anything to do with the military .
If it were properly applied , the military ( or the police ) would not be involved in a country ’s repressive governance .
If a country becomes repressive , it must mean that the Socialism has been wrongly applied .
And repression , by its nature , especially with police power behind it , is a Right wing phenomenon — with the Nazis as her example .
The fact that the Nazis were socialists was irrelevant to her , because they were failed socialists — they ’d moved right when they became militaristic .
Nothing I said about history and labels shook her from this circular reasoning .
Because my mother holds these beliefs ( and , as I said , I ’m sure she ’s not alone in them ) , the fact that American conservatives are denominated as the political “ Right ” is , to her , proof positive that , if Republicans become dominant , America will become a country governed by a military tyranny .
( And this , of course , is precisely what the hysterical “ Left ” keeps predicting will occur . )
I offered my mother a different way to view the “ Left ” and “ Right ” divide , and one that reassured her that she will not be hunted down by the State police for having “ wrong ” thoughts , a la 1984 .
I told her that it would be more accurate to define tyrannical systems as “ Statist ” — that is , they have political systems that vest all power in reside in the state .
Whether it ’s a military dictatorship , a religious dictatorship , or a Marxist dictatorship , individual citizens have no rights .
All power rests in the state .
Mom was readily able to acknowledge that this definition provides a unifying thread for repressive governments , whether one looks at Soviet Russia ( or Putin ’s Russia ) , Nazi Germany , Fascist Italy , Cuba , Burma , Argentina , Iran , North Korea , or anywhere else , now or in the past .
In each case ( and this again harks back to Goldberg ’s points ) , the repression arises when the state , not the individual , becomes dominant .
Power resides in the state , people must conform to the state ’s desires , and non-conformists are punished swiftly and brutally .
As I said to her , the state has no conscience .
Keeping this definition in mind , I asked her to look at the American political parties , Democratic and Republican .
Again , she was able to concede that it is the Democrats who seek to consolidate more and more power in the state .
They want to gather medical care under the state ’s umbrella ; they want to expand the reach of public education with mandatory preschool ; they want to increase taxes so that the state decides how money is spent , rather than individuals ; they want to limit parental decision making with regard to children ; they want to control what we can hear on the radio ; etc .
Although everything the Democrats seek is phrased in loving terms ( “ the state will take care of you ” ) , the fact remains that , by electing Democrats , people will cede more and more power to the State .
Envisioning this scenario , my mother also agreed that , once the state has that power , it keeps it — and it keeps even it if less beneficent people than our good , nanny - like Democrats are in charge .
Also , with the DMV as an example ( sorry DMV employees ) , she acknowledged that , despite the good individuals that may work in a government organization , large government entities such as the DMV are , as often as not , inefficient bullies .
Once I ’d wrung all these concessions from my Mom , I dragged her over to the Republican side of things :
While Republicans may pine for old - fashioned morality , and while a lot of Republican Congresspeople have distinguished themselves by being pigs at the taxpayer trough , the purer form of Conservatism is obsessed with less government , not more .
It wants lower taxes ; less government involvement in education and family matters ; more market freedom for decisions about insurance and retirement ; and free speech on the radios , just to name a few issues .
Conservatives want to contract the power of the Federal government , not expand it , because they have recognized that tyrannies , regardless of the political ideology that powers them , are Statist .
Republicans , I said , are Individualists .
Given the opportunity to shape this country ’s politics , they are the ones who are least likely ones to lead America into the tyrannical , militaristic regime she fears .
It was quite an amazing conversation because , by the end , she really grasped the difference between Left and Right .
Right is not Nazis and Fascists and failed Communist states .
In America , Right is about individual rights , and Left is about Statism — and it is Statism that , when it runs amok , is dangerous .
Anyway , because of the fact that this type of confusion has poisoned the meaning of these commonly used political terms , I think it ’s more accurate to describe the two American ideologies as Statist and Individualist — and I know on which side of the political aisle I want to reside .
UPDATE : My thoughts on this subject have been affected by growing up with an ex-Communist father ( who voted for Reagan ) , by all the reading I ’ve done lately and , especially , by Jonah Goldberg ’s book .
What I ’ve since learned , though , is that I could have taken a shorthand approach to all of this .
Science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle , back in 1963 , created a chart that shows differing political behaviors and , having defined those behaviors , then places on the chart the various political ideologies .
This is a smart way to do things because , instead of looking at the way in which any given ideologue defines and boasts about his politics ( Soviets loved to talk about “ freedom ” ) , it looks at where those ideologies actually fit in a behavioral chart .
Enjoy the chart , but do n’t take the wiki article too seriously .
Mr. Pournelle has tried to correct errors there , and been rebuffed .
Apparently the wiki editors think they understand his theory better than he does .
Mr. Pournelle blogs here , putting up links to articles and blogs that interest him .

LTK GUI for the Sudoku solver 2008-08-08
My original plan , when I created this blog , was to evaluate several GUI toolkits for Common Lisp and write about that , but I did n’t find the time for it .
Now LTK is a really simple , small library and so I was able to learn it quickly and now I made a GUI for my Sudoku solver from the previous post with it .
[ I ’ve posted a screenshot . ]
So here ’s the code :
( in - package #:sudoku - gui ) ( defun main ( ) ( let ( ( * wish-args * '( " - name " " CL - Sudoku " ) ) ) ( with - ltk ( ) ( let* ( (f ( make - instance ' frame ) ) ( puzzle - frame ( make - instance ' frame : master f ) ) ( button - frame ( make - instance ' frame : master f ) ) ( fields ( make - array ' ( 9 9 ) ) ) ( clear - button ( make - instance ' button : master button - frame : text " Clear " : command ( lambda ( ) ( update - fields ( make - array ' ( 9 9 ) : initial - element " " ) fields ) ) ) ) ( solve - button ( make - instance ' button : master button - frame : text " Solve " : command ( lambda ( ) ( update - fields ( solve - puzzle fields ) fields ) ) ) ) ) ( pack f ) ( pack puzzle - frame ) ( pack button - frame ) ( dotimes ( row 3 ) ( dotimes ( col 3 ) ( let ( ( box ( make - box row col puzzle - frame fields ) ) ) ( grid box row col ) ) ) ) ( pack clear - button : side : left ) ( pack solve - button : side :left ) ) ) ) ) ( defun update - fields ( array fields ) ( dotimes ( row 9 ) ( dotimes ( col 9 ) ( setf ( text ( aref fields row col ) ) ( aref array row col ) ) ) ) ) ( defun make - box ( row col frame fields ) ( let ( ( box ( make - instance ' labelframe : master fram e : text " " ) ) ) ( dotimes ( inner - row 3 ) ( dotimes ( inner - col 3 ) ( let ( ( field ( make - instance ' spinbox : master box : width 1 : relief " solid " : values " [ list {} 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] " : wrap t ) ) ) ( grid field inner - row inner-col ) ( setf ( aref fields (+ inner - row ( * row 3 ) ) (+ inner-col (* col 3 ) ) ) field ) ) ) ) box ) ) ( defun field - val ( field ) ( let ( ( str ( text field ) ) ) ( and ( plusp ( length str ) ) ( digit - char -p ( char str 0 ) ) ) ) ) ( defun solve - puzzle ( fields ) ( let ( ( array ( make - array ' ( 9 9 ) : initial - element nil ) ) ) ( dotimes ( row 9 ) ( dotimes ( col 9 ) ( setf ( aref array row col ) ( field - val ( aref fields row col ) ) ) ) ) ( solve - array array t ) ) )
What happens when you change the wording of the original Declaration of Independence very slightly ?
In particular , if we change “ King of Great Britain ” to “ King of the United States of America , George W. Bush ” does the document still make sense ?
Let ’s see [ note , anything you see in brackets is me adding an incident to support the claim ] .
Declaration of Independence 2.0
“ When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature ’s God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government .
The history of the present King of Great Britain King of the United States of America , George W. Bush is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States .
To prove this , let the Facts be submitted to a candid world .
He has refused his Assent to Laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good [ Bush vetoes children ’s health insurance bill ] .
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them [ federal raids on state approved medical marijuana operations in California ] .
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people , unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature , a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only [ Republicans intimidating voters to stay away from voting booths ] .
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual , uncomfortable , and distant from the depository of their Public Records , for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures [ telecom immunity , commutation of Scooter Libby , continued approval of war spending bills and vetoes of timelines ] .
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly , for opposing with manly firmness of his invasions on the rights of the people [ Attorneys fired for not agreeing with Bush , the power to declare war lies in the Congress , not the executive branch ] .
He has refused for a long time , after such dissolutions , to cause others to be elected , whereby the Legislative Powers , incapable of Annihilation , have returned to the People at large for their exercise ; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without , and convulsions within .
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States ; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners ; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither , and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands [ Bush expands immigration checks ] .
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers .
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices , and the amount and payment of their salaries .
He has erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance .
[ Patriot Act , warrantless wire - tapping , Department of Homeland Security ]
He has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures [ illegal wars ] .
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power [ unconstitutional Guantanamo trials , majority of Americans are opposed to Iraq War ] .
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation :
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us [ Department of Homeland Security ] :
For protecting them , by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States :
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world [ Cuban embargo ] :
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent [ war spending for a war the public does not consent to , the economic stimulus checks which are simply an early refund ( so you may owe taxes next year ) ] :
For depriving us in many cases , of the benefit of Trial by Jury [ false accusations of terrorism lead to illegal detainment ] :
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences [ 27,000 people held in secret overseas prisons ] :
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province , establishing therein an Arbitrary government , and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies
For taking away our Charters , abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments [ the Dick Cheney branch ] :
For suspending our own Legislatures , and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever [ Bush believes he can sidestep wiretapping laws ] .
He has abdicated Government here , by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us [ Executive Order : Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq which criminalizes anti-war protests .
He has plundered our seas , ravaged our coasts , burnt our towns , and destroyed the lives of our people [ Bush has had a constant negative impact on the environment ] .
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death , desolation , and tyranny , already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages , and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation [ private contractors outnumber U.S. troops in Iraq ] .
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country , to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren , or to fall themselves by their Hands .
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us , and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers , the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare , is an undistinguished destruction of all ages , sexes and conditions .
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms :
Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people .
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British American brethren .
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us .
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here .
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity , and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations , which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence .
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity .
We must , therefore , acquiesce in the necessity , which denounces our Separation , and hold them , as we hold the rest of mankind , Enemies in War , in Peace Friends .
We , therefore , the Representatives of the united States of America , in General Congress , Assembled , appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions , do , in the Name , and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies , solemnly publish and declare , That these united Colonies are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States , that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British American Crown , and that all political connection between them and the Federal State of Great Britain , is and ought to be totally dissolved ; and that as Free and Independent States , they have full Power to levy War , conclude Peace , contract Alliances , establish Commerce , and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do .
—
And for the support of this Declaration , with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor . ”
Nearly every single reason for the original Declaration of Independence from the United Kingdom holds true today .
There can be only one true patriotic move , declare independence from King George W. Bush and his henchman in the executive branch .
Today , as we celebrate this country ’s birth we must move forward and yet again renew the Tree of Liberty .
The current federal government of these United States of America through its criminal negligence , corrupt conspiracy , and open disregard for the law has rendered itself null and void .
The truly patriotic amongst us realize this government is now illegal and an enemy of the people and this country .
We all must openly admit and declare that we are no longer part of this criminal , blood - thirsty , tyrannical American empire .
To conclude this post , I will borrow the words of one of our greatest fictional Presidents , the great President Thomas Whitmore from Independence Day .
We truly live in a sad state when he is the most inspirational President of my lifetime .
Though he spoke of fighting to prevent annihilation from aliens , his inspirational speech holds too true for our modern struggle :
The UN 's nuclear chief today criticised the US for the delay in publishing what Washington claims is proof that a Syrian nuclear reactor was built with help from North Korea .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , was briefed yesterday by the US under - secretary of state for arms control , shortly before the director of the CIA , Michael Hayden , briefed members of Senate and House committees on the same intelligence .
" The director general deplores the fact that this information was not provided to the agency in a timely manner , in accordance with the agency 's responsibilities under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , to enable it to verify its veracity and establish the facts , " ElBaradei said in a statement today .
He was critical of Israel 's bombing of the site of the alleged reactor .
" The director general views the unilateral use of force by Israel as undermining the due process of verification that is at the heart of the nonproliferation regime , " the statement said .
The Pentagon released a video yesterday it claimed was proof North Korea had helped Syria to build a secret nuclear reactor and called it " a dangerous and potentially destabilising development for the region and the world " .
Today , Syria accused the US of complicity in the Israeli bombing raid which destroyed the site .
" The US administration was apparently party to the execution of the September raid by Israeli warplanes on eastern Syria , " a statement said .
The White House said Israel had consulted the Pentagon before launching the strike , but that it did not give a " green light " to the air raid .
After the Israeli attack last September , there was speculation that the target was a nuclear reactor , but this is the first time there has been an official statement .
It was also the first time North Korea has been mentioned in the affair .
The White House spokeswoman , Dana Perino , speaking after the Senate and House of Representatives had been briefed , said yesterday Syria had built the plant " carefully hidden from view " in a remote desert area in the east of the country , in breach of its international obligations .
" We are convinced , based on a variety of information , that North Korea assisted Syria 's covert nuclear activities .
We have good reason to believe that the reactor , which was damaged beyond repair on September 6 of last year , was not intended for peaceful purposes , " she said .
The White House added that the regime moved quickly to bury evidence of its existence , covering over the wreckage and constructing a new building on the site .
US officials said the Bush administration was putting the information out in order to clear the decks before doing a deal with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programme .
The video , made public last night after Congress had been briefed , is a collection of material from various sources , in addition to Israeli intelligence .
There is no tape from inside the alleged reactor , only two still photographs , apparently taken by a person on the ground rather than a drone or satellite .
This was supported by satellite pictures and graphs .
The pictures taken on the ground show an apparently empty brown - grey , building , but nothing that seems to indicate it is being used for nuclear purposes .
In the video , which shows the site before and after the bombing , the CIA claims that the alleged reactor is similar to one in Yongbyon , 55 miles north of the North Korean capital , Pyongyang .
One official said the Syrian plant was within weeks or months of being operational .
" This thing was good to go , " he said .
Congress was told that the reactor was designed to produce a small amount of plutonium , which can be used to build a nuclear bomb .
In releasing the video , the Bush administration is taking the risk that North Korea may use it as an excuse to walk out of negotiations about dismantling its nuclear programme , but is banking on any such action as being only temporary .
Under a deal agreed last year between North Korea , the US , China , Japan , South Korea and Russia , Pyongyang is required to detail whether it has provided nuclear help to Syria and other countries round the world .
So far it has failed to deliver .
A US official who had seen the video said : " We cannot move forward [ on a deal with North Korea ] unless you acknowledge we are doing this with our eyes wide open .
And we are going ahead with our eyes wide open . "
The Syrian government yesterday denied it had been building a nuclear reactor with North Korean help .
Syria 's ambassador to Britain , Sami al - Khiyami , described the video as ridiculous : " Unfortunately the scenario of taking and retaking pictures looks like what happened before the Iraq war , when the US administration was trying to convince the world that Iraq had nuclear weapons . "
In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , the Bush administration showed photographs and other material to the UN security council that it claimed amounted to evidence of Saddam Hussein 's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction , but the claims were subsequently proven to be false .
Joseph Cirincione , an expert on nuclear proliferation and head of the Washington - based Ploughshares Fund , said : " We should learn first from the past and be very cautious about any intelligence from the US about other country 's weapons . "
Listen to this rant about the Supreme Court decision on Gitmo detainees and you 'll know the state of conservatism in this country
He 's like so many of them .
Beck :
This court has done some frightening .
frightening things ....
If I 'm president of the US , I would go on National television and say ---' ladies and gentlemen , the Supreme Court said that we do n't have Gitmo so that is over .
We 're going to release all of them , but I want you to know from here on out our policy is to not have prisoners .
We 're going to shoot them all in the head . '
If we think they are against us , we 're going to shoot them and kill them --- period because that 's the only thing we 've got going for us --- cause we can put them away and get information .
If we can't put them away and they 're going to use our court system --- kill them .
The Court never said we did n't have Gitmo or could n't arrest or prosecute them .
Maybe Beck could ask Bush why he can't get guilty verdicts with all the resources we spend on the war on Terror .
What an example of American thought he represents .
Mass killings are only predicated on what we ( US Govt ) think about them .
How nice .
It does n't matter if he said this on TV or on the radio , he should be immediately fired by CNN to start with .
What an embarrassment for them .
Here 's one CNN contact page .
Leave more contact info in the comment thread .
Bush was unhappy too .
Mr. Bush said he strongly disagreed with the decision - the third time the court has repudiated him on the detainees - and suggested he might seek yet another law to keep terror suspects locked up at the prison camp , even as his presidency winds down ..... Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said Thursday 's decision should not affect war crimes trials .
" Military commission trials will therefore continue to go forward , " Carr said .
Maybe the press can ask Bush and his PR staff if he'd like to shoot and kill them also .

For the first time since becoming the Democratic nominee , Barack Obama delivered this week ’s Democratic radio address .
He focused on the economy and the need to move America in a new direction .
Obama talked about the budget deficit and the Bush tax policies , “ In recent days we have seen two stark examples of exactly what ’s wrong with Washington and what ’s at stake in this election .
First , we learned that the federal budget deficit could reach a half a trillion dollars next year .
Eight years after we had record surpluses we are faced with record deficits .
This mortgaging of our children ’s future is a direct result of the Bush administration ’s dangerously failed fiscal policies . ”
“ Instead of helping Americans who are struggling we have seen loopholes and lavish giveaways for corporations who ship jobs overseas , and tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest Americans who do n’t need them and did n’t even ask for them .
Now Senator McCain proposes to continue these costly and unfair Bush tax policies .
He ’d continue to put special interests ahead of Americans who are struggling , while shortchanging the investments we need to get the American economy moving again , ” Obama continued .

Next he spoke about the connection between the America ’s economic woes and the Iraq war , “ The second thing we learned this week was that the Iraqi government has a $ 79 billion surplus thanks to their windfall oil profits , and while this Iraqi money sits in American banks , American tax payers continue to spend $ 10 billion a month to defend and rebuild Iraq .
That ’s right .
America faces a huge budget deficit .
Iraq has a surplus .
Senator McCain promises to continue President Bush ’s opened ended commitment to the war in Iraq while refusing to pressure Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country . ”
“ Our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in Iraq , even as our schools are underfunded , our roads and bridges are crumbling , and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring .
Now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that we ’ve spent in Iraq , ” Obama said .
We could have rebuilt American schools and roads and bridges .
We could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of American jobs .
We could have headed off $ 4 a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time .
Instead the president decided to spend our money on tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy , and a war in Iraq that has already lasted longer than World War II , and Senator McCain has fully embraced these Bush policies . ”
Obama painted a vote for McCain as taking a chance on a third Bush term , “ The American people are worse off than they were eight years ago .
Sen .
McCain talks about putting our country first , but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back .
We ca n’t afford to take that chance .
We ca n’t afford to keep running up record deficits while we favor the few over the many .
We ca n’t prioritize a misguided war in Iraq over the urgent needs of the American people . ”
This is the argument that Obama should be out there making every single day until Election Day .
McCain has no counter to this argument which is why he has resorted to negativity and attack ads against Obama .
The Democrats want this election to be about the economy and Bush , while the Republicans are trying to turn this election into a referendum on Barack Obama .
Historically speaking , when the economy is back , pocketbook issues almost 100 % of the time wins out with voters .
Obama would be wise to remember Bill Clinton ’s slogan from 1992 , it ’s the economy , stupid .
If Obama talks about the economy between everyday between now and November , he will win this election .
Suskind : White House forgery meant to solve ' political dilemma ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday August 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Author Ron Suskind said on Monday 's Daily Show that the real significance of the forged letter from the head of Iraqi intelligence revealed in his new book is not precisely who created it , but why .
Suskind told Jon Stewart that following the invasion of Iraq and the failure to find WMD's , " the White House orders the CIA to fabricate a letter from this guy Habbush which clears them of their political dilemma of going to war under false pretenses . "
Suskind explained that as early as January 2003 , months before the invasion of Iraq , " There 's a relationship to the Iraq intelligence chief .
...
We made him our source .
...
He tells us there are no WMD . "
However , the administration blew off the CIA 's reports on Habbush , preferring to believe the claims by a low - level informant , known as " Curveball , " that Iraq was actively producing WMD's .
As a result , once the war had started , Habbush became an embarrassment .
" We end up paying him $ 5 million and hiding him , " Suskind stated .
" He 's kind of radioactive as that summer unfolds and it's clear there are no weapons . "
According to Suskind , even though the Habbush letter was not released until December 2003 , it was created in direct response to Joseph Wilson 's debunking of the earlier Niger forgeries in July 2003 .
Not only does the Habbush letter tie Iraq to al Qaeda , but it also refers to an Iraqi purchase of uranium from Niger and its shipment across Syria .
As previously reported by Raw Story , the United States was actively attempting to discover , or even fabricate , evidence of Iraqi WMD's or uranium purchases throughout the spring and summer of 2003 .
The Habbush forgery appears to have directly followed the failure of those attempts .
" Is it weird that those things were in there ? "
Stewart asked Suskind .
" It 's kind of an overreach moment , " Suskind agreed .
" That overreach kind of revealed it to be fraudulent . "
Suskind went on to suggest that " the White House obviously is intensely interested , because there may be illegality that has constitutional consequences . "
" That may be the nicest way of saying ' impeachment ' I think I 've ever seen in my life , " Stewart replied .
" Quite a little circus we 're running here , " Stewart commented in conclusion .
" This does not seem to have created the firestorm that you would think .
...
It must be weird to learn about this shit and then think , ' Ooh , fourteen months from now , ooh , people are going to go crazy ' -- but then they do n't . "
" I 've done my part in this , " Suskind replied .
" The book 's all about the way America 's moral authority is bled away and how we need to restore it . "

Two criminal trials have collapsed at the cost of tens of thousands of pounds to the taxpayer after jurors decided to investigate the evidence themselves , sparking concerns about the prejudicial influence of the internet .
A judge at Newcastle Crown Court was forced to discharge a jury in a manslaughter trial yesterday when one of the jurors sent him a Google Earth map of the alleged crime scene and a detailed list of 37 questions about the case .
It emerged that the juror , hearing the case against Dale Patterson , 18 , who was accused over the death of the 71 - year - old taxi driver Raymond Quigley , had been to where the death had taken place , taken his own photographs and carried out research into his own theories about what might have happened on the night .

A second trial , this time at the Old Bailey and involving an allegation of child cruelty , was abandoned when it emerged that one of the jurors had gone on to the internet to search for information about the defendant , Jasmin Schmidt , a nanny who had worked for a celebrity .
In both cases the jurors had told their colleagues on the panel about the results of their investigations .
Judge David Paget QC , sitting at the Old Bailey , discharged the jury at the trial of the German - born Schmidt earlier this year .
Judge Paget said he had no alternative but to discharge the jury and order a retrial after one of the jurors had uncovered false information about other charges against the defendant which the juror had then communicated to the jury .
His comments can only be reported now because of reporting restrictions .
It was , said the judge , becoming " harder and harder " to try cases without prejudice because of the internet .
The judge said that at the start of the trial he gave a standard warning that jurors should not use the internet or make their own inquiries and went on : " The juror who found this report went looking for it in defiance of what I said . "
He added : " It is very unfortunate for all those concerned and for the tax - payer .
The chief consideration is that this defendant receives a fair trial . "
Judge Paget said he would be sending the file on the abandoned trial to the Attorney General , Baroness Scotland QC , who decides if anyone should be prosecuted for contempt .
Schmidt was convicted this month when tried on a third charge , and is now awaiting sentence .
Judge David Hodson , at the Newcastle trial , ordered Mr Patterson be found not guilty because of a lack of evidence , but made it clear that he would have instructed the jury to find the defendant not guilty anyway because the trial had been prejudiced .
Internet Service Provider XDSL has released a new Family ADSL service which filters out adult and malicious websites at ISP level .
According to XDSL the average age of an Internet user ’s first exposure to pornography is 11 , something which should be addressed by ISPs .
“ The ease with which children can access rated content is startling .
For this reason it is important that ISPs share the responsibility by offering packages that meet the connectivity needs of the average family while negating some of the content risks , ” said XDSL .
“ We have rated some 2 million adult and malicious websites that are restricted to package users .
Essentially we block adult and malicious sites at the ISP level , so you do n’t need to .
For the first time you can rest assured that it is that much more difficult for your child to access restricted sites unintentionally or otherwise , ” XDSL said .
Subscribers can also submit sites they think should be blocked allowing them to flag sites they identify as a problem .
The cost of the new XDSL Family ADSL package is R80 / Gig – slightly more expensive than standard per-GB ADSL services .

Reborn , born again , recycled , all seems the same to me .
There ’s a baby maker in Foutainhall , Scotland – near Edinburgh , who makes , well , um , babies .
Except her babies are not real .
For some , they are too much like real babies .
They are crafted in vinyl and have become quite popular with collectors and nostalgic grandparents , not to mention parents who have lost their little ones .
I ’m not buying it .
A plastic baby ca n’t replace a real baby .
Still , these babies are painted over several times to create the newborn skin feeling .
They have mohair ( not sure what that is ) and eyelashes ( I know what they are ) .
The babies are also weighted to feel as heavy as a human baby .
So , why do n’t people who buy these babies try the adoption thing ?
There are children looking for parents .
Can you say India and China ?
Why would anybody want a plastic doll when they could have a living doll in need of a real parent ?
Our planet is crowded enough .
Why recycle babies ?
Our last question is if these babies need green diapers or not .
Guess not , right ?

Germany has received container - loads of waste from Naples in Italy
The German city of Hamburg has lifted a ban it imposed on processing Italian hospital waste that was found to contain high levels of radioactivity .
The city said it had reassurances that the waste would be thoroughly checked .
A Hamburg spokesman said the level of radioactivity had been 80 times higher than normal and a costly treatment would be needed to make it safe .
The waste in question came from the Italian region of Campania , which includes the city of Naples .
Waste problems there have been blamed on illegal dumping by the local mafia .
Hamburg had said it would not accept any more waste from Campania until it received written guarantees from the Italian authorities that all rubbish would be checked thoroughly to ensure it was safe before being transported to Germany .
The transfer is now expected to return to normal .
The BBC's Mark Duff in Milan says Campania does not have enough dumps to process its own rubbish and the local mafia , the Camorra , makes a lot of money from illegal dumping .
Exporting waste to Germany , he says , seems one of the few fail - safe ways of dealing with the still unresolved crisis of refuse on the streets of Naples .
タダシップとED治療
タダシップとはED（ErectileDysfunction：勃起機能不全）の患者に使用される治療薬です。
日本では3つのED治療薬が一般に選択される一つのED治療薬「シアリス」のジェネリック薬品です。
このタダシップはインドのシプラ社で製造・販売されおり「シアリス」の後発薬として同成分、同効能で世界中で利用されているED治療薬です。
複数の後発薬が発売されていますが、どれも成分、効果は同じです。
ED治療薬は先発薬と後発薬と様々なメーカーから発売されていますが、基本の効果効能がある成分は4種類になります。
現在、化学的に承認されED治療へ効果が実証されているのは上記の4種系統になります。
そのうちの一つにタダシップがシアリスの後発薬として存在しています。
ど のED治療薬は基本的な効能は殆ど同じですが、成分と効果持続時間や服用方法に多少の違いがあります。
この点、タダシップはED治療薬の中では最新で改良が加えられているED治療薬といわれています。
ED（勃起機能不全）はどのような状態か？
現在ではEDの呼び名は普及しております。一時期はインポ（インポテンツ）という呼び方をされておりましたが、
インポの定義は幅広い意味があり、例えば性欲が無い状態もインポと呼ばれます。
ですが、狭義の男性器が機能不全の状態は正しくはインポとは異なる事もあり、ED治療薬の普及よりEDという表現が定着しだしました。
これは、性欲はあるが勃起が正常に「できない 」
「維持できない」という状態の方がタダシップのようなED治療薬を使用する必要があります。
つまり 、EDの状態とは、
①性欲は普通にあ る
②勃起は出来る、もしくは勃起は出来るが維持できない
③性行為中に萎（な）えてしまい、中折れや、中抜けしてします
④毎回ではないが上記の状態になる事があり、2週間以上、断続的に症状を感じる。
特に①の 「性欲が無い」場合においては異なる原因が考えられますので病院での診察が必要です。
お伝えしたい事としては、タダシップのようなED治療薬は興奮剤、精力剤の類ではなくタダシップの服用で性欲が向上する事はありません。
タダラフィルを知る事もED治療
タダシップは「シアリス」のジェネリック薬で、ジェネリックは同じ薬効成分を使用している医薬品です。
その薬効成分が 「 タダラフィル」になります。
特にインドの製薬会社では 「ジェネリック」が多く製造・販売されています。
タダシップだけでなく、 「タダラフィル」が配合された同効能の製品が多数販売されています。
ED治療薬の特徴
①効果保証されている薬効成分が4種類あり。（その内の一つがタダシップの主成分タダラフィル）
②同薬効成分を使用してるジェネリックED治療薬は多数あり（製造メーカ、パッケージだけが異なる）
これらの4種類の薬効成分のED治療原理は殆ど同じで、
①勃起をコントロールする酵素をバランスのよい状態に整える働きを促す。
②男性器への血流を良くする。
という特徴がありますが、タダラフィルは他のED治療薬に比べて副作用が穏やかという利点があります。
また、このタダシップをお勧めできるのはシプラ社（インドの大手製薬会社）だからです。
酵素 （PDE5）が勃起を収縮される。
EDを自力で改善できる？
EDが心因性のものであれば、ストレスや悩みを取り除くことで改善できる場合もあります。ただし、それには時間がかかることが多く必ずしも成功するとは限りません。
大切なパートナーとの良い関係を維持するためにもEDはできる早く治療した方がよいです。
このため、今すぐEDを改善して勃起力や勃起時間を取り戻したい場合は、以下でご紹介するようなED治療薬を服用することが最も効果的な手段と言えます。
勃起時間を延ばすにはタダシップ（タダラフィル）
ED治療薬には数多くの種類がありますが、タダシップには以下のような効果があります。
①勃起を収縮させる原因酵素を少なくする。
②男性器の血管を拡張させて血流を増加させることで、陰茎に多くの酸素や栄養素送り込み、強い勃起力や勃起時間をもたらす。
同様の作用を持つED治療薬にカマグラ（先発薬名:バイアグラ）がありますが、タダシップは比較的に勃起時間を大幅に持続させる効果があります。
効果持続時間が最長で36時間。
タダシップを個人輸入の通販で最安値のメリット
以下に示すようなメリットがあります。
--安い価格で購入できる
タダシップは、国内で処方されているシアリスのジェネリック医薬品です。シアリスは、健康保険の適応されない自由診療扱いとなるため、治療費が高額になります。一方で、タダシップはジェネリック医薬品のため薬の値段自体も安く、インターネット通販を利用すれば診察料もかからないため、シアリスと比べて安価に入手することが可能です。
--プライバシーが守られる
個人輸入であらばクリニックなどを受診する必要がないため、誰にも知られずにEDを治療することができます。
タダシップで男性力を高めましょう
タダシップは作用の持続時間がとても長いため、バイアグラでは効き目がすぐ切れてしまうという方にもお勧めのED治療薬です。ED全般にお使いいただけますが、中折れなど勃起の持続時間に悩まれている方には特にお勧めの薬です。
男性として自信を失いつつあるならば是非、タダシップから改善を試みては如何でしょうか。
個人輸入であれば非常に簡単に入手できるので、大切なパートナーのためにも是非お買い求めいただければと思います。

Sitting for extended periods of time causes the body to turn off its fat - burning mechanisms , according to a new study published in the journaland presented at the Second International Congress on Physical Activity and Public Health .
Researchers injected rats and pigs with a small amount of radioactive fat , then traced where that fat went in their bodies .
Among animals that were kept stationary , the fat was removed from the blood vessels in the muscles and instead stored in adipose tissue in places such as the kidneys .
Unlike fat in the blood vessels of muscles , fat in adipose tissue is not easily burned .
The researchers also found that after animals were kept stationary for several hours , an enzyme called lipase " was suppressed down to 10 percent of normal , " according to lead researcher Marc Hamilton .
" It 's just virtually shut off .
" Lipase is critical to the body 's ability to split apart and break down fat .
The researchers then followed up with a study on human participants .
They found that when humans were sitting , activity of lipase was suppressed .
This led to raised levels of HDL ( " bad " ) cholesterol , reduction in metabolism and increased retention of fat .
According to the researchers , the new findings suggest that merely exercising more is not enough to lose weight among people who spend most of their day seated , such as in an office .
Nor does using the arms at a computer or video game console provide enough activity to keep lipase active .
According to Hamilton , it is essential to actually stand up and move around .
" When we think about the postural muscles that are mostly in the legs and back , these are big , powerful muscles , " Hamilton said .
" We 're talking probably 20 pounds of muscle in each leg .
" People who spend much of their day seated need to get up periodically and " putter , " Hamilton recommended .
Researchers still do not know how long the lipase - suppressing effect of sitting last after activity resumes .
Mr Parvin said he picked it up because it looked like a fish An unusual stone that has been in a retired police officer 's rockery for 15 years has turned out to be an 80 million - year - old fossil .
Peter Parvin , 74 , of Maidstone , picked up the fossilised fish head from a beach between Pevensey , East Sussex and Dungeness , Kent , during a holiday .
It was then in his garden until experts at the town 's museum looked at it .
Dr Ed Jarzembowski , keeper of natural history , dated the fossil from the Cretaceous period .
Mr Parvin said : " I was walking with my son Simon and noticed this stone , thought it looked nice and took it with us .
It has been heavily weathered because it has sat in a rockery for so long and before that it was a beach pebble but it is certainly an 80 million - year - old fossil
Dr Ed Jarzembowski
" We always bring back a stone from wherever we go on holiday and we picked this one up because it looked like a fish head and was most unusual .
I did n't think any more about it really . "
It was only when a friend of Mr Parvin , deputy mayor of Maidstone and councillor for Leeds village , who works at Maidstone Museum suggested he had the stone looked at that the truth emerged .
Dr Jarzembowski , who examined the fish head , said : " I have shown it to other geologists and they are certain that it is absolutely a fossil .
It 's not a sculpture .
" It has been heavily weathered because it has sat in a rockery for so long and before that it was a beach pebble but it is certainly an 80 million - year - old fossil . "
He said that during the Cretaceous period , the area covering Kent , Sussex and Hampshire would have been a tropical sea .
Mr Parvin said he was not sure what he would now do with the fossil but it would probably stay at the museum for the time being .

MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) -- A Florida man used facilities at the University of Miami to run a multimillion - dollar Ponzi scheme and recruited school employees for the operation , angry investors and investigators tell CNN .
UM business school graduate Andres Pimstein confessed to operating the scheme , police say .
Andres Pimstein , a UM business school graduate , has confessed to operating the scheme in which some investors were promised returns of 18 percent , Miami - Dade County police said .
People across the country lost an estimated $ 30 million in the scheme , which collapsed this year , said Wayne Black , a Miami private investigator hired by one investor .
" Pimstein was able to convince a couple people there to use their computers to control the bank accounts that he laundered the money through , " Black said .
Pimstein , 48 , refused comment on the failed scheme .
But the FBI is now investigating the operation , Special Agent Judy Orihuela said Wednesday .
Pimstein had a joint bank account with the university 's director of contract administration , Alan Weber , according to bank records .
Black said investor meetings were held in a UM conference room used by Weber , and as many as three dozen current and former UM employees -- including two former senior university officials besides Weber -- bought into Pimstein 's operation .
" It was about making money , and then it turned into [ Pimstein ] being the center of attention , " Black said .
" Him being important to these people that were friends .
He played baseball with them .
He knows their kids , in some cases . "
Watch investigators discuss the case »
Weber 's wife , Mary , said her husband was a victim , too , and he no longer works for UM .
She declined further comment .
Do n't Miss CNN Special Investigations Unit blog
The university says that it's aware of the investigation into Pimstein and that " a few current or former employees " invested with the company .
" University funds are not involved , " Miami spokeswoman Margot Winick said .
" The university will cooperate fully with the investigation . "
Black was hired by real - estate investor Victor Gonzalez , who said he put in more than $ 3.5 million .
He said Pimstein offered him an 18 percent return on a short - term investment -- but instead , Gonzalez expects that $ 2 million of those funds will be lost .
" I want to believe people , " Gonzalez said .
" I can't believe somebody would go to so much trouble to try to take advantage of you . "
Gonzalez said investor meetings were held at University of Miami conference rooms in the building where Weber worked .
In addition , Black said , several university computers were used to monitor the bank accounts .
" One time we met , just me , Pimstein and Weber , at the University of Miami conference room , " Gonzalez said .
" It was specifics about what the interest rate was going to be .
They wanted me to be on the board of directors of this company . "
The business collapsed this year when Pimstein was no longer able to pay investors , Black said .
The operation Pimstein launched " grew like a virus , " he said , drawing in accountants , lawyers , business people and retired law enforcement officers around the United States before it fell apart .
" Some dipped into their 401 ( k ) for the quick turn - around , " he said .
Several investment groups besides the one at UM were set up , and those groups recruited new investors , Black said .
" That investment group leader thought it was real , " Black said .
" He or she got points , got a percentage off the top of all their investors so they would solicit more investors . "
Gonzalez filed a lawsuit against Pimstein and his company , the Bottom Line of South Florida , claiming that the entire arrangement was " a classic ' Ponzi scheme , ' a fraudulent investment operation that involves paying earlier investors from the principal of later investors , rather than from profits generated from real business . "
Pimstein has refused comment .
When asked whether he was a con man , Pimstein said , " I do n't have an answer for that . "
But Miami -Dade County police said that Pimstein admitted to the scheme in a taped interview and that the tape is now in the hands of the FBI .
" The FBI is investigating the whole Ponzi scheme , " the FBI 's Orihuela said .
Gonzalez said his biggest question for Pimstein would be , " why ? "
" I do n't believe you needed the money to do this , so why ?
Why did you do this ? " he said .
According to the lawsuits filed by Gonzalez and Jorge Azor , Pimstein 's former business partner , Pimstein presented detailed flow charts and fake invoices to would - be participants , telling them his firm would be selling perfumes and electronics to Ripley , a large department - store chain in Chile and Peru .
" In reality , Pimstein and the Bottom Line had no business relationship with Ripley , " states the Gonzalez lawsuit , filed in June in a state court in Miami .
The Bottom Line began as an accounting firm run by Azor , according to Azor 's lawsuit .
He went into business with Pimstein , a childhood friend and high - school classmate , in 2001 to sell goods such as perfumes and swimwear to retailers .
As the scheme was unraveling , Azor invested $ 250,000 with Pimstein .
He now alleges that those funds were wrongly converted to the scheme , and he accuses Pimstein of forging his signature on documents guaranteeing repayment to other investors .
Azor 's lawyer , Keith Grumer , said his client is cooperating with investigators .
" He does not seek a public airing of his loss , but does not want his business or reputation damaged by association , " Grumer said in an e-mail .
Gonzalez said Pimstein admitted to him the investment operation " was a scam . "
" He would have just stopped at nothing to get any cent he could out of anybody , " Gonzalez said .

Since June , the UK Top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum .
It turns out that Chris Brown 's hit Forever is a crypto-ad for Wrigley 's Doublemint gum .
I recently posted an item on how the charts included a number of references to trainers - a commercial battle between Nike and Adidas conducted within the lyrics of pop songs .
But in studying the words of all the hits , I failed to spot the significance of the chorus to Brown 's number .
" Double your pleasure / double your fun " , he sings - a line I should have twigged was from the Doublemint gum jingle used since 1960 .
Now Wrigley 's have come clean .
In a press release they reveal how the song is an extended version of a new jingle for their product .
" The summer release of Brown 's smash hit , Forever , which featured the unmistakable Doublemint gum jingle lyrics , kicked - off the creative partnership between Brown and Doublemint gum " , the company announced .
" Wrigley consulted with Translation Advertising ( NY ) to conceptualize and identify the artists behind the jingle remakes . "
Translation Advertising is co-owned by Grammy - winning rapper Jay - Z , real name Shawn Carter .
With another African - American entrepreneur , Steve Stoute , they started the agency to help companies reach young multicultural consumers .
The Wrigley 's campaign is aimed at the US market and includes TV ads featuring R&B singer Ne - Yo doing his own take on Big Red 's " kiss a little longer " jingle and country singer Julianne Hough proclaiming that Juicy Fruit 's " taste is gonna move ya " .
It is the global chart success of Chris Brown 's Forever that takes the campaign into new territory .
No -one knew the song 's secret until an article appeared in the Wall Street Journal .
Apparently , while recording the Doublemint jingle in February , Brown extended it into a four and a half minute pop song .
Then , in April , Mr Brown 's record label , Jive , released the song to US radio stations and digital download services as a single .
It crossed the Atlantic a few weeks later and has sat in the UK charts for the last 10 weeks .
British gum - lovers will not be tempted by the rapper 's jingle which is only being used in the US , and most Brown fans I suspect will be unfazed by the origins of the hit .
But the story does remind us how sophisticated the advertising industry is becoming in trying to make an impact with potential customers .
The Mother advertising agency , based in London , is using theatre and film to sell product .
The low - budget movie Somers Town , set around St Pancras station and due to hit the cinemas this month , is sponsored by Eurostar .
Meanwhile at the Edinburgh Festival , Pot Noodle : The Musical has played to standing ovations .
Behind the scenes , most of the production 's costs are being picked up by the snack manufacturer .
I do n't mind being advertised to but I can't help feeling slightly abused when I discover selling is being conducted only with my subconscious .
Perhaps it is a legacy of the way commercial broadcasting has clearly marked out the ads from the content in this country , but I also find it slightly disconcerting when the two become blurred .
Sen . John McCain
John McCain 's personal fortune traces back to organized crime in Arizona , through his father - in - law , according to a report published by a multi-news agency team called Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc .
IRE reporters Amy Silverman and John Doherty , writing in the Phoenix New Times , note that the father of McCain 's wife , James Hensley , was convicted by a federal jury in U.S. District Court of Arizona in March 1948 on seven counts of filing false liquor records .
Hensley also was charged with conspiracy to hide from federal authorities the names of persons involved in a liquor industry racket with two companies he managed , United Sales Company in Phoenix and United Distributors in Tucson .
The umbrella company , United Liquor , at that time held a monopoly in Arizona , organized and managed by Kemper Marley , who was accused of mob ties by a reporter who was murdered in 1977 .
Silverman and Doherty report that by 1955 , Hensley had launched a Budweiser distributorship in Phoenix , " a franchise reportedly bestowed upon him by Marley , who was never indicted in the 1948 liquor - law - violation case – or a subsequent one – despite his controlling role in the liquor distribution businesses . "

According to Marley 's longtime public relations man , Al Lizanetz , the Marley liquor empire was founded by the Bronfman family dynasty of Canada which operated Allied Finance Company , Northern Export Company and Distillers Corporation – the Seagrams , Ltd. empire .
As chronicled by the " Rumrunners and Prohibition " video shown popularly on the History Channel , during the 1920s , the Bronfman family made millions in bootlegging , accounting for half the illegal liquor crossing the border , working in a profitable distribution deal with the infamous mobster Meyer Lansky , who later moved on to establish the crime syndicates in the casinos of Havana , Cuba , in the 1940s and 50s .
Arizona in the 1970s drew a " who 's who " of organized crime figures seeking to retire in the sun , including Rochester , N.Y. , mob boss Joe Bonanno , who spent his last days along the Lake Havasu shores and in a quiet home in Tucson .
In 1977 , after Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles was killed when his car was blown up by the mob in a parking lot , a team of 36 journalists from 27 news organizations , known as IRE , published an 80,000 word 23 - part series on organized crime in Arizona .
Dan Nowicki and Bill Muller , reporting in the Arizona Republic March 1 , 2007 , documented that in 1953 , Hensley was again charged with falsifying records at Marley 's liquor firms .
Hensley was found not guilty after being defended by William Rehnquist , the future chief justice of the Supreme Court , Nowicki and Muller wrote .
In 2000 , Hensley , then 80 years old , still controlled the Budweiser distributorship valued as a $ 200 million - a- year business , with annual sales of more than 20 million cases of beer .
On Feb. 17 , 2000 , Pat Flannery reported in the Arizona Republic that Hensley 's beer - distribution empire was the fifth largest in the nation , " a Budweiser franchise whose bigwigs hold the No. 2 spot on Sen. John McCain 's all - time career list of corporate donors . "
RELATED : Did fake signatures get Obama on Indiana ballot ?
Since 1982 , according to the Center for Public Integrity , Hensley & Co. officials have pumped $ 80,000 into the campaigns of McCain , Flannery wrote .
More than a quarter of that has been donated since 1997 .
Flannery further reported that in 2000 , Cindy Hensley McCain , the senator 's wife , held a 37.18 percent financial interest in her father 's Budweiser distributorship , although she was not involved in day - to - day operations .
The McCain 's four children held a combined 23.55 percent interest , though their interests were at that time held in trust .
Arizona crime connections again surfaced in the 1980s when McCain was implicated as one of the five U.S. senators named in the " Keating Five " scandal .
Charles Keating Jr. and his associates paid McCain some $ 112,000 in political campaign contributions between 1982 and 1987 , while Keating was organizing a massive real estate fraud in the then FDIC federally insured Lincoln Savings and Loan Association .
In April 1986 , McCain 's wife and father - in - law also invested $ 359,000 in a Keating shopping center , before the savings and loan scandal broke .
Keating was sent to prison under civil racketeering and fraud charges for the $ 1.1 billion loss the investment scheme cost the public , although McCain and the other U.S. senators involved managed to avoid charges in the Senate , with McCain receiving only an Ethics Committee rebuke for exercising " poor judgment . "
Even today , McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign staff includes several prominent lobbyists , despite the senator 's claim to be a campaign reform crusader whose goal is to take money out of politics .
WND previously reported McCain 's 2000 and 2008 campaign manager Rick Davis took a six - figure salary as president of the Soros - funded Reform Institute in the intervening years and managed his own lobby firm of Davis , Manafort & Freeman in Alexandria , Va. , operating at the same building in a suite down the hall from the Reform Institute .
In 2003 and 2004 , Davis apparently solicited CSC Holdings , a subsidiary of the Cablevision Systems Corporation , headed by Charles F. Dolan , to make two separate $ 100,000 contributions to the Reform Institute .
In between the two separate $ 100,000 contributions Cablevision made to the Reform Institute , McCain , then chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee , wrote a letter to the Federal Communications Commission supporting Cablevision 's desire to continue packaging customer TV programming in a manner more profitable to Cablevision .
In this period of time , McCain worked with Vicki Iseman , a lobbyist representing telecommunications companies , including Cablevision .
WND also reported Davis arranged a 2006 meeting with Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska in Davos , Switzerland , a close supporter of Russian president Vladimir Putin .
McCain repeatedly has voiced opposition to Putin , even calling on President Bush to suspend Russia 's membership in the Group of Eight .
In 2007 , the U.S. State Department cancelled Deripaska 's visa over continuing concerns he remained connected with the Russian mafia .

Before the Eternal September , but after the Great Renaming , I learned about sex on Usenet .
A few years later , on a Mac SE in a college basement , I met friends I still have today .
We " spewed " about our teenage lives in ways that would be familiar to any MySpace blogger circa 2008 , but that were radical , strange , and comforting in 1993 .
We made faraway friends , burned yearbooks to CDs and mailed them to Finland with way too many stamps .
We were the first Net kids , really .
In a way inconceivable in today 's Web - fragmented marketplace , Usenet was where you went to talk .
Conceived back in the idealistic , non -profit days of the Internet , it was well , it is , but it mostly was a series of bulletin boards called " newsgroups " shared by thousands of computers , which traded new messages several times a day .
On the text - only Usenet of my memory , nobody knew whether you were a dog , or a kid , or Finnishonly what you wrote .
There was n't the obsession with photos and video that overruns today 's social networking sites .
Yeah , I know that sounds like " get off my lawn you darn kids " crotchetiness , but there 's something really nice about just talking to people and not caring what they look like .
Serious conversations went on in forums like comp.sys.atari.8bit ; more frivolous chatter appeared in groups whose names started with " alt , " a freewheeling free - for - all that nobody owned , nobody managed , and nobody policed .
It was a more innocent time on the Net , before most of the spammers , the crooks , or even the general public showed up .
People hewed to a loosely agreed - upon set of net .
manners enforced by self - appointed cops .
The society worked at least for a while .
Usenet was what the Web is missing nowadays : a genuinely public space , with unclear ownership .
While different people hung out in different groups , everyone accessed the same group list and there was plenty of cross-fertilization .
Control came down to a bickering cabal of scattered IT administrators who generally preferred to leave well enough alone .
Compared to chat systems like IRC ( and later , instant messaging and texting ) , Usenet encouraged thoughtful , long - form writing with lots of quotation and back - and - forth . 
Usenet has been dying for years , of course .
Some people date Usenet 's decline as early as 1993 , when millions of AOL users dropped into what was previously a geek paradise .
As the '90s went on , the eye candy of the Web and the marketing dollars of Web site owners helped push people over to profit - making sites .
Usenet 's slightly arcane access methods and text - only protocols have nothing on the glitz and glamour of MySpace .
The Web also gave Usenet a new life through the mid-90s as a searchable database of questions and answers , via DejaNews and Google .
But searchability also killed off some of Usenet 's social functions .
More chaotic and ad - hoc groups functioned through a sort of security in obscurity ; as long as nobody bothered to click on them , nobody would know what people were talking about .
With Google Groups , every word you wrote became enshrined and eternally searchable .
Meanwhile , as multimedia became popular over the past ten years , Usenet started to become a way for pirates and pornographers to distribute massive quantities of binary files in a decentralized , untraceable manner ; in other words , it became a proto -BitTorrent .
That was likely when Usenet became truly doomed .
Newsgroups had exchanged code along with text for years , but by the late '90s the " binaries " groups began taking up huge amounts of space and Net traffic , and since Usenet libraries reside on each ISP 's server , service providers sensibly started to wonder why they should be reserving big chunks of their own disk space for pirated movies and repetitive porn .
It 's the porn that 's putting nails in Usenet 's coffin .
AOL dropped Usenet in 2005 , but many other large ISPs kept carrying newsgroups .
Now major providers are dropping the full alt .
hierarchy , and even Usenet entirely , as part of a New York State government crusade against child pornographers who 've been using the alt .
binaries groups to distribute their wares .
Dropping all of Usenet to lose alt.binaries.videos.of.criminal.acts is definitely throwing the baby out with the bathwater , but at the same time I do n't have much pity for the binaries crowd .
Usenet is a hideously inefficient way to distribute binary file you end up making thousands of unused copies on various servers and encoding your files in inefficient ways .
And way too much of the binaries traffic consists of piracy and warez .
It 's hard to completely kill off something as totally decentralized as Usenet ; as long as two servers agree to share the NNTP protocol , it 'll continue on in some fashion .
But the Usenet I mourn is long gone , anyway , or long - transformed into interlocking comments on LiveJournals and the forums boards on tech - support Web sites .
Obviously , people lead lives , converse , and learn on the Internet far more broadly than they did in 1993 .
But give me a moment 's nostalgia for a Net that had one place to go , that everybody knew about , but nobody owned .

It is time -- arguably , it is past time -- for you to get your family and your wealth safely outside the borders of the United States .
America has become a police state that is moving quickly toward total surveillance and , in typical American fashion , the resulting society will almost certainly be the " the best and the biggest " tyranny in the world .
Make planswhile opportunities still exist to secure your wealth outside of the authorities ' rapacious reach because that door of opportunity may be slammed in your face in the near future .
It is not merely that government at all levels is starving for the cash that 's dried up from property taxes and , so , will steal and confiscate like a drunken highwayman .
Many factors point to rise of the Total State , which will grind up your freedom , your future and the lives of those who resist .
I read about 12 news sources a day , from far - left to the Religious Right ; month by month , there is a dramatic increase in reports of police brutality , government surveillance , crack - downs , the control of daily life down to the minutia of which oils you may cook french fries ...
And there seems to be precious little opposition to the arrival of totalitarianism .
Perhaps the flood of oppression is too overwhelming and has caused a general paralysis ; at times , that is my reaction .
But , mostly , I think people are either focused on financial survival or they actually applaud the Total State .
Even those who believe they believe in freedom are among the applauders because they buy the justifications being offered for the annihilation of civil liberties .
For example , consider just one of the incredible and successful assaults on the due process and liberties of us all ; in the name of defending women and children , the campaign against sex offenders has created a class of " untouchables " in class - free America -- people whom the government tells where to live , how to make a living , which sites they can e-visit , etc. , etc .
In the name of noble goals , the government has erased the idea of serving out a time in jail ( which used to be called " paying your debt to society " ) and , instead , established the idea of indefinite sentences and ' forever ' punishments .
But the establishment of this caste system is just one aspect of the wild plunge into tyranny .
What should worry you the most is that everything has occurred before the economic collapse of the United States , which I believe will happen in the near future .
( The timing depends somewhat on when " too many " foreign - held dollars are dumped back into America . )
I expect a severe depression to unfold over the next few years .

TBB 2.1 makes it easier for developers to apply TBB to new uses in their software , including GUIs , artificial intelligence , network input / output and more .
Among the enhancements are :
The Federal Government has today begun moves to develop the nation 's first men's health policy .
Health Minister Nicola Roxon has released a discussion paper and announced consultations will be held across the country over the next 12 months .
Ms Roxon says there is a need to raise awareness of preventable problems and address some resistance among men to seeking treatment .
" There are specific health challenges which we are determined to help men tackle , " she said .
" This is a way to engage men in looking after their health , getting them to visit their doctor more regularly , to encourage men to think about looking after their own bodies in a way that they often think about looking after their car . "
But the findings called into question the way the military handled the aftermath of the shootings .
For example , a key assertion of the news release issued by the military on the day of the killings was that “ a weapon was recovered from the wreckage . ”
But the military said Sunday that no one claimed to have found a weapon in the car or had seen a weapon taken from it .
Instead , one of the soldiers at the scene reported seeing an Iraqi police officer pull something from the burned car and then place it in the front seat of an ambulance , according to Lt. Col .
Steve Stover , a spokesman for the Fourth Infantry Division , which patrols Baghdad .
The soldier never said the item pulled from the car was a weapon , he said .
But the soldier ’s account nevertheless formed the basis for a statement in an initial internal military assessment of the attack , which said that a weapon had been pulled from the car .
“ We do n’t believe there was any cover - up , ” Colonel Stover said .
The investigation also revealed that the car had already passed through a major checkpoint leading into the airport , which required the occupants to submit to a thorough search for weapons and other dangerous objects .
As they had many times before , the bank employees then drove down the main civilian road to the airport .
But this time they encountered a four - vehicle military convoy that was not supposed to be there .
The convoy had taken the wrong road and failed to turn into a military checkpoint .
Instead , the military vehicles had traveled down a road that serves as the main entry for thousands of Iraqis who drive to the Baghdad airport .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain commented on Friday on the unannounced timing of a high - security trip by Barack Obama to Iraq , saying he believed his Democratic rival was going this weekend .
But McCain ’s spokesman said the Arizona senator knew nothing about Obama ’s schedule .
Obama said last month he would go to both Iraq and Afghanistan soon .
But his campaign has given no dates , seeking to cloak the trip in a measure of secrecy for security reasons .
“ I believe that either today or tomorrow -- and I ’m not privy to his schedule -- Sen. Obama will be landing in Iraq with some other senators ” who make up a congressional delegation , McCain said at a Republican fund - raiser .
McCain ’s campaign spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan insisted to reporters later : “ He does n’t know when he ’s going .
He ’s not privy to that information .
He was speaking in broader terms , about when Obama does land in Iraq . ”
McCain has been sharply critical of Obama , particularly for announcing his support for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in a 16 - month timetable , before actually having visited the country or meeting with commanders on the ground .
“ Sen . Obama is going to arrive in Baghdad in a much , much safer and secure environment than the one that he would ’ve encountered before we started the surge , ” McCain said , referring to a boost in U.S. troop numbers in Iraq that began last year .
McCain , who has made national security and foreign policy the centerpiece of his campaign for the November 4 election , has pressed Obama to visit Iraq .
Robert Gibbs , a top aide to Obama , had no comment on McCain ’s remark .
The Obama campaign has announced he would soon visit Jordan , Israel , London , Paris and Berlin but has made public only the barest of details .
McCain , a strong backer of the U.S. troop build - up that President George W. Bush launched in early 2007 , said that while in Iraq Obama should thank the top U.S. military officer , Gen. David Petraeus , for the current strategy and “ thank him for his leadership . ”
He said Obama should express his regrets to Petraeus for failing to support a non-binding Senate resolution last year condemning an advertisement in The New York Times by a liberal group that mocked Petraeus as “ Gen. Betray - us . ”
“ So he ’ll land in a very different Baghdad .
And we have succeeded in Iraq , and we will win if we continue with this strategy that we are pursuing , ” McCain said .
Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island were to be part of the congressional delegation with Obama .

Clearly Lehman ( LEH ) is on the brink of disaster .
I talked about that on Tuesday in Lehman In Deep Trouble .
On Wednesday , the Financial Times was reporting Lehman ’s secret talks to sell 50 % stake stall .
Lehman Brothers , the beleaguered US investment bank , held secret talks to sell up to 50 per cent of its shares to South Korean or Chinese parties in the first week of August but failed to reach agreement with either .
The South Koreans and Chinese walked away after concluding that Lehman was asking too high a price , said New York - based people familiar with the potential buyers .
Lehman declined to comment .
Fannie and Freddie Are Collapsing
Washington Mutual ( WM ) Is On The Brink
Last fall , in Coming Bank Themes : Whispers From the Confessional I shared with Minyanville readers that Washington Mutual ( WM ) had , to use the company 's own word , " opportunistically " moved a large portion of its " held for sale " mortgages into its " held to maturity " portfolio .
At the time , management suggested that the reason was because of the attractive pricing that it saw on the loans .
As I wrote then , and continue to feel now , I believe that the real reason was the difference in accounting for banks between " held for sale " and " held to maturity " assets .
Put simply , for banks , " held for sale assets " must be marked - to - market every quarter , with the changes in unrealized gains or losses flowing through comprehensive income – and I would note up front , not net income .
While " held to maturity " assets remain at cost ( or market value as of the day of reclassification , if moved to " held to maturity " from " held for sale " ) and , like other loan assets , only when management is certain of cashflow impairment , are they written down .
As I have seen in a number of second quarter bank 10 - K ’s and in financial media , it now appears that banks are moving other assets at a rapid pace from " held for sale " to " held to maturity . "
Specifically , the assets that banks moved most during the second quarter appear to be largely trust preferreds as well as CDO ’s from pooled trust preferreds issued by other financial institutions .
Beyond Fannie , Freddie : Three More Problem Children
While everyone focuses on Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , in my opinion there are 3 other possible disasters waiting in the wings .
1. Regions Financial ( RF ) :
The company needs to raise $ 2 billion , says Sanford Bernstein .
What are their options for doing so ?
They can sell debt .
The problem here is that I believe you could n't sell debt if you wanted .
The last reported trade in RF paper was 2 weeks ago , nearly +700 to the 30 year or close to 12 % .
The company 's preferred trades at 10 % .
And the stock is now a ' single digit midget ' near $ 8 a share .
So , as I see it , if you could get a deal done , shareholders could get a 50 % haircut .
2. Washington Mutual ( WM ) : WaMu trades as if it 's in deep trouble .
Its bonds trade in the 20 % range and no way can they issue a preferred .
3. Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) :
This is my favorite and sits as my ' most likely to fail ' problem child .
Its stock is now on its way to being a single digit midget and just stuck investors with 143,000,000 shares at $ 28 a share in June of this year .
I do n't believe many folks are willing to buy more at $ 12 .
Also , its preferred stock trades are a not awe - inspiring 16 % .
More Than The FDIC Can Handle
Poor , poor FDIC - ever the Treasury Department ’s whipping boy .
The latter gets to smack the former around like a badminton birdie because the FDIC ’s primary responsibility is to clean up the Treasury ’s messes .
And these days , there are messes aplenty .
It goes like this :
The Treasury oversees a regulatory body called the Office of Thrift Supervision , or OTS , that ’s tasked with keeping tabs on federal thrifts ( which are just mortgage companies moonlighting as federally chartered banks ) .
Until recently , the OTS was responsible for monitoring IndyMac Bancorp , which collapsed last month under the weight of misplaced mortgage bets .
The FDIC is now sorting out the mess .
The OTS also oversees such thriving institutions as Washington Mutual ( WM ) , BankUnited ( BKUNA ) and Downey Savings ( DSL ) .
Since the OTS ’s idea of regulation is apparently to wake up late , sip a latte and spend the day diligently ignoring the wildly unsafe lending practices of its member banks , the FDIC is up to its ears in barely solvent financial institutions .
The FDIC charges deposit - taking institutions fees about $ 0.05 per $ 100 in deposits to display the group ’s goofy logo ( which dates to its Depression - era roots ) .
This is meant to assure customers their money 's safe , even if the bank ’s risk management policies are n't .
Now , the FDIC 's challenge is to raise sufficient funds to cover the coming wave of bank failures - without putting undue stress on the already shaky banking system or igniting fears that it would need to tap taxpayers ' money to protect , well , taxpayers ' money .

The Federal Reserve and government regulators are largely propping up the lifestyles not of the middle class in general , but of various individuals who made choices that turned out badly and prefer not to live with the consequences .
These include people who bought houses they now can't afford , executives at banks such as Bear Stearns and people who invested in reckless institutions like Fannie Mae .
Only a small number of these people are blameworthy .
Most simply made reasonable choices that did n't turn out very well .
But people make reasonable choices that do n't turn out very well all the time , and we do n't bail them out .
What about the people who bought SUVs just before the prices of those vehicles fell ?
Should they get bailouts ?
Should the government reimburse everyone who made the mistake of " upgrading " to Microsoft 's Windows Vista ?
When you shield people from great risks , you deny them the opportunity to earn great rewards .
The culture of bailouts raises the price of risky assets , which makes it harder to get rich by buying them .
We all have different risk tolerances , so it 's a good thing that the market offers a great range of options .
When you make the riskiest assets less risky ( and simultaneously less lucrative ) , you reduce that range of options .
At the same time , you dilute the incentive for shareholder oversight , which leads to lower productivity , lower incomes and lower wages .
In the long run , that 's no favor to anybody .

Rick�s Picks Wednesday , August 6 , 2008 � Phenomenally accurate forecasts �
If credit is so tight for commercial borrowers , why are so many households still deluged with mail from banks offering credit - card money at 3.99 % ?
The answer came to light yesterday in news suggesting that the source of such loans is about to dry up .
Banks have typically raised cash for revolving charge loans by issuing bonds that as recently as March topped $ 10 billion per month .
The teaser rates to credit - car consumers varied from 0 % to 8 % and were usually good for six months .
Bonds backed by credit - card payments have always been considered very secure , since default rates were low and payments predictable .
However , both of these factors have taken a turn for the worse due to the deepening recession , causing the market for such bonds to wither .
The result is that their issuance has been more than halved , to $ 5.26 billion in June , and then to $ 4.4 billion in July .
Teaser loans have made it quick , cheap and easy for households strapped for cash to cover their monthly bills , and the skillful juggler of such loans would have had little trouble since the early 1990s borrowing , more or less in perpetuity , tens of thousands of dollars at rates of 4 % or less .
Usually , there was a small up - front fee of 2 % to 3 % associated with the loan , but the fee was almost always capped at $ 50 - $ 75 .
That meant a credit card customer with a $ 25,000 limit could have borrowed that sum for interest payments totaling less than $ 400 over the six - month life of the loan .
The rate would typically skyrocket to 15 % or more after the teaser period expired , but borrowers would have had little trouble rolling to a new teaser loan proffered by another bank .
Borrowers Trapped
More recently , however , the cap on the initial fee was lifted , so that instead of paying just $ 50 or $ 75 to get the loan , borrowers would have to cough up 3 % of the total amount , or $ 750 on $ 25,000 .
Many loan - jugglers undoubtedly have been trapped into doing this , having amassed more debt than they can pay off .
The up - front fee effectively raises the annualized cost of the loan to 6 % plus interest paid over its life .
The banks until recently were ready and eager to continue making such loans because of the high fees ; and , to the extent most borrowers were able to keep current on payments , the risk to lenders was manageable .
Now , however , with defaults rising and many borrowers presumably at the threshold of delinquency , bond lenders have pulled back sharply .
The day when borrowers find they can no longer roll their balances at teaser rates is coming , and with it a large wave of personal bankruptcies .
The best hope for borrowers in over their heads is that the draconian bankruptcy laws hatched under Clinton and signed by Bush are revised or repealed .
Congress , ever eager to be seen helping the little guy , is reportedly hard at work at this task , but clearly , time is running out .

New York City : Wind Energy Powerhouse ?
August 20th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
New York City is famous for many things , but wind power generation is not one of them — yet .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke yesterday at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas about his renewable energy policy proposal for the city .
Bloomberg expressed interest in off - shore wind farms , small - scale wind installations , and and tidal power systems , noting that some estimates predict that wind energy could supply 10 percent of the city ’s energy needs within 10 years .
Of course , there are barriers to Bloomberg ’s proposal .
Many people complain about the unattractiveness of wind turbines , and these complaints certainly ca n’t be ignored in such a densely populated city .
And at least one study claims that urban rooftop windmills are actually net carbon emitters .
But there are ways to get around these problems .
Off - shore wind projects could allay complaints about the ugliness of turbines , and vertical - axis turbines — which were not included in the rooftop wind power study — could be integrated into skyscrapers ’ architecture for maximum effectiveness .
Bloomberg also discussed the need for an upgraded power grid and better transmission lines — both key elements for the transition to alternative energy .
The mayor even had lunch with T. Boone Pickens recently to discuss wind power proposals .
Only time will tell if Bloomberg ’s ideas pan out .
But if they do , the East Coast may finally start catching up to the rapid growth of alternative energy in the rest of the country .

Christian Science Monitor :
The latest embellishments come from the McCain camp .
Cindy McCain has repeatedly referred to herself as an “ only child . ”
This week came news that she actually has two half sisters , although apparently she had very little contact with them .
The McCain campaign had also put out the story that Mother Teresa “ convinced ” Cindy to bring home two orphans from Bangladesh in 1991 .
Mrs. McCain , it turns out , never met Mother Teresa on that trip .
( Once contacted by the Monitor , the campaign revised the story on its website . )

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
For a while last year , it seemed the reports of tainted food , drugs , and toys flowing in from China would never cease .
First came the pet food scare , in which a toxic additive killed thousands of animals .
Summer brought vast recalls of lead - tainted Thomas trains and other name - brand toys , counterfeit Colgate containing antifreeze , salmonella - infected toddler snacks , and ddt - contaminated seafood .
In the fall and winter , dozens of patients died after receiving bad batches of heparin , a blood - thinning drug produced in China by US firms .
At the height of it all , President Bush offered lip service .
“ The American people expect their government to work tirelessly to make sure consumer products are safe .
And that is precisely what my administration is doing , ” he declared that July .
He then issued an executive order directing Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt to seek solutions .
Two months later , Leavitt promised that US agencies would pinpoint the riskiest imports and step up enforcement .
And then nothing happened .
William Hubbard , a senior Food and Drug Administration official who retired in 2005 after serving under seven presidents , had seen it all before .
In response to the 9/11 attacks , staffers at the fda — which oversees some 80 percent of food imports ( the usda handles the rest ) — had developed an Import Strategic Plan that revealed perilously weak controls on food imports .
Unveiled in 2003 , it was intended to boost inspections of risky cargo and slap greater penalties on importers of dangerous goods .
It would have cost a paltry $ 80 million , but the administration had already made its wishes clear :
No new programs .
As Hubbard recalls , then - deputy fda commissioner Lester Crawford “ told us there ’s no money for this , and the White House wants to cut it . ”
Hubbard realized this spelled trouble .
Chinese food exports to the United States have nearly quintupled in the past decade , from roughly $ 880 million to more than $ 4.2 billion , and the People ’s Republic , after Canada , has become America ’s second - largest seafood supplier .
China ’s pharmaceutical exports to the US have more than quadrupled in the past five years , and some 3,000 Chinese firms now sell medical devices in the States .
Such is China ’s reach that American consumers would be hard pressed to find certain items , including vitamin C tablets or heparin , manufactured anywhere else .
Yet the Bush administration , in its eagerness to expand trade , has relegated consumer safety to the backseat .
fda warning letters to companies fell off dramatically , Hubbard says , after the agency ’s general counsel , a Bush appointee , decided such letters should only be sent in cases where the fda intended to sue the firm .
According to the Government Accountability Office , inspections of overseas food factories declined by more than half from 2001 to 2007 , and fda inspectors routinely gave foreign drugmakers a heads - up in advance of their visits , a courtesy not extended to American firms .
In some cases , oversight has even been outsourced to China .
In June 2007 , responding to an epidemic of Chinese seafood containing carcinogenic chemicals and banned antibiotics , the fda announced that certain products would be held until cleared by lab tests , but allowed Chinese labs — notoriously unreliable — to do the testing .
Six weeks later , the Associated Press reported that at least a million pounds of the targeted seafood had hit American plates and stores untested , despite the agency ’s directive .
Do n’t blame the inspectors .
The administration waited until June 2008 — after legislators from both parties had given the fda commissioner a sound public flogging — to seek more funding for food safety .
As of this spring there were only about 300 inspectors , Hubbard says , to spot - check more than 13 million annual shipments .
Only a fraction — 7 percent of incoming drugs , for instance — got even a cursory glance .
“ We ’ve known for years this is a huge problem , ” he says .
Indeed , fda documents scrutinized by Mother Jones show that officials have long known dangerous products were entering the country .
They knew it because some portion of the tainted , counterfeit , or mislabeled shipments were being intercepted and tallied in monthly lists that get passed around the agency .
While the same products appear on the lists month after month , agency officials seldom warn the public until after Americans are hurt or killed .
For example , starting in February 2006 , fda inspectors routinely caught shipments of eels and other Chinese seafood tainted by pesticides , illegal drugs , bacterial infections , and malachite green , a carcinogenic dye .
But agency officials did n’t sound a significant public alert until 16 months later , in June 2007 .
That same month , the fda announced a recall of Veggie Booty , a toddler staple , because its Chinese - made seasonings contained salmonella , but the warning came too late for 50 Americans , mostly young children , who were stricken with the bug .
Similarly , Chinese - made heparin might have killed far fewer Americans had the fda devised a better way to monitor deadly drug reactions .
But because the reports trickled in months after the fact , the public was n’t warned until a spike in “ adverse events ” had left 106 people dead ; 71 had symptoms suggesting a bad reaction to what later proved to be a counterfeit ingredient .
China is n’t the only offender , of course , but the documents show it ’s consistently the worst .
This past May and June , for example , the fda rejected nearly three times as many food shipments from China as from Canada , even though Canada sent five times as much food into the United States .
As the world ’s top consumer of Chinese goods , the US has the clout to sway China ’s behavior , but the administration has alternately ignored safety concerns and accepted assurances from the world ’s fastest - growing exporter that it will clean up its act .
China has placed almost no environmental or safety controls on exports ; its food safety problems will cost $ 100 billion to fix , according to AT Kearney , a leading consultancy .
If anything , the Bush White House has put Americans at greater risk .
Its safety agreements with China tend to be nonbinding , says Tony Corbo of the consumer group Food & Water Watch , and fail to hold Chinese goods to US standards .
Food safety was barely mentioned at the US - China Strategic Economic Dialogue in May 2007 , according to a federal official privy to the proceedings .
( The subject was addressed belatedly at the next meeting , that December , following nine months of import nightmares . )
“ This administration is more interested in promoting trade , ” the official noted .
Consistent with that agenda , the White House Office of Management and Budget , normally slow on regulatory matters , took all of one day to green - light US imports of Chinese - processed chicken in April 2006 .
“ We are trying to open up our beef trade with China , ” says Corbo .
“ The Chinese always say that they want the US to import Chinese poultry in exchange for US beef . ”
The decision came despite unsettling findings by the usda team that had visited the Chinese poultry facilities two years earlier .
At one plant , inspectors had found paint from the ceiling “ on the table used for edible product , ” while workers at another facility wiped down meat - handling areas with dirty cloths .
Parts of a third factory , designated for sanitary operations , were contaminated with “ grease , blood , fat , pieces of dry meat , and foreign particles . ”
President Bush nonetheless presented Chinese president Hu Jintao with the new poultry - import rule during a White House visit last year .
Explains a congressional staffer , “ It was a goodwill gesture . ”
So I was taking a look at the Scala Array source code , as part of research for a forthcoming blog post ( coming soon to a drmaciver.com near you ) when I suddenly realised something .
Then I suddenly had a WTF moment .
The scala .
Array object has a method appy ( xs : Int* ) : Array [ Int ] , and a method appy ( xs : Double * ) : Array [ Double ] , and … etc. i.e. it has an overload for each value type and one for the reference types .
Something like this :
object Overload { def foo ( xs : String * ) = " foo " ; def foo ( xs : Int * ) = " bar " ; } object Overload{ def foo( xs : String * ) = " foo " ; def foo ( xs : Int* ) = " bar " ; }
Um .
/home / david / Foo. scala : 3 : error : double definition : method foo : ( Int * ) java .
lang .
String and method foo : ( String * ) java .
lang .
String at line 2 have same type after erasure : ( Seq ) java .
lang .
String def foo ( xs : Int * ) = " bar " ; ^ /home / david/Foo.scala:3 : error : double definition : method foo :( Int*) java.lang .
String and method foo :( String*) java.lang .
String at line 2 have same type after erasure : ( Seq ) java.lang .
String def foo( xs : Int* ) = " bar " ; ^
See , Scala varargs use Seq , so all varargs erase to the same thing .
So how the hell is scala .
Array working ?
Is it compiler magic ?
Well , sortof compiler magic .
It ’s a compiler magic you too can use .
Lets change the above code slightly :
object Overload { def foo ( xs : String * ) = " foo " ; def foo ( xs : Int * ) = 3 ; } object Overload{ def foo( xs : String* ) = " foo " ; def foo ( xs : Int* ) = 3 ; }
This compiles and works fine .
So , what ’s going on here ?
Well , although this fact is visible only as an implementation detail in most languages , the JVM actually lets you overload based on return type .
Two methods are considered identical if they have precisely the same ( erased ) argument and return types .
And although Scala does n’t let you overload based on return type directly , it seems it will happily accept methods whose arguments erase to the same thing as long as their return types do n’t .
This is a bit strange .
It has been five years since MP3 blogs - also known as audioblogs - first started appearing on the web .
In 2003 , a few thoughtful music bloggers decided it would be a good idea to complement discussions of songs on their sites with the songs themselves , which readers could download in MP3 format and listen to straight away .
Do n't just take our word for it , was the attitude - take the music too .
The trend built slowly at first - Fluxblog , Stereogum and Said the Gramophone were pioneers - and then , over the last couple of years , it avalanched .
Today , the blog index site Hype Machine lists more than 1,700 regularly updated MP3 blogs in regular use and there are certainly many more in operation .
All musical tastes are catered to , and the music , much of it brand new or pending release , can be taken for free , no strings attached .
This is not , you might think , a development the beleaguered music industry can be watching with enthusiasm , but you 'd be wrong .
An New York University study published in February , Does Chatter Matter ? , found that the volume of blog posts about a new album can significantly affect sales .
Many record labels now view the audioblog as a vital marketing tool , and a euphoric plug on Brooklyn Vegan is more valuable in certain cases than a five - star review in Q. ( ' Certain cases ' is worth noting ; most blogs shy away from the mainstream , favouring obscure bands whose fans will also favour less obvious sources of information . )
In contrast to their disreputable cousins , file - sharing networks , MP3 blogs do n't attract much legal attention .
No one has been prosecuted for posting individual tracks .
The most serious injunction a blogger is likely to get is a polite ' take down ' notice , usually for posting material too far ahead of release .
' In fact , ' according to Scott Wright , who runs the London - based blog Pinglewood.com , ' almost everything I post now is something I 've been sent or asked to post by record labels or artists . '
' I draw the line at whole albums , ' says Laura Seach , head of digital PR at Ninja Tune , an independent British record label , ' but if someone posts one track , that 's great .
The promotional opportunity is huge .
We run campaigns now trying to get bloggers posting about our artists .
You ca n't underestimate how important blogs are . '
Rich Walker , head of communications at the Beggars label group , has a similar view .
' With certain bands , we allow one track to appear in the blogs in advance of a new album , ' he says .
' It makes sense to send out the strongest one - we used " Fake Empire " for [ Brooklyn indie band ] the National .
The track basically ends up playing the role of a lead single . '
By earmarking specific songs for blog use , the labels attempt to control how their music leaks .
According to Walker , most of the ' better blogs , the ones with readership and clout ' , observe the rules of fair play and many sites voluntarily remove songs within a few weeks of posting .
But , he acknowledges , certain bloggers , particularly those with clout , do n't want to be part of a marketing strategy .
' All these publicists send me music , ' says blogger Jace Clayton , ' but that to me is part of the blind idiot - machine of the music industry which I wish to have no truck with . '
Clayton , who posts a range of esoteric music on his blog Mudd Up ! , is sensitive about the songs he posts and has made it easy for people to email him with objections .
He understands the artist 's perspective as he is a musician himself , trading under the name DJ / rupture .
Does he mind when other bloggers distribute his music for free ?
' I 'd cringe if someone put my whole album up .
But I 'm happy if someone wants to post my songs or mixes .
If I 'm not on the blogs , ' he adds , ' maybe I 'm doing something wrong . '
The legal area they occupy may still be grey , but audioblogs represent a happy medium for industry and fans alike .
The range of music available is marvellous , and yet there 's something hugely appealing about being able to concentrate in detail on a single song - ' to get close enough to see the fingerprint , ' as Clayton says , adding : ' Maybe the album is dead , but people love songs more than ever and hold them closer to their heart .
That 's what makes this pursuit seem worthwhile . '

Founded by Sean Michaels in Montreal , March 2003
' Every other site is trying to break the world 's greatest new band every day .
We 're just trying to find the greatest next three minutes of your life . '
So says Sean Michaels , 26 , who set up one of the very first MP3 blogs in Montreal five years ago .
Today , Said the Gramophone is a revered elder among alternative music bloggers .
Michaels and co-writers Dan Beirne and Jordan Himelfarb were talking about bands such as Arcade Fire , Beirut and Feist long before bigger sites and publications caught up with them .
Not only that : they were eulogising them in an inventive , literary style .
' Because people can listen to the music while reading our text , ' says Michaels , 'we can be a lot more free with our descriptions . '
The site does n't use advertising and is sponsored by readers through an annual fundraising drive .

This wildly popular music blog , loved and loathed in equal measure by Parisian hipsters , has become a phenomenon in France .
Its contributors have used it as a springboard for putting on huge parties and establishing themselves as international DJs , and the word ' fluokids ' is now used in the French media to refer to the trend of teenagers dressing up in fluorescent clothing .
' We created a monster , ' says Hianta Cassam Chenai , one of seven contributors , all students , most of them based in Paris ( see picture top left ) .

Most Dangerous Volcano of Kamchatka to be Studied
The Bezymyanny volcano Russian and American volcanologists prepare for massive studies of the Bezymyanny volcano , located at the Kamchatka Peninsula .
During one month a group of researchers will install special equipment on the slopes of the volcano .
The expedition is aimed at studying mechanisms of eruptions and other activities of this volcano , which is considered to be most dangerous of 29 active volcano of Kamchatka .
The Bezymyanny volcano behaves like a highly explosive substance .
The volcano erupts twice a year and always brings troubles .
During eruptions ash reaches 18 - km heights , and ashy tails stretch for thousands of kilometers .
All this is quire dangerous for aviation , since transcontinental air paths lie very close to the place , where the fire - spitting mountain is located .
The Bezymyanny volcano ’s ill fame started in 1956 , when during the eruption ash reached 40 km , and mudflows filled the Kamchatka river .

Most people agree that the majority of human beings are attracted to the other sex and gender ( gender is a social construct and sex is biological ) .
According to most statistics , only few people are attracted to their own sex and gender , which leads some people to ask why homosexuality , bisexuality or other queer kinds of â€œdeviantâ€ sexuality exists .
But the real question that should be asked is why heterosexuality exists at all .
People tend to choose partners with similar interests , values , economic backgrounds , social backgrounds , and religious beliefs .
We especially tend to select partners that look similar to us : people with the same attractiveness , age , weight , style and , to an increasingly lesser extent , race ( race is becoming less of a determining factor thanks to advancements in social logic ) .
Think back to most of the people youâ€™ve dated , hooked up with or hung out with ; most likely they were similar to you .
Study after study has shown that people choose similar partners , not opposites .
So why is gender and sex the one selection exception ?
Why are the majority of us humans heterosexual ?
After all , gender is a type of similar
mentality and sex is a type of similar appearance .
While Iâ€™m not an expert on evolution , I think that it must be some sort of freak biological adaptation .
Like those religious sects that abstain from sex , a species that was predominately attracted to its own sex would not procreate for very long .
I imagine that some mutation programmed our distant evolutionary ancestors to enjoy having sex with the other sex .
This adaptation must have stuck even as attraction to other kinds of similarities deepened .
Iâ€™m also guessing that another mutation decreased attractiveness to the same gender , which enabled the species to not waste genetic material , energy or resources .
It could also be the way that humans socialize , although Iâ€™m less keen on this explanation .
More and more we are finding that other mammals are not exclusively heterosexual .
Dolphins , monkeys and giraffes among other animals have same - sex fun without much thought .
Only humans seem to have social punishments for non-heterosexuality .
Mating and having children was extremely important to ancient societies because they needed fresh soldiers and laborers .
The authority to persecute those who prevented procreation was imbedded into religion and the ruling state .
Perhaps our ancestors were trying to socialize out the gay that threatened their civilizationâ€™s future .
Ironically enough , if non-heterosexuality is determined by genetic factors , they forced it to stay in the gene pool .
The historical gender ( social ) dichotomy between women and men created such a strange barrier between them that itâ€™s a wonder men and women were attracted to each other at all .
In the past , women and men have been kept in such strictly separated spheres than there was little chance for them to share common interests or activities , except for social class .
Women were encouraged to act like proper ladies while men could enjoy whatever pleasures they fancied .
Itâ€™s almost no wonder that in Victorian times , and much of history , heterosexual men didnâ€™t enjoy sex with their wives as much as with whores .
Through the cracks , indications of same - gender sexual relationships seep out .
Most heterosexual male - orientated porn today depicts the myth of the sexually willing females that draws on the male fantasy of a woman who is as sexually forward as a man would be .
Many , many women enjoy sex , but most donâ€™t do so in the same frenzied fashion often depicted in porn .
They seem to behave much more like the stereotypical sex - crazed man would .
And when describing how women act outside the bedroom , the leading man of the musical My Fair Lady laments , â€ œwhy canâ€™t a woman be more like a man?â€ 
Many of the traits that men want are those that would be more common of their own gender .
Similarly , the majority of the romance movies aimed at heterosexual females present men as sensitive , romantic , and gentle when they are needed .
The viewer fails to realize that a woman who was socialized to be all those things would fulfill their wants more completely than a man .
Then thereâ€™s the kind of male body that many women find attractive .
Most women like men who are slightly more feminine ( think Orlando Bloom ) .
Very few women prefer the traditional manly man ; I canâ€™t think of one woman who actually finds Fabio attractive .
Additionally , studies have shown that many women become aroused at porn that shows women .
Many of the traits that women want are those that would be more common of their own gender .
All of this begs the big question : why do the majority of us find each otherâ€™s gender so physically attractive ?
Why do we get hot and bothered thinking about someone with these traits more different than similar ?
Itâ€™s all a bit queer .
Most web hosting companies use either one of two operating systems on their servers .
Those two are Windows and Linux .
What is the difference between the two and how do they effect your web hosting ?
Linux is one of the most prevalent operating systems for web hosting , because it is inexpensive and fairly easy to install .
Windows is the other choice because they have world class support .
However there are a lot of similarities and a lot of differences in how the two operate .
There is also a difference in security between the two , and many times Windows becomes the target of spyware because of these vulnerabilities .
The first thing most people notice when they join up with a new host is the way they access the back end of their websites .
Many people are familiar with cPanel , which is available on all Linux OS hosting .
WHM , or Web Host Manager , is also available on Linux servers , but not on Shared Linux servers .
Windows servers on the other hand run Plesk .
The next thing that you may notice about your web hosting is how you are able to access and transfer files to and in the server .
Both operating systems have FTP access , but Linux is usually the only one that supplies telnet or ssh access as well .
It ’s not that Windows ca n’t do that , but it ’s very rarely offered by hosting admins .
Linux and Windows servers can both provide CGI and Perl , PHP and ASP , though Linux is the one that you find those on more commonly .
Both operating systems may also provide ColdFusion .
If you are going to run dynamic websites , you are going to want to be able to build and access databases .
You may be familiar with mySQL , or perhaps you have used Access .
If you are used to seeing mySQL and working with that , you have probably been on a Linux server .
Windows can run it but it ’s rare that you find mySQL on Windows and those servers are usually running Access .
Many people would say that Windows operating systems are full of security holes .
While this may or may not be true , the truth is that both Linux and Windows have vulnerabilities .
Security is an issue that you should look at on the web hosting administrator level rather than the operating system .
A good hosting company will work endlessly to ensure their server security .
Two seemingly small but rather important differences between Linux and Windows web hosting servers is how they write the pages , and whether or not they are case sensitive .
Windows and Linux servers will serve pages in HTML and Javascript .
However , Linux servers end name files with *.html versus Windows , which uses only *.htm .
This is not entirely important beyond what your preference may be .
Some people may site FrontPage extensions as a Windows exclusive feature , but some Linux servers will provide this as well .
The last difference , case sensitivity , is actually very important .
With Linux , file and directory names are case sensitive .
So if you name a file AboutUs.html , and another page in the same directory as aboutus .
html , you actually will have to completely different pages .
Your visitors will have to enter your page URLs precisely or risk landing on 404 error pages .
Windows servers however really do n’t care about upper and lowercase .
On a Windows server , you would only have one aboutus . html page , no matter where you put or left out capitalization .
These differences between server operating systems may sound insignificant , but they can have a major impact on how you manage your site as well as your site traffics experience with your site .
Armed with knowing which operating system does what , you can find or set up a web hosting server that will best meet your needs .
Ed Shadles quest to break the world land - speed record is , by his own admission , a long shot .
But it s still the best shot anyones got .
On Oct. 4 , 1983 , Richard Noble went to the Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada , one of the flattest places in the world , hoping to break the world land - speed record of 622 miles per hour .
An American named Gary Gabelich had set that record some 13 years earlier when he scorched across the salt flats at Bonneville , Utah , in a car named the Blue Flame .
That day at Black Rock , Noble answered with his Thrust2 , a turbojet - powered car , and blasted across the desert at 633 miles per hour , claiming the record for the UK for the first time since a brief two - month period in 1964 — and establishing Gabelich ’s achievement as the last time to date an American set the mark .
But 633 mph was n’t good enough ; Noble wanted his team to become the first to break the speed of sound on land .
Over the next 14 years , they designed and built the Thrust SSC ( Super Sonic Car ) , a 54 - foot - long , Batmobile - looking machine powered by twin Rolls - Royce Spey Turbofan engines .
On Oct. 15 , 1997 , Andy Green , a British Royal Air Force fighter pilot whom Noble had recruited to man the SSC ’s steering wheel , drove the new car 763 mph , becoming the first person ever to break the sound barrier on land .
Ed Shadle of Spanaway had mixed emotions about Green ’s success .
While supportive , Shadle had to concede that his car , an aluminum - bodied monstrosity , could n’t compete .
Shadle had started building it in the mid-’90s , thinking that , if funding came through , if everything ran properly , if the weather cooperated , he could possibly fire the car across the Black Rock Desert at a speed faster than 633 mph .
But after Green ’s success , the 67 - year - old Shadle admitted to himself that his car would n’t measure up .
On a flight home from California , Shadle began chatting with his friend Keith Zanghi , who had also worked on the old car .
What if , they wondered , instead of designing the body of the car themselves , they used something that had already proven itself to be aerodynamically capable — say , a jet !
The more they talked about it , the more it made sense .
Zanghi had seen a Lockheed F - 104 Starfighter hanging in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. , and thought it would make a great land - speed car .
The F - 104 fighter is a smaller , lighter airplane with tremendous horsepower .
Aerodynamically , it ’s one of the fastest airplanes ever designed .
By the time the pair landed in Seattle , they had decided to move forward with the project , which they dubbed the North American Eagle .
The idea was this : find an old F - 104 fighter , chop off the wings , drop it on a chassis , fire it up , go like hell — and maybe , with a little luck , this fall they ’ll become the first team to drive a car faster than 800 mph .
But the attempt is not without its challenges .
The costs are high , public interest is down , and sponsorship in the sport is next to nil .
So why invest massive quantities of time and money for a 20 - second ride ?
Shadle answers with the Mount Everest analogy :
Why climb it ?
Because it ’s there .
“ The difference between me and some of the others is I always have this motto that is ‘ Do what you say you ’re going to do , ' ” he adds .
“ So when I said I would do it , that ’s it .
I ’m moving forward with it . ”
Shadle grew up as one of four children in a small central Washington town called Malott , just south of Okanogan .
His family was always into cars , his uncles flying around dusty dirt tracks in shaky stock cars .
Speed was in Shadle ’s blood .
As a young kid in the late ’ 40s , Shadle would perch behind the steering wheel of those jalopies as his family towed them behind their sedan to the next race .
Then his father , a carpenter , could n’t find work .
“ The Okanogan Valley , when the wind starts blowing in the fall and it starts acting like it ’s gonna be winter , well , everything just shuts down , ” Shadle explains .
“ Too much of that . ”
So the family moved to Puyallup .
It was there , in 1955 , that a 14 - year - old Shadle heard about the Soap Box Derby for the first time .
He borrowed a set of authorized derby wheels —
Chevrolet dealerships sold the only sets , to ensure fairness — and slapped together a racer .
On 38th Street in Tacoma , Shadle and a handful of other kids barreled down the hill .
He does n’t remember much about those races , but he does recall that he walked away enamored with racing .
So when he got his driver ’s license , he immediately picked up a “ car or two to run around the streets with ” — a ’ 49 Ford and a ’ 51 Studebaker .
Three years later , he was spending Friday nights at Puyallup ’s Thun Field , racing grudge matches .
“ You ’d say , ‘ Hey , there ’s a guy over there with a ’ 47 Ford with the straight pipes making a lot of noise .
And I got my ’ 49 Ford with my Flathead …hey , I ’ll run you . ’
So we ’d go over and get in line . ”
The races were not always kind to the cars .
“ If you broke your car , one of your buddies would tow you home with a rope tied between the bumpers , ” Shadle says .
“ No rules , no insurance , no lawyers . ”
At about that same time , Shadle heard about Speed Week at Bonneville , where amateurs from all over the country compete annually to see who ’s fastest .
It sounded like the grudge matches at Thun Field , only the whole country showed up .
Shadle immediately wanted to go , but it was n’t until the late ’ 80s that he finally got the chance .
“ I was hooked , ” he says now .
That first year , Shadle talked his way into helping out one of the teams .
The next year , he was crew chief .
By 1993 , he had built a car to compete in the street roadster class ( there are dozens of classes , determined by engine displacement and body style ) .
The next year he built a lakester ( elongated body , open wheels , different engine sizes ) , for which he was crew chief .
He held records briefly in both classes .
“ I ’ve been going back ever since with one car or another , ” he says .
But the Bonneville records are n’t enough .
Shadle wants more — for himself and his country .
What we need , he says , is a cause , something that ’ll restore some national pride .
The Brits used our soil and resources to set the world land - speed record .
Now , Shadle says , it ’s time to take it back .
He wants to be the fastest person on earth — period .
People have been trying to set world land - speed records for more than a century .
On Dec. 18 , 1898 , Count Gaston de Chasse - loup - Laubat won a contest sponsored by the French magazine La France Automobile , when he drove an electric car through Achères , Yvelines , a suburb of Paris , at the white - knuckle speed of 39.24 mph .
Four years would pass before an American took the record for the first time : On Nov. 5 , 1902 , William K. Vanderbilt drove an internal - combustion car through Ablis , France , at 76.08 mph .
The record bounced between France and Belgium over the next two years until Henry Ford became the first to break the record on American soil , driving over the frozen surface of Lake St. Clair , Mich . , at 91.37 mph .
According to legend , Ford was so spooked by the ride that he never drove the car again .
In 1927 , Daytona Beach , Fla. , became the preferred venue for the record .
Between 1928 and 1935 , another British citizen , Malcolm Campbell , broke the record eight times , with speeds ranging from 146.16 to 276.71 mph .
Then on Sept. 3 , 1935 , Campbell became the first person to drive 300 mph , marking the first time the record was broken at the Bonneville Salt Flats .
At 159 square miles of pancake flatness , the Flats provide a 10 - mile linear track that gives speed freaks plenty of room to accelerate and slow down .
Between 1935 and 1970 , the Utah venue hosted every successful attempt at the land - speed record except one .
It was also the site of America ’s land - speed heyday , the period between 1963 and 1970 when the record belonged almost exclusively to two Americans : Art Arfons and Craig Breedlove , who exchanged the record eight times between 1963 and 1965 .
Their cars were the first land - speed racers to run on turbojet engines .
That technology , as well as the competition between the two , saw the record shoot up from 407.447 mph to 600.601 mph in just two years .
“ It was very popular at that time , ” says Breedlove , now 71 , from his home in Rio Vista , Calif .
“ I think primarily because of the competition between Art Arfons and myself and [ because ] the record went back and forth a number of times .
It was something that caught people ’s imagination and they followed it . ”
( Arfons died last year . )
In 1996 , Breedlove gave it another shot , but his car rolled over at 675 mph when someone misread a wind gauge .
Then , a year later , Green shattered the previous record .
Subsequently , Breedlove sold his car to Steve Fossett , who owned speed and endurance records in everything from ballooning to yachting , and has n’t made a serious attempt since .
“ I just decided that when Steve ( Fossett ) wanted to buy the car , I should take him up on the offer , ” says Breedlove .
“ I was n’t doing too well trying to get sponsored . ”
But Fossett went missing in September 2007 while scouting the Black Rock Desert in a small airplane .
Louise Noeth , a land - speed historian who was doing PR for the team at the time , says that the car is still ready , but Fossett ’s widow , Peggy , wants nothing to do with land - speed racing .
And the team needs a driver , preferably one with a lot of sponsorship money .
As it is , the project is at an impasse , Noeth says .
Meanwhile , Rosco McGlashan , the fastest Australian , says that he has an engine and funding to build a 1,000 - mph car at the Treasure Island Casino in Las Vegas as part of a large motor - sport garage , “ but because of the dismal financial situation in the U.S. at present , our construction program is about one year behind schedule . ”
After Shadle made his pact with Zanghi , he began to beat the bushes looking for an F - 104 , eventually finding one at a scrapyard in Maine .
It was in bad shape , but Shadle and Zanghi nonetheless bought it for $ 25,000 .
In the fall of 1998 , the plane arrived in Shadle ’s home hangar at Spanaway ’s Shady Acres Airport .
Covered in graffiti , punctured with holes , adorned with the wrong tail cone , and stripped of everything but the fuselage , it was exactly what the team needed : a template , nothing more .
“ We knew we ’d have to do a lot of work on it anyway , ” he says .
“ No sense ruining a perfectly good F - 104 for the project .
It ’s better to take one that needs the work . ”
So Shadle and Zanghi cleaned the graffiti and stripped the paint .
At the tail , Shadle found some history underneath the third layer :
The plane ’s tail number , 763 , is the current world land - speed record .
An interesting coincidence , Shadle decided .
He then wrote to the Air Force Historical Research Agency for the plane ’s history .
In the reply , he found out that the plane was mostly a research vessel at Edwards Air Force Base .
But as he read the history , Shadle also found something else .
If the plane ’s maintenance records were correct , Chuck Yeager , the first man to break the sound barrier , once flew Shadle ’s F - 104 .
It was an omen , Shadle decided .
Shadle ’s hangar is a little bigger than a two - car garage , too small for the North American Eagle if the nose cone is attached .
It ’s cluttered with parts , people , toolboxes , and dogs .
At beer - thirty , crewmember Jon Higley starts passing out Heinekens .
One by one , crewmembers peel off .
The humor quickly turns bawdy , and aside from the vehicle ’s shiny red fuselage , team North American Eagle could be any group of garage monkeys on any Saturday afternoon in any small town in America .
Perhaps the most notable aspect of the group is its complete lack of haughtiness .
If you do n’t know Shadle , you wo n’t be able to pick him out .
Dressed in jeans and a North American Eagle sweatshirt , he ’s retired from his job as a project manager at IBM , and is now a great - grandfather with graying hair , a beer gut , a kind face , and an easygoing disposition .
He ’s cracking jokes and sipping a bottle of suds when his crew goads him into practicing his best prime - time voice , one he honed during his time in front of TV cameras .
“ Take 15 , ” someone says .
“ I’m Ed Shadle , ” he says , “ and this is the world ’s fastest car ! ”
Everybody laughs .
Yet driving a car faster than the speed of sound is not as easy as attaching a set of wheels to a plane and hoping for the best .
There are a number of challenges to overcome .
For one , an object traveling along the face of the earth has managed to break the sound barrier exactly twice , and both times that object was Green ’s car , the Thrust SSC .
( For a land - speed record , a car must make two runs in opposite directions within an hour of each other .
The official time is actually the average of the two runs . )
As a result , there is little information about ground effects at supersonic speeds .
Shadle was at Black Rock when Green broke the sound barrier .
“ The blast coming by you is tremendous , ” he says .
“ It ’ll practically bust your eardrums out . ”
He also saw the ground where the Thrust SSC ran .
“ It just pulverized the dirt , ” he says .
If he ’s fortunate , Shadle says , he ’ll be able to use one of Boeing ’s high - speed wind tunnels for testing .
A handful of team members work for the airline manufacturer , but the company wo n’t officially endorse the project .
However , if Shadle can somehow enlist the company ’s support , a wind tunnel would give his team an idea of how the car will react as it approaches the speed of sound .
If not , Shadle must rely on computer modeling to figure out how to mitigate the effect of the sound waves .
And that ’s only if the engine works .
The North American Eagle contains a J79 turbo jet engine , the type used on the F - 104 .
But at stock , it ’s not fast enough , so Shadle has had to soup it up , coating the turbine blades with molybdenum to reduce wind resistance and resizing the fuel nozzles to hop it up .
Now the car is running at about 52,000 horsepower — compared to around 180 in a standard eight - cylinder .
If the engine runs well and he can keep it on the ground ( preventing the car from taking off is a real issue ) , Shadle will then need to put it on wheels .
Gary Gabelich was the last land - speed record holder to run on rubber tires .
He also was the last to run at Bonneville .
Now , speeds are simply too high to use rubber tires .
When a wheel spins at 800 mph , the centrifugal force spreads the tires wide enough to fall off the wheel .
So when Noble and Green broke the record in 1997 , they used a special set of hand - crafted aluminum wheels .
“ We ’ve taken their design and modified it slightly to get even more speed , ” Shadle says .
“ Now , they ’re rated to about 900 miles per hour .
It ’s not something you can go buy off the shelf at your local racecar shop . ”
Even if you could , they ’re not cheap .
Shadle says a set of five wheels , which is what his car requires ( two in the middle , two in the back , one in the front ) , costs $ 94,000 — and that ’s without design work or the grease , which goes for $ 3,000 per gallon .
The manufacturer , Eagle Machine in Abbotsford , B.C. , is providing both to Shadle , basically free of charge .
( Shadle only had to pay for the forgings , which run about $ 10,000 for a set of five . )
But perhaps one of the biggest problems is getting the car to stop once it ’s going 800 mph .
For this , LEV - X , out of Port Angeles , came up with a set of magnetic brakes — the only set of its kind in the world , Shadle says .
Using hydraulics , the car activates a cylinder that pushes a magnet to within an eighth of an inch of the aluminum rotor , causing deceleration without rubbing metal against metal .
On a recent Saturday , Higley wants to show off the system , so he digs out a heavy bar of aluminum .
Then he pulls a smaller neodymium - iron - boron magnet from a box .
He sets the magnet on the bar of aluminum and tips it over .
It lands softly , slowed by the magnetic field .
“ Pick it up and run it over the top of the aluminum , ” he says .
I hold the magnet about a half - inch above the aluminum and wave it back and forth .
The force feels about like it would if I were doing the same thing in a bucket of water .
“ See that ? ” Higley says .
“ That ’ll stop the car from 200 miles per hour in about a mile . ”
Even if everything runs properly , Mother Nature does n’t always cooperate — something Breedlove found out the hard way during his last run , when wind flipped his car .
The wind can vary from minute to minute , but some changes are much more gradual — and much more permanent .
Dave Cooper , a field manager at the Bureau of Land Management ’s Winnemucca , Nev. , office , explains that recent seasons of drought have cracked the Black Rock Desert ’s surface , making it more brittle than it was during Green ’s run .
“ The surface is not as hard and flat as it was back then , ” says Cooper .
“ [ When Green set the record ] , the conditions were just ideal for it at that point in time . ”
Throwing money at a project like the North American Eagle is a gamble for a potential sponsor , especially when there are safer opportunities in conventional racing .
Undeterred , Shadle has embarked on an all - out media blitz in his quest for sponsorship .
Hence , the North American Eagle has shown up in newspapers from Seattle to London , and Shadle ’s been to countless air and car shows as well as television and radio programs .
At one time he was so desperate for money that he even allowed an agent to briefly talk him out of the driver ’s seat , the idea being that a younger , Robert Redford–looking fellow would generate sponsorship .
The advertisement went up on the Web under the headline : “ Are you fucking insane ? ” Shadle still gets applications constantly , he says , but has thus far refused to relinquish his seat .
That ’s not to say that Shadle has n’t been able to find any sponsorship .
At the hangar at Shady Acres , he points out each logo on the car and explains what that company has agreed to do .
One of his largest sponsors is S&S Turbines in Fort St. John , B.C. ( hence the name “ North American Eagle ” instead of “ American Eagle ” ) .
That company owns the car ’s engine , and fixes it when it blows up — something that happened during the most recent test run .
“ The worst thing that happens is I lose the engine , ” says S&S owner Robin Sipe .
“ Why would n’t you get involved in something like [ the North American Eagle ] ?
If the opportunity is there , you leap at the chance . ”
Other sponsors supply gas , parachutes , shelters , computers , and a slew of other services .
But most provide just that : services — not cash .
This shortfall , George Calloway says , is not unique to Shadle .
A longtime acquaintance of Shadle ’s who lives in El Mirage , Calif. , Calloway has been involved in the land - speed racing scene since the ’50s .
He ’s worked with at least one record holder ( Gabelich ) , and several others who have made attempts .
“ That ’s what ’s holding it up these days : no sponsors , ” Calloway says .
“ You get a nut - and - bolt guy who will … give you some nuts and bolts . ”
It was n’t always that way , Calloway says .
“ Before , when it was Arfons vs. Breedlove , it was Firestone vs. Goodyear .
Now nobody builds 700 , 800 - mile - per - hour tires , so they ’ve gone to aluminum wheels .
You ca n’t run those on the salt because it ’s too hard .
That ’s why Black Rock worked out so well .
It ’s dirt , and it ’s just soft enough it takes up the vibration .
They [ Firestone and Goodyear ] could put millions of dollars in development and they get nothing in return . ”
As Breedlove explains , a run at the land - speed record involves a trip out to the desert and a lot of downtime .
“ There ’s a lot of time spent making adjustments , modifications , and doing instrumentation runs , ” he says .
“ It gets pretty technical .
It ’s interesting to see the cars when they do run , but in any given time period you ’re never sure when that ’s going to be .
“ I think there ’s just more promotional opportunity for sponsors through NASCAR , IndyCar , and drag racing , ” he adds .
“ They get a lot of TV time , so the sponsors get a lot of corporate identification . ”
Dan MacDonald , a spokesman for Bridgestone Americas Holding , Inc. , Firestone ’s parent company , notes that Bridgestone is not completely out of the land - speed business .
A few years ago , the company sponsored Susan Robinson when she set the world land - speed record for a woman on a motorcycle .
“ It did n’t require us to do a lot of special development work on a special tire or anything , ” he says .
“ She did it on a very high - end , ultra - high performance … consumer product . ”
But MacDonald acknowledges that intensive sponsorship for land - speed racing is probably a thing of the past .
“ In the ’50s and ’60s there was a lot of that activity , ” he says .
“ I think at that time , it was before we were walking on the moon , and you could garner a lot of PR . ”
Each time the North American Eagle makes a run , Shadle says , it costs about $ 20,000 in kerosene and worn parts .
That adds up pretty quickly .
He estimates it ’ll cost another $ 500,000 to break the record .
So far , he and Zanghi have each spent about $ 150,000 of their own money over the decade and a half they ’ve been chasing the record .
There have been cash sponsorship offers , but most are ridiculous .
Monster.com offered to kick Shadle $ 50,000 if he would paint the car black .
No thanks , he told the company — it ’d cost more than that to paint the car .
A mailbox company offered some cash , but only if Shadle would install a special compartment for packages ; the company wanted to be able to say that it had the world ’s fastest land delivery service .
Still , he says he ’d be willing to stoop pretty low .
“ We ’ve said jokingly that we ’d paint the thing pink with a bunch of purple lines on it if Viagra or Trojan would sponsor us . ”
If Shadle ca n’t come across the half - mil in time to make an autumn attempt , he ’ll wait until next year .
“ We ’ll just do it when we have the money , ” he says .
It would n’t be the first time the lack of funds has delayed the project .
As early as 2006 , Shadle was telling reporters he hoped to make a run at the record “ this fall . ”
This weekend , team North American Eagle is planning to run the car at a speed somewhere between 400 and 500 mph at a site in El Mirage .
If all goes as planned there , the team will then set up camp in Black Rock to accommodate 30 people for about a month .
In a perfect world , the team would arrive , break the record , and drive home the next day .
But if something goes wrong — the weather , the technology — it could take awhile .
Because attempts to break the world land - speed record are very rare ( Green ’s was the most recent ) , the Bureau of Land Management determines the permitting and application process on a case - by - case basis , says the BLM ’s Cooper .
“ We ’d have to process the application , which means writing an environmental assessment would be the minimum , ” he says .
There would also be a public review process and a competitive fee of about $ 5 per person per day .
For a two - month permit , Shadle says he will have to post a $ 30,000 bond , plus another $ 10,000 in a checking account if the bureau has to clean up after the North American Eagle team has come and gone .
And to validate the record , the team will have to fly officials from the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile in France to Black Rock .
They ’ll also be responsible for the officials ’ housing during the stay .
Once the officials are there , the team will have to clear a 13 - mile track .
They ’ll lay a run line down the middle and place human monitors along the way to ensure that nothing gets in the car ’s way .
And that ’s only if Mother Nature cooperates .
Last time he was in El Mirage , Shadle says , the dust was blowing so hard you could n’t see the back of the car if you were standing at the front .
Since the test , at 350 mph ( Shadle ’s fastest speed to date ) , involved relatively low speeds , the wind effect was negligible .
But at Mach 1 , they ’ll have to wait for the weather to be just right .
One thing , however , is free : Shadle ’s crew is all volunteer .
In 10 years , they ’ve grown from four to 44 members and have shown up everywhere from car shows to hardware stores .
“ You run into an airplane mechanic and say , ‘ Hey , you ought to come down to the hangar , ' ” Zanghi says .
“ We ’ve grown to 44 regular guys who have good jobs during the day who come together on Saturday [ to do ] something extraordinary . ”
Rosco McGlashan got into land - speed racing when he was 12 years old , at which point Donald Campbell brought his Bluebird racer to McGlashan ’s native Australia and set the world record at 403 mph .
“ I quit school the same week that Campbell set his record , telling my schoolmates that I was going after Campbell ’s record , ” McGlashan says .
“ Obviously , they all laughed .
The year was 1964 , and it was n’t until 1994 that I claimed the Aussie land - speed record at 500 miles per hour . ”
For his part , Shadle traces his infatuation with the sport back to Thun Field in Puyallup : “ Number one , it ’s kinda akin to the old days of hot - rodding , ” he says .
“ The amateur can still compete . ”
And although Shadle complains constantly about funding , he says that the lack of money in land - speed racing is actually one of the sport ’s big draws .
“ I can build a car in my garage and the high - dollar guys have n’t shown up with the multimillion - dollar sponsorship , ” he says .
“ When you go to drag racing , unless you ’re running some really low class , everybody seems to have big bucks .
In land - speed racing , Joe Blow down the street can field a Camaro and run…
You could spend all year letting your imagination run wild , trying to make this thing work better than the guy down the street . ”
And when it comes to the ultimate land - speed conquest , McGlashan says , “ There is only one team out there delivering the goods : Ed Shadle .
We wish him all the very best of luck and take our hat off to a man who is truly following his passion . ”
If Shadle is successful in his pursuit , what will it feel like to drive a car faster than the speed of sound ?
There ’s only one person in the world who knows : Andy Green .
“ The noise is both massive and unique , ” says Green .
“ You ca n’t hear the distinctive sonic boom from inside the car , but you can hear the howling of the standing shock waves on the canopy , and around the bodywork , as the air is literally battered out of the way as you travel 350 feet per second .
And then , of course , there ’s the realization that this is a unique experience .
I ’m looking forward to Ed getting there so I finally have someone with whom to compare notes . ”
So in the fall , after Shadle ’s spent hundreds of thousands of dollars , after all the searches for parts and experts and sponsors , after all the testing , after the car is loaded and driven to Black Rock , after camp is set up , after the inspectors arrive and the wind ’s right and the temperature ’s right and the car ’s firing , after he ’s sat in the cockpit in four layers of clothing and flight suits , after the car ’s accelerated and he ’s pinned to the seat and flames shoot 70 feet out of the tailpipe and he ’s covering a mile in 4.3 seconds ( a speed fast enough to keep his eyes from focusing on the scenery around him ) , after the sound wave howls on the canopy and then dissipates as the car goes even faster , after the magnetic brakes kick in and the parachutes deploy and he finally rolls to a stop , after he turns around and does it all again , and after Ed Shadle has driven the North American Eagle to the fastest land speed ever recorded on the face of the earth …
What then ?

Giant biotech companies are privatising the world 's protection against climate change by filing hundreds of monopoly patents on genes that help crops resist it , a new investigation has concluded .
The study – by the authoritative Action Group on Erosion , Technology and Concentration ( ETC Group ) , based in Ottawa , Canada – has found that nine firms have filed at least 532 patents around the world on about 55 different genes offering protection against heat , drought and floods .
If granted , the companies would be given control of crucial natural raw material needed to maintain food supplies in an increasingly hungry world .
Last week , as world leaders met in Rome to discuss the food crisis , GM companies promoted their technologies as the answer to hunger .
On Thursday , Monsanto – the biggest and most controversial firm – announced a " commitment " to increase food production , partly by developing crops that need less water .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Together we must meet the needs for increased food , fibre and energy , while preserving the environment , " said the company 's head , Hugh Grant .
" These commitments represent the beginning of a journey that we will expand on and deepen in the years ahead . "
The ETC Group calls this " an opportunistic public relations strategy " , adding : " Monsanto 's business is selling patented seeds for industrial agriculture – not addressing a humanitarian food crisis . "
The report of its investigation shows that Monsanto and BASF – which last year announced a $ 1.5 bn " collaboration " to develop new GM crops , including " ones more tolerant to adverse environmental conditions such as drought " – have between them filed patents for 27 of the 55 genes .
Others had been filed by companies such as Bayer , Syngenta and Dow .
The reports says some of the applications are sweeping .
One would cover more than 30 crops from oats to oil palms , triticale to tea , and potatoes to perennial grass – " in other words , virtually all food crops " .
It says the " corporate grab on climate - tolerant genes " means that " a handful of transnational companies are now positioned to determine who gets access to key genetic traits and what price they must pay " .
Small farmers in developing countries will be particularly hard hit by such " climate - change profiteering " .
Patenting will make the crops expensive and ensure that poor farmers have to buy them every year , by prohibiting them from saving seeds from one harvest to grow for the next .
According to the report , conventional , non-GM breeding techniques are making remarkable progress in developing crops that can tolerate heat , floods and drought .
A new Asian rice , due to go on the market next year , can stand being submerged for two weeks without affecting yields , while a new African one flowers early in the morning , escaping the heat of the day .
But , it says , " the patent grab is sucking up money and resources that could be spent on affordable , farmer - based strategies for survival " .
It concludes : " These patented technologies will ultimately concentrate corporate power , drive up costs , inhibit independent research and further undermine the rights of farmers to save and exchange seeds " .
But Croplife , which represents the world 's plant - science industry , retorts ; " Patenting is very important .
That is how we protect intellectual property and ensure we continue to bring new innovations to the marketplace . "
It denies that biotechnology companies are seeking to monopolise world food supplies .
In my experience , many people believe that New Yorkers are smarter than other Americans , and this may actually be true .
The majority of people who live in New York City were not born here .
Indeed , more than a third were not born in the United States .
New Yorkers , then , are people who left another place and came here , looking for something , which suggests that the population is preselected for higher energy and ambition .
Also for a willingness to forgo basic comforts .
I grew up in California , where even middle - income people have a patio on which they can eat breakfast and where almost everyone has a car .
In New York , only upper - income people enjoy those amenities .
The others would like to share them .
I sometimes get into conversations with taxi drivers , and since most of them are new to the city , I often ask them what they miss about the place they came from .
Almost always , they name very ordinary pleasures : a slower pace of life , a café where they could sit around and talk to friends , a street where they could play kickball without getting run over .
Those who miss these things enough will go back home .
That means that the rest of us , statistically , are more high - strung , hungry and intent on long - term gains — traits that quite possibly correlate with intelligence .
But I think it's also possible that New Yorkers just appear smarter , because they make less separation between private and public life .
That is , they act on the street as they do in private .
In the United States today , public behavior is ruled by a kind of compulsory cheer that people probably picked up from television and advertising and that coats their transactions in a smooth , shiny glaze , making them seem empty - headed .
New Yorkers have not yet gotten the knack of this .
That may be because so many of them grew up outside the United States , and also because they live so much of their lives in public , eating their lunches in parks , riding to work in subways .
It 's hard to keep up the smiley face for that many hours a day .
It is said that New Yorkers are rude , but I think what people mean by that is that New Yorkers are more familiar .
The man who waits on you in the delicatessen is likely to call you sweetheart .
( Feminists have gotten used to this . )
People on the bus will say , " I have the same handbag as you .
How much did you pay ? "
If they do n't like the way you are treating your children , they will tell you .
And should you try to cut in front of somebody in the grocery store checkout line , you will be swiftly corrected .
My mother , who lives in California , does n't like to be kept waiting , so when she goes into the bank , she says to the people in the line , " Oh , I have just one little thing to ask the teller .
Do you mind ? "
Then she scoots to the front of the line , takes the next teller and transacts her business , which is typically no briefer than anyone else 's .
People let her do this because she is an old lady .
In New York , she would n't get away with it for a second .
While New Yorkers do n't mind correcting you , they also want to help you .
In the subway or on the sidewalk , when someone asks a passerby for directions , other people , overhearing , may hover nearby , disappointed that they were not the ones asked , and waiting to see if maybe they can get a word in .
New Yorkers like to be experts .
Actually , all people like to be experts , but most of them satisfy this need with friends and children and employees .
New Yorkers , once again , tend to behave with strangers the way they do with people they know .
This injects a certain drama into our public life .
The other day I was in the post office when a man in line in front of me bought one of those U.S. Postal Service boxes .
Then he moved down the counter a few inches to assemble his package while the clerk waited on the next person .
But the man soon discovered that the books he wanted to mail were going to rattle around in the box , so he interrupted the clerk to tell her his problem .
She offered to sell him a roll of bubble wrap , but he told her that he had already paid $ 2.79 for the box , and that was a lot for a box — he could have gotten a box for free at the liquor store — and what was he going to do with a whole roll of bubble wrap ?
Carry it around all day ?
The clerk shrugged .
Then the man spotted a copy of the Village Voice on the counter and laid hold of it to use it for stuffing .
" No ! " said the clerk .
" That 's my Voice . "
Annoyed , the man put it back and looked around helplessly .
Now a woman in line behind me said she 'd give him the sections of her New York Times that she did n't want , and she began going through the paper .
" Real estate ?
You can have real estate .
Sports ?
Here , take sports . "
But the real estate section was all the man needed .
He separated the pages , stuffed them in the box and proceeded to the taping process ( interrupting the clerk once again ) .
Another man in line asked the woman if he could have the sports section , since she did n't want it .
She gave it to him , and so finally everything was settled .
This was an interesting show , to which you could have a wide range of reactions .
Why did n't the box man bring some stuffing ?
If the clerk had n't finished her Village Voice , why did she leave it on the counter ?
And so on .
In any case , the scene sufficed to fill up those boring minutes in line — or , I should add , to annoy the people who just wanted to read their newspaper in peace instead of being exposed to the man 's postal adventure .
I wo n't say this could happen only in New York , but I believe that the probability is much greater here .
Why are New Yorkers like this ?
It goes against psychological principles .
Psychologists tell us that the more stimuli people are bombarded with , the more they will recede into themselves and ignore others .
So why is it that New Yorkers , who are certainly confronted with enough stimuli , do the opposite ?
I have already given a few possible answers , but here 's one more : the special difficulties of life in New York — the small apartments , the struggle for a seat on the bus or a table at a restaurant — seem to breed a sense of common cause .
When New Yorkers see a stranger , they do n't think , " I do n't know you . "
They think , " I know you .
I know your problems — they 're the same as mine — and furthermore we have the same handbag . "
So that 's how they treat you .
This belief in a shared plight may underlie the remarkable level of cooperation that New Yorkers can show in times of trouble .
Every few years or so , we have a water shortage , and then the mayor goes on the radio and tells us that we can't leave the water running in the sink while we 're brushing our teeth .
Surprise !
People obey , and the water table goes up again .
The more serious the problem , the more dramatic the displays of cooperation .
I will not speak of the World Trade Center disaster , because it is too large a subject , but the last time we had a citywide power failure , and hence no traffic lights , I saw men in business suits — they looked like lawyers — directing traffic at busy intersections on Ninth Avenue .
They got to be traffic cops for a day and tell the big trucks when to stop and when to go .
They looked utterly delighted .
Another curious form of cooperation one sees in New York is the unspoken ban on staring at celebrities .
When you get into an elevator in an office building and find that you are riding with Paul McCartney — this happened to me — you are not supposed to look at him .
You can peek for a second , but then you must avert your eyes .
The idea is that Paul McCartney has to be given his space like anyone else .
A limousine can bring him to the building he wants to go to , but it can't take him to the 12th floor .
To get there , he has to ride in an elevator with the rest of us , and we should n't take advantage of that .
This logic is self - flattering .
It 's nice to think that Paul McCartney needs us to do him a favor , and that we live in a city with so many famous people that we can afford to ignore them .
But if vanity is involved , so is generosity .
I remember , once , in the early '90s , standing in a crowded lobby at City Center Theater when Jackie Onassis walked in .
Everyone looked at her and then immediately looked down .
There was a whole mob of people staring at their shoes .
When Jackie died , a few years later , I was happy to remember that scene .
I was glad that we had been polite to her .
Of course , the rule with celebrities , which forbids involvement , is different from the other expressions of common cause , which dictate involvement .
And since few of us are celebrities , the latter are far more numerous .
As a result , New Yorkers , however kind and generous , may also come off as opinionated and intrusive .
Living with them is a little like being a child again and having your mother with you all the time , helping you , correcting you , butting into your business .
And that , I believe , is another reason why New Yorkers seem smarter .
Your mother knew better , too , right ?

A headline from the UK Daily Mail ( 06/30 ) : Grandfather with ' For Sale ' sign in car window given Â£ 100 fine for running street business .
Victor Abrahams put a ' for sale ' sign on his Ford Escort and , then , went about his daily life .
Unhappily , he works and , so , parks his car in the town of Barnett where it is illegal to do business in a parking place , however legally parked a car may otherwise be .
Abrahams has appealed the fine and will undoubtedly attempt to reason his way out of paying .
As he stated to the press , " Why is the for - sale sign in my car window any different from a delivery van with the name and phone number of the company on the side ?
Or why is it different from a driving instructor 's car that has the name and details of the driving school on the side ?
Surely if I 'm offering goods for sale , so are they .
" Alas , the man is appealing to government agents against whom reason is impotent .
As Thomas Paine wrote in Common Sense , â€ œIt is as useless to argue with those who have abandoned the use of reason as it is to administer medicine to the dead.â€ 

Larger - scale folds develop the fastest in premature ( born more than seven weeks early ) infants ( top ) , while medium - scale folds develop the fastest in older premature infants , born between seven and two weeks early ( middle ) .
In older infants and children , fine folds develop the most quickly across the brain surface ( bottom ) .
Any topic concerning young children and prescription medication is bound to be contentious .
But add to the mix phrases like " abnormal behavior " or " my kid is better than your kid because you 're a lousy parent , " and you have the enduring ADHD controversy , with its ongoing discourse about how to treat a disorder that some folks are n't convinced exists .
ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , a family of neurobehavioral and developmental disorders first diagnosed in the mid-1800s — yes , we 've been wrestling with inattentive and restless kids for a long , long time .
ADHD encompasses the outdated term attention - deficit disorder as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity , sometimes called " boys will be boys . "
In terms of clinical diagnoses , it affects about 3 to 5 percent of children and is indeed a little more common in boys , according to the National Institute of Mental Health .
Although books such as " Ritalin Nation " have convinced many that ADHD is purely a behavior problem brought about by bad parenting and our fast - paced lifestyle , the preponderance of evidence reveals how ADHD has a biological base .
The primary cause seems to be genetic , along with prenatal or early postnatal exposure to toxins such as lead or cigarette smoke .
For most doctors and psychologists , what remains controversial is not whether ADHD is real but rather how to diagnose and treat it .
Now there 's a name
Nearly every psychological or cognitive disorder goes through a period in which the public , and even doctors , dismiss it as imaginary or the result of a weak will .
Depressed ?
Snap out of it .
Addicted ?
Toughen up and just say " no . "
But modern imaging techniques reveal how such disorders are the result of real changes in the brain .
ADHD is no different .
Some people still are convinced that the cure is a matter of a swift slap on the rear - end .
The problem area , however , is another part of the body entirely : ADHD seems to be the result of dopamine receptors in the brain not functioning properly , as well as other characteristics in the frontal lobes of the cerebrum that differ from brains of people without ADHD .
The word " differ " is important here , for ADHD is not a sign of inferior intelligence .
As with dyslexia and mild forms of autism , the brain is merely different .
The child could be brilliant or otherwise normal or could have a less than stellar IQ .
The cerebrum is that section of the brain involved with problem - solving and controlling impulses .
In a society that values problem - solving and controlling impulses , and which has created a school system based on this , ADHD can cause quite a predicament .
So ADHD is often treated with an eye toward helping a child cope in such a society .
Tough call
The problem of " what is normal " makes ADHD all the more difficult to diagnose .
Clearly all children can be hyperactive , impulsive or lost in a daydream .
Although brain scans do reveal differences in the brains of children and adults with ADHD compared to control subjects , the differences are not defined well enough to serve as diagnostic tools .
Diagnosis instead is based on how far from average the behavior of the child is .
Characteristics such as being fidgety or unable to pay attention must be pervasive , manifest themselves before age 7 , and be severe enough to negatively affect school or social interactions .
Hyperactivity in the playground might be fine , for example , if the child can behave well in the classroom .
Because of the wiggle room in diagnosing ADHD , parents should seek multiple opinions before placing their children on a drug therapy .
Drug options
Ritalin is but one of many drugs available to treat ADHD .
These drugs do nothing to cure ADHD but allow the child to focus in school so that he does n't fall behind and become " less intelligent . "
Usually drug therapy is coupled with behavior therapy .
These drugs do carry risks , particularly for children with heart defects , so the prudent doctor tries to prescribe just what is needed to help a child focus better .
In his 1999 book " Ritalin Nation , " author Richard DeGrandpre theorized that ADHD is caused by America 's " rapid - fire culture " of MTV and videogames and parents too busy for their children .
While DeGrandpre did alert the public about a nation perhaps a little too casual with prescribing drugs , nearly all the medical elements of his book were false or have since been proven to be false .
Bad parenting can exacerbate the situation , but it does n't cause ADHD .
Videogames , too , do n't seem to cause ADHD and , in fact children with ADHD often are n't very good at videogames and do n't play them because , well , they can't focus .
This cuts across classes and affects kids with no access to videogames .
Also , what DeGrandpre labeled as purely behavior reveals itself in various kinds of letter - recognition and number - counting tests to be analogous to dyslexia or autism .
New medication might soon be available that could be safer than Ritalin and similar stimulants , targeting the neurotransmitter norepinephrine instead of dopamine .
Doctors , fortunately , do remain very focused on ADHD .

Alarm over ' Unfair ' Campaign Money
There was real emotion in his voice when ABC News anchor Charles Gibson used Friday night ’s newscast to stand up for little - guy McCain against online - fundraising - powerhouse Barack Obama .
Bookmark

By opting out of public financing , Gibson intoned , the Democrat could obtain “ two times , three times , four times , as much money as John McCain . ”
“ Let me ask you a question about basic fairness , ” Gibson implored of chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos .
“ People in this country like to believe that people play on a level playing field and that a campaign will be about ideas and personality ; if you start with that much more money , is it basically fair ? ”
It was more a statement than a question , like Brit Hume anchoring at Fox .
( ABC has gone Fox - like in crusading over “ Obama ’s Switch ” and “ Back Flip ” and “ Flip - Flop ” on public financing . )
Gibson ’s egalitarian “ fretting ” about fairness was too much for right - wing media critic Brent Baker , who belittled the anchor and McCain : “ If Obama can raise more than his opponent , it just reflects greater enthusiasm for him .
And there 's hardly any nobility in taking taxpayer money when you know you 'll be challenged to raise a larger amount voluntarily . ”
To me , the good news is that a network anchor was giving prominence to the plight of underfinanced candidates .
The bad news is that it ’s taken years to see an anchor make such a stand .
And that Gibson ( like other media voices in recent days ) is making his stand for “ fairness ” against a candidate who has attracted 3 million contributions from 1.5 million donors giving an average donation of $ 91 .
In other words , against a candidate who is arguably less beholden to big- moneyed interests than McCain .
( The Gibson clip is at Crooks and Liars . )
I have mixed emotions about big media ’s newfound concern for under - funded candidates .
Beginning in 1992 , Norman Solomon and I used our nationally - syndicated column to criticize mainstream media for their failure to focus on campaign spending inequities and the elite funders of corporate - friendly politicians .
Days after the 1992 election , we wrote that “ national media seemed almost clueless to explain the triumph ” of endangered U.S. Senate incumbents – with the New York Times blandly noting that many incumbents “ somehow managed to survive . ”
We mentioned several narrowly victorious Senators like corporate - backed sex-harasser Bob Packwood of Oregon , who outspent his Democratic challenger by more than 3 to 1 .
And ethically - challenged Al D’Amato of New York , who outspent his liberal opponent 2 to 1 .
Our column – titled “ We Need Term Limits for Political Pundits ” – concluded that “ big bucks special interests dominating Washington are almost a taboo subject . ”
In that column and others , we urged political journalists to calculate and report which candidates won more “ votes per dollar spent ” – arguing that the “ VPDS count would make it clear that many incumbents would have been defeated if not for their advantage in dollars . ”
So here we are in 2008 , and we ’re witnessing an apparent flip - flop in mainstream news – with bleeding - heart appeals to “ fairness ” on behalf of the less - funded McCain enough to make a right - winger cringe .
From the same outlets that spent decades worshipping a politician ’s corporate fundraising prowess as a sign of that candidate ’s strength , seriousness , viability .
When longtime media lapdogs on campaign inequities transform into fierce watchdogs in the face of Obama ’s online fundraising clout , the public is wise to be suspicious .
Are these elite voices truly upset because Obama shifted his position ?
Are they upset all of a sudden that one candidate has a financial advantage over another ?
Or is this just the fear and loathing of the Netroots resurfacing – like when establishment pundits went hysterical as Joe Lieberman lost the Democratic primary in 2006 ?
Here is a fresh , outsider candidate – like Dean in 2003 – with a powerful grassroots funding base that goes way beyond the corporate sponsors of the nightly news .
To the old - line media establishment , that ’s scary .
If network anchors want to be taken seriously on campaign “ fairness , ” they might propose common - sense reforms .
For starters : free TV and radio airtime to candidates .

But as Internet users reaffirmed on Friday , some viewers are already willing to find some other source and watch what they want , when they want .
As dancers and acrobats whisked across the National Stadium in Beijing , anonymous users uploaded more than 100 video clips of the ceremony to YouTube , but the site , owned by Google , swiftly removed as many as it could .
Similarly , some live video streams on Justin.tv , a popular source for international video , were also removed .
According to International Olympic Committee guidelines , the television networks with the local rights to the Games are the only legal sources of video in each country .
But the media companies were almost always a step behind users who have a seemingly unlimited number of Web sites , especially when bloggers were sharing links to new sources .
In Rhode Island , Aida Neary and a colleague huddled at her desk to watch a Brazilian television channel ’s live coverage .
“ It was n’t the best quality , ” Ms. Neary said of the video feed , “ and I ’m sure it will be better on TV , but to watch that flame go up at the same time as the rest of the world was a beautiful , moving thing . ”
Most of the world ’s other broadcasters with rights to the Olympics , including CBC in Canada , Televisa in Mexico , the BBC in Britain and NHK in Japan , broadcast the opening ceremonies live on television .
“ The idea of watching a 14 - hour delay is repulsive , ” remarked Tracy Record , a blogger in Seattle , who woke up at 5 a .m. to watch the opening ceremonies with her 12 - year - old son on CBC .
Around the same time , American television viewers were treated to a taste on NBC’s “ Today ” show and regular programming on NBC ’s cable sisters , MSNBC and CNBC .
Parts of “ Today ” were taped hours in advance because Matt Lauer , who serves as co-host of the morning show , was due at the stadium to anchor the opening ceremonies with Bob Costas .
Gary Zenkel , the president of NBC Olympics , said in a statement : “ We have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here , so that means we ’re not public television , for better or worse . ”
One by one , the core standards that define the Web are getting a new lease on life .
First , the W3C rebooted its development of HTML by abandoning its single - minded focus on XHTML and embracing the work of the WHAT - WG ’s HTML 5 draft as a new beginning .
Now , at a meeting in Oslo at the end of July , the long - divided standards body responsible for the JavaScript language has managed to find new unity through compromise .
The standard that describes JavaScript is called ECMAScript ( because “ JavaScript ” is a trademark owned by Sun Microsystems ) .
The last full update to ECMAScript , ECMA - 262 3rd Edition , was published in 1999 .
In the over eight years since its publication , progress of JavaScript as a web standard has barely budged .
The lack of change to ECMAScript in that time has not been due to the language ’s maturity .
ECMA - 262 3rd Edition has widely - recognized issues that real - world browsers have had to work around for years , so there has been plenty of need for a 4th Edition .
In the absence of one , browser makers have had to reverse - engineer each other ’s implementations in order to decide how to deal with the holes in the spec— pretty much the worst - case scenario for all concerned .
The Split in TC39
The ECMA Technical Committee 39 ( TC39 , the committee responsible for developing ECMAScript standards ) certainly has n’t been sitting idle during this time .
Discussion of the features that should go into the 4th Edition of ECMA - 262 have been ongoing pretty much non-stop , but consensus has been elusive .
Within TC39 , representatives from Mozilla , Adobe , Opera , and Google wanted to undertake major enhancements to the language , and began assembling a list of new features shortly after the release of the 3rd Edition .
Many of these features ( like namespaces , generators , optional static typing , and getters / setters ) have been added into real - world implementations of ECMAScript over the years ( e.g. ActionScript 3 in Flash / Flex , JavaScript 1.7 and 1.8 in Firefox ) .
But not everyone within TC39 favored these kinds of changes .
Over a year ago , representatives of Microsoft and Yahoo !
within the committee stated that they felt a relatively minor update to the language , to fix the problems that had become apparent in the 3rd Edition , was more appropriate .
They pointed out , for example , that features like packages , namespaces , and early binding that had been implemented in ActionScript 3 would present performance challenges if anyone tried to implement them in browsers .
This split within the committee led to the formation of two groups , each with its own draft : those seeking to add major features called their draft “ ECMAScript 4.0 , ” while the more conservative group called its draft “ ECMAScript 3.1 . ”
But there could only be one ECMA - 262 4th Edition , so as long as the two groups worked in parallel , the future of ECMAScript would remain unknown .
All that changed last month in Oslo .
Read on below to find out what happened .
Harmony at the Oslo Meeting
What had been scheduled to be a regular meetup of the divided TC39 in Oslo at the end of July turned out to be a massive turning point for the committee and — we have good reason to hope — the JavaScript language itself .
The members of TC39 agreed that a divided committee was good for no one , and forged an agreement that would allow work to continue on a single , unified draft for the 4th Edition of ECMA - 262 , under the name “ ECMAScript 3.1 . ”
To reflect the historic settling of differences that this represented , the effort has been dubbed ECMAScript Harmony .
Under Harmony , each side of the debate has made a key concession :
The “ ECMAScript 4.0 ” group has conceded that packages , namespaces , and early binding are all features that are unsuitable for the Web .
They have been permanently ruled out of being included in any future version of the ECMA - 262 standard .
They have been permanently ruled out of being included in any future version of the ECMA - 262 standard .
The “ ECMAScript 3.1 ” group has conceded that some of the features that were proposed for ECMAScript 4.0 do have merit , and these will be reworked for inclusion in a release to follow ECMAScript 3.1 .
That subsequent release is being called “ ES - harmony ” .
Moving forward , the committee anticipates being able to deliver a 4th Edition of ECMA - 262 in the first half of 2009 , with at least two real - world implementations ( i.e. two of the four major browsers ) in the wild .
No new features will be added to this release that are not already present in at least three of the four major browsers ( e.g. getters and setters will make it in ) .
The official announcement by Mozilla ’s Brendan Eich can be read at Ajaxian , and the reactions from other JavaScript notables like John Resig , Douglas Crockford , Mike Chambers , and Alex Russell make worthwhile reading ( with varying levels of technical detail ) .
Also , Episode 2 of the newly - launched Open Web Podcast brings a lot of these people together to discuss the change in direction .
What ’s It All Mean ?
Obscure dropped features aside , the fundamental point here is that TC39 has realized the same thing that the W3C was forced to realize about HTML last year : writing standards and hoping that the browsers will follow does n’t work .
No matter how good the W3 C ’s recommendation for XHTML2 looked on paper , it was n’t going to force Microsoft to support it in Internet Explorer .
With HTML 5 , the W3C is letting the browsers try out new ideas , and is forging standards from the good stuff .
Similarly , the members of TC39 could add all the features in the world to ECMAScript 4.0 , but the only way to find out if a feature works on the Web is to build it into a real - world browser first .
Then you can decide if it should make it into the standard .
And now for the obvious question : is CSS next ?
I for one will be keeping a close eye on the W3 C ’s CSS Working Group in the weeks ahead .
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO , California --
Fossil fuels that keep our planet running -- oil , natural gas and coal -- were created from the decomposition of plants , plankton and other organic material over millions of years .
A California lab has developed genetically altered bacteria that eat sugars and excrete a form of diesel oil .
Today , scientists all over the globe are working to create fuels with the same properties but without that pesky 100 million - year wait .
And " renewable petroleum " is now a reality , on a small scale , in some laboratories .
The biotech company LS9 Inc. is using single - celled bacteria to create an oil equivalent .
These petroleum " production facilities " are so small , you can see them only under a microscope .
" We started in my garage two years ago , and we 're producing barrels today , so things are moving pretty quickly , " said biochemist Stephen del Cardayre , LS9 vice president of research and development .
How does it work ?
A special type of genetically altered bacteria are fed plant material : basically , any type of sugar .
They digest it and excrete the equivalent of diesel fuel .
Humans have used bacteria and yeast for centuries to do similar work , creating beer , moonshine and , more recently , ethanol .
But scientists ' recent strides in genetic engineering now allow them to control the end product .
" So these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil , " del Cardayre said .
" They started off like regular lab bacteria that did n't produce oil , but we took genes from nature , we engineered them a bit [ and ] put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil . "
The company is focusing on diesel fuel , but the microbes can be " programmed " to make gasoline or jet fuel .
The bacteria used are a harmless form of E. coli .
And the feedstock , or food for the microbes , can be any type of agricultural product , from sugar cane to waste such as wheat straw and wood chips .
Choosing plants with no food value sidesteps one of the biggest criticisms of another synthetic fuel , corn ethanol , because critics say that corn should be used as food , not fuel .
It takes a lot of microbe poop to fill a gas tank , however .
Biofuel experts say that processes like those used at LS9 are scientifically viable but that there 's still a long way to go before they can address global energy needs .
" Scalability is really the critical issue , " said Robert McCormick , principal engineer at the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado .
" If you 've got something that you can make work in a test tube , that 's good , but you 've got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports . "
But del Cardayre says his product has other benefits over traditional fossil fuels .
" What we 've done is make the same molecules from renewable sources , so that it can go into the existing infrastructure , be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way .
That 's the goal , " he said .
The LS9 product does not have the cancer - causing benzene that is in other fossil fuels and has far less sulfur , he said .
LS9 President Bob Walsh says that using existing petroleum pipelines is crucial .
Ethanol , for example , requires its own distribution system because it can corrode oil pipelines .
" You ca n't put ethanol in a pipeline , [ and ] even your car needs some adjustments to it ; whereas the product we 're making is going into the existing system , and that 's a big difference , " he said .
LS9 expects to be in large - scale commercial production in three or four years .
But del Cardayre is the first to admit that microscopic oil fields are not a silver bullet for the world 's energy woes .
" I doubt we 're going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil , but we 'll certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term , " he said .
Although energy researchers are spending tens of millions of dollars in venture capital , McCormick believes that " just making more " is not enough .
" I think that the answer to reducing our petroleum - import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold , " he said .
" It involves replacement fuels like biofuels , it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today , and it involves driving less . "
One thing that McCormick and del Cardayre agree on is that energy research is a great place to be these days if you are a scientist .
" The fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists , and biochemists and chemical engineers , and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this , and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue , " del Cardayre said .
" Honestly , I could n't think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now , " said McCormick , a chemical engineer .
" Part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem , it can't be solved by a farmer or an ag expert , and it can't be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist .
" We all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy , " he said .
" And the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain on Thursday accused Sen. Barack Obama of breaking a promise when the Democrat decided to forgo public financing in this fall 's campaign .
Sen . Barack Obama repeatedly broke campaign fundraising records during the Democratic primary season .
Obama told supporters in an e-mail message Thursday that he would not accept about $ 85 million in public funds when he becomes the Democratic presidential nominee .
In the e-mail , Obama said the public campaign financing system allowed " special interests [ to ] drown out the voices of the American people " and asked his supporters to " declare our independence from a broken system . "
McCain said that Obama 's move to drop out of the system " should be disturbing to all Americans " and that he may decide to opt out , too .
" Sen . Obama 's reversal on public financing is one of a number of reversals ... that he has taken , " McCain said while touring flood - damaged parts of Iowa .
" This election is about a lot of things , but it 's also about trust .
It 's also about whether you can take people 's word .
...
He said he would stick to his agreement .
He did n't . "
Watch McCain 's attack on Obama »
He said his campaign will reconsider whether to opt out as well .
" We ''l have to reevaluate in light of his decision , " he said .
But he said he leans toward taking public money .
But Rep. Rahm Emanuel , an Obama supporter , argued that the Democrat had " more than realized the objective of public financing " by setting up a system to accept small donations over the Internet .
" It has given the American people a voice in our political process and has forever changed politics in this country by inspiring record numbers of Americans to participate in bringing change to Washington , " Emanuel said .
Despite the heated back - and - forth , CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said it is unlikely the controversy will influence voters .
" I 'm not sure it 's a big deal for most voters .
There 's not a lot of support for the public financing system . "
Schneider said .
" About a year ago , the polls asked people if they supported the idea that candidates and campaigns should be financed by taxpayer money ... and most persons said no .
" They like the idea of financing campaigns through small contributions from a lot of individual contributors , which is what Obama has done , " he said .
Obama would be the first major presidential candidate to drop out of the modern campaign financing system for the general election since its creation in 1976 in the post - Watergate era .
Under this system , candidates agree to spend only the public funds and cannot raise or spend money directly obtained from individuals .
Because he has decided not participate in the system , Obama will be able to spend an unlimited amount of money during the general election .
The two camps also bickered Thursday over whether they had held negotiations on public financing before Obama 's move to drop out .
Obama counsel Bob Bauer said he discussed the public funding issue for 45 minutes with Trevor Potter , his McCain counterpart , on June 6 when they met to talk about a possible town - hall appearance between the candidates .
Potter said the two " spoke in general terms about the public financing system , with Bob outlining reasons it could be considered ' broken ' or irrelevant in 2008 , and I explaining why Sen.
McCain remained committed to it and thought it was good for the country . "
Given his record - breaking ability to raise donations over the Internet , the Illinois Democrat probably will be able to raise more than and outspend the presumptive GOP nominee .
Watch CNN 's Candy Crowley explain the significance of Obama 's decision »
Since January 2007 , Obama has raised more than $ 272 million , including nearly $ 31 million in April .
During that time period , McCain has raised less than half that amount , roughly $ 100 million .
In April , the Arizona Republican brought in about $ 18 million .
The FEC ruled unanimously in March 2007 that presidential candidates could accept general election public financing , provided that they return any money raised for the general election while following certain guidelines .
At the time , Obama 's actions appeared to be a desire on his part to preserve the public financing option while enabling him to raise general election money .
After that ruling , spokesman Bill Burton said , " Sen. Obama is pleased the FEC took this important step in preserving the public financing system , which is why he sought the opinion .
If Sen . Obama is the nominee , he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election . "
McCain is embroiled in controversy over his attempt to withdraw from the primary public financing system .
He entered the program last year when his campaign was strapped for cash , and took a loan using future fundraising -- or the matching funds from the public financing system -- as collateral .
But after his primary victories on Super Tuesday , McCain wrote to the Federal Elections Commission announcing his intent to withdraw from the program .
But the FEC has four vacancies -- and no quorum -- to vote on whether to allow McCain 's withdrawal .
And federal election rules say that a candidate who uses the matching funds as collateral cannot withdraw from the system .
The Democratic National Committee has filed a complaint with the FEC , but the lack of a quorum has stalled assessment of the complaint .
Obama , meanwhile , asked supporters Thursday to " declare our independence from a broken system , and run the type of campaign that reflects the grass - roots values that have already changed our politics and brought us this far . "
The Democrat also attacked McCain and Republicans for taking money from lobbyists and political action committees , and he faulted McCain for not checking the campaign spending of conservative groups independent from his campaign .
" We 've already seen that he's not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so - called 527 groups , who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations , " the e-mail said , referring to independent political advocacy groups that often purchase issue ads independent of the presidential campaigns .
These groups operate under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Service tax code .

If you ask any Australian what the most annoying thing is about TV shows or movies , a common response is that it can take a long time for things popular in the US and UK to make it ' down under ' .
Apparently , the Mafia has picked up on this , as they have started selling pirated movies and TV - shows on the streets , or have they ?
When you get in any sort of reporting , you start to see the same sort of stories crop up .
We ’ve been writing for almost 3 Â ½ years , and even in that short time , and in as narrow a field as I keep an eye on , we see the same things crop up .
In that way , it ’s like fashion , except instead of cycles of 20 - 30 years , its often only 3 - 4 .
One such example comes courtesy of yesterday ’s The Australian .
Under a headline of “ Organized Crime gets into Video Piracy ” is a number of claims .
“ DVD and other piracy can now be more profitable than drug trafficking , ” AFACT ’s director of operations Neil Gane told The Australian .
“ That ’s why crime organizations are going into it . ”
It might not sound familiar to some of you , but a similar claim was made some four years and 9500 miles away , in the UK .
Back then , during a campaign called “ piracy is a crime ” they made similar allegations ( see the top of this page , court .
wayback machine ) , allegations that did n’t stand up to scrutiny back then , when we first encountered them .
Do these ?
Well , the article in question makes use of the infamous LEK study , and even the MPAA knows it ’s inaccurate ( pdf ) .
So , it ’s not exactly off to the best of starts .
Unfortunately , that ’s also the only start .
Despite a trawl of the websites and press releases put out by the two organizations ( theÂ otherÂ being Â Foxtel ) , there isÂ only oneÂ recent link ( doc ) between drugs and ‘ piracy ’ and that is the prosecution of ONE MAN just over a month ago , for cultivating cannabis , and what is described as ‘ multiple copyright offenses ’ .
So , we ’ve gone from one guy , with 3,300 movies +
TV shows and growing some cannabis ( total punishment , 7 month suspended sentence , and a 2 year good behavior order ) to Organized Crime .
Despite the utter failure of the similar campaign in the UK years earlier ( where the only thing remaining of the campaign is the ‘ You would n’t steal a … ” advert ) Australia seems determined to try and make it work .
However , there is a plus side , in that AFACT have established a market price it believes consumers feel to be the worth of a DVD .
In all their estimations of yearly capacity , they give a ‘ street value ’ of roughly $ 5AUS , which is about $ 4.77 US ( 3 Euros , or Â £ 2.40 ) .
In this they differ from the campaign in the UK , where the value given was some 20 times greater .
In this , while telling lies , they are also more truthful .
In the end , no ‘ criminal gang ’ will forego their drugs , weapons or other lucrative money - making operations for DVD piracy .
The reasoning is as plain as it is simple .
With drugs , or guns they have small , highly valuable goods that ca n’t be easily obtained elsewhere .
As the world becomes increasingly connected , and peer - to - peer becomes simpler to use , more reliable , less time consuming AND more powerful , the potential returns on selling bootleg DVDs reduces , ask Tony .
Ten years ago , people had dial - up , and hard drives were maybe big enough for 2 - 3 DVDs .
Now you can buy terabyte hard drives , and even the TorrentFreak researcher , living in the middle of rural Georgia , 10 miles from the nearest shops , has an 8 M bit connection .
The reasons for comparisons become clear when you hear the comments of Foxtel ’s head of Fraud , Mark Mulready ( a ‘ former police prosecutor and detective ’ ) , who told The Australian “ Police should have all the same investigative tools to fight piracy they currently have for organised drug trafficking or money laundering , ” so , as usual , it ’s about not having to spend time and money on civil cases , but having the taxpayer foot the bill , and the ability to use law enforcement to patch their business model .
Rehashing failed campaigns is a sign that the industry has no new ideas , and is desperately trying to avoid dealing with the root of the problem , themselves and their greed .
WhenÂ even the police are so into ‘ piracy ’ , that there are too many to prosecute , it ’s time to stop sticking your head in the sand , and deal with the causes .
By Way of Introduction
SUCCESS comes to the man who so works that his efforts will bring the most and the best results -- not to the man who simply works hard .
It is the know - how , things - to - do - with and economy that count .
Labor - saving machinery has revolutionized many a trade and industry .
It has made farming an industry and a science of possibilities undreamed of and unattainable a hundred years ago .
But it is not enough for the modern farm to be equipped with the best tools and machinery that shops and factories turn out , to know how to use them and keep them in repair .
There are many handy devices , not made in any factory and not sold in any store , that every intelligent man can make himself , which save money and labor and time .
Inventive men are constantly contriving simple but valuable things to meet the needs of their own practical experience .
We are all the time hunting after and gathering these ideas .
Now we are putting a lot of the best ones into this book .
We are trying , by words and pictures , to explain clearly just how to make each device .
Everything described is tried and practical .
Some are old , many are new , all are good for the purpose intended .
They represent the practical , successful experience of farmers and other wide - awake workers all over the United States .
This book is broader than its title .
The overflow of good measure includes a valuable chapter on the steel square and its uses .
Nowhere else has this subject been handled in a way so easily understood , with confusing mathematics cut out .
We especially commend this chapter to our readers .
We also present some good house and barn plans , that will be appreciated by those who contemplate building .
In addition to the direct benefit to be derived from doing what the book tells how to do , we have in mind the larger purpose of education toward putting more thought into our work and doing what we have to do the easiest , the cheapest and the quickest way .
Out of it all , we trust our readers will make progress toward greater prosperity , greater happiness and greater usefulness .

Introduction
Since this series began , I 've been asked one question over and over .
How do I build a poker bot for Poker Stars and / or Full Tilt ?
How do I extract text from the game chat window ?
How do I snoop on hand history and log files as they 're generated ?
Today we 're going to answer that question .
As of this writing , Poker Stars is the most popular poker venue not only in the world , but in the history of poker .
Online or brick - and - mortar , it does n't matter .
There 's not currently , and there never has been , another card room in which so many people congregate so routinely to play poker for such sums of money .
If you took one of the largest buildings in the world — for example , the Lockheed - Martin manufacturing plant in Fort Worth , Texas ...
... and filled it with tables , stretching off into the distance , you 'd have yourself a casino which could handle maybe 1 % of Poker Stars traffic .
Maybe 5 % if you pack them like sardines .
With well over 120,000 players at peak hours , Poker Stars is n't really a card room at all .
It 's a small city .
Controlled by a mysterious group of investors , operating behind the veil of privacy .
Nothing wrong with privacy ; given the politics surrounding online poker , I positively understand it .
But in the absence of hard information , rumors abound : Poker Stars is owned by a group of top poker players ; a cadre of eccentric billionaires ; foreign governments ; you name it .
I challenge anyone reading this ( other than Poker Stars staff and other industry insiders ) to answer the question :
Who owns Poker Stars ?
Who owns Rational Entertainment Enterprises , Ltd . ?
Because that 's a tough nut to crack , when you 're on the outside looking in .
And inquiring minds want to know .
Building a Monitor Bot for Poker Stars and Full Tilt
Anyway , we 're going to build a little application which is capable of extracting complete table and game information from the Poker Stars client .
Hole cards , board cards , player actions , you name it .
We 'll call it the " MonitorBot " although it 's not technically a bot since this one ( unlike last week 's FoldBot ) does n't actually click any buttons .
Here 's what it looks like .
Nothing too snazzy as you can see ...
Did I mention that one thing today 's bot will not do , is click any buttons on your behalf ?
It 's only purpose is to gather information .
Because it does n't automate your play , use of this tool does not constitute a violation of typical online poker EULAs .
In fact , all of the information retrieved by this tool can be extracted by publically available tools such as Spy ++ and others .
But notice that we 're displaying game chat text ( in real time ) in the top right window , and notice that we 're displaying log file text ( in real time ) in the middle window .
Getting access to this text cleanly can be a little tricky .
The Techniques
Several techniques are demonstrated in today 's article .
I 've broken these out into separate posts .
How I Built a Working Online Poker Bot , Part 6 : Guerilla - Style File Monitoring on Windows with C# and C++ explains how to snoop on poker client hand history and log files as they 're generated , in real time .
We 'll build a simple file monitor application that can be pointed at any poker client ( or any other application ) to get a real - time view not only of the files it 's creating and opening , but the data it 's writing to and reading from those files .
And we 'll introduce C# into the botting series for the first time .
How I Built a Working Online Poker Bot , Part 7 : Extracting Text from 3rd -Party Applications describes how to snoop on text drawn by external , 3rd - party applications .
It also demonstrates a few GDI " parlor tricks " you may not have seen before .
Then in Part 8 ( coming sooner than you think ) we 'll take these techniques in a direction you might not have anticipated .
It should be interesting .
Stay tuned .
Running the Poker Stars MonitorBot
In order to run the above application , you 'll need to do two things :
Download and build the source code ( and this time , no Boost libraries !
And no NMAKE ! )
Download and install Poker Stars ( www.pokerstars.com) and / or Full Tilt ( www.fulltiltpoker.com) and set up a play - money account .
Once you 've downloaded and installed Poker Stars , you 'll need to set your dealer message verbosity to " Everything " as shown here :
Repeat the above step on Full Tilt .
Then follow these steps to see the MonitorBot in action :
Launch the Monitor Bot executable ( XPokerBot.EXE ) .
Click the " Launch Poker Client " button and browse to the location of the main Poker Stars executable .
On most systems , this will be in C : \Program Files\PokerStars\PokerStars.exe .
Alternately , browse to Full Tilt .
You should see the Poker Stars client launch .
Messages will start to appear in the MonitorBot user interface .
Open one or more Poker Stars game tables .
If the tables do n't appear in the MonitorBot UI , jiggle the table window by bringing the MonitorBot UI to the foreground , and then bringing the poker table window to the foreground , etc .
This is due to a quirk in the underlying Window detection logic .
( Optionally ) open the Full Tilt client ( FULLTILTPOKER.EXE ) using the same " Launch Poker Client " button , and open some Full Tilt tables .
Limitations
The MonitorBot is a demonstrative application , not a working poker bot .
As a result :
It only works with Texas Hold 'em tables on Poker Stars , Full Tilt , and Poker Time .
It only works with Windows XP .
It may or may not work on Windows Vista .
MonitorBot does n't display hole cards in the UI like the FoldBot did .
Instead it demonstrates how to pluck these cards from the log file and / or game text windows .
It 's intended to show you techniques which you can use in your own applications , or to serve as a " starter kit " which you can embellish .
Hey !
Where are the hole cards ?
Different online poker clients emit different information into the game chat window .
Some of them , such as Poker Time , display your hole cards in this window ; others , like Poker Stars , do n't .
But in that case they may emit hole cards into the log file ( as on Poker Stars ) or into the hand history file ( as on most poker clients , although there are timing issues ) .
And in any case , there are other ways to go about getting the hole cards .
The point of today 's post is to show you one way ( out of several ) to access the three basic types of text emitted by the client ...
Game chat window text .
Log file text .
Hand history text .
Once you have access to that text , what you do with it is up to you .
Building the Source Code
This week 's project is much easier to build than the FoldBot we looked at last week .
No more Boost !
By popular demand , clean regular expressions are gone in favor of low - level , error - prone , but considerably easier - to - build string manipulations .
!
By popular demand , clean regular expressions are gone in favor of low - level , error - prone , but considerably easier - to - build string manipulations .
No more NMAKE !
This project uses the Detours library , but I 've included separate Visual Studio projects for detours.dll and the Detours marker DLL .
So what are you waiting for ?
Download the MonitorBot source code ( C++/ Windows 157KB ) .
Conclusion — Where 's the AI ?
As interesting as inter-application command and control techniques can be , I think you 'll find the A.I. aspects of bot - building even more interesting .
We 've been busy laying out the framework for the bot 's eyes ( input ) and hands ( output ) but we 'll return to the A.I — the brain — before too long .
For those of you who are new to poker botting , we 'll discuss how to build an A.I. from scratch , and we 'll talk about how to leverage existing commercial bots as programmatically callable components inside your " master " bot .
And whether you 're new to poker botting or not , we 'll discuss hand evaluation and comparison , game theory and the nuts and bolts of ICM calculation , rules - based vs. heuristic approaches , the importance of table selection , and much more .
And at some point we 'll say hello to some of the other communities and poker - programming sites that are out there , commercial or otherwise .
Until then , good luck in your poker and programming endeavors .
Comic Transcript
PHIL : Hallo Alice .
I ’ve been thinking about what you said earlier today .
ALICE : About not dressing better than Brian during office hours ?
PHIL : That too — no , I mean about how we need to come up with a brand and lifestyle identity in order to give Apple the old run for their money .
ALICE : Yeah , tricky problem .
Apple already has the squeaky clean image locked down tight .
If we tried to move in on it our customers would just laugh .
PHIL : You ’re probably right .
But we do n’t need to try to compete for the same image .
We need to use an image , project a lifestyle , that people will like better .
ALICE : What are you talking about ?
Everybody wants to be the Mac guy .
PHIL : Only in comparison to his comic foil .
But that ’s the thing —
Apple is selling a comedy .
We need to sell something that will make the customer feel they ’re buying into an epic lifestyle .
Something gritty and powerful .
Something that will take our most commonly perceived flaws and make them an essential part of the overall image .
( CUT TO : Office , shown in black and white .
A man in a fedora slumps behind a wooden desk , his head covered .
The window blinds are drawn . )
NARRATOR : The pain in my head and the half - empty bottle of Scotch on my desk told me everything I needed to know about the night before .
I ’d crashed ; now I was rebooting .
That ’s the way it works in this concrete jungle of empty promises and broken dreams .
This is my city .
I ’m a PC .
Russia handed out passports to the residents of the two provinces , which have long looked to Moscow for support , five years ago .
The Kremlin has justified its invasion of Georgia in terms of defending its citizens in Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgian " aggression " .
Barack Obama no doubt could have lived without the nod he recently received from now - retired Cuban President Fidel Castro , who called the Democratic presidential contender " the most advanced candidate " in America 's presidential race .
And today , John McCain received the type of backing from a foreign leader that he would just as soon forego .
Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi , at a joint news conference with President Bush in Rome , initially demurred when asked about the U.S. election , saying , " I can not express any preference with regard to an electoral campaign going on in another country .
But he then quickly added , " I suppose I could express my own personal preference for one of the candidates : the Republican candidate .
And this is for a very selfish reason , and that is that I would no longer be the oldest person at the upcoming ( summit of the eight leading industrial nations ) , because McCain is a month older than me . "
McCain turns 72 on Aug. 29 and , as much of the nation will be able to recite by the time the November vote rolls along ( and as a website we recently wrote about is devoted to spotlighting ) , a victory would make him the oldest person to win a first White House term .
Berlusconi gets points for doing his homework -- he is exactly one month younger than McCain .

Muthanna Dulaimi was caught while planting a roadside bomb !
The son of the leader of the Iraqi Accord Front , which has cabinet seats in the government of PM Nuri al - Maliki and from which one vice president derives , appears to be an active terrorist !
Questions have swirled for some time about Adnan Dulaimi and his sons ’ connections to the Sunni Arab guerrilla movement .
Of course , some of the Shiite parties in parliament , including the Badr Organization and the Sadr movement , have also been involved in political violence .
The security agreement nearly completed between the Bush administration and the government of the Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki may pull the rug out from under Sen.
John McCain on Iraq , according to AP .
It will stipulate that US troops will be out of Iraqi cities by June , 2009 and then mostly out of Iraq by 2011 .
In that light , it will be much harder for McCain to paint Obama as “ surrendering ” or wanting to “ cut and run , ” since his withdrawal plan is very close to what Bush and the Iraqi government have agreed on .
McCain ’s position on having long - term bases in Iraq a la South Korea was always pie in the sky , because it assumed that it was a decision he as president would get to make all by himself .
Neither the Iraqi parliament nor Congress will likely actually put up with such a policy .
Why McCain has n’t been called on this by the Dems is mysterious to me .
Why not do an ad ?
“ McCain says he wants long term bases in Iraq .
But that is not what the elected government of Iraq says it wants .
Is he going to invade again to get what he wants ? ”
AP reviews Bush ’s flip - flop on the timetable issue .
The Shiite government of al - Maliki is mounting a campaign to arrest hundreds of leaders in the Awakening Council movement among Sunni Arabs , which the US military created and paid for as a way of getting Iraqis to fight fundamentalist radicals ( “ al - Qaeda ” ) .
Although the McCain camp confuses the temporary troop escalation of 2007 - 2008 and the Awakening Council policy , in fact they were two different tracks .
Other observers have argued that neither was as important as the massive ethnic cleansing of neighborhoods in Baghdad and elsewhere , in leading to a reduction of civilian deaths ( no one left to kill of the other sect in a lot of neighborhoods ) .
The big question is whether al - Maliki can keep the peace in Sunni Arab neighborhoods without the assistance of the Awakening Councils .
General David Petraeus , who has long been at loggerheads with al - Maliki over the Awakening Councils confirms to McClacthy that the Iraqi government has been dragging its feet on absorbing fighters from the Awakening Councils into government security forces .
Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad are afraid that militias are returning to them .
Shu ’la , Abu Dashir and Sadr City had seen a big reduction in Mahdi Army and other militia activity in the past few months , but there are troubling indications of a resurgence , some residents say .
Sadiq , who opened a music shop in Abu Dashir on the assurance of a return of security , was dismayed to see it fire - bombed , costing him a substantial investment .
A note from the perpetrators accused him of contravening Islamic law ( radical fundamentalists dislike music but it is not actually banned in mainstream Islamic law ) .
Some residents of Shiite neighborhoods have begun again receiving personal threat letters .
Such individual threats have been a major reason for the refugee crisis , since people tend to move out if they know a militia is gunning for them and knows where they live .
The personal threat also prolongs the refugee crisis , since it is extremely invasive and victims are hard to convince that the threat has subsided ; if they think the militia is still there waiting for them and will view their return as a capital crime , they wo n’t go back .
All the celebrating on the American Right about the “ war ” being “ won ” and security having returned is awfully premature , as Gen. Petraeus has underlined .
Not only did the Iraq War siphon off enormous resources from the US military effort in Afghanistan , it also provided the neo-Taliban with a model for fighting US and NATO troop presences .
[ Stop press , March 15 , 2009 : El Salvador : Victorious FMLN candidate promises `to benefit the poor rather than the rich ' ]
By the National Committee of the War Veterans ' Sector of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN )
El Salvador has entered a governance crisis the signs of which include the bare participation by the general public in the life of the nation .
There is no attempt by the government to achieve consensus , or a will to reach agreement on public policy ; and there is no tolerance of even a minimal participation by the citizenry in public affairs .
Disillusion and scepticism are the predominant feelings amongst the general public .
The country 's institutional structures are weak and poorly developed .
This impacts even upon political parties , which neither express nor channel popular demands and lack the capacity to play an intermediary role in the conflicts caused by the demands of different sectors of society .
Separation of powers exists only on paper -- the centralism of the executive power predominates .
There are no oversight bodies , accountability systems or freedom of information , which has led to high levels of corruption .
This has produced , in consequence , an erosion of the country 's institutional structures and of democracy .
Poverty and inequality
The governance crisis is also founded in a lack of equality , which finds its expression in increased poverty , caused by economic and political imbalances .
Rural life has collapsed .
There is accelerated urbanisation , pressure on public services , employment and public safety ; accelerated emigration .
In the urban setting , employment opportunities are mostly absorbed by the informal sector , with the risks this entails for workers .
Men predominate in regular employment and women in the informal sector and in maquiladora assembly plants , which means they are less protected .
Schooling is low level and poorly funded , which does not favour the technological development required for an increase in productivity .
Crime has worsened as a result of these inequalities .
Law and order is a recurring public concern .
A range of studies on the matter have produced recommendations for the development of public policies aimed at preventing , containing and addressing the situation , but the government has not shown much political will and its approach to the issue has been counterproductive and increased the problem to some degree .
Authoritarianism
As there has been no plan aimed at bringing about a lessening of social divisions , there has not been any democratisation of society and the state , but rather a greater concentration of power and greater authoritarianism .
Inequality and authoritarianism have damaged the legitimacy of democracy and the political system .
As socioeconomic conditions have worsened , people 's demands upon the government have grown and governments usually resort to repressive measures to maintain the status quo , which is easy to do in an authoritarian society .
The country 's viability requires the wealthy , the government and the social forces to arrive at minimal accords to reduce inequality .
Accords have been the usual practice only amongst sectors with much in common , not with adversaries .
Accords have been between the senior leadership of political parties , not with the sectors affected .
The alliances proposed by previous governments as a governance and transparency tool were very soon forgotten .
At present we have the practice of isolation , sociopolitical conflict , imposition , confrontation and polarisation instead of accords .
Democracy
Democracy is unsustainable with such large social divisions .
Governance , to be consistent , should be accompanied by viable proposals and / or should close these gaps .
Democracy cannot be built with institutional structures lacking in legitimacy .
Democracy also requires active social participation in the government .
This does not just mean good electoral results .
It is related , as well , to the channelling of social demands , social , legal and legitimate control .
The democratic sustainability of the country is nourished by the preparation of pacts or accords , public discussion of problems and the prevention of conflicts .

Mauricio Funes , the FMLN candidate for hope
Excerpt from Amanda Shank , Upside Down World , http://upsidedownworld.org/main/content/view/1282/1/
May 13 , 2008 -- Mauricio
Funes steps into the hotel surrounded by his campaign staff and supporters .
Earlier in the afternoon in the hot Central Plaza of San Miguel , he was greeted with cheers , chants and fireworks by 8000 supporters donning FMLN red .
Amid the excitement and exhaustion of El Salvador ’s presidential campaign , where the FMLN has a strong possibility of breaking the right - wing ARENA party 's 19 - year grip on power , Funes searches the hotel lobby for his wife .
Vanda Pignato checks her watch , 10 pm , and suggests that they should order dinner from Wendy's .
It 's the only place open this late .
“ Let 's do this interview before dinner , Mauricio ” , Vanda advises , “ but change your shirt , first ” .
Energised by the day 's successful events , Funes stops to think and admits that he could use a couple of minutes alone .
He has already appeared at three public events , and held an afternoon press conference .
With a packed agenda and plans to leave next week for Germany and then Brazil , he had to back out of a radio interview and turn down an invitation from a nearby community that had organised a welcome celebration .
After a ten - minute break in his room , Funes returns with a new shirt and invites me to take a seat at a nearby table in the hotel 's outdoor restaurant .
When I ask the first question , he speaks quickly and clearly , an ability that he has practiced and refined throughout 21 years of professional journalism and six months on the campaign trail .
Q : From the election of Hugo Chavez to the recent election of Paraguay 's Fernando Lugo we ’ve seen a leftward shift in Latin American countries .
Where does the FMLN and your candidacy fit within this movement ?
We are often asked , ``Well , what type of left do you represent ? ’’ , and I have said : “ We represent the left of hope .
We are a sensible left , a reasonable left , a left that is betting on change , a stable change .
We are looking for a type of society that builds functioning institutions in El Salvador , a democracy that functions , a viable nation .
Given the current international context , we do not aspire to build socialism in El Salvador .
What we hope to build is a more dynamic and competitive economy , placing ourselves in the international playing field in a highly globalised and competitive world .
We hope to have a stronger and more dynamic economy than what has been built up until now .
To do this we need the institutions that work , and for democracy to become a symbol that also exists in our country .
We do not need to be close to Chavez , close to Lula or close to Bush in order for our institutions and democracy to work .
What we need is to build a model of public management that responds to the needs of Salvadorans and that will resolve Salvadoran problems .
We respect the process being followed in Venezuela , as well as we respect and closely watch the new society which Lula is building , and the one that the new President Fernando Lugo in Paraguay has promised to build .
Those processes are a response to other circumstances .
What we hope to build are relationships based on cooperation and solidarity with the people represented by each one of these countries .
However , we are not going to follow the same recipe or model that might have worked in other countries , but has nothing to do with our reality ...
People 's Government Program of Hope
1. Completely founded in human rights
All public policy and government action will be built upon , and aimed at reaching , the greatest degree of effectiveness in human rights , to better meet the essential needs and aspirations of the Salvadorean people , the basis of the legitimation of democratic governance which will begin with the Social and Democratic Inclusiveness Program .
2. Informed by gender policy Despite struggles , women still suffer discrimination and exclusion from decision making .
Thus , for the People 's Government , the exercise of democracy begins precisely with widening the spaces which rightly belong to women as co-actors in the history , present and future of El Salvador .
3. Environmental rehabilitation
The People ’s Government immensely values all life forms in the Salvadorean - Middle American ecosystem .
4. Local level strengthening
The inclusiveness model proposed by the new government stems from an understanding that El Salvador ’s development will include local development and co-ordinated gearing - up of its municipalities and regions .
5. Independent Integration in Central America
The new government is integrationist and will launch an initiative , involving all the country 's social and economic forces willing to contribute to the deepening of Central American and Caribbean integration , from the standpoint of the real interests of the people of El Salvador and the country 's economic strengths , as well of those of our sister peoples .
This means seeking benefits for people ; an increase in our domestic and regional capacities ; the promotion of knowledge ; scientific and technological innovation ; social rights ; and environmental sustainability .
FMLN War Veterans ’ campaign for 2009 elections
We , FMLN war veterans , were the driving force behind the foundation of the FMLN on 10 October 1980 , and in addition we were the only vanguard force in the Salvadorean left , forged in the popular struggles of our people and in urban and rural guerrilla warfare in the decade of the 1970s .
Our aim was to take political power through armed revolutionary struggle to bring about social transformation with a people 's revolutionary government for the benefit of El Salvador 's poor majorities .
All non-violent and political roads to power had been closed off to us , roads which the Salvadorean people sought at the time , as shown in practice through the massive demonstrations of all sectors of our people which took place in the very centre of San Salvador , demanding political , economic and social changes , and which were responded to by the fascist dictatorship governments of the day , with killing and repression of students , workers , peasants and any social sector which mobilised and protested .
In 1972 and again in 1977 , the political opposition of our Salvadorean people won the presidency through the ballot box and both times was shamefully robbed of victory by the right wing and the military .
What we confronted was a military dictatorship under the direct political , military , economic , ideological and intelligence control of the US governments of the day .
The right - wing in our own country was considered the most stubborn and murderous in Latin America .
It made use of all the US was able to develop in terms of counterinsurgency warfare in order to defeat us , as they thought .
For 12 years we fought them with success , and we can therefore now say , with pride , that we , the War Veterans ' Sector of the FMLN , are the moral and historic reserve stock of the FMLN Party , and as such we can and should transmit our experience to the Salvadorean people , together with all our militancy , as adapted , of course , to the current historical and political moment in El Salvador .
As veterans we have every capacity to train contingents of new comrades who will join and strengthen the party , in political schools based upon revolutionary principles .
In other words , the FMLN is the party born of the people and which cost tens of thousands of deaths of heroes and martyrs of the Salvadorean people .
Therefore , as war veterans we have both the duty and the right to keep on developing and strengthening it to make it capable of taking political power in 2009 , which is what our dead dreamt of , those who fell in the course of our struggle in past decades .
The signing of the Peace Accords on January 16 , 1992 , closed off a chapter in our history as the FMLN and as the people of El Salvador .
War came to an end , weapons were silenced .
We and the government signed for peace , aware that peace was not only signed for on paper ; the peace we signed for would have to be with dignity and social justice , that is , with benefits in education , health , housing , nutrition and other aspects for all the marginalised of our country .
And above all with respect for the human rights of the people of El Salvador , a transformation of the legal system and an end to impunity in all areas of power .
We knew that we had not achieved political power , but that we had managed to dismantle the military dictatorship which had been deeply entrenched for over 100 years .
We also knew that with the signing of the Peace Accords we had opened the way towards a real democracy which would have to be built together with the people , making full use of the opportunities opened up through the negotiations and that could not be gone back on .
But now practically the opposite is happening .
Once peace was signed , our party the FMLN worked to transform itself into a political party which could participate legally in Salvadorean politics , since that is a requirement laid down in our constitution , in order to take part in elections .
Over the past five years we have been making an effort to organise FMLN war veterans ( both men and women ) with the aim of continuing the struggle to change our country into a more just society with a place for everybody .

In pictures : Kashmir in turmoil
At least 11 people were killed and many injured when security forces in Indian - administered Kashmir opened fire on stone - throwing Muslim protesters .
Thousands defied a curfew in Srinagar and other towns in the mainly Muslim Kashmir valley for a second day .
One person died in clashes in Jammu region .
The curfew was imposed ahead of the burial of a senior separatist who died after police opened fire on Monday .
Tensions are rising and threaten peace hopes after years of relative calm .
Officials say Tuesday 's death toll stands at 14 , after two people succumbed to injuries sustained a day earlier .
The BBC's Chris Morris in Delhi says Kashmir is now dangerously polarised , in a dispute which began over the control of a small piece of land .
A curfew has been imposed in all 10 districts in the Kashmir valley for the first time in 13 years .
We have imposed a curfew to ensure the peaceful burial of Sheikh Aziz
Police chief Kuldeep Khuda
Violence threatens Kashmir peace Views on Kashmir land row Protests and counter - protests have been taking place for weeks in the valley and in the mainly Hindu region around the city of Jammu further south .
The demonstrations in the valley are some of the biggest since a separatist rebellion against Indian rule broke out nearly 20 years ago .
More than 20 people - Muslims and Hindus - have been killed and hundreds wounded in clashes with police since the unrest began in June .
' Freedom '
Security forces opened fire on Tuesday on a number of protests by Muslims who defied the curfew .
The violence is spreading
The army fired to disperse a procession in the northern district of Bandipora , killing three people and injuring five .
Three other people were killed in the Lasjan and Rainawari areas .
" We have imposed a curfew to ensure the peaceful burial of Sheikh Aziz , " local police chief Kuldeep Khuda told reporters .
Shops , businesses , schools and colleges in the valley have all been closed , and other separatist leaders are under house arrest .
In the Jammu region , one person was killed and more than a dozen injured after Hindus and Muslims clashed in the town of Kishtwar .
Houses , vehicles and other property were damaged before police opened fire to restore order .
No other violence has been reported from the Jammu region .
Sheikh Aziz was a prominent leader of the All Party Hurriyat Conference , an umbrella of separatist groups which opposes Indian rule .
Large crowds gathered at the main mosque in Srinagar to attend his funeral .
Mourners shouted slogans against India including " We want freedom " .
Police say they are trying to find out why security forces opened fire on protesters on Monday .
Police say several of their personnel were injured by stones thrown by those at the protest .
Pilgrims Sheikh Aziz was among thousands of protesters who marched on Monday towards the Line of Control ( LoC ) , the de facto border with Pakistani - controlled Kashmir .

They were supporting fruit growers seeking to sell their produce .
Muslims in the Kashmir valley complain that supplies of food and medicines are running short .
And they say crops of fruit which should have been sent to market are rotting away because Hindus are blockading a key road that links the valley with the rest of India .
The government , which denies the blockade , says lorries are moving between the two regions with security escorts .
Violent demonstrations began two months ago in the state when a decision to transfer a small area of land to the trust which runs a Hindu shrine provoked an angry Muslim reaction .
When the land transfer was abandoned , groups from the state 's Hindu minority began furious protests of their own .
Our correspondent says the government was slow to realise how volatile the situation had become - and opposition parties were quick to try to use the situation to their own political advantage .
The result is that Kashmir is more divided along communal lines than it has been for years .

What are these ?
In the event that it is ever actually built , the Freedom Ship , " the world 's first mobile , floating city " , will have to be constructed at sea : there is n't a port on the planet that would be big enough to accommodate it .
" Imagine a mile - long stretch of 25 - storey buildings in New York City ; now imagine that floating on the water , " one reporter wrote , after detailed plans were released a few years ago .
As it turned out , " imagine " proved a well - chosen verb .
But there was no denying the breathtaking ambition of the Freedom Ship 's designers : artists ' impressions showed a gargantuan , flat - bottomed slab of glass and concrete , 340 ft high , capable of housing 60,000 people and topped with several aeroplane runways .
The QE2 was pictured alongside , for comparative purposes ; it looked like some kind of tugboat .
On board the Freedom Ship would be schools , hospitals , banks , light manufacturing industries , shops , restaurants and 200 acres of open space , according to its chief engineer , a modern - day Noah from Florida called Norman Nixon .
There would be no local taxes .
" It will follow the sun - it will be better than a land - based city , " the head of marketing told anyone who asked .
By 2002 , 3,000 families and businesses had reportedly signed up to live and work on it , although Nixon himself adopted a wry tone that seemed to acknowledge the absurd vastness of his plans .
" As soon as I build this joker , " he told Fox News , " I 'm going to retire and live on it . "
But some things are easier said than done , especially when it comes to building giant floating cities weighing 2.7 m tonnes , and recently a downbeat statement signed by Nixon appeared on the Freedom Ship 's website .
It uses too many quotation marks , and devotes several lines to a bizarre attack on Wikipedia , but the gist is clear .
" We were ... contacted by a group of people who we thought in the beginning had a serious interest in the ship [ but ] wanted nothing more than to use us for a ' scam ' , " Nixon claims .
There then follows a string of accusations and allegations of financial impropriety : " So , as you might guess , we have a major lawsuit against everyone involved . "
Things are at a standstill " while the lawyers get to work .
We could get moving if we could find $ 150 m , but as of now we do n't have that kind of money . "
Nixon is currently busy running a long - shot campaign for the US presidency .
Perhaps you need to be an eccentric to dream on this kind of scale , and maybe it 's inevitable that you 'll attract scam artists along the way .
Several times , in recent decades , different groups have proposed building floating cities at sea , but almost always their plans have collapsed amid acrimony , alleged criminality or lawsuits , along with a chronic lack of funds .
Mostly , they have been Americans of a libertarian bent , intent on escaping the yoke of government , especially taxes , and embarking on a kind of endless retirement cruise .
But last month the idea re-emerged in a different form : what if colonising the oceans were to become not just a libertarian escape fantasy , but an environmental necessity ?
A young Belgian architect , Vincent Callebaut , unveiled Project Lilypad , a vision of a " floating ecopolis " , shaped like a giant waterlily , that could house tens of thousands of people forced from their homes by rising sea levels .
" It will be one of the major challenges of the 21st century to find ways to accommodate environmental migrants , " he says .
According to the UN's International Panel on Climate Change , sea levels will probably continue to rise for centuries even if greenhouse gas emissions are stabilised ; they could rise by as much as 81 cm this century , enough to devastate areas such as the islands of Kiribati and the Maldives , and parts of Bangladesh .
The Netherlands is spending huge sums to reinforce its dykes , Callebaut notes , and the United Arab Emirates is building expensive new land , near sea level , in the Palm Jumeirah reclamation project .
But both solutions can only ever be sticking - plasters .
" The Lilypad , " he says , " would be a long - term solution to the water rising . "
The notion is ridiculous , of course : another chapter in the long history of urban futurology , according to which we were all supposed to be travelling in airborne bubble - cars by now .
And yet there 's something bewitching about Callebaut 's designs .
The Lilypad is calming even to look at ; it feels like something that might have evolv ed naturally .
The steel and glass that dominate the Freedom Ship are relegated to second place behind the flowing contours of three " mountain ridges " , covered in vegetation and hollow within .
Where the real - life lily is weighted and balanced by its central submerged stalk , the Lilypad has a glass - walled , underwater , bowl - shaped space that could be used for commercial and leisure facilities .
Technical details are notably lacking from Callebaut 's vision - he does n't even pretend to estimate how much it would cost to build - but the general idea is that it could be self - sustaining , using various forms of renewable energy and collecting and purifying rainwater in a central lake .
Its titanium dioxide skin could absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
" The whole city is covered by a stratum of suspended gardens , " Callebaut says .
" The goal is to create a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature . "
One of his images pictures Lilypad floating between the islands of the Maldives .
It does n't look like an emergency solution to a nightmarish crisis : it looks like a beautiful addition to the view .
But it did n't take long for the old problems of egos and allegations of underhand behaviour to assert themselves .
The media excitement over the designs overlooked the striking similarity they bore to Mermaid , a project created by a Danish architect , Julien de Smedt .
Mermaid was envisaged as something far more modest : a floating " wellness resort " , with a water park at its centre .
It was designed to accommodate far fewer people , but that was n't enough to prevent De Smedt from growing angry at the attention Callebaut 's images received .
" We have been running a case on him , " says De Smedt , whose firm has been investigating Callebaut 's other work to look for instances of plagiarism .
" He 's a strange character .
His project is on another scale , but it 's the same : the shape , the three peaks , everything .
In my view , it is totally driven by our work . "
( When I asked for his response to this allegation , Callebaut stopped communicating with me . )
The idea for the Mermaid , De Smedt says , came to him almost by chance : " Our client wanted this wellness resort , but he did n't feel it was suited to Denmark , so he started asking the question of whether we should think of another location .
I suggested designing an island . "
A Middle Eastern investor is now interested , and engineering feasibility studies have been carried out , De Smedt says - all of which suggests another difference that may soon distinguish the Mermaid from the Lilypad , and from every other fantasy of a floating metropolis that anyone has ever entertained : it might really exist .
People have dreamed of colonising the oceans for decades , but they 've generally glossed over the practical challenges .
Their minds have been on higher things - specifically , creating new nations to which their founders could escape and live in peace , untroubled by the actions of governments , or by other people in general .
Their projects have had names such as the Free State Project , Laissez - Faire City , Libertocracy and New Utopia .
As is common in the world of libertarian politics , the language in which they speak of their plans tends to be tetchy and misanthropic , dripping with contempt for the ordinary herd .
" Most people never leave ' home ' - they grit their teeth and simply endure whatever their ' home ' government throws at them , as if no possible alternative exists , " writes Prince Lazarus Long , ruling monarch of the as - yet nonexistent principality of New Utopia , which he plans to build on concrete platforms perched on the Misteriosa Bank , a submerged atoll in the Caribbean .
( Long was born Howard Turney ; he changed his name to that of a character in a science fiction novel . )
" A small - but growing - number of individuals ... refuse to confine themselves to the advantages and drawbacks of just one country , " he continues .
Taxation will be illegal in New Utopia , and Long claims that more than 3,200 people have paid a fee to register as the first citizens .
Unfortunately , there will first be some hurdles to overcome : in 2000 , the US Securities and Exchange Commission declared New Utopia to be a " fraudulent nationwide internet scheme " , accusing Long of making tens of thousands of dollars from the sale of bogus securities .
He insists it is legitimate , and is ploughing ahead .
On a handful of occasions , such schemes have become reality - perhaps most famously in the case of Sealand , the unofficial " micronation " on a structure off the Suffolk coast that was used as a second world war fort .
Sealand 's ruler is Prince Roy , aka Paddy Roy Bates , who now lives in retirement in Spain ; in 2006 , a fire caused extensive damage , and plans are reportedly underway to sell the platform and open an internet casino there .
Yet the dream of creating a thriving new nation on the sea refuses to die .
Earlier this year , Peter
Thiel , the entrepreneur behind the web - based payments system PayPal , donated $ 500,000 to inaugurate the Seasteading Institute , which aims " to establish permanent , autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social , political , and legal systems . "
Although motivated by similar libertarian impulses , the institute does seem , for once , to be giving extensive consideration to the engineering work such dreams would require .
The strategy is to start small and scale up : from " PintStead " , a tongue - in - cheek structure small enough to float in a beer glass , to the fish - tank - sized AquariumStead , to PoolStead , to CoastStead , " a floating home that can go anywhere " , which they plan to build and exhibit off the US west coast , starting next year .
( After that , they plan to explore larger combinations of multiple floating homes . )
Meanwhile , at Seasteading.org , enthusiasts discuss a plethora of issues , from farming algae to produce fuel , to procuring surface - to - air missiles as a defence against attacks from established states .
It is ironic that the notion of the floating city should arise as a potential answer to the problems caused by global warming , since the libertarians responsible for the earlier ocean - colonising visions have tended to despise government - led initiatives , including those targeting climate change .
But building floating homes is an idea with its own history , too , primarily in the Netherlands : near Maasbommel on the banks of the river Meuse stand almost 40 three - storey homes , tethered to the ground , designed to rise with the water whenever the river floods .
( Responding to a problem by seeking to accommodate it , rather than eliminate it , is a characteristically Dutch approach : it is , of course , how the Netherlands deals with prostitution and drugs , too . )
Earlier this year , two architecture graduates at Harvard made a related - if rather more fantastical - proposal for post - Katrina New Orleans , envisaging homes that could float when required .
" Rather than considering the river an unwanted guest , welcome it in , " they suggested .
" Allow the city to wander through the river ...
Individual dwellings bob , tethered [ by ] umbilical cords through which potable water , electricity , sewage and telephone connections continue uninterrupted .
When the water subsides , depositing the city in a new arrangement , a post - diluvian landscape emerges , " they went on .
" The city 's historic economic stratification is blurred . "
One can envisage a few practical problems with a street layout that changes every time a city floods .
But it 's something to think about .
Environmental campaigners tend to be scornful of ideas such as Callebaut 's Lilypad , which , they say , offer not solutions to the climate crisis but dreamy distractions that encourage us to think we might get away with not having to make drastic alterations to our lifestyles right away .
" The idea that we can somehow take humanity , scoop it up and place it on an island that 's self - sustaining , and therefore that we can continue to exist as we were - well , let 's just say that it 's deeply unrealistic , " says Ben Stewart , a Greenpeace spokesman .
" Perhaps it would be possible for a small , elite proportion of humanity .
But what we should really be talking about is trying to protect a planet that is perfectly capable of sustaining us in perpetuity ...
The coming century is n't going to look like an HG Wells novel , where , if we lose the battle , we move to another planet or to the oceans .
It 's not going to look like that .
It 's going to be a large number of people dying . "
Besides , it 's hard to imagine that life on a Lilypad would really be such a paradise .
Surely they 'd soon become floating refugee camps , housing people the rest of the world would prefer to forget - prisons for an unrooted , essentially homeless underclass ?
Even as an elite getaway , it 's not clear that a floating metropolis would be that much fun .
Cruises , after all , are an acquired taste , and there 's something unavoidably fake and claustrophobic about even the finest ships .
On board QM2 , for example , according to publicity material , " sybarites can enjoy the rejuvenating treatments of the world - renowned Canyon Ranch Spa Club ...
Or how about a visit to the planetarium ?
A wine - tasting seminar ?
Or a walk down history lane at the Maritime Quest exhibit ?
QM2 is a veritable City at Sea , with everything from virtual - reality golf [ and ] a basketball court to a bookshop . "
Now imagine living there all year round .
ROBERT LANGDON : A LOVE STORY The Lost Symbol ( or
************
I come to you this evening to tell you why Dan Brown is right and everyone else is wrong , and why Robert Langdon is the hero we need .
I think Dan Brown was tired of Jason Bourne , James Bond , Jack Bauer , Indiana Jones , and John McClane and decided to make us what we really want . . . a nebbishy hero whose name does not contain a J. Someone who is not fearless , but deeply fearful .
A reading of The Lost Symbol alone reveals his fears of : planes , elevators , running in loafers , spontaneous speaking , basements , long hallways , rats , stairs , fast driving , catwalks , and tiny conveyor belts .
This is a man who wears turtlenecks because he is afraid of ties .
This is also a man who could not save his own ass with a two - handed ass - saving machine , so he is incapable of helping anyone else .
Indeed , he never saves the damsel in distress — she is saved from death twice , once by herself , and once by the CIA .
On the first occasion , not only does Robert Langdon not save her life , but she is forced to drive herself across down in her own Volvo , crash into the steps of the Library of Congress , and fling herself into his arms just to show her appreciation for just how much he has not done .
He spends most of the book having absolutely no idea what is going on .
Like a cat lost in an airport , he dodges and weaves his way around massive , frightening figures .
He repeatedly denies the reality of everything that is happening .
“ What the hell ? ” he asks .
“ You can not be serious . ” “ But that ’s not real . ”
He is periodically lifted up and carried from place to place , and set down again in increasingly uncomfortable surroundings .
He will go anywhere he is told to go , even if that place is completely crazy — like on to a plane at a moment ’s notice at the invitation of a stranger , down the book chute of the Library of Congress , or to the house of a known madman .
Ten hours after the ordeal , he allows Peter “ The Stump ” Solomon to blindfold him and push him around Washington DC — into black cars and ominous elevators .
When Katherine tells him to go to the top of the dome of the Capitol building , he goes .
If your parents ever used the “ if your friends all jumped out the window would you do it too ? ” line on you , they were talking about people like Robert Langdon , who would not only jump out the window because his friends told him to — he would do it because anyone told him to .
He would like nothing more than to cave in to any and all demands placed upon him .
In Mal ’ahk ’s house of horrors , he is subdued within seconds of walking in the door , and when forced to give up the secrets of the pyramid or die , he trips over himself in his effort to give up the secrets as quickly as possible .
A beloafered jerk in a Mickey Mouse watch whose only known routine is his daily swim and subsequent hand - grinding of coffee beans . . .
Robert Langdon would like nothing more than to be left alone to study weird puzzles and dead languages and teach the surprisingly dimwitted and slavishly devoted students he openly despises .
But sadly , his phone always rings , and he must do whatever the voice on the other end tells him .
At the end of the book , when he is busy not making out with Katherine , she gives him a suggestive hug and says , “ How can I ever thank you ? ”
Missing the hint entirely , he delivers the great truth of the novel .
“ You know I did n’t do anything , right ? ” he says .
Now , in saying all of that , you may think that I may be suggesting that the book or its characters are deficient .
Far from it .
Dan Brown just saw that the world was ready for a completely unironic , unsexy , inept , scaredycat , easy - bleeder , indoor - kid , nerd hero who succeeds not by trying , but by being forcibly pushed into danger , which he quite sensibly hates and wants to avoid .
He is the opposite of a Boy Scout — he is never prepared .
This unpreparedness is the key to his success — had he known what was going to happen , he most certainly would have hid .
How does Robert Landgon roll ?
He rocks some Saturday New York Times crossword puzzle in pen .
He likes comfy chairs and smooth rides and looking at the decorations .
He does n’t know what Twitter is .
He ’s like your grandpa , but he ’s not as cool as your grandpa .
He ’s that guy at the party who will just not shut up about the things he saw in Rome .
You could kick his ass , even if you are twelve years old and armed only with a bag of goldfish .
This is why , to use a word he despises , Robert Langdon is awesome .
Adventure comes to the lazy , nerdy , and easily influenced .
You too — armed with your comprehensive understanding of signage and your workmanlike knowledge of Klingon — you too might be called .
You too can defeat the big bad , no matter how big , oiled , hairless , and tattooed he is — even if you do so almost completely by accident .
And in what forms does danger come ?
It comes in SUDOKU .
Because , just as you suspect , the forces of good and evil spend all of their free time making codes and building puzzle cities .
Everyone in power is full - tilt - boogie crazy , secrets are the building blocks of the universe , and absolutely everything is interesting if you are just boring enough to see that fact .
This is the world I want to live in , and this is the world Dan Brown has shown to me .
The man , the myth , the loafers

The BBC is facing an uphill battle to maintain support for the licence fee , according to a new survey that shows almost half the population do not find it value for money .
A new Ipsos Mori poll for MediaGuardian also shows that the further north you live , the less likely you are to feel that the licence fee is an appropriate way of funding the BBC .
The same is true of those in lower socioeconomic groups .
As media regulator Ofcom prepares to unveil the next phase of its wide - ranging public service broadcasting review , the results will prove troubling for BBC executives who have previously argued that the licence fee retains widespread support .
The poll suggests that while viewers enjoy the corporation 's programmes - BBC1 is by some distance the most popular channel - a large proportion do not feel the licence fee is good value for money or an appropriate way of funding the BBC .
According to the figures , 41 % agree that the licence fee is an " appropriate " funding mechanism and 37 % disagree .
But asked whether the licence fee is " good value for money " , 47 % disagree , with more than half of those disagreeing strongly .
Nor do the majority of people believe the licence fee ensures the provision of distinctive programming not available elsewhere - long one of the key arguments for its existence .
Forty - one per cent of the population disagreed , with 30 % agreeing .
The BBC Trust chairman , Sir Michael Lyons , last year commissioned research that showed viewers wanted the BBC to be more innovative .
The devil is in the detail for the BBC , with the survey confirming it is losing the support of swaths of the population and revealing a growing north - south divide .
In Scotland , 35 % of people believe the licence fee is an appropriate funding mechanism but 47 % disagree .
In the north of England , 37 % agree and 44 % disagree .
But in London , 41 % agree and 28 % disagree .
While 56 % of those classified in the higher - earning AB socioeconomic group believe the licence fee is an appropriate way of funding the BBC , that falls to 32 % among those classified as DE .
And while 61 % of broadsheet readers agree , the figures fall to 36 % among tabloid readers .
It has long been argued by its opponents that the case for the licence fee , which costs £ 139.50 a year and brings in £ 3.37bn annually , will be difficult to sustain in a fragmented digital age as the amount of time people spend consuming BBC programmes declines .
Conversely , the BBC argues it has a more important role than ever in bringing high - quality public service content to a wide audience .
Director general Mark Thompson has also sought to broaden the justification for the universal licence fee , pointing to the BBC 's impact on the economy , its global reputation and its role in British cultural life .
