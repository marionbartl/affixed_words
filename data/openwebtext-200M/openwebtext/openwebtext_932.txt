WASHINGTON
When Bush 41 was ramping up to the Gulf War , assembling a coalition to fight Saddam , Jimmy Carter sent a letter to members of the U.N. Security Council urging them not to rush into conflict without further exploring a negotiated solution .
The first President Bush and other Republicans in Washington considered this treasonous , a former president trying to thwart a sitting one , lobbying foreign diplomats to oppose his own country on a war resolution .
In 2002 , when Bush Junior was ramping up to his war against Saddam , Al Gore made a speech trying to slow down that war resolution , pointing out that pivoting from Osama to Saddam for no reason , initiating “ pre-emptive ” war , and blowing off our allies would undermine the war on terror .
Charles Krauthammer called Gore ’s speech “ a disgrace . ” Michael Kelly , his fellow Washington Post columnist , called it “ vile ” and “ contemptible . ”
Newt Gingrich said that the former vice president asserting that W. was making America less safe was “ well outside the mark of an appropriate debate . ”
“ I think the president should be doing what he thinks is best as commander in chief , ” Gingrich said flatly .
Now , however , Gingrich backs Dick Cheney when he asserts that President Obama has made America less safe .
Technology.am ( Apr. 27 , 2009 ) — The British government plans to snoop on every call , e-mail or website visited by the public to empower its security forces .
Now the security services will monitor communication traffic , – “ who calls , texts , e-mails – when and where – but not what is said ” .
It means the security agencies will be able to see your visited Websites , when and from where but not the content of those visits .
It means the exact content of calls , communications will not be approachable but the text messages and visits to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter would be tracked .
However , if the data sets alarm bells ringing , officials can request a ministerial warrant to intercept exactly what is being sent , including the content .
“ The proposals would be unacceptable , ” warned Britain ’s data protection watchdog Thursday night .
There is no problem with the targeted surveillance of terrorist suspects .
But a government database of the records of everyone ’s communications is not likely to be acceptable to the British public , said Information Commissioner Richard Thomas , the country ’s data watchdog .
Seeking Knowledge - The Way to Paradise By Habib Ahmad " Allah will exalt those who believe among you , and those who have been granted knowledge to high ranks . " ( Qur 'an ) " Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim ( male and female ) . "
( Hadith ) THE VIRTUES OF KNOWLEDGE Allah ( Most Exalted is He ) , Who created us and gave us sustenance , has also given us guidance .
He said : " Verily We have created man into toil and struggle Have We not made for him a pair of eyes ; and a tongue , and a pair of lips ; and shown him the two ways ( obedience and disobedience ) ? " ( Qur'an , Al - Balad 90:4- 10 )
After providing us with the capability to contemplate , think and differentiate between things ,
He instructed us to know Him , to know his Prophets and to know His Deen , Islam .
He said : " So know that there is no god save Allah , ask forgiveness for your sins and for the believing men and the believing women .
Allah knows well your moving and your place of rest . "
( Qur'an , Muhammad 47:19 )
This verse shows the importance of knowledge and the virtues that Allah has given to it .
It also shows that knowledge comes before deeds , since Allah instructed His Prophet to know that He is One and the only One worthy of worship .
After that ,
He commanded him to ask forgiveness for himself , his family and for his Ummah .
If Muslims truly realise the importance Islam places on knowledge and its virtues , they will definitely be keen to learn and teach others .
They would start with themselves and their families ; then their neighbours and the community at large .
Once Mu'awiyah Ibn Abi Sufyan ( may Allah be pleased with her ) gave a sermon in which he said , " I heard Allah 's Messenger saying , " If Allah wants to do good to a person , he makes him very knowledgeable in the Deen . "
( Related by Bukhari and Muslim )
This is because knowledge is the basis of all good ; it generates actions that are based on the commandments of Allah and the instructions of the Prophet .
Hence , every Muslim must instil in his mind a desire to seek knowledge .
Allah ( Most Exalted is He ) instructed His Prophet -- and thus all Muslims -- to ask Allah to increase him in knowledge .
He said : " And say : My Lord increase me in knowledge . "
( Qur'an , Ta - Ha 20:114 )
Though , initially , all Muslims are equal in the sight of Allah , those who believe , have taqwah ( fear of Allah and righteousness ) , and have been granted knowledge move up to higher ranks .
Allah says about those who have taqwah : " Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is he who has most taqwah . " ( Qur'an , Al - Hujurat 49:13 ) And He said about those who believed and acquired knowledge : " Allah will raise up , to ( suitable ) ranks and ( degrees ) , those of you who believe and who have been granted knowledge .
And Allah is well - acquainted with all you do . "
( Qur'an , Al - Mujadilah 58:11 )
When a servant of Allah is granted knowledge , he appreciates Allah 's creation more , and becomes more acquainted with Allah 's attributes and qualities .
Consequently , he wholeheartedly witnesses that his Creator is the only one worthy of worship , and then submits to Him humbly .
This , in return , generates in his heart a fear , which is akin to a full appreciation and love of His Lord .
Allah ( Most Exalted is He ) has witnessed in favour of His learned servants these qualities , full appreciation of His Oneness and fear of Him .
He stated in two verses , to be recited until Doomsday : " There is no one worthy of worship but He : That is the witness of Allah , His angels and those endowed with knowledge , Standing firm in Justice ( or maintaining His Creation in Justice ) .
There is no god but He , the Exalted in power , the Wise . " ( Qur'an , Al - ' Imran 3:18 ) " It is only those who have knowledge among His servants that fear Allah . " ( Qur'an , Fatir 35:28 ) The Messenger of Allah gave glad tidings to anyone who undertakes the task of seeking knowledge .
Abu Hurayrah relates that the Prophet said , " For him who embarks on the path of seeking knowledge , Allah will ease for him the way to paradise . "
( Related by Muslim )
If no Hadith on the importance of knowledge besides this one had been uttered by the Prophet , it would have been enough for Muslims .
Yet the Prophet did more than that :
He used to stimulate his companions to seek knowledge : Ibn Mas'ud relates that the Prophet said , " Only two persons are worthy of being envied ; a person upon whom Allah bestows riches and gives him the power to spend it in a righteous cause ; and a person upon whom Allah bestows wisdom by which he judges and which he teaches . "
( Related by Bukhari and Muslim )
He used to congratulate the companions whenever they issued a right judgement or correctly answered a question .
Imam Muslim narrates that once the Prophet asked Ubayy Ibn Ka'b , " Do you know which verse in Allah 's Book is the greatest ? "
Ubayy answered by reciting Ayat - ul - Kursi ( the verse of the Throne , i.e. Al - Baqarah , 2:255 ) : " Allah !
None has the right to be worshiped but He , the Ever Living , the One Who sustains and protects all that exists )
The Messenger kindly patted him on the chest , saying , " Congratulations , Abul - Munthir for this knowledge " .
He used to call upon Allah to grant them the correct knowledge and understanding of this Deen : Ibn ' Abbas ( may Allah be pleased with him ) narrated , " Once the Prophet embraced me and said , ' O Allah !
Bestow on him the knowledge of the Book ( Qur'an ) . " ( Related by Bukhari )
He ordained all his companions and , thus , every Muslim who possesses some knowledge -- even as little as one verse -- to disseminate what they know to others :
He said , " Convey ( what you learn from me ) even if only one verse " ( Related by Bukhari )
He made special du'a ( supplication ) for those who learn his sayings and transmit them to others : Zayd Ibn Thabit narrated that the Prophet said , " May Allah brighten the face of the person who hears what I say and retains it , then conveys it to others : for sometimes one who hears from another remembers it better than the original hearer himself . "
( Related by Ahmad and Tirmithi )
He assured all those who disseminate his knowledge that they will get the same reward of any Muslim who acts upon that knowledge : Abu Hurayrah relates that the Prophet said , " He who calls another to guidance will have a reward equal ; to the reward of him who follows him without diminishing the reward of either of them . "
( Related by Muslim )
He showed to us the noble status of the learned people of His Ummah : Abu Umamah relates that the Prophet said , " A learned one is as much above an ( ordinary ) worshiper as I am above the least of you ; and he added : Allah , His angels and all those in the heavens and in the earth , even the ants in their holes and the fish in the water , call down blessings on those who instruct people in beneficent knowledge . "
( Related by Tirmithi )
Better still , he declared that the ' Ulama ' ( those who have Islamic knowledge ) are his heirs : Abu Darda ' said that he heard the Prophet saying , " The ' Ulama ' are heirs of the Prophets , and the Prophets do not leave an inheritance of Dirhams and Dinars but ( they left ) only knowledge .
He who acquires knowledge acquires a vast portion . "
( Related by Abu Dawud and Tirmithi )
After reading all these promises and glad tidings , one might ask , what more do we need to awaken our consciousness ?
We have been promised an easy way to paradise ; the inheritance of our Prophet ; a lofty rank , high and noble in status ; a blessing from Allah and a supplication of all that exists in the heavens and earth ; a face beaming in brightness and beauty on the Day of Judgement , when other faces will be sad and dismal .
So , let us embark on the road to paradise ; let us seek knowledge today .
In retrospect , their life seemed almost quaint .
Lucasz and Angelika Witkowski met in high school , fell in love , got married , bought a house in Orangeville and got a dog they named Nala .
Angelika , 26 , was full time on the door line at Chrysler , where her parents still work .
Lucasz , 27 , made moulds as a machine operator , a skill he learned from his father , who still works in the trade .
They were planning to have children .
Then , in March 2008 , Angelika was laid off .
Lucasz lost his job a month later .
That set off a chain of events that still has not ended .
" We were ready to start ( a family ) .
Fate said `nope , ' " Angelika said .
" We were doing everything we were supposed to and it just kind of crashed down . "
It crashed down for Huda Assaqqaf , 24 , too .
Assaqqaf believed university would bring a stable career .
Armed with a food and nutrition degree from Ryerson , she embarked on a job search in 2007 that has yielded nothing but frustration and contract jobs , none of them in her field .
She now works part - time for Access Apartments , co-ordinating personal support workers for people with physical disabilities .
" For an office job , it 's not very bad . "
" It 's just that I 'm not using my education or my core skills . "
This is not what was promised .
Generation Y grew up being told that if they were willing to work and study hard they could have it all : well - paying , fulfilling jobs that provided all the comforts .
But as they reached adulthood , secure jobs began vanishing , replaced by part - time , non-union work with little security , no benefits and odd hours .
Then the financial crisis hit .
Now , young adults are being forced to radically remake their life plans .
They are staying in school longer to keep up with an " educational arms race " and accepting that life will be contract - to - contract , perhaps in different cities , and almost assuredly without benefits .
They are living in a purgatory of arrested adolescence , of delayed adulthood .
They are unable to do what twenty - somethings have done for generations : settle into careers and start families .
" We 're calling it a crisis now in youth unemployment , " says Nancy Schaefer , president of YES Youth Employment Services .
People aged 15 to 24 had an unemployment rate of 14.8 per cent in March , the highest in 11 years and roughly double the rate of older workers .
" People have bought the message : get a degree , do everything right and you 'll be able to get a good job , " says Schaefer .
" Then , through no fault of their own ... the jobs are n't there . "
Rosemary Romeo , 26 , walked into YES with a master 's degree in social work and a resumé that included working with the homeless and people living with HIV , disabilities and addictions .
She sends out 10 applications a week , all with customized cover letters .
" A lot of the time it 's six - month contracts , eight - month contracts ; I never get anything full - time permanent , " Romeo says .
She has only had three interviews since graduating with her master 's a year ago – one was for a six - week contract teaching English to Aboriginal students in a college carpentry program .
Romeo still lives with her parents .
So does Assaqqaf , a thin , cheerful girl in a grey blazer .
With her $ 16 - an - hour job , she helps pay rent for the two - bedroom apartment she shares with her mother , whose English is poor and who cannot work , her father , who is on disability , and her two younger brothers , one of whom is autistic .
She also buys groceries .
Assaqqaf 's mother does not understand why her bright , articulate daughter does not have a better job .
Three months into her job search , Assaqqaf says , " My mom especially , she started getting very frustrated , very agitated .
` Why am I staying at home ? '
` Why am I not getting the job that she always dreamt I would be getting ?'
" In her mind she thinks that people who graduate and have a degree will work automatically and they 'll have a 9 - to - 5 job and a stable salary and everything .
...
She was really getting frustrated .
` Where 's the $ 40,000 a year you told me you 'll be earning after you graduate ? ' "
" `Well , Ma , there 's not enough jobs out there , ' Assaqqaf recalls saying .
" `And , you know , I am frustrated more than you are , but I 'm not showing it . ' "
Assaqqaf applied to a master 's program at Ryerson University .
When the rejection letter came , her feelings were mixed : she was already $ 14,000 in debt and did not want that to grow .
David Livingstone , head of the University of Toronto 's Centre for the Study of Education and Work , questions the instinct to return to school when job prospects are bleak , calling it a " knee - jerk reaction . "
" Invest more in education and you 'll get more reward .
That 's been the mantra for the last couple generations since the Second World War . "
But people are increasingly overqualified and underemployed .
Moreover , the gap between the educated and the less - educated is growing .
" What we have created is an educational arms race , " he says .
Increasingly , diplomas and degrees are used simply to screen the choices in a flooded labour pool .
And as young people climb up the ivory tower , the pile of indebtedness at the bottom grows .
The average debt for a Canadian undergraduate is between $ 25,000 and $ 28,000 .
Katherine Giroux - Bougard , the Canadian Federation of Students ' national chairperson , says that even before the recession , graduates crippled by debt were putting off buying houses and starting families .
Ito Peng , a University of Toronto sociology professor , calls it " delayed adulthood . "
" It means people are not as willing or able to actually think about making long - term commitments . "
Lucasz has been living in his cousin - in - law 's home office in Sarnia and babysits the couple 's 2 - year - old to offset rent he cannot afford .
He has enrolled in a construction carpentry program at Lambton College .
If gas prices are n't too high , he will drive to see his wife in Orangeville .
Angelika has also gone back to school , to Humber College , for tourism and hospitality administration .
After a full - time , $ 70,000 - a- year union job , she is now an unpaid intern at a conference centre , helping out with events such as the " All About Pets " conference , which featured pet psychiatrists and animal massage therapists .
Their modest , $ 279,000 house is up for sale .
" I do n't believe in guarantees anymore , " says Angelika .
" It 's definitely a different era of how people are employed , " Lucasz adds .
" In our generation , it 's more likely that you 'll have three , four , or five jobs in your career .
They may not be totally different trades , but working for different companies – as opposed to our parents , who to this day are still in the same place . "
Recessions , of course , buffeted the Witkowskis ' parents as well .
But this one is different .
Laurel MacDowell , a historian at the University of Toronto 's Mississauga campus , says the recessions of the early 1980s and '90s helped create globalization – and the current woes .
" This has been a 30 - year process . "
Lucasz 's employer in Orangeville made moulds for a company almost next door .
" We could literally take it across the street , " he said .
Shortly before he was laid off , the other company found it cheaper to import moulds from Taiwan .
In the 1980s , most people who lost their jobs got them back , MacDowell says .
But the recession of the ' 90s was the first where workers ' jobs disappeared for good , outsourced overseas .
" We are still in the process of shakeup , " says Peng .
" We are not so clear exactly on what specific skills we should be looking for and what we should be prepared for .
And I 'm not sure industry knows , either . "
Peng is no stranger to lost generations .
She finished her PhD in 1995 and taught in Japan , arriving in the middle of Japan 's " lost decade , " when a generation who had seen their fathers badly hurt by that country 's bubble collapse began to leave school .
" Young people came out into the world just at the wrong moment , more than disappointed , disoriented by this uncertainty . "
The social and economic consequences here may not be as extreme , but will be substantial : a declining birth rate , disengaged young adults , declining voter turnout and bright kids heading overseas .
Anxiety , cynicism and frustration .
" The promise has been : if you get a good education , you 're going to be okay , " says Livingstone .
" You 're going to get all the good things in terms of a house , a car and a family , and that you can be reasonably confident that you will lead a secure life .
And all of those things are at risk now , in some ways similar to the ways that they were at risk in the Great Depression . "
As bleak as the horizon seems , previous generations adapted and this one will , too .
They will move further afield .
They will start work early and finish late and then , perhaps , move on .
They will have several jobs and fewer children .
Braek Urquhart , 24 , grew up in Cobourg and graduated from Trent University in 2007 with a liberal arts degree and $ 13,000 in debt .
After seven jobs in four provinces and a stint couch surfing in Toronto , he joined thousands of other young Canadians who decided to teach English in South Korea .
" You ca n't get sh -- with an undergrad , " he said by phone from Incheon .
" In Canada , it 's impossible to save money .
It 's impossible to pay off your debt quickly .
It 's impossible to have a steady job .
...
This seems like a very effective way of paying off debt while getting work experience . "
Urquhart has adapted .
He puts $ 1,000 a month toward his debt , which he figures he can pay off in a year , and is considering law school .
His girlfriend will join him soon .
" I have only been here for a month , but I see myself being here maybe a second year , to bank some more cash before I go on to what 's next . "
The newly married Witkowskis had banked on living a life like their parents .
The plan now is to sell the house and move to Sarnia .
They will be renting : an eighth - floor apartment in a building of seniors .
" I do n't want to buy a house again , " Angelika says .
" I have been so traumatized by this whole ordeal that I 'm happy renting until I actually have a family and need to settle somewhere for a while .
Renting gives you more flexibility if you need to leave . "

Teen jailed on charges he punched League City mayor 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
A 17 - year - old high school senior was in jail Thursday night accused of assaulting the mayor of League City after an argument over a roadway incident in Clear Lake Shores overheated .
Police say he punched her as he tried to leave , but his girlfriend says the mayor instigated the incident and used a racial epithet while cursing him loudly .
Denshay Benson , 17 , is charged with endangering Toni Randall with his vehicle and later knocking her to the ground after she confronted him in a nearby parking lot .
He was being held in lieu of bail totaling $ 10,000 on misdemeanor charges of assault with bodily injury and deadly conduct with a vehicle .
Reached late Thursday night , Randall declined to say whether she made the alleged racial slurs .
“ I ’m not going to comment , period , ” Randall said , “ other than I am the victim .
I ’m the one that was hit .
That ’s all there is to it .
I was the one that was assaulted .
I mean come on , this is way out there . ”
Clear Lake Shores Police Chief / City Administrator Paul Shelley said Randall , 46 , was astride her trademark red motor scooter on FM 2094 about 2:30 p.m.
Wednesday when a GMC Denali began tailgating in a 40 - mph zone .
“ She was driving slow , ” Shelley said of Randall .
“ He did n’t like it .
My policeman tells me that he followed all the way from League City , a distance of 1 ½ or 2 miles . ”
As Randall approached the thoroughfare ’s 400 block , her scooter was forced off the road , Shelley said .
The SUV driver then passed her and pulled into the parking lot of a Discount Tire store .
Recovering her composure , Randall followed the vehicle until it stopped and then approached its driver .
As she walked back to her motorbike , Shelley said , Benson hit the mayor in the ribs with his fist , knocking her to the ground .
Benson , a senior at Clear Creek High School , then fled the scene and hit a parked car while doing so , Shelley said .
“ He admitted to knocking her down , ” he added .
But Benson ’s girlfriend , Meghan McIntyre , who was with him during the incident , offered a different version of events .
She said Randall pulled in front of their vehicle and drove very slowly .
When they began to pass her , Randall shouted and cursed at them and used an obscene hand gesture , said McIntyre , 18 , also a Clear Creek senior .
According to McIntyre : Randall then pulled in front of them again and slammed on her brakes .
Benson went around her once more and pulled into the parking lot .
Randall followed them and began to curse at them as she approached the vehicle .
When Benson got out of the car , the mayor called him a common racial epithet .
Both Benson and McIntyre are African - American .
“ She kept telling him , ‘ Hit me , hit me .
You think you ’re cool with those little things in your hair , ’ ” McIntyre said , referring to Benson ’s dreadlocks .
McIntyre said Benson tried to get back into his vehicle but that Randall tried to keep the door closed .
As they argued , Benson slapped at a cup of iced tea in Randall ’s hand to keep her away , at which point she poured it on him , McIntyre said .
She said Benson pushed Randall in order to get back into the truck .
“ She started yelling , ‘ Call the police !
Call the police !’ ” McIntyre said .
Another motorist pulled his car in front of Benson ’s to keep him from leaving and struck the Denali , she added .
McIntyre said she and Benson gave statements to police Wednesday night .
She said she was shocked that he was arrested .
She also said she was hurt by the mayor ’s language .
“ I ’d never seen that in person before , ” McIntyre said .
“ I always see it in TV and movies , but when I see that ( in person ) it hurts .
I just do n’t know what to think . ’’
Shelley said he had no proof Randall used racial slurs when confronting Benson .
“ That ’s a ‘ he said / she said ’ deal there , ” the chief said .
Randall was examined at an area hospital but was not admitted .
Each charge against Benson carries a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $ 4,000 fine , Shelley said .
He was to remain in the Kemah jail overnight and be transferred to the Galveston County jail today , he said .

Here ’s two completely false accusations from Michael Steele , ripped straight from Glenn Beck ’s fantasy world .
First , Steele says President Obama is considering a plan to " squelch the basic freedom of speech on the nation ’s airwaves , " a reference to the so - called ‘ fairness doctrine . ’
Steele is either lying or refuses to believe the truth , because President Obama opposes the fairness doctrine .
Second , Steele says the Obama administration is seeking to use violence in Mexico to impose " a new gun ban in America . "
Again , this is false .
President Obama supports the right of Americans to own guns .
There has been some discussion regarding automatic machine gun style weaponry used in drug wars , but this would n’t have any impact on the types of guns normal Americans buy .
This robot taxi concept by Petr Kubik looks like James Dyson of vacuum cleaner fame designed it .
The Robot Taxi can do up to 90 kmh for up to 20 hours without a recharge .
Using a touch panel inside the taxi , you input your destination .
A very cool concept .
If James Dyson had designed it , would it also double as a street cleaner ?
I wonder how Heathrow ’s robot taxi plans are coming along ?

He was Colonel Robin " Tin Eye " Stephens of Britain 's MI5 .
He operated out of a sinister place called Camp 020 .
His record for confessions is legendary .
Imagine it .
Hitler is blowing up your cities .
His army stands just across the Straits of Dover , waiting to invade .
Your children huddle terrified in shelters .
You 've got a Nazi spy in your grasp , and he 's got vital information .
What do you do to get it from him ?
In 1942 " Tin - Eye " Stephens faced a genuine " ticking bomb " .
Europe was already exploding , and he knew that the spies in his custody had information that could save countless innocent lives .
He made them squeal , but he never laid a finger on them .
" Figuratively , " [ Stephens ] said , " a spy in war should be at the point of a bayonet . "
But only ever figuratively .
As one colleague wrote : " The Commandant obtained results without recourse to assault and battery .
It was the very basis of Camp 020 procedure that nobody raised a hand against a prisoner . "
Stephens never used physical violence on a prisoner .
Not once .
Surely he was some bleeding - heart surrender monkey ?
Stephens did not eschew torture out of mercy .
This was no squishy liberal : the eye was made of tin , and the rest of him out of tungsten .
( Indeed , he was disappointed that only 16 spies were executed during the war . )
His motives were strictly practical .
" Never strike a man .
It is unintelligent , for the spy will give an answer to please , an answer to escape punishment .
And having given a false answer , all else depends upon the false premise . "
But such tactics could n't have produced actionable intelligence , right ?
Once a prisoner in Camp 020 realised he was safe from physical violence , he tended to sing all the louder .
Many became double agents , secretly working for the British and sending false information back to Germany .
The above excerpts come from a Times Online article entitled " The truth that Tin Eye saw " .
I found this article via Andrew Sullivan , who draws the correct conclusion :
Torture is the weapon of cowards and bullies and monsters .
Cheney is all three .
Prosecute him .
Special thanks to commentor djtyg for the " ticking bomb " quote .
This was also diaried here last week by jsfox , but went unnoticed .
******************************************************************
More info at the official MI5 website :
On one occasion in September 1940 , Stephens expelled a War Office interrogator from the camp for hitting a prisoner , the double agent TATE .
As Liddell noted in his diary " It is quite clear to me that we cannot have this sort of thing going on in our establishment .
Apart from the moral aspect of the whole thing , I am quite convinced that these Gestapo methods do not pay in the long run " .
Stephens saw that the officer in question never returned to Camp 020 .
Stephens later ran a postwar camp in Germany that was the center of a prisoner abuse scandal , but it would appear from the evidence that he was not personally culpable , and indeed he was later cleared of all charges .
What 's interesting is that the British convened a full court martial to investigate the alleged abuse of Nazi prisoners .
That 's how civilized nations do things .
Texas Senate passes bill to allow students to carry weapons Texas Senate OKs guns on college campus bill today
AUSTIN — A bill to allow college students and employees to carry their concealed handguns on campus won final passage today on a 19 - 12 vote in the Senate .
The bill would allow college students who are at least 21 years old and licensed to carry concealed handguns to bring those weapons into state campus buildings .
University hospitals and athletic facilities would remain off limits to guns .
It applies to all universities and colleges in the state , but private institutions would be able to opt out .
Sen . Jeff Wentworth , R - San Antonio , said he introduced the bill because of the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech , where he said victims were “ picked off like sitting ducks . ”
“ I would feel personally guilty if I woke up one morning and read that something similar had occurred on a Texas campus , ” he said .
If the Senate gives the bill final approval — which could happen today — the controversial measure could go back to the House , where it died last week because lawmakers did not make the deadline to debate it .
However , legislative rules do allow House lawmakers to take up the Senate version if they do it before midnight Tuesday .
Exactly half of the House members , 75 of 150 , have signed on as supporters of the bill , a legislative priority of the Texas State Rifle Association , an affiliate of the National Rifle Association .
Only 11 U.S. universities allow handguns on campus .
In Texas , college students are split on the issue and several university administrators have expressed reservation .
Sen. Leticia Van de Putte , D - San Antonio , tried to amend the bill to allow all schools to opt in if their governing boards wanted to allow concealed guns on campus .
Colorado took that approach , she said , with some universities allowing guns and others not .
“ This is a common - sense approach to the concealed handgun issue .
Allow local control , ” she said .
Her amendment was defeated .
Katie Kasprzak , a recent graduate of Texas State University , testified in favor of the bill before legislative committees .
She completed the required course and shooting test to get licensed to carry a concealed weapon , but was n’t able to carry it at night when she walked alone on campus .
“ If someone wants to protect themselves , they should be guaranteed that right whether they are on a college campus , ” said Kasprzak .
Sen . Rodney Ellis , D - Houston , said the bill could confuse university police , who now know that a person with a gun on campus is violating the law .
“ When there is an alcohol - related tragedy on campus , you do n’t hear claims that giving students a 12 - pack is the solution , ” he said .
“ Yet , when it comes to gun-related incidents , we seem to think that putting more guns in the mix will lead to a good , rather than bloody outcome , ” Ellis said .

From Diebold to Zero in 90 Days
And there 's nothing Humboldt can do about it ...
Parke Bostrom Byon

By Parke Bostrom and Brad Friedman
On Tuesday , April 21 , we gave Humboldt County , CA Registrar of Voters Carolyn Crnich a public records request for the two letters she read aloud ( but declined to otherwise disclose ) at a March 24 public meeting of the ad - hoc Humboldt Election Advisory Committee .
As The BRAD BLOG previously reported the two letters were from Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold Election Systems ) .
The primary purpose of both letters was to terminate all contracts between Premier and the county .
The letters were dated March 17 and 18 , the day of , and the day after , the CA Secretary of State 's hearing regarding serious flaws found in Diebold / Premier 's GEMS vote - tabulation system .
At that hearing , a Diebold / Premier spokesperson admitted that all versions of their GEMS systems --- as used in 20 counties in CA , and 34 states across the nation --- feature such flaws .
Some of those flaws , including the wholesale deletion of ballots without notice to the system operator , were discovered to the surprise and dismay of Crnich and volunteers working on the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project following the certification of the November 2008 election .
Crnich was subsequently forced to re-certify the election with new results .
[ Disclosure : Parke Bostrom is one of the volunteers on the Humboldt ETP . ]
Last Tuesday , at the next monthly meeting of the ad - hoc committee , Crnich presented copies of the two one - page letters and allowed examination of the originals ( copies of which are posted at the end of this article . )
The letters ' legal language is very plain , straightforward and troubling .
The contracts ' termination clauses are being executed , and those clauses specify the necessary steps and required time frames ... no matter how it may adversely affect upcoming elections in Humboldt County ...
It is interesting that the letter concerning the voter registration system , known as DIMS --- in which no problems were either discovered or reported --- is dated March 17 , the day before the GEMS letter .
The county 's DIMS voter registration database system is entirely separate from the GEMS vote counting system , and the county had hoped to continue using it .
In fact , the county IT department was in the middle of performing a software upgrade to the DIMS system when the letters were received .
The upgrade was summarily aborted upon notice from Premier of their unilateral decision , " As per Section 25 of the DIMS License Agreement executed by Humboldt County ... on April 27 , 1999 ... to terminate the above - referenced Agreement ninety ( 90 ) days from the date of this letter . "
Those who have ever had questions about the perils to U.S. democracy vis-a - vis the dangerous over - reliance on private corporate vendors for the execution of our public elections , should take note of the troubling truths spelled out in the paragraph above .
The March 18 GEMS letter points out that " Premier has also chosen to terminate the County 's right to use Premier 's OS and TSX firmware , and all other Premier licensed products " .
Also terminated is the county 's right to use the central count GEMS software .
This leaves the county with 80 AccuVote scanners that cannot be used on their own .
While the county could try to sell the scanners in hopes of recouping some of their terminated investment , any buyer would need to purchase new licenses from Premier .
Given their proven proclivity for petulance , should Premier wish to punish the county further , they could simply refuse to sell the necessary licenses to any potential buyer .
Back on April 6 , Premier 's unfortunately - named spokesman Chris Riggall commented on the contract terminations to the Times - Standard : " We just believed it prudent to kind of make a , well , to essentially provide a clean break , or a fresh start , for however the county would like to proceed going forward .
We thought it would provide the county an opportunity to make a fresh start . "
" Prudent " ?
As in , Premier does not trust even their own voter registration database product to work correctly in an environment in which it might be thoroughly audited ?
That kind of " prudent " ?
Actually , if the county gets to choose between the " clean break " and the " fresh start " of which Riggall speaks , we 'll put our vote in right now for the " fresh start " .
A good first step towards any " fresh start " would be for Diebold / Premier to refund all the taxpayer money it took , in exchange for the soon - to - be- useless , ballot - and - audit - log - deleting , federal - standard - violating election equipment that Diebold sold to the county over a decade ago .
While Premier will likely decline to offer any refund , the company 's letters remain as a cautionary tale to election officials everywhere , should they chance to stumble across additional flaws in any product bearing the forever - sullied Diebold / Premier name .

Parke Bostrom became a poll worker in 2004 due to concerns with paperless voting machines ( which are not used in Humboldt County ) .
He became involved as a volunteer with the local Voter Confidence Committee , the Humboldt Election Advisory Committee , and Humboldt County Election Transparency Project over the course of 2008 .
Parke has also served as an election night election observer , most recently on behalf of the Humboldt County Republican Party .
His professional background is in software and programming .
Royal Bank of Scotland is under fire over new bonus schemes for its chief executive , Stephen Hester , and other top bankers amid concern about the performance criteria attached to multimillion - pound awards by a bank 70 % owned by the taxpayer .
The latest controversy follows the award of shares worth £ 5 m to four RBS bankers last week .
The largest award was to Ellen Alemany , who runs the bank 's US business and was given almost 6 m shares , worth £ 2.4 m based on Friday 's closing price of 41 p .
Three other bankers had awards of about 1.8 m shares each , worth about £ 750,000 at current share prices .
The shares were awarded during an ongoing review of the pay structure for Hester , parachuted in as chief executive when Sir Fred Goodwin was ousted last year .
Goodwin 's pension of £ 700,000 a year continues to cause controversy .
City institutions being consulted about the scheme for Hester , who earns £ 1.2 m a year , are determined that strict performance criteria are attached .
One investor said : " People are not entirely happy [ about the deal for Hester ] and have asked them to refine it .
Its performance criteria are not sufficiently stretching .
They have been told to think again . "
According to disclosures to the stock exchange , the four bankers issued with shares will not be able to cash in their awards for three years and only if certain performance criteria are reached .
The awards – also made to top bankers Alan Dickinson , Chris Sullivan and Ron Teerlink – are also subject to " clawback " , which allows the bank to reclaim any payments for profits that turn sour later on .
But details of the performance criteria have not been released , largely because the bank is undergoing a dramatic overhaul , led by Hester , which is still being devised and has already led to 9,000 job cuts .
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , called the awards " completely unjustified " and " utterly unacceptable " .
RBS indicated it would make the criteria public later on .
A previous incentive scheme has not paid out since 2004 .
Hester 's pay deal is also being finalised , along with a scheme for outgoing finance director Guy Whittaker and his replacement .
It is thought a number of structures are being considered in addition to traditional awards of shares .
RBS is also thought to be looking at a pay deal that might include subordinated debt .
Subordinated debt was first introduced as a way of paying RBS bankers after the row in February over a £ 1bn bonus payout for its staff .
UK Financial Investments , the body that controls the taxpayer 's stake in the bank , reduced the cash bonuses to £ 340 m but allowed other payments to take place in less conventional forms , such as subordinated debt , and over a three - year period .
Hester , who has a " no reward for failure " clause in his contract , has warned that RBS has lost top staff as a result of the clampdown on bonuses despite the share awards being made to some bankers .
Among RBS bankers to have received share awards this year is John Hourican , head of global banking and markets , who has been granted 21.3 m shares and 7.4 m options , a package currently estimated to be worth £ 11 m .
An RBS official said : " We have put in place a new leadership team to lead RBS through the substantial restructuring we have under way .
It is critical that executive reward is made dependent on the delivery of those plans over the next three to five years to align their interests directly with those of our shareholders .
These incentives are designed to do just that and there will be no reward for failure .
Nothing will be paid until and unless performance criteria are achieved , and awards are subject to clawback .
" All such incentives will have exacting performance criteria attached to them based on delivery against our objectives .
It is the group 's intention to outline corporate and divisional business targets upon completion of our strategic review this summer .
These targets will form the basis of all long - term incentives . "

For more than five years , David Kellermann worked on the prickliest issues and investigations facing beleaguered mortgage giant Freddie Mac .
But to those who worked with him , the acting chief financial officer was typically buoyant and a calming influence on those around him .
On Wednesday , Kellermann , 41 , was found dead at his spacious home in Vienna , Va. Police say it appeared he committed suicide .
Nancy Bull , regional administrator for the medical examiner 's office , said Thursday that a final determination wo n't be made until all lab results are received .
But she said preliminary findings are consistent with a suicide .
Kellermann 's death was a shock to friends and neighbors , as such tragedies typically are .
They described him as happy .
But it was clear Kellermann had long been dealing with an extraordinary amount of stress .
TURMOIL AT FREDDIE MAC :
No key leaders READ : Police press statement MORE ABOUT KELLERMANN : His Linked
In page
The company he worked for during the past 16 years has been facing federal , civil — and , more recently , criminal — investigations since 2003 for business and accounting practices .
Whether it was an earnings restatement or a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Kellermann was always " part of the team working on it , " said Tim McBride , former Freddie Mac senior V.P. of government relations .
Last month , Freddie Mac disclosed Kellermann was one of the Freddie Mac senior executives who would be getting a hefty retention bonus .
Kellermann was going to get $ 850,000 , paid in several installments .
An uproar ensued on Capitol Hill .
At about the same time , neighbor Paul Unger said , he saw a van parked outside the Kellermann home with someone apparently guarding it .
Despite the years of pressure , McBride said Kellermann was typically the one who kept the mood light .
" He was someone people enjoyed working with — just a clever , fun guy to be around , " McBride said .
McBride said Kellermann beamed with pride when he talked about his daughter , Grace , 5 , and his wife , Donna .
He was known as a devoted father around the Northern Virginia neighborhood , where he and Donna hosted a Halloween party and put up lively Christmas and Halloween decorations .
" He was just an incredible neighbor and very friendly , " said Karen Layton , who lives on the same street .
Angela McClelland , a sorority sister and roommate of Donna Kellermann at the University of Michigan , said the couple met their senior year there and had been together since .
McClelland , who stayed in touch with the couple through e-mail in recent years , agrees Kellermann had a way of diffusing tension .
McClelland said she rode with Kellermann and Donna to Kellermann 's mother 's funeral during their senior year .
" Despite his incredible sorrow , he was able to make the rest of the car laugh , " she said .
" He had an amazing sense of humor . "
And a big heart , said Michael Ferrell , executive director of the ( Washington ) D.C. Coalition for the Homeless .
Kellermann became a board member of the non-profit group in March 2005 and , six months later , held a fundraiser at the Hard Rock Cafe that raised $ 34,000 for the group .
" It was truly remarkable and something no board member had ever done , " Ferrell said .
" David was a real go - getter . "

But those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
— Luke 19:27 1
Christians love to rail against hateful language in the Koran , saying that the extremist teachings there can be used to justify violence .
Well , it ’s in the Bible too — all over the place 2 .
What ’s to stop a new cult at some point in the near future from claiming there ’s Biblical justification for killing non-Christians based on this language in the Bible ?
Nothing .
It ’s there in cold print for anyone to summon for their own purposes .
EDIT : A number of people are pointing out that this was a story he was telling , and not something he was commanding directly .
I concede that I should have used a better title , as “ quote ” generally implies “ direct ” quote .
I should have used “ teaching ” instead , as that ’s more precise .
That being said , I do n’t think , morally speaking , this distinction helps much , if at all .
Why ?
Because the story was literally about what happens to people who do n’t obey their master , something Jesus consistently talked about with respect to following his own teachings .
In short , it was a warning .
And , directly related to this , here are some choice pieces of what Jesus is promising to do to unbelievers when HE gets back .
( Revelations 19 )
“ And I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war ” , “ His eyes were as a flame of fire ” , clothed in a vesture dipped in blood “ , and “ out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the nations : and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God . ” ”
So it ’s not some abstract “ story ” unrelated to Jesus ’s teachings or morals ; it ’s a direct threat about suffering the consequences of not listening to him .
Notice that he ended the parable with that quote .
In short : obey or I will kill you . ::
Notes
Congressman Jerrold Nadler has just publicly asked that the Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor .
Please THANK HIM , and please ask him and ask your congress member to jointly send to Eric Holder the letter that Nadler and 55 other congress members sent to Michael Mukasey requesting a special prosecutor last summer , or an updated version thereof .
Here is a release from Nadler 's office :
CONGRESSMAN JERROLD NADLER
8th Congressional District of New York
Nadler Applauds Obama Administration 's Transparency on Torture Memos
Renews Call for Special Prosecutor and Congressional Investigation
NEW YORK , N.Y . – Today , Congressman Jerrold Nadler ( NY - 08 ) , Chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties , praised President Obama and the Department of Justice for releasing four legal memos on the torture of detainees that had previously been concealed by the Bush administration .
Rep. Nadler , however , called on the Obama administration to go further and appoint a special prosecutor to investigate and , if necessary , prosecute those responsible for authorizing the torture .
He also said that a Congressional investigation is absolutely warranted .
Rep Nadler released the following statement :
“ While I applaud the Obama administration for releasing these torture memos in the spirit of openness and transparency , the memos ' alarming content requires further action .
These memos , without a shadow of a doubt , authorized torture and gave explicit instruction on how to carry it out , all the while carefully attempting to maintain a legal fig leaf .
“ These memos make it abundantly clear that the Bush administration engaged in torture .
Because torture is illegal under American law – as the U.S. is a signatory to the Convention Against Torture – we are legally required to investigate and , when appropriate , to prosecute those responsible for these crimes .
“ I commend President Obama for his unequivocal rejection of torture and for his resolve to move forward .
The President 's intentions are honorable , but do n't go far enough .
All history teaches us that simply shining a light on criminal acts without holding the responsible people accountable will not prevent repetition of those acts .
“ I have previously urged Attorneys General Gonzalez and Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the torture abuses of the Bush administration , and now I will convey that same necessity to President Obama and Attorney General Holder .
We sorely need an independent investigation that will provide accountability for these terrible crimes .
This investigation should not be a witch - hunt to punish those rank - and - file C.I.A. operatives who acted in good faith on Justice Department instructions .
At the very least , those who wrote and authorized the memos knowing full well that they were instructing others to torture must be held accountable to the law .
“ We must have a criminal investigation if the U.S. is to reclaim its moral authority and prevent repetition of these crimes .
“ As Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights said yesterday , ‘ Whether or not to prosecute law breakers is not a political decision .
Laws were broken and crimes were committed .
If we are truly a nation of laws . . . a prosecutor needs to be appointed and the decisions regarding the guilt of those involved in the torture program should be decided in a court of law . ’
“ Furthermore , the revelations contained in these memos make it abundantly clear that we need additional Congressional oversight hearings on this matter .
We intend to hold such hearings .
“ Finally , I particularly want to thank the American Civil Liberties Union for their role in bringing these memos to light and for their vigilant efforts to ensure that the United States government does not engage in torture . ”
Following are the memos released yesterday : http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/politics/20090416_memos.pdf.

Jerrold Nadler has served in Congress since 1992 .
He represents New Yorks 8th Congressional District , which includes parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn .
Not only does God exist , but he intervenes in our lives – at least according to Francis Collins , the former head of the human genome project .
Collins recruits quantum physics to make his religious case , and has set up a website called Biologos .
The site is funded by the Templeton Foundation , which seeks to find common ground between science and religion .
Laudable aim or not , the argument seems an odd one for Collins to make , given that he ’s such a renowned scientist and led such a pioneering project , one grounded so deeply in the principles of scientific enquiry and discipline .
Odd , because it undermines the case that science alone can explain how and when the world came to be .
Collins sort of agrees , in his book The Language of God , but says that the Bible explains the “ why ” we came to exist .
Fair enough .
But he goes a stage further – and for me strays into the realms of mumbo- jumbo .

Genesis and the big bang
Many scientists reconcile their belief in God with the overwhelming scientific evidence for evolution by holding that God set the universe in motion through the big bang , then stood back and let the laws of nature – including evolution – do the rest .
Genesis , they believe , is an allegory explaining how evolution unfolded .
Organisations such as the international Clergy Letter Project have backed these kinds of explanations to help religious people reconcile their beliefs with acceptance of evolution , at the same time distancing mainstream religion from the those who believe in the literal story of creation in Genesis .
But for Collins , the idea of a disinterested God who stands back and lets nature – and evolution – take its course is too much .
Where does this leave divine intervention , and how can prayers do any good if God does n’t intervene ?
To resolve his dichotomy , Collins delves into abstruse quantum mechanical physics to argue that God does still intervene , but in ways undetectable to scientists , maybe through tiny , subtle nudges to nature ’s designs .
God ’s influence ?
“ With quantum mechanical uncertainty and the chaotic unpredictability of complex systems , ” Collins writes , “ the world is now understood to have a certain freedom in its future development . ”
This means , he goes on :
“ It is thus perfectly possible that God might influence the creation in subtle ways that are unrecognisable to scientific observation .
In this way , modern science opens the door to divine action without the need for law - breaking miracles , ” says Collins .
“ Given the impossibility of absolute prediction or explanation , the laws of nature no longer preclude God ’s action in the world .
Our perception of the world opens once again to the possibility of divine interaction . ”
So , because God somehow tinkers in a quantumy type way , it ’s worth praying for divine guidance and intervention .
To me , and to other scientists and commentators , Collins is straying into pseudo - scientific speculation simply to keep God in the earthly frame .
Believing in God in the first place is by definition a leap of faith , and one that many scientists and many non-scientists are , after careful and reasonable thought , unwilling to take .
For those who have trouble accepting that we ’re a product of pure chance , there is the option of believing that God set everything in motion .
Food for worms
But the idea that God can undetectably intervene when he wants to is having your cake and eating it .
It disappoints me that such a gifted scientist could make this argument .
For the rest of us stuck with the realities of nature , and our inexorable fate as food for the worms , we have to struggle on alone trying to understand what we can and improve the quality and fairness of human existence through more mundane endeavours within the laws of nature .
As Collins himself says , we can never know or predict everything through science .
Absolutely true .
To think otherwise is delusional .
But for all its faults , science is probably the best and most honest tool we ’ve got for finding out practical truths about how the natural world operates .
So let ’s recognise that , and not shoehorn what little we do know into abstruse and untenable explanations for divine intervention .
Culture secretary Andy Burnham opposes the freeze MPs have rejected by two to one Conservative proposals to " freeze " the TV licence fee for a year .
In April the annual fee for a colour TV licence went up by £ 3 to £ 142.50 - a 2 % rise , linked to inflation - under the terms of a six - year settlement .
The Tories said a freeze was needed next year if the BBC were to maintain public support in tough economic times .
Culture secretary Andy Burnham told the Commons : " Now is not the time to be ripping up the licence fee settlement . "
' Never over - funded '
He added that the prospect of year - on - year funding for the BBC would " undermine " its work and " take away its creativity and stability " .
Mr Burnham also said that while the BBC provided " good value " for licence fee payers , it should be " adequately but never over - funded " .
Shadow culture secretary Jeremy
Hunt said : " The BBC too needs to maintain its bond of trust with the British people .
" That means understanding that when times are tough , you do n't just pocket the money allocated to you in happier times - you listen to people 's concerns and you respond to the very changed economic circumstances of 2009 . "
The licence fee should only be used to enable the BBC to deliver its public services
Sir Michael Lyons , BBC Trust chairman
Send us your comments
The Conservative proposal for a one - year freeze in the licence fee was announced by party leader David Cameron in March .
He said the BBC and other public bodies needed to maintain public support in the current economic climate by doing more with less .
BBC
Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons said in a speech last night that the plan is " a recipe for curbing the BBC 's editorial independence " .
" The traditional system of multi - year funding agreements ... underpins the BBC 's editorial independence . "
Sir Michael said the tradition of setting the licence fee for several years meant the BBC 's journalists did not have to trim their reporting to the prevailing political wind .
During his speech , Sir Michael made reference to the usage of a potential surplus in cash allocated for the switchover to digital television in 2012 .
' Wrong in principle '
Some of the licence fee has been set aside to help vulnerable groups with the change .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
And it has been suggested that any leftover digital switchover money could be used to fund universal broadband as part of the government 's Digital Britain plans .
But Sir Michael said research carried out by Ofcom suggested the public would like any surplus money to be paid back .
He said : " The licence fee should only be used to enable the BBC to deliver its public services .
" The digital switchover help scheme is consistent with that .
The rollout and take - up of universal broadband may be consistent with that .
We 'll see .
" But taking licence fee payers ' money and giving it to other causes and commercial players clearly is n't .
" It 's wrong in principle , it undermines the BBC 's accountability to licence fee payers , and it risks compromising the BBC 's independence . "

Residence - From Our Having Lived the Movie Century
A little more than a century ago , the first motion picture was shown before an audience .
Thereafter , â€ œthe movieâ€ grew with tremendous vitality as a medium .
In the course of the 20th century , countless movies were filmed in virtually every nation in the world , and countless people attended theaters to see them .
Today , the movie has become an integral part of our everyday reality .
Since the advent of the movie , we have changed in the way we see and think about things .
This change in our perceptions , nevertheless , is not yet sufficiently reflected in the character of our architecture .
Even today , a static imageâ € ” the photographâ € ” is the primary medium used for showing buildings and communicating architectural design .
Even buildings essentially born from sensibilities and modes of thought fostered by movies and dynamic images are disseminated using static images .
This reliance on photography may be one obstacle to needful change .
In truth , that obstacle is currently dissipating , owing to the Internetâ€™s growing capacity for video transmission .
This being the case , architecture suiting our perceptions and ways of thinking as people who have lived and fully digested the movie century may soon hereafter begin to appear .
Architecture that can only be seen from a moving perspective ?
Architecture that transcends the architectural diagrams ?
Architecture as story ?
What are the possibilities from our perspective as people who have lived the movie century ?
This competition seeks residential design proposals that respond to that question .

Dubbed the Zwistil , this bike is unlike in any other due to the fact that it “ provides with two riding positions : one to travel in the city [ and ] the other is to travel long distances and for leisure . ”
Video after the break .
As you can see in the video , it works rather well .
Sadly , it ’s only a prototype now , but I would happily pay for one .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Preliminary results of a joint U.S. - Afghan investigation show U.S. airstrikes in western Afghanistan this week killed Afghan civilians , a senior U.S. military official told CNN .
Villagers pray at a mass grave this week after an airstrike in Afghanistan 's Farah Province .
The investigation into the air strikes Tuesday in Farah Province found an unknown number of Afghan men , women and children were killed when U.S. warplanes bombed more than half a dozen targets , the senior official said .
The official , who had knowledge of the investigation details , declined to be identified in advance of a news conference scheduled in Kabul , Afghanistan , on Friday to discuss the findings .
The official said the targets bombed were buildings and compounds that the U.S. military had identified as areas from which insurgent fighters were firing on Afghan and coalition forces .
But based on evidence collected by military investigators , there also were civilians at those locations , the official said .
The U.S. military believes the insurgents were holding people there as a means of causing civilian casualties , the official said .
The United States may never get a confirmed number of civilian dead because of the Islamic practice of quick burial .
But since the airstrike , Afghan officials said dozens of civilians were killed .
" This is not looking good , " the official said , noting repeated instances of civilian casualties are becoming increasingly sensitive politically for the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
The question now for investigators , the official said , is how much information was available at the time of the strikes about the potential presence of civilians and whether those in charge should have known civilians might be in the vicinity .
In the past , the U.S. military paid compensation to victims ' families and leveled heavy public criticism against the Taliban for holding civilians at risk in conflict zones .
The senior U.S. military official also said the United States is still looking at separate intelligence that some civilians in a nearby area were killed with hand grenades by militants who then displayed the bodies , claiming they were killed by U.S. bombs .
The official said that intelligence is still believed to be reliable , but investigators may never be able to confirm it because of lack of access to bodies already buried .
There also is some information , U.S. officials say , that some civilians were beheaded by insurgents in the area during the several hours of heavy fighting .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , traveling in Afghanistan on Thursday , would not comment on the report of the grenade killings until a final report is released , but he expressed regret over the deaths .
" We regret any , even one , Afghan ... innocent civilian casualty .
And we will make whatever amends are necessary , " Gates said .
" We all know that the Taliban use civilian casualties and sometimes create them to create problems for ... the United States and our coalition partners .
We will have to wait and see what happened in this particular case . "
The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a news release earlier this week that its " impression was that dozens of people , including women and children , had been killed " in the airstrikes .
" The ICRC workers were told that some of the dead had already been buried by the time they arrived on the scene , " it said .
The Red Cross added , " We know that those killed included an Afghan Red Crescent volunteer and 13 members of his family who had been sheltering from fighting in a house that was bombed in an airstrike . "
According to the ICRC 's head of delegation in Kabul , Reto Stocker , " Tribal elders in the villages called the ICRC during the fighting to report civilian casualties and ask for help .
As soon as we heard of the attacks we contacted all sides to warn them that there were civilians and injured people in the area .
...
" We reiterate our concern that far too many civilians in Afghanistan are killed in incidents such as airstrikes and suicide bombings , " Stocker said .
" We will now try to learn as much as we can about exactly what happened and then raise our concerns in bilateral dialogue with the parties to the conflict . "

The death toll from an outbreak of a human swine flu virus has risen to more than 80 in Mexico as new suspected cases have been reported as far apart as Auckland in New Zealand and New York in the United States .
The World Health Organisation said at least 81 people had died from severe pneumonia caused by the flu - like illness in Mexico .
It said the virus has pandemic potential but it has stopped short of issuing a worldwide alert , while it gathers more information .
The New Zealand government announced today it was " likely " that ten students have who had recently returned from Mexico have contracted the virus .
Twenty - five students and teachers in New Zealand , some with flu - like symptoms , were quarantined and tested for swine flu after returning from a trip to Mexico .
The group , from New Zealand 's largest high school , returned to the northern city of Auckland yesterday on a flight from Los Angeles .
Eight students at a school in the Queens area of New York are " likely " to have contracted the virus , according to the New York Times .
In London , tests showed that a member of cabin crew on a British Airways flight from Mexico City did not have swine flu .
The man , who has not been named , was taken to hospital yesterday with " flu - like symptoms " after landing at Heathrow .
A hospital spokesman said : " I can confirm he does not have swine flu .
All the tests have come back negative . "
The UK Health Protection Agency said it was keeping a close eye on the situation involving human cases of swine influenza in case of any threat to people in this country .
An HPA spokesman said : " No cases of swine flu have been identified in the UK or anywhere in Europe . "
Mexican authorities ordered the closure of schools in the capital and the states of Mexico and San Luis Potosi until 6 May .
Soldiers and health workers patrolled airports and bus stations , looking for people showing symptoms , which include a fever of more than 100 degrees and coughing .
Twenty people are known to have died in Mexico so far out of a total of 1,324 reported cases , and 48 more deaths are thought to be attributable to the outbreak .
At least nine swine flu cases have been reported in California and Texas .
The most recently reported California case , the seventh there , was a 35 - year - old woman who was treated in hospital but recovered .
The woman , whose illness began in early April , had no known contact with the other cases .
At least two more cases have been confirmed in Kansas .
State health officials said yesterday they had confirmed swine flu in a married couple living in the central part of the state after the husband visited Mexico .
They have not been hospitalised , and the state described their illnesses as mild .
Dr Jason Eberhart - Phillips , Kansas 's state health officer , said : " Fortunately , the man and woman understand the gravity of the situation and are very willing to isolate themselves . "
The Mexican government yesterday authorised President Felipe Calderón to invoke powers allowing the country 's health department to isolate patients and inspect homes , travellers and baggage .
Mexico's health secretary , José Angel Córdova , said : " We are very , very concerned . "
Yesterday , people in Mexico City were being ordered not to kiss or shake hands .
Football matches went ahead without spectators , theatres , shops and museums were closed , staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant , and health workers patrolled buses , ordering sickly looking people home .
Scientists have long feared that a new flu virus could launch a worldwide pandemic .
Evolving when different flu viruses infect a pig , a person or a bird , mingling their genetic material , a hybrid could spread quickly because humans would have no natural defences .
The director general of the WHO said : " We are seeing a range of severity of the disease , from mild to severe , and of course death .
The eight cases in the US have been mild in terms of severity and it is too premature to calculate the mortality rate of this disease . "
Any doubts over the extent of the emergency were dispelled last night by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City 's central boulevard , Paseo de la Reforma .
With TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu - like symptoms , queues grew at clinics and hospitals across the city .
Calderón said his government learned only on Thursday night what kind of virus Mexico was facing after tests by specialist laboratories in Canada confirmed the outbreak as a type - labelled A / H1N1 - not previously seen in pigs or humans .
Few of the cases appear to have had any contact with live pigs .
The WHO said the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human and contained human virus , avian virus and pig viruses from North America , Europe and Asia .
Given how quickly flu can spread , there might be cases incubating around the world already , said Dr Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota : " Hundreds and thousands of travellers come in and out [ of Mexico ] every day . "
It was unclear how much protection current vaccines might offer .
A " seed stock " genetically matched to the new virus has already been created by the US Centres for Disease Control .
If the US government decides vaccine production is necessary , it would be used by manufacturers to get started .
At Mexico City 's international airport , passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aircraft and spreading the disease .
The Foreign Office issued a warning to UK travellers about the outbreak , but stopped short of recommending people did not visit Mexico .
US health officials took a similar line , urging visitors to wash their hands frequently .
Bond Bubble Springs a Leak ?
Hmmm … is this it for the bond bubble ?
Above is a new page in the credit crisis playbook .
You ’ve no doubt heard the old routine :
When stocks plummet , flee to U.S. Treasuries — bond prices go up , bond yields go down .
But yesterday , stocks fell … and Treasury bond yields soared .
Instead of selling U.S. stocks and buying American debt , traders decided to sell both .
At 3.38 % , the yield on a 10 - year note is at its highest level since November .
Why ?
Standard &
Poor ’s served the bond market a stiff glass of reality when it threatened to strip Britain of its coveted AAA rating .
Oddly still relevant , the rating agency gave the U.S an implicit shot across the bow… if the U.K. can lose its AAA , the U.S. can too .
At the same time , the Federal Reserve purchased fewer Treasury securities than the market expected .
During an auction yesterday , the Fed purchased “ only ” $ 7.3 billion in U.S. debt , or about 16 % of the total debt offered .
At a similar auction earlier this week , they bought upwards of 30 % … not exactly the buyer of last resort .
And nearly simultaneously , the U.S. Treasury quietly announced it will pump another $ 162 billion worth of U.S. debt into the market next week .
Total marketable U.S. debt will soon exceed $ 6.36 trillion .
It ’s no wonder traders are finally pushing up yields … who the hell is going to buy all this stuff ?
“ New Treasury bond issuance may become more challenging , ” warns our resident macroeconomic sage Rob Parenteau , “ not just because of the huge supply forthcoming , but because the quantitative easing measures adopted by the Fed and other central banks are designed in part to force investors out of the risk spectrum and away from cash and default - free Treasury holdings .
“ We are especially concerned the large buildup of long Treasury positions at primary dealers is unlikely to be sustained and there may be a rout in the Treasury market reminiscent of 1994 , when Goldman Sachs had to borrow from the Japanese in order to stay afloat after getting caught the wrong way round in yield curve carry trades .
“ With 10 - year Treasuries hitting 3.36 % and passing through their 200 - day moving average earlier this month , our concern is looking less and less theoretical .
“ Unless U.S. macro data start to get more alarming soon — and auto production cuts could dampen the Institute for Supply Management ’s numbers , while the minor consumer bounce in Q1 was really mostly over in January and could cool further in Q2 — Treasury yields are likely to surge higher .
So far , the backup in Treasury yields has not taken 30 - year fixed mortgage rates higher , but this is the type of challenging setup in the Treasury market that could squash attempts to stabilize the U.S. housing market .
“ If you were planning on refinancing your mortgage this year , you may wish to consider acting sooner , rather than later . ”
Kobold Camp is an ultra-primitive variation / mod of Dwarf Fortress , characterized by a combination of mods and personal restrictions .
Due to the inherent issues with playing kobolds , the intentional disuse of specialized jobs such as metalsmithing , and guidelines regarding types of structures and mining , Kobold Camp is intended to be a challenge for advanced Dwarf Fortress players looking for something new .
Believe it or not , it was actually originally created by Weaver , the same man that made Ruby Quest .
Synopsis [ edit ]
As put succinctly by one Anon :
Kobold Camp has three main points :
These kobolds are the world 's primitive society .
I find the game is a lot more fun if you let yourself really get into the primitive aesthetic and build mostly lean - tos , hill - homes , huts and shacks , fishing tents , and so on .
Imagine what you think these little guys would really live like , and work with it .
The focus of Kobold Camp , first and foremost , is that it's not the same as Dwarf Fortress .
It 's meant to be a departure .
Live like a savage ( or simply downtrodden and oppressed ) nation to see what it 's like being basically the lowest of the low on the ladder of fantasy fodder .
Of course ...
The real point of the game , like most games , is to have fun .
If you 'd prefer it if the kobolds could work stone , then by all means , add it in .
If you want them to be able to smelt their own weapons , go for it .
If you want to build a giant wooden tower fort , you can test the limits of kobold engineering .
You 're the one playing it , and your changes wo n't affect anyone else , so knock yourself out .
There 's no reason to hold yourself to how a game " should " be played if you do n't enjoy it that way .
Installing Kobold Camp [ edit ]
Kobold Camp can be modded into an existing Dwarf Fortress installation by downloading the file from DFFD [ 1 ] and using its contents to replace the raw / objects folder 's contents .
If you do not already have a copy of 40d or want to preserve your current version , simply unzip the full contents to another directory and play from there .
Changes [ edit ]
The improved kobold tileset for Kobold Camp .
Kobolds have been heavily modified into a playable race , and are almost completely functional ( see Known Issues ) .
They have been given the required professions to get a camp going , though certain professions may have been intentionally left out ( see Challenges ) .
Kobolds have multiple children per litter , and grow into adults faster .
Various items have been fixed that make them usable by kobolds .
Shovels and choppers replace picks and axes , respectively .
Kobold Camp uses a modified version of the May Green tileset , as seen in the thumbnail .
Elves no longer ambush .
Kobold Camp is difficult enough without their rather bugged ambushing behavior , which apparently caused them to spontaneously appear in the dead center of your camp .
They 'll still attack , but at least you 'll get to see them coming .
Challenges [ edit ]
Kobold architecture at its finest .
Kobolds are simple creatures , seeking out primitive but happy lives without the need for massive sprawling stone feats of engineering .
Players attempting Kobold Camp should follow these guidelines to keep in the " spirit " of the game and challenge :
Kobolds do not mine .
Picks have been replaced with shovels , and players should never dig into rock layers .
They should never dig more than one z - level down .
If you choose to live in a cave instead of above - ground mud or wood huts , make it look as organic and natural as possible , and do not alter or expand it once complete .
Alternatively , you could embark on a natural cave ( those with entrances to the caverns ) and try not to be killed by the many nasties living in there .
Kobolds likewise do not make tunnels or specialized underground room structures .
Kobolds do not smith or smelt .
Almost all of their necessary equipment is made out of wood , and some new items have been created to make kobolds playable ( e.g. shovel and choppy to replace pick and axe , as picks and axes are too large for kobolds to equip and wield ) .
Kobold engineering and architecture is primitive .
They mostly dwell in above - ground wooden huts only one floor tall , with the occasional two - story longhouse or other larger endeavor .
Rarely will a kobold build a structure taller than two z - levels , such as a small guard tower or other highly - specialized structure .
Low - tech is key .
Mechanical changes and other general information of note include :
Kobolds can eat bones , meaning food lasts longer .
This is a good thing , but it also depletes bones which can otherwise be used for armor and trade goods .
Kobolds are very weak creatures , meaning most any kind of combat encounter , even with mild , natural animals , is a life - or - death experience every time until they get some decent skills .
Elves will fuck your shit up 7 different ways and attack on a fairly frequent basis .
They 're normally very easy to defeat , but kobolds are n't particularly tough , so their weakness is more than compensated for .
The kobolds of Kobold Camp feature different ethics , meaning different interpersonal behaviors than vanilla kobolds .
Names are untranslatable , as kobolds still use the [ UTTERANCES ] tag , the illiterate bastards .
Survival in Kobold Camp depends primarily on making good use of the natural landscape and living off the land .
The primary source of food is through plant gathering , hunting whatever is n't too dangerous , and trading .
The best option for creating a camp is the " Use Kobolds " option on the pre-embark screen ( Play Immediately , Plan Carefully , Use Kobolds ) , as it pre-selects the necessary jobs and equipment that suit the mod .
Known Issues [ edit ]
A bug in 40d causes the items taken away by kobold caravans to be considered " stolen " when they leave the map .
However , this benefits the difficulty of the game , since the lack of exported wealth will greatly reduce the number of immigrants you receive , forcing you to rely on birth rates to keep your population stable .

The kids and I made the trip out to Syracuse , and stopped in at the Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science and Technology ( MOST ) .
We encountered a surprise treat at the museum : Stan Munro ’s Toothpick City II .
Wow !
We walked in to the main arena to see a vast display of the most incredible works of art I ’ve seen !
All done with toothpicks and Elmer ’s glue !
The Leaning Tower of Pisa .
I love this one most of all .
The Blue Mosque in Istanbul , Turkey .
And London Tower Bridge !
The platform is about 25 ′ by 30′ , and the toothpick structures are all built to a 1:164 scale .
Some of the toothpicks towers and temples are over 16 feet high .
Others are under a foot high .
Since the towers and temples are all built in proportion to each other , seeing them all next to each other is stunning .
And Stan has done an incredible job , with amazing attention to detail .
This is a closeup of the Aspire Tower of Qatar .
It ’s huge !
Stan was working on more structures at the MOST while we ooo ’ed and ahh’ed .
So we got a chance to talk to him and ask him how he got started on this project .
I found out he is a wacky radio guy !
I used to be one , too !
( Well , I was a wacky radio girl– I had my own morning show on a small station in the Southern Tier , near Binghamton , NY ) .
Stan said he was in - between jobs , working on his toothpicking hobby , when he was asked to display some of his work .
The reception was enthusiastic , and demand became so high that Stan was soon earning a living , doing what he loves !
Stan has a website , ToothpickCity.com , which is really fun to peruse .
It has a great gallery of his work ( including structures he built for Toothpick City I , permanently on display in Spain ) , and a humorous biography :
When Stan Munro started Toothpick City I in 2003 , he convinced his wife that this might be an actual job .
Whether she really believed him , or just reveled at the thought of a husband spending all his time in the basement , she supported him .
She helped him in every way imaginable , and when Toothpick City sold in 2005 , she helped him spend the money .
Here are more photos I took .
Perhaps some of you will recognize the structures .
You can see many more photos at Stan ’s Gallery at the website .
He ’s done most of the world ’s skyscrapers , too , including the Chrysler Building , Pyramid at Giza , the Petronas Towers , the Sydney Opera House , Taipei 101 , the Taj Mahal , and more .
Really amazing !
Plus , Stan gave me his business card .
How cool is that ?!
If you are interested in giving Stan some suggestions for future projects he can do , he ’s happy to take them .
We suggested the Pantheon of Rome , and he said he has just started work on it !
Much too late to save Jacqui Smith , it emerges that there is , after all , a perfectly good reason to keep the American broadcaster Michael Savage out of the country .
Belying his unexceptional appearance as a raging disseminator of allegedly contagious hatred , the man turns out to be an unreformed homeopath .
Of his almost 20 or so books on alternative health , many are still available , supplying valuable information , for example , on the whereabouts of potentially harmful plants .
Elsewhere , he urges uncritical adherence to the primitive credo , " like cures like " .
No apology or retraction of this work has ever been offered .
Though there is no way of quantifying the threat this healer might have posed to public rationality had he been allowed to visit the country , everything points to the need for caution , pre-emptive if necessary .
Anyone shopping for Savage 's anodyne polemic on Amazon will soon recognise this harmless stuff as a pretext for whisking fans to an array of more sinister manuals , such as Secrets of Fijian Medicine .
Readers who enjoyed Savage 's enchanting The Enemy Within : Saving America From the Liberal Assault on Our Churches , Schools and Military will be efficiently steered towards the same author 's Complete Book of Homoeopathy , written under his real name , " Dr Michael Weiner " .
There is no evidence , yet , that the author of Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder has actually devised a drug that could eliminate the condition for ever ( that honour surely goes to Jacqui Smith ) , but , for those with eyes to see , the connections between his two strands of work are inescapable .
In both lives , for example , Dr Weiner and Mr Savage attempt to voice the anxiety many people feel about life in the modern world .
On air , Savage might attribute this upsetting feeling , lightheartedly , to the presence of diseased immigrants , or to the proximity of gay people , or to Al Gore 's contributions on global warming .
In his Complete Book of Homoeopathy , however , that playfulness translates into a sober call to arms .
" The depletion of our energy resources and the unbalancing of our ecology , " he writes , " are creating a widespread state of alarm " .
As any observer of the holistic community can tell you , there is never any yin without yang .
Hurrying to justify his presence on its excluded list , the Home Office naturally focused , since it was easier to measure , on the offence generated by Savage the professional offence - manufacturer , rather than on ostensibly respectable work by Weiner .
Even though , unlike Weiner 's manuals , we can be confident his radio broadcasts did not provide incalculable support for Radovan Karadzic , when the blood - soaked Serb changed career , becoming a complementary healer in Belgrade .
But the Home Office was desperate .
Once the name of Savage / Weiner had featured as the token racism - deflector on Smith 's list of sociopaths , the government needed a crime that vaguely fitted his punishment .
In the recent case of Geert Wilders , invention of a relevant fiction had been relatively easy .
There was a video , Fitna , in which he criticised the Qur'an .
So long as people did n't watch it – and how tempting , really , did it sound ?
– Wilders was toast .
" We have a profound commitment to freedom of speech , " David Miliband said , " but there is no freedom to cry fire in a crowded theatre . "
Careful not to see Fitna himself , Miliband could never be accused of traducing the reputation of a fellow European politician .
Last week , with no evidence worth misrepresenting , it fell to David Winnick MP to endorse Smith 's exclusion of a man nobody had heard of .
Though he was keen on freedom of speech , Winnick told Newsnight , always had been , there could be no welcome here for a person who described autistic children – he consulted his Home Office crib sheet – as " brats " .
Yes , brats .
" I ca n't for the life of me see why , " Winnick said , " we should say to this chap , ' Come over . ' "
No , not even if it were on an exchange visit with Chris Moyles .
Within four months then , exemptions to Britain 's cherished tolerance have advanced from objecting to the Qur'an to embrace reports of coarsely phrased scepticism about a potentially disabling illness .
What next : no holidays here for chicken pox deniers ?
Gagging orders for anyone who wonders if this dyslexia business is getting a bit out of hand ?
Imprisonment without trial for anyone who thinks that the current home secretary is a shaming , incompetent clown whose greed will remain famous even after every one of her fellow colleagues has been similarly ­disgraced ?
Savage 's observations about autism had , as the Home Office claimed , provoked indignation in the US , followed by boycotts .
Mercifully , however , there are no reports of offended people having being moved to acts of cohesion - threatening violence .
Savage has no anti-autism following , no campaign , no significant allies .
So , given that autistic people here are still less likely to be moved to bloodshed by this non-existent controversy , the addition of illness - denial to the official list of intolerable visitor behaviour might be a slightly careless precedent .
It was not , presumably , Ms Smith 's intention to add Thabo Mbeki , former president of South Africa and a once - honoured visitor to this country , to her ever - expanding rogues ' gallery .
Even though , in Mbeki 's case , the Home Office could justifiably argue that the result of his denial of Aids was tantamount to homicidal violence .
At least 300,000 South Africans are estimated to have died because of his pig- headedness .
But while Smith is allowed to make up the rules , it 's futile to look for consistency .
Wilders was bad enough , but the ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act , so staggeringly capricious and stupid , as to defy evaluation .
For all the sense it made to blither , after a day 's desperate rummaging , about hurt feelings in the US autism community , Smith might as well have defended a ban on a foreign rabbit or an offensive mango .
" Coming to the UK is a privilege , " she raved last week , " and I refuse to extend that privilege to individuals who abuse our standards and values to undermine our way of life . "
And which way of life might that be , Smith ?
The one whereby denying clinical evidence can get you classified as an undesirable alien ?
Or the way of life that offers similar deniers a homeopathic qualification and a berth within the NHS ?
For guidance , in these rudderless times , one falls upon a brand new guide to our collective identity : Being British , The Search for the Values That Bind the Nation .
In his introduction , the prime minister takes as his theme our nation 's precious tolerance .
" And it is tolerance , " he whiffles , " that has helped the positive enrichment of our nation by the long succession of newcomers it has both attracted to these islands , and then helped to integrate ... "
Sure , it looks a bit out of date now .
But let 's be fair to Brown ; at the time it was written , a few months back , he 'd never heard of Savage and , in all probability , Savage had never heard of him .
New Haven , Conn .-- Most polluted or damaged ecosystems worldwide can recover within a lifetime if societies commit to their cleanup or restoration , according to an analysis of 240 independent studies by researchers at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies .
Their findings will appear in the June edition of the journal PLoS ONE .
The Yale researchers found that forest ecosystems recovered in 42 years on average , while ocean bottoms recovered in less than 10 years .
When examined by disturbance type , ecosystems undergoing multiple , interacting disturbances recovered in 56 years , and those affected by either invasive species , mining , oil spills or trawling recovered in as little as five years .
Most ecosystems took longer to recover from human - induced disturbances than from natural events , such as hurricanes .
" The damages to these ecosystems are pretty serious , " said Oswald Schmitz , an ecology professor at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies and co-author of the meta- analysis with Yale Ph.D. student Holly Jones .
" But the message is that if societies choose to become sustainable , ecosystems will recover .
It is n't hopeless . "
The Yale analysis focuses on seven ecosystem types , including marine , forest , terrestrial , freshwater and brackish , and addresses recovery from major anthropogenic disturbances : agriculture , deforestation , eutrophication , invasive species , logging , mining , oil spills , overfishing , power plants and trawling and from the interactions of those disturbances .
Major natural disturbances , including hurricanes and cyclones , are also accounted for in the analysis .
The researchers analyzed data derived from peer - reviewed studies conducted over the past century that examined the recovery of large ecosystems following the cessation of a disturbance .
The studies measured 94 variables that were grouped into three categories : ecosystem function , animal community and plant community .
The researchers quantified the recovery of each of the variables in terms of the time it took for them to return to their pre-disturbance state as determined by the expert judgment of each study 's author .
The Yale analysis found that 83 studies demonstrated recovery for all variables ; 90 reported a mixture of recovered and non-recovered variables ; and 67 reported no recovery for any variable .
Schmitz said 15 percent of all the ecosystems in the analysis are beyond recovery .
Also , 54 percent of the studies that reported no recovery likely did not run long enough to draw definitive conclusions .
In addition , the analysis suggests that an ecosystem 's recovery may be independent of its degraded condition .
Aquatic systems , the researchers noted , may recover more quickly because species and organisms that inhabit them turn over more rapidly than , for example , forests whose habitats take longer to regenerate after logging or clear - cutting .
The researchers point out that a potential " pitfall " of the analysis is that the ecosystems may have already been in a disturbed state when they were originally examined .
Many ecosystems across the globe that have experienced extinctions and other fundamental changes as a result of human activities , combined with the ongoing effects of climate change and pollution , are far removed from their historical , natural pristine state .
Thus ecologists measured recovery on the basis of an ecosystem 's more recent condition .
The study points out the need for the development of objective criteria to decide when a system has fully recovered .
The researchers said the analysis rebuts speculation that it will take centuries or millennia for degraded ecosystems to recover and justifies an increased effort to restore degraded areas for the benefit of future generations .
" Restoration could become a more important tool in the management portfolio of conservation organizations that are entrusted to protect habitats on landscapes , " said Schmitz .
Jones added : " We recognize that humankind has and will continue to actively domesticate nature to meet its own needs .
The message of our paper is that recovery is possible and can be rapid for many ecosystems , giving much hope for a transition to sustainable management of global ecosystems . "

It ’s hard to imagine that anyone in Minnesota still believes that the cops are a credible source of information regarding SF 97 and HF 292 — the state ’s pending medical marijuana measures .
After all , it was only a few weeks ago when state lawmakers and the local media ‘ outed ’ law enforcement for continually lying about the bills during their public testimony .
Nevertheless , in the interest of ‘ balance ’ ( and I use that term euphemistically here ) , state newspapers apparently feel the need to give these tainted folks a platform to spew their lies and propaganda — even though it appears that no one aside from Gov. Tim Pawlenty is listening .
Of course , it ’s arguable that by giving law enforcement a forum , editors are actually , if inadvertently , promoting marijuana law reform .
After all , the prejudice , fabrications , and misplaced logic exhibited by those who favor prohibition clearly does more to undermine the policy than NORML could ever hope to .
A case in point .
Writing in the Minneapolis Star - Tribune , local sheriff Richard Stanek goes off on a tirade about marijuana .
But if one reads between the lines , it becomes readily obvious ( to anyone but the sheriff ) , that his gripe is really with cannabis prohibition .
Lighten up on marijuana ?
By RICHARD W. STANEK
… The connection between marijuana and violent crime should not be underestimated .
The violence related to marijuana is n’t a result of the effects on the user but rather stems from the money people can make selling and growing the drug .
Violence is part of the trade .
By legalizing marijuana - growing operations and drug traffic , we would invite violence into our communities .
… We should never lose focus on the immediate connection between guns , gangs , kids and drugs — and marijuana is frequently the connection .
I have been in law enforcement for 25 years and have seen this firsthand .
When I was captain of the Criminal Investigations Division with the Minneapolis Police Department , we investigated a case involving a man from out - of - state who tried to buy marijuana for personal use .
He unwittingly approached a gang - connected dealer .
The man was shot and killed so gang members could keep his money and the marijuana .
Read about any gang - related violence surrounding the sale of alcohol lately ?
How about vicodin or paxil ?
Did n’t think so .
The irony , of course , is that the very ramifications that Sheriff Stanek claims to lament are , in fact , direct consequences of the public policy he reflexively endorses .
Of course , Sheriff Stanek is n’t alone is his twisted thinking ( another euphemism ) .
In a pro/con piece published today in the Rochester Post - Bulletin , Dennis J. Flaherty , executive director and chief lobbyist of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association , also predictably plays the ‘ violence ’ card ( among others ) .
The facts are that marijuana is a drug that is associated with violent crimes such as robberies and assaults .
Many have and will resort to almost anything to get their hands on it .
And here I thought cops believed that pot smoking made people unmotivated .
The cop lobbyist goes on to make a number of other false accusations as well .
You are free to read them here .
( Have a strong anti-emetic handy . )
Fortunately , despite this deluge of deliberately false information , most Minnesota politicians — former sheriff and current Senator Bill Ingebrigtsen notwithstanding — are voting on the side of truth .
Will Gov. Pawlenty do likewise ?
If you live in Minnesota , now might be a good time to ask him .
PS : Think that Minnesota is the only state whose cops blatently lie about medical marijuana ?
Think again !

SEATTLE , WASHINGTON –
It was not the expansive new mural depicting evolutionary history that brought Sandy McKean down to the Pacific Science Center on a rainy winter weekday .
Nor had he come to linger over the elegant displays about Ethiopian culture .
The reason Mr. McKean paid the $ 20.75 admission fee for “ Lucy ’s Legacy : The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia ” was because he wanted to see the bones .
They are 3.2 million years old but , for him , electric with urgency .
This was the first American exhibition tour of the famous Lucy fossils , 47 skeletal fragments of a female hominid whose discovery one day in 1974 altered the study of human history .
“ This is like a dream come true for me , to see the actual skeleton , ” said Mr. McKean , 64 , who is retired from a job in computers .
“ I ca n’t think of a more amazing and interesting thing than to study human beings and our ancestors . ”
He added , “ I would think people would be lining up and down the block . ”
Yet as the exhibition prepared to close on March 8 , six months after it opened amid the freefalling economy , lines had been rare .
Attendance had been less than half of what was projected .
Instead of being a boon for the Pacific Science Center , the kind of premium - priced blockbuster that would help cover its losses in other areas , the show stands to lose about $ 1.25 million , according to officials at the science center .
But the sour economy does not seem to explain all of Lucy ’s troubles .
A rare December snowstorm played a role , and Bryce Seidl , the center ’s president and chief executive , has suggested less intuitive reasons like the feverish focus this liberal city had on the election of President Obama and his transition to office .
In addition , an Ethiopian organizer of the show has raised questions about how effectively the science center presented and marketed the show .
Ethiopian leaders have long viewed Lucy , and the American exhibition tour in particular , as a way to improve perceptions about their country , and to make money .
[ The money goes to the dictators ’ pocket . ]
“ Ethiopia has an image problem , ” said Gezahgen Kebede , the honorary consul general [ {www : Woyanne} cadre ] at the Ethiopian Consulate in Houston and one of the leading proponents of bringing Lucy to the United States .
He said his country was still defined by the famine of the 1970s , and this exhibition offered a broader view .
“ The bigger thing in my opinion is to teach people about Ethiopia , ” he said .
Although many museums nationwide are struggling , laying off employees and scaling back exhibition plans , the recession has not hurt every blockbuster that has opened over the last year .
Since it opened in October at the Dallas Museum of Art , the show “ Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs ” has broken all of the museum ’s attendance records .
At the Field Museum in Chicago , an exhibition called “ The Aztec World , ” which opened in October , has also been a success .
The general adult entrance fees on those shows are higher than admission was to Lucy .
Yet at the end of its six - month run in Seattle , the second stop on what is supposed to be a multicity , multiyear tour of the United States , Lucy had drawn only about 100,000 people .
The exhibition has no confirmed next destination , and at least one museum that had considered hosting the show in the future , the Field , has decided against it .
But Mr. Kebede said negotiations were under way for the show to open in New York this summer .
Lucy opened in Seattle in early October , just as the breadth of the collapse in the financial markets was becoming clear .
“ We opened at a time when people were shutting their wallets , ” Mr. Seidl said .
“ Then you add the weather to it . ”
In a city that gets little snow , several days of significant snowfall paralyzed streets right in the middle of the holiday season .
The weather also inspired parents to push their homebound children , a crucial target audience for the exhibition , out onto sleds rather than downtown to a museum .
Mr. Kebede acknowledged the economy and the weather as challenges but said he had been told by contacts in Seattle that the museum had done a poor job of planning for the show .
“ The Seattle people , they just flunked it because they really did n’t do their homework in terms of solid advertising and how to penetrate the demographics , ” said Mr. Kebede , who had not seen the exhibition in Seattle .
“ There are people in Seattle who did n’t know this exhibit was there . ”
Mr. Seidl said the science center had spent more promoting Lucy than it had on previous large shows .
He noted that an exhibit about the Dead Sea Scrolls in 2005 , when the economy was stronger , drew twice as many people in half the time .
Disputes over exhibiting Lucy began long before Seattle .
When the show ’s organizers , the Houston Museum of Natural Science and the Ethiopian government , first agreed to bring Lucy to the United States , several museums and scientists said the fossils should not leave Ethiopia except for scientific purposes .
Some accused the Ethiopian government of seeking profit at the risk of damaging Lucy .
“ The one thing you heard a lot is that it was too fragile , ” said Joel A. Bartsch , the president of the Houston Museum .
“ Is it important ?
Absolutely .
Is it irreplaceable ?
Absolutely .
But it is not too fragile . ”
Lucy spent about a year on exhibit in Houston before going to Seattle .
The show drew about 210,000 people over 12 months , Mr. Bartsch said , and was regarded as a success .
“ My understanding is they had gone with a younger demographic , a lot of kids , ” Mr. Bartsch said of the Seattle show , which he had not seen .
“ We kind of did a higher - end more adult demographic .
You ’re trying to explain an idea .
Lucy the object and artifact is phenomenal , but really what she ’s about is the idea she represents , that she ’s an ancestral cousin to the human line . ”
Yet Donald C. Johanson , the paleoanthropologist who plucked Lucy out of an Ethiopian ravine 35 years ago and is one of few people close to Lucy who has seen both exhibits , said , “ I enjoyed the Seattle presentation much more than I did the Houston one , because I think Seattle put an enormous amount of effort into placing Lucy ’s species , Australopithecus afarensis , in a broader framework . ”
Mr. Johanson said he particularly liked the display of prehuman skulls that suggested a kind of evolutionary ascendance on the way to the exhibit ’s focal point , the Lucy fossils .
He also noted a lighter feature he liked , a display that used soda bottles , filled with varying amounts of fluid , to show the difference in brain capacity between humans and Lucy .
Those enhancements cost money .
The Pacific Science Center paid a fee of about $ 500,000 to the show ’s organizers , Mr. Seidl said , then spent almost $ 2 million more to renovate its exhibition spaces , add an audio tour and enlarge the exhibition ’s section on Ethiopia , including the country ’s role in farming coffee .
Admission also included tickets to an Imax film about the Nile River .
“ This is never a business that ’s comfortable , ” Mr. Seidl said .
“ Our job is not to build big bank accounts .
It ’s to serve underserved people , inspire kids , that sort of stuff . ”
The science center , in addition to several other museums nationwide , is not planning any exhibitions that charge premium ticket prices .
Future shows — like “ G.P.S. Adventures , ” an exhibition about “ geocaching ” opening March 28 ; “ Animal Grossology , ” opening May 23 ; and “ Animation , ” opening Oct. 3 — are “ real family - friendly , right for the economy , ” Mr. Seidl said .
Mr. Kebede , of the Ethiopian consulate , said he hoped Lucy would travel to New York this summer in an arrangement with Running Subway Productions , which has helped host huge shows like “ Body : The Exhibition , ” the controversial exhibit about human anatomy .
A spokeswoman for Running Subway said it was too early to comment on any plans .
“ This is going to be a big thing , ” Mr. Kebede said .
Next year , he said , he hopes Lucy will travel to China for an exposition in Shanghai .
Indiana Rep. Steve Buyer , the ranking Republican on the House Veterans ’
Affairs committee , said it was “ inconceivable ” that the administration would consider military veterans a potential terrorist threat .
Republicans are now arguing that , for politically correct and politically expedient reasons , we should ignore this possible domestic terror threat identified by George Bush ’s FBI and George Bush ’s Department of Defense .
I understand that it ’s politically correct , and fun political fodder , for Republicans to express false outrage over a new Department of Homeland Security report that noted , among other things , that right - wing extremists were trying to recruit US military members .
But are the Republicans really now saying that Homeland Security should not keep an eye on terrorists ’ efforts to recruit former US military members ?
Yes , they are .
I give examples below , from George Bush ’s FBI and DOD , detailing the problem of far - right extremists infiltrating the US military , and trying to recruit former members of the US military .
The media does all of us a disservice by not demanding the Republicans explain why they are now for us abandoning efforts to monitor a threat that George Bush himself pointed out to us .
Now , let ’s examine the facts , since last night , Republican leaders and the Republicans at the American Legion asserted that Timothy McVeigh was the ONLY current or former member of the military to be involved in any domestic terrorism , and therefore we do n’t need to keep an eye on this potential threat .
Department of Defense investigators estimate thousands of soldiers in the Army alone are involved in extremist or gang activity
From the Southern Poverty Law Center , 7/7/06 :
Under pressure to meet wartime manpower goals , the U.S. military has relaxed standards designed to weed out racist extremists .
Large numbers of potentially violent neo-Nazis , skinheads and other white supremacists are now learning the art of warfare in the armed forces .
Department of Defense investigators estimate thousands of soldiers in the Army alone are involved in extremist or gang activity .
“ We ’ve got Aryan Nations graffiti in Baghdad , ” said one investigator .
“ That ’s a problem . ”
This was George Bush ’s Defense Department , Donald Rumsfeld ’s DOD – they determined that thousands of extremists were at that time members of the US military .
So the media needs to ask the Republicans what they are talking about .
Do they think we should not keep tabs on Aryan Nation members of the US military ?
FBI report : “ White Supremacist Recruitment of Military Personnel since 9/11 , ” 7 July 2008
This is a report from George Bush ’s FBI :
Although individuals with military backgrounds constitute a small percentage of white supremacist extremists , they frequently occupy leadership roles within extremist groups and their involvement has the potential to reinvigorate an extremist movement suffering from loss of leadership and in - fighting during the post - 9/11 period … .
FBI reporting indicates extremist leaders have historically favored recruiting active and former military personnel for their knowledge of firearms , explosives , and tactical skills and their access to weapons and intelligence in preparation for an anticipated war against the federal government , Jews , and people of color .
FBI cases also document instances of active duty military personnel having volunteered their professional resources to white supremacist causes … .
A review of FBI white supremacist extremist cases from October 2001 to May 2008 identified 203 individuals with confirmed or claimed military service active in the extremist movement at some time during the reporting period … .
According to FBI information , an estimated 19 veterans ( approximately 9 percent of the 203 ) have verified or unverified service in the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Twelve of these have primary affiliations with the national organizations NSM ( 7 ) , NA ( 4 ) , and AN ( 1 ) , six with skinhead groups , and one with white supremacist criminal gangs .
FBI information indicates the activities engaged in by these individuals reflect those by veterans in the extremist movement generally since 9/11 .
The Bush administration ’s FBI and DOD documents thousands of cases of US soldiers being members of far - right extremist groups .
Yet the Republicans are now saying that our anti-terror organizations should not keep an eye on this potential domestic terror threat because it would n’t be politically correct .
This is yet another example of how the far - right takeover of the GOP has led the Republicans to demagogue on every serious issue affecting our country , from the economy to terrorism .
The GOP does n’t think we should have a stimulus bill , preferring to risk another Great Depression , because they think opposition to stimulus is a political winner for them , regardless of the economic costs to the nation .
Republicans do n’t think the Dept. of Homeland Security should be paying any attention at all to domestic terrorists ’ efforts to recruit members of the US military , because they think “ defending the military ” will earn them political points , even if it means risking another Oklahoma City style terrorist attack , killing hundreds of thousands of Americans in the process .
Saving the country from another Great Depression or another major terrorist attack has taken a back seat to earning political points .
I hope the Republican party and the American Legion hire a good crisis management expert , and an even better lawyer , the next time a Timothy McVeigh wannabe blows up a federal building , killing hundreds , if not thousands , of Americans .
Because they ’re going to have some serious explaining to do as to just whose side they ’re on .
The geologic faults responsible for the rise of the eastern Andes mountains in Colombia became active 25 million years ago — 18 million years before the previously accepted start date for the Andes ' rise , according to researchers at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama , the University of Potsdam in Germany and Ecopetrol in Colombia .
“ No one had ever dated mountain - building events in the eastern range of the Colombian Andes , ” said Mauricio Parra , a former doctoral candidate at the University of Potsdam ( now a postdoctoral fellow with the University of Texas ) and lead author .
“ This eastern sector of America ’s backbone turned out to be far more ancient here than in the central Andes , where the eastern ranges probably began to form only about 10 million years ago . ”
The team integrated new geologic maps that illustrate tectonic thrusting and faulting , information about the origins and movements of sediments and the location and age of plant pollen in the sediments , as well as zircon - fission track analysis to provide an unusually thorough description of basin and range formation .
As mountain ranges rise , rainfall and erosion wash minerals like zircon from rocks of volcanic origin into adjacent basins , where they accumulate to form sedimentary rocks .
Zircon contains traces of uranium .
As the uranium decays , trails of radiation damage accumulate in the zircon crystals .
At high temperatures , fission tracks disappear like the mark of a knife disappears from a soft block of butter .
By counting the microscopic fission tracks in zircon minerals , researchers can tell how long ago sediments formed and how deeply they were buried .
Classification of nearly 17,000 pollen grains made it possible to clearly delimit the age of sedimentary layers .
The use of these complementary techniques led the team to postulate that the rapid advance of a sinking wedge of material as part of tectonic events 31 million years ago may have set the stage for the subsequent rise of the range .
" The date that mountain building began is critical to those of us who want to understand the movement of ancient animals and plants across the landscape and to engineers looking for oil and gas , " said Carlos Jaramillo , staff scientist from STRI .
" We are still trying to put together a big tectonic jigsaw puzzle to figure out how this part of the world formed . "
This work was published in the Geological Society of America Bulletin in April 2009 .
Editor ’s note : Author , scholar and Truthdig contributor Chalmers Johnson passed away Nov. 20 .
In his honor , we are reposting this 2009 book review , which , like much of Johnson ’s work , remains relevant to this day .
In her foreword to “ The Bases of Empire : The Global Struggle Against U.S. Military Posts , ” an important collection of articles on United States militarism and imperialism , edited by Catherine Lutz , the prominent feminist writer Cynthia Enloe notes one of our most abject failures as a government and a democracy : “ There is virtually no news coverage — no journalists ’ or editors ’ curiosity — about the pressures or lures at work when the U.S. government seeks to persuade officials of Romania , Aruba or Ecuador that providing U.S. military - basing access would be good for their countries . ”
The American public , if not the residents of the territories in question , is almost totally innocent of the huge costs involved , the crimes committed by our soldiers against women and children in the occupied territories , the environmental pollution , and the deep and abiding suspicions generated among people forced to live close to thousands of heavily armed , culturally myopic and dangerously indoctrinated American soldiers .
This book is an antidote to such parochialism .
Catherine Lutz is an anthropologist at Brown University and the author of an ethnography of an American city that is indubitably part of the American military complex : Fayetteville , N.C. , adjacent to Fort Bragg , home of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare School ( see “ Homefront , A Military City and the American Twentieth Century , ” Beacon Press , 2002 ) .
On the opening page of her introduction to the current volume , Lutz makes a real contribution to the study of the American empire of bases .
She writes , “ Officially , over 190,000 troops and 115,000 civilian employees are massed in 909 military facilities in 46 countries and territories . ”
She cites as her source the Department of Defense ’s Base Structure Report for fiscal year 2007 .
This is the Defense Department ’s annual inventory of real estate that it owns or leases in the United States and in foreign countries .
Oddly , however , the total of 909 foreign bases does not appear in the 2007 BSR .
Instead , it gives the numbers of 823 bases located in other people ’s countries and 86 sites located in U.S. territories .
So Lutz has combined the foreign and territorial bases — which include American Samoa , the District of Columbia , Guam , Johnston Atoll , the Northern Marianas Islands , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , and Wake Island .
Guam is host to at least 30 military sites and Puerto Rico to 41 bases .
The Bases of Empire By Catherine Lutz NYU Press , 356 pages
Combining the two numbers is a good idea .
Some of the most deplorable conditions in the American military empire exist in U.S. territories , notably in Puerto Rico , where the citizens fought a long battle to stop the naval bombardment of Vieques Island , and in Guam , where the government plans to relocate more than 8,000 Marines from Okinawa together with a $ 13 billion expansion of Air Force and Navy facilities .
The result will be an almost 15 percent increase in Guam ’s population , which will significantly exceed the capacity of the island ’s water and solid - waste systems .
( See “ U.S. Military Guam Buildup Spurs Worry over Services , ” San Diego Union - Tribune , April 12 , 2009 . )
In the book under review here , Lutz also includes an essay on the state of Hawaii , with its 161 military installations ( in 2004 ) covering 6 percent of the state ’s land area ( 22 percent of the state ’s most densely populated island , Oahu ) .
The military is easily Hawaii ’s largest polluter , including the secret use of depleted uranium ammunition at the Shofield range , evidence of which was uncovered in 2006 .
It should be noted that the BSR for fiscal 2008 has been available since the summer of last year and it somewhat alters Lutz ’s figures .
It gives details on 761 bases in other people ’s countries and 104 U.S. territories , which produces a Lutz total of 865 .
Such small variations from year to year have been typical of the American empire throughout the Cold War .
Some 865 bases located in all the continents except Antarctica is not only a staggeringly large number compared even with the great empires of the past , but one the U.S. clearly cannot afford given its severely weakened economic condition .
Nonetheless , there has been no public discussion by the Obama administration over starting to liquidate our overseas bases or beginning to scale back our imperialist presence in the rest of the world .
One must also remember that the BSR is an official source that often conflicts with other reports on the numbers of American military personnel located all over the world .
It omits many bases that the Department of Defense wants to conceal or play down , notably those in Iraq , Afghanistan and Israel .
For example , just one of the many unlisted bases in Iraq , Ballad Air Base , houses 30,000 troops and 10,000 contractors , and extends across 16 square miles with an additional 12 - square - mile “ security perimeter . ”
One other subject that Lutz touches on in her introduction and that cries out for a book - length study is the political machinations that every American embassy and military base on earth engages in to undermine and change local laws that stand in the way of U.S. military plans .
For years the United States has interfered in the domestic affairs of nations to bring about “ regime change , ” rig elections , free American servicemen who have been charged with extremely serious felonies against local civilians , indoctrinate the local officer corps in American militarist values ( as at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation at Fort Benning , Ga. ) , and preserve and protect the so - called Status of Forces Agreements that the United States imposes on all nations with U.S. bases .
These SOFAs give our troops extraterritorial privileges such as freedom from local laws and from passport and travel regulations , and they absolve the U.S. from a country ’s anti-pollution requirements , noise restrictions and environmental laws .
Mapping U.S. Power
The first essay in Lutz ’s collection is by one of the few genuine veterans of military base studies , Joseph Gerson , the New England director of programs for the American Friends Service Committee .
He is the editor ( along with Bruce Birchard ) of “ The Sun Never Sets : Confronting the Network of U.S. Military Bases ” ( Boston : South End Press , 1991 ) .
His essay on “ U.S. Foreign Military Bases and Military Colonialism : Personal and Analytical Perspectives ” is particularly good on the hypocrisy and opportunism that imperialism imposes on our foreign policy , regardless of our intentions .
For example , he notes , in the words of the American Declaration of Independence , the “ abuses and usurpations ” that King George III of England imposed on us though his “ standing armies kept among us , in times of peace .
” Today the “ abuses and usurpations ” of American standing armies “ include more than rape , murder , sexual harassment , robbery , other common crimes , seizure of people ’s lands , destruction of property , and the cultural imperialism that have accompanied foreign armies since time immemorial .
They now include terrorizing jet blasts of frequent low - altitude and night - landing exercises , helicopters and warplanes crashing into homes and schools and the poisoning of environments and communities with military toxins ; and they transform ‘ host ’ communities into targets for genocidal nuclear as well as ‘ conventional ’ attacks . ”
When it comes to opportunism , Gerson notes that the Navy ’s Indian Ocean tsunami relief operations of 2005 helped open the way for U.S. forces to return to Thailand and for greater cooperation with the Indonesian military .
John Lindsay - Poland ’s essay “ U.S. Military Bases in Latin America and the Caribbean ” is informed by his extensive background in organizing and supporting struggles for the closure and environmental cleanup of U.S. military bases in Panama and Puerto Rico .
His essay is comprehensive and historically detailed , although it appears to have been completed in late 2007 or early 2008 and some of the information has been overtaken by recent events .
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa has refused to renew our lease on Manta Air Base when it expires in November 2009 ; and the U.S. Army ’s 2005 attempt to woo Paraguay flopped .
After the Americans are expelled from the Manta base in November the only physical facilities of the U.S. military in South America will be in Colombia .
The Bases of Empire By Catherine Lutz NYU Press , 356 pages
In 2005 and 2006 , the United States tried to seduce Paraguay into giving the U.S. a permanent base by sending several hundred soldiers to provide medical assistance and dig wells .
As it turned out , these ancient ploys did not work .
Suspicions of the American military ’s motives were aroused throughout the cone of South America , and the local population pronounced itself fully capable of digging wells unassisted by foreign troops .
Lindsay - Poland notes that the “ medical attention [ in Paraguay ] was one - time only , and … U.S. personnel handed out unlabeled medicines indiscriminately , regardless of the differences in medical conditions . ”
David Heller and Hans Lammerant have contributed one of the most useful essays in the volume on “ U.S. Nuclear Weapons Bases in Europe . ”
Information on this subject is scarce and the U.S. press is frightened of reporting what little is available for fear of raising a taboo topic .
Heller has been actively involved with anti-nuclear and anti-militarist campaigns in Britain , Belgium and other European countries since the early 1990s .
Lammerant has long supported the Belgian branch of War Resisters International .
They reveal that there are today still an estimated 350 to 480 free - fall B - 61 - type tactical nuclear weapons in the territories of the NATO allies , compared with a maximum of 7,300 land , air , and sea - based nuclear weapons based in Europe in 1971 .
The bombs are housed at eight air bases in six NATO countries , all of which enjoy Bechtel - installed Weapons Storage and Security Systems , type WS - 3 .
These devices are vaults installed in the floors within a “ protective aircraft shelter ” and allow for the arming of bombs and aircraft inside hangars , offering high degrees of secrecy and ( supposedly ) security .
Heller and Lammerant note that the weapons based in Europe are “ secret , deadly , illegal , costly , militarily useless , politically motivated , and deeply , deeply unpopular . ”
Before they were all withdrawn , ground - launched nuclear missiles were based at Greenham Common and Molesworth in Britain , Comiso in Italy , Florennes in Belgium , and Wuescheim in the former West Germany .
Pershing II missiles were based at Schwaebisch - Gmuend , Neu Ulm , and Waldheide - Neckarsulm in West Germany .
One of the themes stressed by Catherine Lutz as editor of this book is the prominent role played by women and women ’s organizations in resisting American military imperialism over the years .
All of the chapters offer details on the contributions of women to anti-base resistance activities , particularly in the case of the nuclear bases in Europe .
Following the U.S. decision to station nuclear weapons at Greenham Common in the south of England , local women created “ Women for Life on Earth ” and maintained a constant presence in front of the base from 1981 to 2000 ( even though the nuclear weapons were secretly removed in 1991 ) .
Heller and Lammerant conclude their essay with details on the early - warning radars , anti-missile bases , military hubs to support operations in Africa , and facilities extant or being constructed at Thule in Greenland , Vardo in Denmark , the Czech Republic , Poland , and Vicenza in northern Italy .
On March 17 , 2009 , the Czech government rejected a proposal by the Pentagon to install a U.S. military radar base in the Czech Republic because the lower house of the Czech parliament seemed certain to vote against it .
Tom Engelhardt ’s contribution , “ Iraq as a Pentagon Construction Site , ” is a cobbled - together version of two essays first published on TomDispatch , of which Engelhardt is editor .
All source citations have been removed from the Lutz version , but readers can consult the original essays —
“ A Basis for Enduring Relationships in Iraq , ” Dec. 2 , 2007 , and “ Baseless Considerations , ” Nov. 4 , 2007 .
The essays are tours de force on the construction of probably permanent American military bases in occupied Iraq and of the massive fortress — as large as the Vatican — in the Green Zone of Baghdad that is the “ American Embassy . ”
Engelhardt ’s work is a model of how to glean information from the public press on subjects that the American military is trying to keep secret .
This is the best research we have to date on the bases in Iraq and the billions of dollars that flowed into the coffers of Halliburton Corp. to build them .
( Truth in reporting : Engelhardt is the editor of all three of my books in the Blowback Trilogy . )
Global Resistance
Roland G. Simbulan ’s “ People ’s Movement Responses to Evolving U.S. Military Activities in the Philippines ” is a detailed analysis of how the United States has tried to get back into its former colony after the Philippine Senate voted on Sept. 16 , 1991 , to close all American military facilities and ordered U.S. troops to withdraw .
Simbulan is a professor at the University of the Philippines and he played an active role in the “ people ’s power ” movement that overthrew the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and led to the 1991 rejection of the bases treaty .
Simbulan is justified in calling his country ’s active protests against the Americans and their domestic lackeys “ the most vibrant social movement in Southeast Asia , ” but he is at pains to stress that the Americans are unreconciled to their colonial defeat .
They continue with unabated creativity to invent “ visiting forces agreements ” aimed at restoring the U.S. troops ’ old extraterritorial privileges and “ joint military exercises ” against domestic criminal gangs such as the Abu Sayyaf bandits in Mindanao and other Islamic provinces of the southern Philippines .
After the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , the U.S. has also tried to overstate the threat of Islamic radicalism in the Philippines , even though there has been a slow - burning insurgency by indigenous Muslims for over 20 years , and it has pressured the Philippine government to abandon the anti-nuclear weapons provisions of its 1987 constitution .
Americans may also be implicated in a clandestine campaign of selective killings of political activists , peasant and trade union leaders , human rights workers , lawyers and church people “ in a pattern that was strikingly similar to that of Operation Phoenix ” — the terrorist exercise run by the CIA in Vietnam that took the lives of some 30,000 suspected members of the National Liberation Front .
Simbulan has written an important analysis of why the Philippines seems unable to get out from under the shadow of the United States despite the victories of “ people power ” almost 20 years ago .

David Vine ’s and Laura Jeffrey ’s article entitled “ Give Us Back Diego Garcia : Unity and Division Among Activists in the Indian Ocean , ” is a lively treatment of the seemingly hopeless efforts of the indigenous people of the island of Diego Garcia to obtain some measure of justice .
In 1964 , they were expropriated and forcibly expelled by the British government at the insistence of the U.S. Navy so that it could turn the entire island into an American military base .
This essay builds on Vine ’s important monograph “ Island of Shame : The Secret History of the U.S. Military Base on Diego Garcia , ” Princeton University Press , 2009 .
Vine is a professor of anthropology at American University in Washington , D.C. Jeffrey holds a postdoctoral fellowship in anthropology at the University of Edinburgh .
She has carried out ethnographic fieldwork among the Chagossians , the exiled people of Diego Garcia , now living in Mauritius and the United Kingdom .
In 1960 , U.S. government officials secretly approached their British counterparts about acquiring the tiny island of Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean as a site for a military base .
By 1964 , the United Kingdom agreed to detach Diego Garcia and the rest of the surrounding Chagos archipelago from its colony Mauritius and several island groups from colonial Seychelles to create a strategic military colony , the British Indian Ocean Territory .
In a flagrant violation of human rights , Britain then removed the native inhabitants of Diego Garcia and Chagos , dumping them in Mauritius and Seychelles , 1,300 miles away , where they live today in abject poverty .
By 1973 , the United States had completed the nucleus of a super - secret base that would grow faster than any other U.S. base since the Vietnam War .
After the attacks of 9/11 , the United States used Diego Garcia ’s twin parallel runways , each over two miles in length , to launch its fleet of B - 1 , B - 2 , and B - 52 bombers in its assault on Afghanistan , and its 2003 “ shock and awe ” campaign against Iraq .
Diego Garcia also became the site of a secret CIA detention and torture facility for suspected terrorists .
According to John Pike , who runs the military analysis Web site GlobalSecurity.org , Diego Garcia lies at the center of American imperialist plans in case the nations of East Asia should decide that they have had enough of American military forces based on their territories .
According to Pike , “ [ Diego Garcia ] is the single most important military facility we ’ve got . ”
The military ’s goal , Pike says , is that “ we ’ll be able to run the planet from Guam and Diego Garcia by 2015 , even if the entire Eastern Hemisphere has drop - kicked us from bases on their territory . ”
With characteristic hypocrisy , the Pentagon has named the Diego Garcia base “ Camp Justice . ”
Environmental Issues
Environmental and health issues have become the most important new focus in the long - standing conflicts between the U.S. military and civilian communities .
Chief evidence is the victory of popular mobilization and civil disobedience against the Navy ’s 60 - year - long bombing of Vieques , a 51 - square - mile island municipality six miles off the southeast coast of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico .
Katherine T. McCaffrey ’s expert treatment of the four - year - long movement to force an end to the bombing of Vieques is one the most important pieces in Lutz ’s anthology .
The bombing of a Caribbean island inhabited by 10,000 American civilians also exposed Puerto Rico ’s lack of sovereignty and the second - class status of its residents within the U.S. polity .
Emphasis on environmental issues overcame the Puerto Ricans ’ traditional reluctance to politicize their plight and created a broad popular movement that mobilized women and caused the Catholic and Protestant churches to join hands .
On April 19 , 1999 , the Vieques movement was further strengthened and united when it acquired a martyr .
Two U.S. Navy F - 18 jet aircraft traveling at supersonic speeds accidentally dropped two 500 - pound bombs on the compound that the Navy used to survey the shelling .
A civilian security guard , David Sanes , who was patrolling the area , was knocked unconscious and subsequently bled to death .
The result was that civilians occupied the site for more than a year , causing the Navy to move its bombing range to North Carolina .
Given their access to the site , the occupiers also discovered that the Navy was using depleted uranium ammunition on Vieques .
In May 2003 , the Navy was finally forced off the island .
McCaffrey concludes , “ After decades of secrecy surrounding its activities , the military is emerging as the single largest polluter in the United States , single - handedly producing 27,000 toxic - waste sites in this country . ”
From Vieques , mobilization based on environmental and health concerns spread to the Navy - controlled island of Kahoolawe in Hawaii , where it was equally successful in forcing the Navy to pull out .
Kahoolawe had been occupied and bombed by the U.S. Navy since the outbreak of World War II .
Kyle Kajihiro ’s essay “ Resisting Militarization in Hawaii , ” touches on this and other military issues in Hawaii .
Kajihiro is the American Friends Service Committee ’s program director in Hawaii , who since 1996 has been active in the Hawaiian sovereignty movement .
His article is less a scholarly analysis of the popular protests against the huge military presence in Hawaii than a well - informed , impassioned brief for the rights of the Kanaka Maoli ( native Hawaiians ) .
Kajihiro also points out that for the first time since World War II , tourism is now a bigger part of the Hawaiian economy than the military installations .
His essay is a valuable contribution to the comparatively small literature on the problems of militarism within the United States .
The essay by Ayse Gul Altinay and Amy Holmes , “ Opposition to the U.S. Military Presence in Turkey in the Context of the Iraq War , ” is important for three reasons .
First , there is very little published on the bases in Turkey ; second , Incirlik Air Base on the outskirts of Adana , Turkey , is the largest U.S. military facility in a strategically vital NATO ally ; and third , the decision on March 1 , 2003 , of the Turkish National Assembly not to deploy Turkish forces in Iraq nor to allow the United States to use Turkey as an invasion route into Iraq was one of the Bush administration ’s greatest setbacks .
Public opinion polls in January 2003 revealed that 90 percent of Turks opposed U.S. imperialism against Iraq and 83 percent opposed Turkey ’s cooperating with the United States .
Nonetheless , major U.S. newspapers either ignored or trivialized Turkey ’s opposition to U.S. war plans .
Altinay is a professor of anthropology at Sabanci University , Turkey , and the author of “ The Myth of the Military Nation : Militarism , Gender , and Education in Turkey ” ( Palgrave Macmillan , 2004 ) .
Holmes is a doctoral candidate in sociology at the Johns Hopkins University and has written extensively on American bases in Germany and Turkey .
The Bases of Empire By Catherine Lutz NYU Press , 356 pages
Turkey is not an easy place to do research on American bases .
Some 41 percent of bilateral agreements between the U.S. and Turkey between 1947 and 1965 were secret .
It was not known that the U.S. had stationed missiles on Turkish territory until the U.S. promised to remove them in return for the USSR ’s withdrawing its missiles from Cuba .
Incirlik became even more central to U.S. strategy after 1974 .
In that year , Turkey invaded Cyprus and the United States imposed an arms embargo on its ally .
As a result , Turkey closed all 27 U.S. bases in the country except for one , Incirlik .
As Altinay and Holmes write , “ It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of the Incirlik Air Base for U.S. power projection in the Middle East , particularly since the early 1990s ; for more than a decade , the entire Iraq policy of the United States hinged on Incirlik . ”
My choice of the best article in the Lutz volume is Kozue Akibayashi’s and Suzuyo Takazato ‘s “ Okinawa : Women ’s Struggle for Demilitarization . ”
The persecution of the native population of the island of Okinawa , Japan ’s most southerly and poorest prefecture , by the American occupiers and the Japanese government since at least the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 has been told often and is reasonably well known in mainland Japan and among the U.S. armed forces .
Akibayashi and Takazato expertly retell the essence of the story here , but what makes the article a standout is their emphasis on the mistreatment of Okinawan women and girls and their theoretically sophisticated conclusions .
Akibayashi is a researcher at the Institute for Gender Studies of Ochanomizu University in Tokyo .
Takazato is one of the best - known activists in the struggle of Okinawan women to escape the threat of sexual violence by American military personnel .
She is an elected member of the City Council in Naha , the capital of Okinawa , and one of the founders of Okinawa Women Act Against Military Violence , which was created in the wake of the gang rape on Sept.
4 , 1995 of a 12 - year - old Okinawa schoolgirl by two U.S. Marines and a sailor .
The purpose of Takazato ’s organization was to prevent a recurrence of attacks by the U.S. military on Okinawan women and to protect the young victim of Sept. 4 from unwanted publicity .
The organization subsequently created the Rape Emergency Intervention Counseling Center in Okinawa , and has worked to end the U.S. military occupation of the island chain .
Unfortunately , despite heroic efforts to get American military commanders to enforce discipline among their troops and strong representations to the Japanese government to take an interest in the plight of the Okinawans , little has changed .
This has led Akibayashi and Takazato to two significant conclusions .
(1) “ Integral elements of misogyny infect military training .
… The military is a violence - producing institution to which sexual and gender violence are intrinsic . …
The essence of military forces is their pervasive , deep - rooted contempt for women , which can be seen in military training that completely denies femininity and praises hegemonic masculinity . ”
(2) “ The OWAAMV [ Okinawa Women Act Against Military Violence ] movement illustrates from a gender perspective that ‘ the protected , ’ who are structurally deprived of political power , are in fact not protected by the militarized security policies ; rather their livelihoods are made insecure by these very policies .
The movement has also illuminated the fact that ‘ gated ’ bases do not confine military violence to within the bases .
Those hundred - of - miles - long fences around the bases are there only to assure the readiness of the military and military operations by excluding and even oppressing the people living outside the gated bases . ”
These two propositions — misogyny in the official education of American troops and hypocrisy in describing the benefits to locals of foreign military bases — are significant .
I believe that they should inform future research on the American empire around the world to see if they can be verified in many different contexts and to further develop their various implications .
Meanwhile , these erudite essays should cause Americans to reflect on the nature of U.S. imperialism just at the point where it is most probably starting to decline due to economic constraints and popular exhaustion with the wars and deaths it has caused .
*“ Women are lauded for encompassing unladylike traits such as violence and assertiveness ; especially when they use those traits against men .
It is why a lot of young men have developed a stance of indifference towards women , marriage and family . ” — Dr. Helen Smith , Psychologist
You know the article is going to be messed up when it opens with this quack or , as her husband calls her , the “ Instawife ” .
Darryl James , I do n’t even know where to begin .
For the longest , men have been looked at as the sole perpetrators of domestic violence .
And , propaganda dictates that those men are violent in pursuit of power .
But just because those thoughts are popular , does n’t mean that they are the truth .
Propaganda ?
Where is this propaganda ?
I must immediately switch viewership to this progressive domestic violence channel .
A great deal of violence has less to do with power and more to do with a lack of self control .
Okay , everyone .
Let ’s keep this line of logic in mind as we continue reading his article .
The rise of feminism = the decline of self - sovereignty .
Men who beat women are usually male bitches — more than likely crapped on by their parents and not respected by their families .
Having little self - control , they are unable to simply walk away from a provoking woman ( real or imagined provocation ) and so participate in an escalating situation that ends in violence .
And , if those men are imprisoned , they will more than likely spend their lives behind bars as someone ’s female companion .
Powerless from beginning to end .
So the goal here is to not imprison the “ male bitches ” because that would just mean further feminization .
Check .
So if domestic violence is n’t always about power and control , then we must at least consider that other propaganda is BS , including the propaganda that claims men are always violent and women are always victims .
I ’m not sure how he proved that it was n’t about power and control , since the “ male bitches ” lack control and thus perpetrate violence .
There is necessarily a theme of power and soveriegnty .
I mean , did he not just say that the feminized person in the relationship is usually the one in the victim role ?
Let ’s take a look at some of the feminist propaganda that has given way to the masculinization of women , which laid the foundation for increased violence from women and a decrease in men ’s pursuit of marriage .
Let ’s do .
Apparently men suddenly do n’t want to get married — forget the savvy bachelor / playboy model that ’s existed for centuries .
Forget about anything other than heterosexual relationships .
Feminism began as a very good thing .
Thanks for the shout out .
According to a report in the Journal of Men ’s Studies , titled “ The Feminization of Domestic Violence in America , ” contrary to society and the media ’s portrayal of women as “ recipients of domestic violence …epidemiological surveys on the distribution of violent behavior between adult partners suggest gender parity . ”
One thing I learned very young was to consider the source .
One way to get around that , is to get multiple references to support your conclusion .
Quoting the free blurb from the journal ’s website generally does n’t cut it .
“ Feminism taught the current generation of young women to unsex themselves , ” said Smith .
“ The reason they were taught to unsex themselves is because the Second Wave Feminists believed that femininity is inferior to masculinity .
“
Once the goal of shedding femaleness was realized in a substantial portion of the female population , male / female relationships became problematic , if not impossible for the newly masculinized women who still wanted to date men .
A “ substantial portion ” of the female population shed their femaleness ?
Mr. James , please check out Scarleteen ’s article , Genderpalooza !
A Sex & Gender Primer .
Furthermore , during the commonly accepted brackets of the Second Wave ( 1950s - 80s ) , we did not have the technology to “ shed ” sex .
We barely have it now , and what we have is quite expensive .
Much too expensive for “ a substantial portion ” of the female population .
“ As a result ( of shedding feminine behavior ) , women are lauded for encompassing unladylike traits such as violence and assertiveness — especially when they use those traits against men , ” said Smith .
“ Praise is heaped upon the women who are self - centered , uncouth , egotistical and devious .
It is why a lot of young men have developed a stance of indifference towards women , marriage and family . ”
If we ’re talking binaries ( male / female , woman / man ) and the women are self - centered deviants which push the men into “ indifference ” , who is doing the praising ?
Just other women ?
And in what forums ?
I ’m pretty sure that Oprah and Cosmo , the leading advisers on femininity , would disagree with Dr. Smith ’s statements .
If not them , then for sure Sherry Argov , writer of WHY MEN LOVE BITCHES .
And how exactly are men indifferent to women ?
Is Mr. James suggesting that feminism caused an increase in male homosexuality ?
To be clear , Feminists created a huge paradigm shift in society , and then began to blame men for the poor results , which include a sharp decline in the marriage rate , and a sharp incline in domestic violence initiated by women .
Frankly , the pervasiveness of destructive Feminist propaganda has facilitated the evolution of many women into something close to Vikings .
And their status as violent , narcissistic and vengeful creatures has turned them into unmarriageable beings .
It is this modern “ turning of the shrew ” that has dampened marriage rates more than any other development in society .
Feminism has turned women into violent , vengeful creatures .
If only .
Then there might be less cleavage when selling products like web hosting .
Secondly , if Mr. James is trying to make a Shakespearian reference , the proper title is “ The Taming of the Shrew ” , which actually was the inverse of this article .
The female “ Shrew ” was tamed by her husband .
Perhaps he ’s thinking of the Henry James novella , The Turn of the Screw which deals with an off - kilter governess ?
In a discussion forum for my column , one psychotic man-hater who curiously views herself as a “ prize catch ” for men because of her education and financial wherewithal , admitted to being disappointed in the changing of the times .
Her disappointment comes because previously , men were working hard and dying early , leaving their widows in comfortable financial conditions , so that they could live out their senior years alone and comfortable .
If this is what men have to look forward to in a so - called “ prize catch , ” why would any man with a working brain want to live under such parasitic circumstances ?
A ) It was not Second Wavers that created chivalry and dowries .
B ) Heterosexual women want to be left alone ?
What happened to the legions of praising women who are lauding her bitchery ?
C ) The marriage sale is necessarily parasitic : the husbands feast upon the ovaries to produce male offspring .
Look at Henry VIII .
I bet he was a victim too ?
I ’m sure that if history could be re-written by the second wavers , the institution of marriage would be largely different .
Alas , we can only aspire to dream .
D ) “ psychotic man-hater ” ?
Who are you , Limbaugh ?
In a study on sex differences in physically aggressive acts between heterosexual partners , titled Aggression and Violent Behavior , the author reports that while men were more likely than women to strangle , choke , or beat up their partners , women are more likely than men to throw something at their partners , as well as slap , kick , bite , punch and hit with an object .
Who did this study ?
You ?
What kinds of objects are we talking about here … pillows ?
Could you please provide the link to the blurb you lifted this from ?
And , some women are turning violence into a game .
Like fight clubs ?
In one survey of college students , twenty per cent of men who had been attacked by their girlfriends thought it was funny .
It is anything but funny .
Define “ attack ” please .
Also , it ’s exactly Mr. James ’ own sexist stereotyping ( “ male bitches ” ) that would , in a sense , disallow these college students to reporting violence .
So what else are they going to do , when these supposed male activists are the ones perpetrating harmful thought patterns , besides laugh it off ?
According to the Department of Health and Human Services , “ children who had been physically abused by their birth parents were more likely to have suffered at the hands of their mothers than their fathers ( 60 % versus 48 % ) . ”
What ’s ironic here is that the site Mr. James quotes , Department of Health and Human Services , has a specific page just for women in abusive relationships .
Would n’t citing this government source kind of contradict his previous suggestion for a feminist - propaganda - less media ?
As a result of some of the harshness displayed by some females today , there is a growing lack of interest in relationships , marriage and family .
Many men , faced with the possibility of being harmed by a woman who will file for divorce and ask for half of the assets and custody of the children , simply choose not to marry at all .
So , since men are afraid of a woman who ca n’t control her anger , they ’re not getting married .
If we were to accept this , how would Mr. James explain the fight for same - sex marriage and adoption ?
If we truly seek to protect our families and decrease the violence that our children are exposed to , we would do well to take our heads out of the sand and realize that women have come into their own where violence is concerned .
Knowing is half the battle .
I ’d agree with the last line : knowing IS half the battle .
So if perhaps this guy has read anything besides his Men ’s Rights BS , he might have a stronger argument .

You can always agree / disagree / correct me here by leaving a comment .

AROUND the time of the G20 summit in London on 2 April , the streets of cities across the world were filled with people protesting against the excesses of the banking bosses , among other things .
Chances are you agreed with the sentiment .
Chances are too that if you had been asked to put your hand in your pocket to fund a campaign to seize their bonuses , even if you would n’t see any of the money , you ’d have been sorely tempted .
If so , congratulations : you have just confounded classical economics , which says that no rational person should ever reduce their own income just to slash someone else ’s .
And yet that ’s exactly what we do .
Classical economics , it turns out , is a pretty terrible predictor of how we actually behave .
But why do we inflict pain for no gain ?
On the face of it , it is rather a perverse way of going about things .
Does spitefulness stem from an affronted sense of fairness ?
Or something altogether darker : envy , lust for revenge – or perhaps even pure sadism ?
It might be all those things .

San Francisco would be the first city in the nation to sell and distribute medical marijuana under legislation proposed Tuesday by Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi .
Mirkarimi , who spearheaded legislation more than three years ago to regulate the city 's proliferating medical marijuana dispensaries , asked the city attorney to craft a measure that would create a pilot program for medical cannabis sales .
The details are still being worked out , Mirkarimi said , but he envisions a pilot program under which the Department of Public Health could distribute pot to medical marijuana patients of city clinics .
Mirkarimi called the legislation the " next step " toward codifying the state laws that legalized medical marijuana , adding that he wanted to introduce the legislation in 2005 when the city was passing the laws regulating the city 's marijuana clubs .
But he said he waited out of concern that federal law does not recognize California 's legalization of medical marijuana .
However , U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder announced last month that federal authorities would prosecute only " those people who violate both federal and state law , " implying that the government no longer would try to shut down California pot dispensaries .
" We 're spending much more money keeping marijuana underground , trying to hide a fact that is occurring all around us , " Mirkarimi said .
" Now is the time to take responsibility for something we 've deflected to others and to test our ability to take responsibility . "
Mayor Gavin Newsom 's office was n't so sure .
Although the mayor supports medical marijuana , Newsom has said he does not favor efforts to legalize pot , and his office was noncommittal about the proposal for the city to sell it .
" The mayor will have to hash this out with public health officials , " press secretary Nathan Ballard said .
" It 's the mayor 's job to weed out bad legislation .
And to be blunt , this sounds pretty bad . "
San Francisco 's successful dispensary regulations , which are now being used as a model for other cities , arose out of concerns that the clubs were operating with no oversight and often attracting criminal elements .
The regulations mandate who can run cannabis clubs , limits where they can be located and requires the businesses to receive a city permit that must be approved by four agencies .
The city laws led to the closure of at least 15 clubs .
Mirkarimi said he does n't anticipate the pilot program putting the remaining clubs out of business but said it could " alleviate the burden on neighborhoods " and provide a more " prudent approach to regulation " by moving some pot purchases into city facilities .
Where the city would get the marijuana would be determined later , he said , adding that he views the proposal as " cost - neutral " because the city could recoup any money spent on acquiring and distributing marijuana through sales .
Federal authorities in San Francisco , who have clashed with local officials over federal prosecution of medical marijuana sellers , seemed caught off guard by the proposal .
A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Agency said only that federal law has not changed , while U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said the proposal was too vague to comment on .
He noted that a municipality taking over the distribution of medical marijuana does n't solve the problem that the drug is still illegal under U.S. law .
" I expect that their objective here is to avoid some problems of the disparity between federal and local laws , but I do n't know that such an effort - that is , a government takeover - would be to the exclusion of other dispensaries , " Russoniello said .
" They would just be creating another entity ... and it assumes the city government would act in strict compliance with state regulations , which is a significant assumption . "
At least one marijuana advocate praised the proposal .
Richard Lee , director of the Oakland dispensary and education group Oaksterdam University , said it 's a step in the right direction .
" In general I 'm more of a private , free - enterprise guy - I 'd rather see the free market do it than the government , " he said .
" But I 'm in favor of anything we can do to legitimize ( marijuana ) and make the federal position out of date and unenforceable as possible . "
MEXICO CITY , May 1 ( Reuters ) - Mexico's Congress has passed a bill decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs , from marijuana to methamphetamine , as President Felipe Calderon tries to focus on catching traffickers .
The bill , proposed by Calderon after an attempt by the previous government at a similar bill came under fire in the United States , would make it legal to carry up to 5 grams ( 0.18 ounces ) of marijuana , 500 milligrams ( 0.018 ounces ) of cocaine and tiny quantities heroin and methamphetamines .
The lower house of deputies passed the bill late on Thursday .
It already has been approved by the Senate and is expected to be signed into law by Calderon in the days ahead .
Mexico's Congress passed a similar proposal in 2006 but the bill was vetoed by Calderon 's predecessor , Vicente Fox , after Washington said it would increase drug abuse .
The United States recently pledged stronger backing for Calderon 's army - led war on drug cartels , whose turf wars have killed some 2,000 people so far this year in Mexico , as the drug violence is starting to seep over the border .
The new bill also allows Mexican states to convict small - time drug dealers , no longer making it a federal crime to peddle narcotics , a move that should speed up those cases .
U.S. President Barack Obama praised Calderon 's drug war efforts in a visit to Mexico last month and promised more agents and southbound border controls to curb the flow of guns and cash to the cartels .

JERUSALEM – Sometimes it seems a person can't have a simple cup of coffee in the Middle East without making a political statement .
Take Starbucks , the Seattle - based purveyor of coffee , coffee - flavoured beverages and international cool .
The company has been active in the Middle East since 1999 , but it faces challenges here unlike those it has encountered in any other corner of the planet , and lately they have taken a strange , even outlandish turn .
The latest Middle Eastern tribulations of Starbucks are merely one example of the political minefield that many North American or European companies must negotiate in what must be among the twitchiest , most disputatious neighbourhoods in the world .
Cue Egyptian cleric Safwat Higazi .
Speaking on Egypt's Al - Nas TV in January , the avuncular , grey - bearded imam issued a call for Arabs to boycott Starbucks , which operates a total of 280 coffee shops in nine Arab states , including Egypt .
" We want Starbucks to be shut down throughout the Arab world , " declared Higazi .
The reason ?
Well , it has to do with the Starbucks logo .
What most people likely see when they inspect the famous green - and - white Starbucks emblem is the likeness of a long - maned mermaid wearing a crown , surrounded by several concentric circles that contain the company 's brand name .
But that is not what Higazi sees .
" The girl in the Starbucks logo is Queen Esther , " he insisted .
" This queen is Queen of the Jews . "
And the crown she wears ?
" This is the crown of the Kingdom of Persia .
This girl you see is Esther , Queen of the Jews in Persia . "
The cleric , whose four - minute polemic may be viewed online on YouTube , goes on to summarize the Old Testament story of Esther , a beautiful virgin who is manipulated by her cousin Mordecai to win the heart and hand of the Persian king Ahasuerus ( believed to be Xerxes I ) without revealing to him that she is a Jew .
" Can you believe that in Mecca , Medina , Cairo , Damascus , Kuwait and all over the Islamic world hangs the picture of beautiful Queen Esther with a crown on her head and we buy her products ? " exclaimed Higazi .
" It is inconceivable . "
He cautioned his viewers not to ransack Starbucks coffee shops or burn them down , but he exhorted everyone to boycott the offending premises .
On a section of its website devoted to the peculiar hazards of selling coffee in the Middle East , the company takes direct issue with the Egyptian imam , who has stirred up more than his share of controversy before .
" This is totally inaccurate , " say Starbucks management .
" This myth has been brought about by the similarity in looks on the cover of a children 's book about Esther to the Starbucks logo . "
In fact , says the company , the figure in its trademark is taken from a 16th century Norse woodcut .
It is unlikely the coffee - seller 's protests will carry much weight , for rumour campaigns against Starbucks have been swirling unchecked through the Arab world for years .
Most of the rumours directed against the company , whose CEO Howard Schultz happens to be a Jew , involve charges the Seattle firm provides financial support for the Israeli government or the Israeli military , allegations Starbucks flatly denies .
In fact , the company does not even operate in Israel .
Citing unfavourable market conditions , Starbucks closed its six Tel Aviv coffee shops in 2003 and has not returned .
But the rumours of an Israeli connection persist , bolstered by a 2006 letter , purportedly signed by Schultz , that has been floating around the Internet for several years .
In it , Schultz supposedly admits to bankrolling the Jewish state with hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
The letter has been debunked as a hoax , but the rumours rage on , nonetheless .
In January , demonstrators in London trashed two Starbucks coffee shops in protest against what they believed was a decision by the company to provide two weeks ' worth of revenues to fund that month 's bloody invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces – another rumour the company denies .
Starbucks is not alone in facing obstacles in the Middle East .
More than 120 familiar corporate brands – including Sara Lee , Nestlé , Marks & Spencer , Coca - Cola and Ralph Lauren – are also on the list of targets compiled by an international Boycott Israel campaign .
All these companies are accused of supporting Israel in one way or another .
But do these boycotts have much impact on the targeted firms ?
Most experts say no .
" The purchasing power of the Arab world is very limited , " said Efraim Inbar , director of Israel 's Begin - Sadat Center for Strategic Studies .
" It 's equal to Spain .
The ability of the Arab world to boycott products is very small . "

Gillian Anderson of The X - Files fame and former Doctor Who actor Christopher Eccleston have joined forces to appear in a London production of Henrik Ibsen 's A Doll 's House .
In this version the action has been moved from Norway to London
The result will no doubt appeal to sci- fi fans who may have secretly wondered what might happen if FBI agent Dana Scully ever crossed paths with a certain Time Lord .
More striking than its eye - catching casting , however , is the way this Donmar Warehouse revival brings a topical edge to this 19th - Century classic .
How ?
By making Norwegian banker Torvald Helmer - renamed Thomas Vaughan in Zinnie Harris 's adaptation - a Westminster politician facing a career - wrecking scandal .
It is a bold move that cannot help but reflect the current uproar over MPs ' expense claims and financial underhandedness .
One suspects , though , the play would strike chords of recognition even if its launch did not coincide with such a national cause celebre .
Since the X - Files TV series came to an end in 2002 , Anderson has carved a new niche for herself as a star of British films and the West End stage .
Arrogance Earlier this year she featured as an " honorary Brit " on a list of the UK's 20 most powerful women in theatre compiled by Harper 's Bazaar magazine .
She was also seen as Dickens ' Lady Dedlock in the BBC's Bleak House serial , a performance that landed her a Bafta nomination .
Eccleston ( left ) plays a disgraced politician desperate to save his career
The period gowns she wears in A Doll 's House recall that series , but her character could hardly be more different .
Flighty and girlish , Nora Vaughan is a trophy wife who lives to please her minister husband - played with a preening , patrician arrogance by onetime Bond villain Toby Stephens .
In truth , however , Nora has been keeping a secret from Thomas that could bring their comfortable middle - class existence crashing about their ears .
Unbeknownst to him , Nora forged her late father 's signature to secure a loan from Thomas 's bitter rival Neil Kelman , played by Eccleston .
When he arrives at her home on Christmas Eve threatening to expose her , she finds herself in an impossible situation .
Traditionally , this marital intrigue has formed a preamble to Nora 's climactic realisation that her life is an illusory sham .
Hypocrisy Armed with this discovery , she makes an empowering decision to leave her husband and two children that shocked audiences when the play was first staged in London in 1889 .

While the U.S. is bolstering its presence in Afghanistan , Canada is having second thoughts about its very presence .
The issue is on everyone ’s mind .
The Canadian government had called in Afghanistan ’s ambassador to deliver a stern rebuke to a controversial law that some say legalizes the rape of Shia Muslim women .
It included a provision making it illegal for a Shia Muslim woman to refuse to have sex with her husband , to leave the house without his permission or have custody of children .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper had expressed strong concerns about the legislation , saying Canada was “ deeply troubled ” by it .
As he pointed out , making progress on human rights for women “ is a significant component of the international engagement in Afghanistan . ”
Harper even hinted that allied support for Afghanistan would weaken should this law stay on the books .
But amid mounting international pressure — from Canada , the U.S. , Great Britain , and numerous other countries — Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced that the law will be amended so that it “ will not have any concerns on any account of human rights and especially the rights of the Afghan people . ”
According to a Kabul lawmaker , Karzai said that he did n’t read the law before signing it and his advisors never saw a version with the articles in question .
This about - face should lay to rest some of the most pressing concerns for Canadian human rights groups about the country ’s Afghanistan mission .
Back home and abroad , Canada ’s work in Afghanistan could hardly be seen as credible if a piece of legislation reminiscent of the repressive Taliban regime , was allowed to become law .
In the eyes of many combat - weary Canadians , the enactment of the controversial family law would be viewed as a slap in the face and a good excuse to exit the war - torn country .
Canada has vowed to stay on in Afghanistan until 2011 but is increasingly shifting its focus to the reconstruction effort and democratic governance .
Along with security , basic services , humanitarian aid , border protection , strong national institutions and reconciliation , one of its priorities is to strengthen judicial institutions , train judges and support the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission .
The view , now , is that Taliban insurgents are unbeatable .
Harper made that clear in a candid interview on CNN in March : “ Quite frankly , we are never going to defeat the insurgency …
My reading of Afghanistan history is that it ’s probably had an insurgency forever of some kind .
What has to happen in Afghanistan is we have to have an Afghan government that is capable of managing that insurgency . ”
If that ’s the case , many are wondering why Canadian soldiers are risking their lives in a war that is not winnable .
The sacrifice seems very high indeed .
And the payoff very far off in the distance although , clearly , some progress has been made .
Some 12,000 Afghans , mostly women , have signed up for basic literacy courses set up by Canada , schools have been built and police have undergone training .
The ball is now in Afghanistan ’s court .
It ’s a chance it cannot afford to miss .

© 2009 Lawrence A. Stanley
On March 30 , 2004 , when Dwight Whorley found the Japanese website of Fractal Underground Studio via Yahoo and clicked on a couple of the thumbnail images , he thought he had found what he was looking for : images that were n't child pornography by the legal definition , but which nonetheless expressed the ideas he wanted to see illustrated : sex between adults and minors .
They were cartoon figures , inked in a clumsy style .
There was nothing real , and no one was hurt .
No one could mistake them for anything other than the cartoons that they were .
[ 1 ]
Unfortunately for Whorley , he was n't at home , but in the public resource room at the Virginia Employment Commission , where he was supposed to be looking for a job .
A woman saw what he was looking at and informed a supervisor that he was viewing child pornography .
Believing the material to be legal , Whorley showed it to the supervisor and was promptly escorted to the door .
He did n't even have time to close his e-mail account .
[ 2 ]
Shortly thereafter , law enforcement officials seized twenty emails ( containing only words , no images ) detailing fantasies of sex with minors .
Only one email was sent by Whorley ; the rest he received from a third party .
Investigators also discovered that he viewed online 15 images of naked children from an Illinois website called " Logical Reality . " [ 3 ]
As if all this were n't enough already , Whorley was still under post - conviction supervision for the crime of downloading child pornography in 1999 , a crime for which he served three years and four months in jail .
[ 4 ]
It could easily be predicted that he would be shown no mercy .
For the act of " receiving " the cartoons , or more specifically , for printing out three of them at the public resource room [ 5 ] and purportedly viewing the rest online - the images were in the computer 's cache memory and no one could say for sure whether Whorley saw them for five minutes or one second or not at all [ 6 ]
-
Whorley was charged under two statutes : 18 U.S.C. Section 1462 , an obscenity statute harking back to 1873 , and 18 U.S.C. Section 1466A , a provision passed by Congress in 2003 .
[ 7 ]
The prohibitions under Section 1462 - which makes it a crime to use an " interactive computer service " to " take or receive " any " obscene , lewd , lascivious , or filthy book , pamphlet , picture , motion - picture film , paper , letter , writing , print , or other matter of indecent character " - were enough to convict Whorley , but under that section there is no minimum jail term . [ 8 ]
So , in addition , the government charged him under Section 1466A , " Obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children .
"
Section 1466A imposes precisely the same penalties that apply to images of hard - core child pornography showing real children . [ 9 ]
Paragraph ( a ) ( 1 ) of section 1466A criminalizes the production , distribution , receipt and possession with intent to distribute of any obscene visual depiction , including a drawing , cartoon , sculpture , or painting , which " depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct . "
Section ( b ) ( 1 ) purports to criminalize the private possession of such representations .
" Minor " means any person under the age of eighteen and " sexually explicit conduct " is defined as in the child pornography statute : " actual or simulated " acts of sexual intercourse , oral and anal sex , bestiality , masturbation , " sadistic or masochistic abuse , " or " lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person . "
Despite the application of both child pornography definitions and sentencing standards to Section 1466A , obscenity is not the same thing as child pornography .
An item is child pornography only when it depicts an actual minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct , regardless of the conditions under it is made , the quality or character of its portrayal or the mores of the community in which it is found . [ 10 ] ( For this reason " virtual child pornography " is not child pornography at all under the law .
It is an oxymoron . )
By contrast , an item is obscene when a jury finds it so after applying the three - pronged test devised in 1973 by the Supreme Court in the case of Miller v. California . [ 11 ]
To be clear , " obscenity " is not synonymous with pornography , but a tiny sub-category of it , which , in one jurisdiction or another , is found by a jury ( or a judge acting in a jury 's stead ) to be illegal .
Nothing , not even pornography , is presumptively " obscene . "
It must be judged so in a court of law .
Here is how the U.S. Department of Justice describes that tri-partite obscenity test in Miller in its " Citizens ' Guide to Federal Obscenity Laws " : - Whether the average person , applying contemporary adult community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest ( i.e. , an erotic , lascivious , abnormal , unhealthy , degrading , shameful , or morbid interest in nudity , sex , or excretion ) ; and - Whether the average person , applying contemporary adult community standards , would find that the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct ( i.e. , ultimate sexual acts , normal or perverted , actual or simulated , masturbation , excretory functions , lewd exhibition of the genitals , or sado - masochistic sexual abuse ) ; and - Whether a reasonable person would find that the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . [ 12 ]
It was in the hopes of avoiding the effort and expense of going through this test that Congress included two additional provisions in Section 1466A : paragraphs ( a ) ( 2 ) and ( b ) ( 2 ) .
These criminalize production , distribution , receipt , possession with intent to distribute , and private possession , but eliminate the first two prongs of the Miller test . [ 13 ]
These two provisions were not applied to Whorley .
The government left them for another day .
On March 6 , 2006 , a jury found Whorley guilty for " receiving " obscene cartoons .
It also found him guilty for receiving child pornography ( the photos of naked minors [ 14 ] ) and obscene emails .
However , for the cartoons alone he was sentenced to 20 years in prison , with a 10 - year period of probation thereafter , a sentence which was upheld on appeal last December by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals . [ 15 ]
Had he not been previously convicted of receiving child pornography , his sentence would probably have been much lower , but under 1466A the sentence for the first - time receipt of even a single image is , in any event , " not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years . " [ 16 ]
Given all the qualifying facts in the Whorley case , one might ask , why should anyone care ?
Setting aside questions of fundamental justice for the moment , the answer is : because cartoons and drawings are n't child pornography and should not be treated as such under the law .
The moral slippage in the law is palpable in the way it conflates images of actual minors with fictional representations : it refers to " depictions of minors , " and , by reference to the other provisions in the law , defines acts engaged in by " persons , " [ 17 ] but how is a cartoon character a person ?
It talks about engaging in sexually explicit acts , but how does a cartoon character engage in anything ?
It defines " actual or simulated " conduct , but how can a cartoon character 's conduct be " actual " ?
Ultimately the law denies the reality that these are not " depictions of minors " at all but pure fantasy .
One should care about this case because United States v. Whorley was a testing of the waters .
With Whorley behind bars , some people in the government believe they have a mandate .
Christopher Handley 's circumstances were vastly different from Dwight Whorley 's when law enforcement officers followed him home from the Post Office on May 23 , 2006 .
He had just picked up a package from Japan containing manga .
A thorough search of his home turned up only more of it : some 1200 magazines , hundreds of DVDs , laser discs and videotapes , and an untold number of images on computer , but no child pornography or even images of nude minors .
Handley was a collector of manga , not lolicon , and the vast majority of the manga and images he possessed contained no fantasy representations of minors at all . [ 18 ]
The fact that a small amount of it represented fictional pre-pubescents and fantasy portrayals of sadomasochistic or violent sex , however , meant that Handley faced a sentence ranging from a minimum of 7 years and 3 months in prison to a maximum of 9 years .
What does a small amount mean ?
By the government 's count , he received or possessed more than 150 but less than 300 such images in total .
Not 150 to 300 magazines , but cartoon pages with one or more panels or individual jpgs .
( The precise calculation of his sentence is outside the scope of this article , but each factor of the offense - the number of images , whether an image can be considered to represent a prepubescent , whether sadomasochistic conduct or bestiality are portrayed - is quantified in the United States Sentencing Guidelines . ) [ 19 ]
At first , things looked good for Handley .
He was charged under Section 1466A both for receipt and possession of manga , [ 20 ] but it took the government almost a year to hand down an indictment .
When it did , he was released on his own recognizance shortly thereafter .
The conditions of release were typically onerous , but not impossible .
Among them was the requirement to turn over the contents of his computer to the government ; to agree to have periodic unannounced searches of his computer " for child pornography " and unscheduled visits from government officers ; to undergo periodic drug testing ; to restrict his movements to the State of Iowa and two counties in Nebraska ; and to " seal and not access the printed and computer media materials released to him by the government of a sexual nature . " [ 21 ]
( Presumably this was a large quantity of material that the government decided it did n't want to keep once the case was over , but did n't want him looking at while the case was pending . )
Then the government went to work on him .
In July his Pre-Trial Officer tried to send him back to jail , claiming that he had " ongoing access to material that represents the sexual abuse of children . "
The officer 's report demonstrates just how expansive ( and possibly clueless ) a view some people in the government take of the statute in question .
It reads as follows :
He is regularly visiting sites that contain Anamie [ sic ] art .
There is concern at this time as the subject matter contained information relating to the " Gothic and Lolita Bible . "
Portions of the information accessed were as follows : A DVD advertisement - GaoGiaGar : King of Braves - with the quote , " Unlike Godanner , GaoGiaGar is n't aimed at those fans that have grown up and developed a taste for extreme fan - service and romantic drama ; its aimed at the fans that never grew up at all .
Do n't hide it you know who you are ....
[ The government thinks these are code words for pedophilia . ]
In addition were DVD titles of : All Sex Hentai , Angel Core , Sexy Freedom Fighters , Girls Locker Room Lust , Forbidden Love , Moral Hazard , Natural Obsession , Perverted Thomas , University Girls " Special Counseling . "
Other websites accessed were www.animesuki.com, www.animenewsnetwork.com, animenation.com , animenfo.com , ads.animesuki.com . [ 22 ]
As a result of the report , the district court prohibited Handley " from viewing or accessing anime on the Internet , " from " ordering anime video and written material , " or from " engag[ing ] in Internet chat . "
The latter condition would have the effect of preventing Handley from informing others about his case and preparing his defense , but pre-trial detention would have been even worse .
Finally , Handley was ordered to " participate in mental health counseling with a licensed mental health therapist of his choice " and to authorize the therapist to inform on him if s/he determines that Handley " is a danger to himself or others . " [ 23 ]
Things got even worse a year later when Handley 's lawyers filed their Motion to Dismiss .
Contrary to 35 years of jurisprudence and with the kind of logic that defines torture not to include waterboarding , Judge James E. Gritzner , a legacy of George W. Bush , ruled that the government could proceed under the possession charges .
This may sound like a harsh characterization of Judge Gritzner 's decision , but it really did come down to one simple sentence of doublespeak :
Thus , while an individual has a limited right to possess obscene materials in the privacy of his own home , there exists no right to ... possess obscene materials that have been moved in interstate commerce .... " [ 24 ]
In comparison are the unambiguous words of the Supreme Court from the 1969 case , Stanley v. Georgia :
But we think that mere categorization of these films as " obscene " is insufficient justification for such a drastic invasion of personal liberties guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments .
Whatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity , we do not think they reach into the privacy of one 's own home .
If the First Amendment means anything , it means that a State has no business telling a man , sitting alone in his own house , what books he may read or what films he may watch .
Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds .
[ Emphasis added . ] [ 25 ]
There is also the United States Department of Justice 's own public statement regarding possession from its " Citizens ' Guide " quoted above :
While the mere possession of child pornography is a crime , private possession of obscenity is not ...
The DOJ site contains no weasel words and no exceptions for possession of materials that were shipped , or which used paper and ink that were shipped , in interstate commerce .
This clear declaration certainly raises the question of the government 's good faith in charging Handley for possession in the first place .
Perhaps to his credit , Judge Gritzner did strike down as unconstitutional the two paragraphs of Section 1466A which tried to sidestep the Miller test , [ 26 ] but that determination made absolutely no difference to Handley , as the government had hedged its bets by not specifying which provisions it was proceeding under .
In the final analysis , only striking down the possession prohibition would have possibly benefited Handley , and then probably by only a few months .
It should come as no surprise to learn that Handley has negotiated ( but , as of this writing , not yet entere ) a guilty plea in the hopes of receiving a lower sentence .
How far will the government go ?
How about the somber work of Hiraku Machida , or Suehiro Maruo's DDT or Rose Colored Monster , or Liberatore 's Ranxerox ?
What about the art of Trevor Brown , or any of the publications or websites mentioned by Christopher Handley 's probation officer ?
What about Kaworu Watashiya 's Kodomo no Jikan ? [ 27 ]
Once you begin to attack pure fantasy , where do you stop ?
Under current legal interpretation , a drawing of Rin 's fictional panties covering her non-existent genitalia constitutes a prohibited sexual act .
Would a jury , applying local community mores , be convinced that these materials possess serious artistic value ?
In Texas v. Castillo , a state case from 2000 tried under Texas law , two defense experts - one of them a professor at the University of Texas who was also an authority on Asian literature - were unable to convince the jury that Demon Beast Invasion : The Fallen was not obscene .
What are the chances that a jury will credit an expert 's testimony regarding manga containing representations of minors ?
The government , of course , says " trust us , " but history teaches precisely the opposite .
Since 1984 , the category of material which could and would be prosecuted has been in a constant state of expansion by act of Congress and court decision alike .
At first the law forbade only the commercial handling of obscene images depicting minors under sixteen . [ 28 ]
In 1984 the upper age limit was increased to eighteen and the crime of simple receipt was added .
Later , Congress included the crime of possession of three or more items , then just a single item . [ 29 ]
Rather than defining " lascivious exhibitions of the genitals " by the model 's pose , the courts interpreted the phrase broadly , basing the determination on factors outside of the image itself , such as whether it was published with a lewd caption [ 30 ] or created with lewd intentions in mind . [ 31 ]
With United States v. Knox the meaning of the phrase expanded to include " exhibitions " of the pubic area or genitals which were fully covered by clothing and / or zooming in on that body part from afar , even without the knowledge of the person depicted . [ 32 ]
Simulated sexual acts were also defined and prohibited .
Advertisements became illegal , as did , briefly , any image that " appeared to be " a minor . [ 33 ]
Then Section 1466A came along , and with it all the criteria and penalties associated with child pornography were applied to completely fictional representations .
Naturally the penalties increased with each amendment .
Soon , if the so - called " Safety Act , " currently pending before Congress , is passed , the sentence for receiving even a single prohibited cartoon in violation of Section 1466A will jump from " not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years " to " 15 years or for life . " [ 34 ]
Life .
For cartoons .
Artists probably have the most to fear .
Under United States v. Schales , a decision issued last October by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , the very act of drawing may be deemed criminal under Section 1466A . [ 35 ]
In that case the defendant was charged and convicted for " producing " obscenity by using software to edit and paste together parts of pre-existing pornography with legal photos he took of local girls to make it appear as if the girls were engaging in sexually explicit conduct .
( He did not disseminate these images , but kept them for his private viewing . )
There is no logical reason why one rule would apply to collages and another to drawings and paintings .
Following this decision , what artist is willing to risk an assessment of the worth of his or her work by the harshest critic of all , the criminal law ?
It is often said that " bad cases make bad law , " but here the bad law is being made by legislators and judges alike who climb over each other in an effort to prove their moral uprightness and supposed concern with protecting children .
It is quite possible that at least some of the more obvious excesses - the prosecution of private possession of obscenity ; the definition of " production " to include the creation of collages , the definition of " receiving " to include viewing online however briefly ( or not at all ) and the recent criminalization of " accessing " with intent to view - will eventually be ruled unconstitutional .
Likewise , there are solid legal arguments why the interpretation of Section 1466A as applying to completely fictional representations is untenable and contradictory given both the language of the statute and statements of intent by those in Congress who drafted it .
But in the broader view , Section 1466A is about thought control .
Both the law and its penalties are premised solely on the idea that fictional representations " whet the appetites " of sex offenders or seduce children into sex .
When the Supreme Court rejected that rationale for prohibiting fictional representations under the rubric of " child pornography " but held that such images could , nonetheless , be prohibited if they were " obscene , " it did not indicate that anything goes .
Rather , the Court announced this crucial principle :
The mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it .
The government " cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person 's private thoughts . " ...
First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end .
The right to think is the beginning of freedom , and speech must be protected from the government because speech is the beginning of thought . [ 36 ]
Speech includes not just the written word , but also painting , drawing , collage , film , video and sculpture .
Private authorship and possession of obscene books are no different from private authorship or possession of obscene works of art .
Prohibiting either strikes at the very heart of freedom of thought , but then so does prohibiting an individual 's right to buy , purchase , download or otherwise receive " obscenity " for his or her private consumption .
Do n't think that this argument is a defense of child pornography .
It is n't .
The subject here is fiction and fantasy .
No children are abused in the production of these images .
In its 1973 decision in United States v. Orito , the Supreme Court ruled that the right of an individual to private possession of obscene material did not mean that the producer or seller could lawfully send it to him or her through the mail .
" Congress could reasonably determine such regulation to be necessary to effect permissible federal control of interstate commerce in obscene material , " Chief Justice Burger wrote , " based as that regulation is on a legislatively determined risk of ultimate exposure to juveniles or to the public and the harm that exposure could cause . " [ 37 ]
A lot has happened since 1973 , including an explosive growth in the selection and availability of sexually explicit material , a revolution in communications and an evolution in our understanding of the zone of privacy .
( In 2003 , the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a Texas sodomy law , holding that a state may not enforce the moral views of the majority " on the whole society through operation of the criminal law . " [ 38 ] )
Several times in the past ten years the courts has struck down laws aimed at restricting on - line content on the basis that it might be seen by juveniles or unwilling adults . [ 39 ]
One of these days , the Supreme Court will have to face this larger issue of whether the obscenity laws can honestly still be justified .
In the meantime , organizations like the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund , which would have provided expert witnesses at its own expense had the Handley case gone to trial , should be supported through donations and membership .
News sites and blogs should loudly criticize government interference with the rights of its citizens to purchase , read and possess the publications they wish .
Petitions should be sent to members of Congress objecting to the censorship of art under the guise of protecting children .
Moral crusading against comic books and art must be forced into retreat .

FBI Agent James M. Fottrell , a forensics expert , testified that the computer Whorley used " only logged one entry for each of those images [ i.e. , the 20 cartoons ] .
He also stated that he was ' confused ' about different windows being open at the same time on the computer , and that the data gets ' mishmashed ' because of email activity and browsing activity going on at the same time .
J.A. 581 , 606 .
He conceded that 'an image could be downloaded onto the hard drive in the internet cache hard drive , and the person sitting there looking at the screen may never see the image , " or may just see a portion of the image or the contents page .
J.A. 592 , 609 , 620 , 626 .
He also conceded that the index .dat file does not indicate what is appearing on the screen , only the timing and sequence of what is going on with the hard drive and the Internet Explorer Program .

He confirmed that for almost all charged images , many uncharged images were logged in within seconds of the charged images , and many uncharged images in the same second as the uncharged images .

The statute , known as The Protect Act of 2003 ( " Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today " ) , was introduced in January 2003 and signed into law on April 30th of that year .

18 U.S.C. 1462 specifies a prison sentence of " not more than five years " for a first offense and " not more than tem years ... for each offense thereafter . "
See http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1462.html [ 9 ]
The penalties under 18 U.S.C. Section 1466 ª are controlled by 18 U.S.C. 2252A ( b ) , the child pornography statute .
See http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1466A&url=/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001466—A000-.html [ 10 ]
The distinction was first made in New York v. Ferber , 458 U.S. 747 ( Supreme Court of the United States , 1982 ) , see http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0458_0747_ZO.html. [ 11 ]

No Senator or Congressman actually stated this as a reason for the provision , but the attempt to create a slightly narrower category of images of fictional minors with respect to which the Miller test could be dispensed was obviously aimed at easing any prosecutorial burden while reducing the defendant 's chances for a successful defense . [ 14 ]
According to Whorley 's federal public defender , Robert J. Wagner , " The nude images in the case , which were thumbnails scattered among written text , were simply nude children in non-lascivious poses , sitting on the kitchen counter , standing in the woods , standing on the beach .
It was simply the context of everything else in the case that caused the jury to find him guilty on those counts .
These were the kind of pictures that you might find in a family album . "
( Email communication March 18 , 2009 ; see also Brief of the Appellant , United States v. Whorley , p. 80 . )
This characterization is strongly supported by circumstantial evidence .
The FBI 's expert testified that he visited the Logical Reality site to confirm the existence of the images seven or eight months after Whorley was arrested : [ Agent Fottrell ] compared the pages appearing on the web - site during the October - November 2004 time frame with the files in the VEC computer 's temporary Internet file directory [ on the day of Whorley 's arrest , March 30 , 2004 ] , and found them to be the same .

He also stated that the text on the web - site indicated that it was last updated in 2003 .

Superceding Indictment , United States v. Christopher S. Handley , Crim .
No. 07-CR-030 , United States District Court , Southern District of Iowa , Western Division , October 17 , 2007 ; and Order of District Judge James E. Gritzner , July 2 , 2008 , http://www.iasd.uscourts.gov/iasd/.../Handley.pdf
There is no mention in any court document throughout the case of either child pornography or images of nude minors in the defendant 's possession .
It would have been noted and / or charged had there been . [ 19 ]
In calculating the applicable sentencing range , Handley 's lawyer noted the sentencing enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines Section 2G2.2 ( b ) ( 7 ) ( B ) for the presence of " at least 150 images , but fewer than 300 images . "
That number would have been provided to him by the government .
See , Defendant 's Motion in Limine , United States v. Handley , p. 6 . Sections 2G2.2 ( b ) ( 7 ) ( C ) and ( D ) provide further enhancements , respectively , for " at least 300 images , but fewer than 600 ″ and " 600 or more images . "
The guidelines are less than precise as to how the government counts images in magazines , but one may draw an inference that one page equals one image : ( B ) Determining the Number of Images .
- For purposes of determining the number of images under subsection ( b ) ( 7 ) :
( i) Each photograph , picture , computer or computer - generated image , or any similar visual depiction shall be considered to be one image .
If the number of images substantially underrepresents the number of minors depicted , an upward departure may be warranted .
( ii ) Each video , video - clip , movie , or similar recording shall be considered to have 75 images .
If the length of the recording is substantially more than 5 minutes , an upward departure may be warranted .
See " 2008 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual , Chapter 2 - Part G - Offenses Involving Commercial Sex Acts , Sexual Exploitation of Minors , and Obscenity , " available at http://www.ussc.gov/2008guid/2g2_2.htm.
The low number of images in Whorley 's case rules out the probability of being charged in connection with Comic LO , as a single issue of that magazine contains more than 300 pages , each which contain numerous chargeable cartoon panels .
An email exchange with the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund ( CBLDF ) also suggests that there are no English words on the cover of the magazines in question :
" The titles of the manga in question in Handley is not secret , but they are not known either .
The material in question is untranslated Japanese manga , likely doujinshi ...
The titles have not been identified , and the alleged nature of the material makes wide dissemination to identify titles risky . "
Email dated April 7 , 2009 from Charles Brownstein , Executive Director of CBLDF to the author . [ 20 ]
Handley was also charged with mailing an obscene book of cartoons which , according to the indictment , " depicted graphic bestiality , including sexual intercourse , between human beings and animals such as pigs , monkeys and others . "

______________________________________________
Afterward Some websites have reported that Christopher Handley received or was in possession of issues of Comic LO .
There is almost not chance that this rumor is true .
Here 's what Charles Brownstein , Executive Director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund ( CBLDF ) has to say about the titles : " The titles of the manga in question in Handley is not secret , but they are not known either .
The material in question is untranslated Japanese manga , likely doujinshi , [ furnished by the government ] as a series of photocopies .
The titles have not been identified ... "
If Handley had received or possessed copies of Comic LO , there would be no doubt as to the title , since the title is written in English .
Moreover , each issue of Comic LO contains well over 300 images that would violate 18 U.S.C. 1466A .
But as the article , " Viewing Manga As A Crime , " points out , " [ b ] y the government 's count , [ Handley ] received or possessed more than 150 but [ fewer ] than 300 such images in total . "
Remember that he was charged for receiving AND possessing a variety of titles .
Thus it is almost impossible that Comic LO was among them .
Given the ubiquity of prosecutable " schoolgirl " images in manga ( including prosecutable images showing some variety of bdsm , which provides for a sentencing enhancement ) , the issues raised by the Handley prosecution are serious indeed .
About the Author Lawrence A. Stanley has a B.A. in Philosophy from George Washington University and a Juris Doctor from Cardozo School of Law .
He has authored or co-authored appeal briefs in U.S. v. Knox and U.S. v. Various Articles of Merchandise , Schedule No. 287 , among other cases , and amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. Oakes and Maryland v. Craig .
His articles have been published in Playboy , the Washington Post , The Gauntlet and other print publications .
In 1989 , he was the recipient of the Free Press Association 's H.L. Mencken Award for Investigative Journalism for his Playboy series , The Child Porn Myth .
He currently practices in the area of trademark and copyright law .
The kicker , here and elsewhere , is Beckett ’s uncanny multilingualism .
( Remember , this is the man they entrusted with the translation of portions of “ Work in Progress , ” a k a “ Finnegans Wake , ” into French . )
Italian phrases and poems judiciously and joyfully pepper these letters , and never gratuitously : Beckett seems practically incapable of an unconscientious utterance .
Among the most affecting streams of correspondence is the one he conducts with his teenage cousin in Dublin , a promising student of modern languages .
Lucky , lucky fellow , because from Beckett he receives long letters in French and German that are master­pieces of mentorship : learned , utterly uncondescending , self - revealing , personal .
( The editors , Martha Dow Fehsenfeld and Lois More Overbeck , throughout provide translations — executed by George Craig , Dan Gunn and Viola Westbrook — of all foreign - language letters . )
It is to the youngster that Beckett makes the crucial admission ( in German ) that “ no sooner do I take up my pen to compose something in English than I get the feeling of being ‘ de - personified . ’ ”
Although there are no letters here to his parents — perhaps because Beckett authorized the publication only of letters “ having bearing on my work ” ? — there is no doubt he remained deeply preoccupied by “ the fading fact of my family . ”
He notes : “ Lovely walk this morning with Father , who grows old with a very graceful philosophy .
Comparing bees & butterflies to elephants & parrots & speaking of indentures with the leveler .
Barging through hedges and over the walls with the help of my shoulder , blaspheming and stopping to rest under color of admiring the view .
I ’ll never have anyone like him . ”
Several months later , the father dies .
The son says , “ I ca n’t write about him , I can only walk the fields and climb the ditches after him . ”
This bereavement was , no doubt , one of the events that influenced the progressive calming , over the years , of Beckett ’s tone .
About the possible Nazi invasion , he writes from Paris : “ No matter how things go I shall stay on here .
. . .
All I have to lose is legs , arms , balls etc. , and I owe them no particular debt of gratitude as far as I know . ”
There is little sign , in these ­pages , of sustained attention to political and economic crises .
The Great Depression is not mentioned , and Hitler and his cronies figure , briefly , as absurdities ; even when he travels in Nazi Germany in 1936 - 37 , Beckett ’s focus is on galleries and churches .
The future member of the Resistance has yet to show himself .
In June 1940 , he writes from Paris : “ Suzanne seems to want to get away .
I do n’t .
Where would we go , and with what ? ”
Suzanne is Suzanne Deschevaux - ­Dumesnil .
Here ’s how we learn of her : “ There is a French girl also whom I am fond of , dispassionately , and who is very good to me .
The hand will not be overbid .
As we both know that it will come to an end there is no knowing how long it may last . ”
Beckettists will know , of course , that in due time Suzanne and Sam married , and that the marriage lasted till their deaths .
The knowledge of what lay ahead for Beckett — the writing of the plays and the great prose fiction — makes one very impatient for the further volumes of letters , almost as if Beckett were in actual correspondence with oneself .
I know a little about what this might feel like .
Many years ago , while languishing like Murphy in a London flat , I received an airmail envelope on which my name had been scratched with a ballpoint pen .
I had no idea who could be writing to me from France , so unthinkingly I tore open the envelope .
I wish I ’d been more careful .
The envelope contained a very short , playful message from Samuel Beckett .
It ’s still my most precious possession .
The stock market at least in its current form is a horrible indicator of the actual economic carnage falling upon the majority of Americans .
Most Americans are witnessing the current rally and wondering why the massive run up ( largely in financial related stocks ) is going forward while they are getting called into supervisor offices behind closed doors and being laid off or seeing their hours cut back .
Wall Street has completely disconnected from Main Street .
It is also hard for many to understand how they are having their limited income being taxed to finance the bailouts of Wall Street and financial cronies while they are asked to do more with less .
They are seeing these same institutions , alive because of the massive funding from the American people since our government ideally should reflect the will of the majority , shut off credit lines and raise rates while the government through the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve showers the banks and Wall Street with easy low rate financing thanks to the American taxpayer .
Welcome to the new America .
Where unemployment is good news for Wall Street and bailouts are now seen as a new source of revenue for financial companies .
New accounting students will learn how to incorporate bailout funds as a new source of revenue .
It is easy to turn a profit when trillions are funneled into the financial system .
This is like jumping into the blue ocean and being shocked you got wet .
Yet the problem of course is very little of this money is trickling down to the real economy ; you know , the economy that does n’t involve Bloomberg Terminals and pinstripe suits ?
Imagine a giant person eating at a table and the mice are running around on the floor hoping to pick up the scraps .
Guess who the mice are ?
The last few weeks have been great for the financial companies because they are now operating in a pseudo reality that is for the privileged few .
These are the new financial overlords and all it took was the collapse of debt to show them for what they truly are .
Many people for the last few decades have confused debt with actual wealth .
That is a mistake we are now coming to terms with .
Many families now are seeing $ 5,000 in credit card debt at a good rate all of a sudden jump up just because banks have decided to change terms .
They are doing this on a massive scale while cutting the credit lines of many Americans .
Just to highlight this split , let us look at the unemployment numbers released for California on Friday :
The unemployment rate for California is now 11.2 % , the highest on record .
While the markets are rallying states are reporting higher and higher unemployment rates .
In California , this translates to 2,131,200 unemployed and the trend is still moving higher .
Most Americans would say that there biggest source of income is their job .
So how can an economy be healthy if people are losing jobs and breaking records ?
Again , the small elite circle of financial kingpins are squeezing the debt serfdom to pay as much as they can even though they are confronting one of the worst employment markets in history .
We have been throwing money at this problem for many months now .
We first brought out the TARP in the fall of 2008 and that has been an abject failure .
Remember that most officials have been saying that it has been crucial to stabilize the housing market .
You would think that $ 12 trillion in committed bailout funds would at least stem some foreclosures .
In fact , the opposite has occurred .
The latest data shows foreclosures breaking all time records :
Even with all the moratoriums , incentives to banks , and other smoke and mirrors foreclosures keep on moving up meaning more and more Americans are losing their homes .
So what have all those bailouts accomplished ?
They have kept the banking feudal lords sitting pretty while the rest of country finances their massive losses .
I even hesitate to call this corporate welfare because many corporations still have to face the grim reality like all us .
I call this crony financial capitalism run by a small group of plutocrats .
If you are looking at the stock market as some sign of the overall health of the economy you are really looking in the wrong place .
So what has happened to the income of most Americans ?
Let us take a look :
Keep in mind the above data does not include the destruction of $ 11.2 trillion in financial wealth because of 2008 .
Even without that cold hard fact , American families overall have seen their income not only stagnate , but go negative when adjusted for inflation .
So who has done well in the last decade ?
While most families have seen their income move sideways or decrease , the top 10 percent of wage earners have seen gigantic shifts in their income upward .
Even with the top 10 percent , you see most of it being skewed by the top 5 percent of all incomes .
And the more money you have , the less you depend on wages :
So while 90 percent of Americans depend on their wages for 70 percent of their income or higher , the top 10 percent of wage earners only depend on wages for 46 percent of their income , a drop from 53 percent in 2004 .
What does this mean ?
They get more money from passive sources .
Passive sources like fleecing the 90 percent of American taxpayers to make sure their bond income or stock portfolio pays enough in dividends so they do n’t have to go out there with the other 90 percent of poor schmucks trying to make a living .
And keep in mind , those at the higher end of the curve are not part of that elite group .
Let us look at the income break down for the U.S. :
In order to be in the top 10 percent your household will need to bring in $ 118,200 or more .
Here in California that is basically a household of two working professionals .
But given the high unemployment rate , the number of families here is decreasing .
I would argue that you will see a bigger difference if you look at household incomes of more than $ 200,000 .
That is where the separation begins .
The problem with the current system is the abject hypocrisy .
Most Americans for the most part , do believe in the basic tenets of capitalism .
Competition .
Supply and demand .
But here you have a system that does not favor competition .
In fact , the top five banks control upwards of 60 percent of all banking .
How is that competition ?
How about AIG posting the biggest quarterly loss in history ?
Their punishment is more money .
In addition , the core belief of competition is that the best businesses will survive and thrive .
In our current environment , we are rewarding the worst and most corrupt businesses .
It is contrary to what many have been told .
That is why you are seeing such anger and frustration out in our country .
Wall Street and politicians can’t admit to what is going on but if you have two eyes and a bit of logic , you will realize that all we have been doing is a transfer of wealth from the majority to the tiny minority .
To show this even clearer look at the income for various brackets :
It would be one thing if the top earners made their money from solid businesses .
There are many that did do this .
But there is a massive majority that created their wealth through AIG , Lehman Brothers , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and other complete failures of business .
Many hedge funds thrived because they placed bets on casino like profits in finance and real estate .
If you want to see who are the biggest failures just look at the TARP recipients yet they are the companies seeing the biggest benefit in the current rally .
They are all trying to prance around in this parade with their first quarter profits but those are thanks to the taxpayer , not them .
If it was n’t for the bailouts , they would be in bankruptcy themselves if they did n’t have control of an oligarchy system of finance .
The best course of action should have been receivership .
But that would cut in to this select group of people and their income so we could n’t do that .
Therefore the next logical step was to snow the masses into believing the world would end if we did n’t step in .
They should have qualified that their financial world would have ended which is n’t necessarily a bad thing .
Since that time , unemployment has been skyrocketing , foreclosures are at all time highs , and we are too believe that this is good for us ?
For many people things are ending ( i.e. , jobs , losing homes , losing healthcare , etc ) .
And even amongst the wealthy , there is also a caste system :
We can throw in a few hedge fund managers and bond managers in this group .
Ultimately , the system is flawed .
Most Americans have been under the illusion that they were wealthy .
They are not .
In fact , we can pinpoint this decline on a graph :
Starting in the 1970s , we started seeing a massive decline in the savings rate and an explosive jump in consumer debt .
Debt per se is n’t bad .
In fact , for nearly 50 years the 30 year fixed mortgage served us well when borrowers came in with a down payment ( which they saved ) .
That all changed of course .
Now , debt was used as a supplement to the lack of real wage growth .
It was like a fake Hollywood set .
It was only a matter of time before we walked up to the cutout of a building and pushed it over .
Time to put that Fiji vacation on the credit card .
Let us put the Jacuzzi on the American Express .
Time to put those breast implants on the card .
It was used for everything and anything .
And that was the problem .
Debt was given to all with the implicit notion that if everything went boom , the government would step in to backstop it all .
No one really explicitly said this but the inner circle knew this .
Everything has gone boom and here the government is bailing out decades of frivolous spending financed by the loan sharks on Wall Street .
As a society we setup the environment to create Frankensteins like Bernard Madoff .
He got away with it for so long because the system rewarded people like him .
He merely played the game better than most .
Do n’t hate the player , hate the game .
There are many that are worse than Madoff but they played within the plutocracy rules therefore everything is fine .
But is it ?
Is this the kind of system we want where gains are privatized and losses are socialized on the back of the population ?
I know many people are screaming about socialism now but they are late to the game ( like a few decades late ) .
Also , what exactly is the mass population getting for this new expensive socialism ?
Employment security ?
Healthcare ?
If this is socialism we are getting very little out of it .
For a history lesson , Mussolini ’s government was supported by the military , the business class , and the extreme wings of the political branches .
Sound familiar ?
In fact , in 1935 Mussolini pushed for government control of business .
By 1935 nearly 75 percent of Italian business was under state control .
We have AIG , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , all the TARP banks , and what else ?
We definitely do not want to go down this path .
Are we looking at Japan and there 2 lost decades as an example ?
The crowd that is getting silenced here is the moderate majority .
In fact , I talk with both moderate Democrats and Republicans and we have more in common than many think .
Yet you have the extreme wings of the party hijacking issues .
Like the tea parties started with anger toward the bailouts .
Yet many protests started having people use other wedge issues which have nothing to do with the bailout .
These are distractions .
Keep your eye on the ball .
The first news station that does a two hour piece shredding the Fed and U.S. Treasury gets a massive high five ( hint hint CNBC ) .
The current administration has two widely respected financial experts in Paul Volcker and Elizabeth Warren .
They should unleash both of them on the current financial industry .
Last I heard is they are putting Volcker on the task of reforming the tax code which is incredibly important .
But why not have him tackling the current banking crisis as well ?
He can walk and chew gum .
Also , Elizabeth Warren showed up on The Daily Show and said all the right things .
Yet when John Stewart asked her what her power was , she really could n’t say .
All she could say is “ I ’ll talk about it . ”
What use is transparency without the ability to act on what you find ?
Now I realize a fiscal problem 30 years in the making wo n’t be fixed in 3 months , but I hope we start seeing some progress in protecting the American people because ultimately , we are all going to pay if we continue down this path .
The bottom line is there is a two class system in the U.S. and it does n’t separate along party lines .
Those that rely and use debt and those that create it with the aid of the government ( aka Wall Street ) .
Banking should be a utility that provides capital for the most efficient resources .
That is it .
Banks should not be seen as a large segment of the economy for employment .
They are like a parasite that depends on the host producing over and over .
Now that defaults are hitting , they are looking for a new vector and now they are latched onto the government ( aka taxpayers ) .
There was a reason banking became a boring enterprise after the Great Depression .
If we learn any lessons from our Great Recession banking will go back to being a boring , controlled , and tiny part of our economy .
In the mean time , enjoy the stock market rally for the feudal lords while unemployment keeps skyrocketing for serfdom .

A lawyer for the Tennessee college student charged with hacking into the Alaska governor ’s Yahoo e-mail account last year says his client could n’t have violated Palin ’s privacy because a judge had already declared her e-mails a matter of public record .
“ He ’s not suggesting that e-mail ca n’t be private , ” says Mark Rasch , a former Justice Department cybercrime prosecutor .
“ He ’s saying this particular e-mail was not private or personal because of who she is and because it was n’t intimate communication . ”
Additionally , photos that 20 - year - old David Kernell allegedly obtained of Palin and her family were not private since the Palins are “ the subjects of untold numbers of photo - ops , ” the lawyer argued last week , in one of a slew of motions and memorandums attacking the government ’s four - count federal indictment against Kernell .
Threat Level broke the story last September that a hacker had obtained unauthorized access to Palin ’s Yahoo e-mail account — gov.palin@yahoo.com — by using publicly available information to reset her password to “ popcorn . ”
The intruder then posted screenshots of Palin ’s e-mail , as well as her new password , to a forum at 4 chan.org under the handle “ Rubico , ” enabling other intruders to access the account .
Bloggers quickly traced the name Rubico to an e-mail address that Kernell was known to use .
Last October , federal prosecutors in Tennessee had Kernell indicted on one felony count of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
Then in March prosecutors filed three more charges — one count of identity theft for allegedly impersonating Palin to access her e-mail account ; one count of wire fraud for allegedly scheming to defraud Palin of property by obtaining information from her account and posting it to a web forum ; and one count of obstruction of justice for allegedly destroying evidence .
Now defense lawyer Wade Davies is asking a federal judge to dismiss all of the charges on various grounds , with particular attention to the hacking and wire fraud charges .
The attorney ’s pretrial arguments provide insight into his defense strategy should the matter proceed to trial .
Last year , following the initial indictment , Davies objected to the computer hacking charge on the grounds that the government had erroneously used two misdemeanors pertaining to the same crime to elevate the charge to a felony .
In order for hacking to be a felony under the federal law , it has to be done for the purpose of committing an additional crime , or a “ tortious ” act — i.e. , an action that could give rise to a civil suit .
But in a circular argument , the government had essentially charged Kernell with obtaining unauthorized access to information in Yahoo ’s computers for the criminal purpose of obtaining unauthorized access to the information .
In March , prosecutors addressed the circular problem by amending the charge to state that Kernell ’s alleged unauthorized computer access violated Palin ’s privacy , committing a tortious act under the laws of Tennessee , where Kernell resides .
Davies , however , says the Tennessee law is improperly invoked , and Palin is n’t entitled to privacy protection .
Tennessee , he says , only recognizes an invasion of privacy when the invasion exposes something that is inherently private , and the victim was placed in a false light by the invasion .
But Palin was n’t placed in a false light by the alleged hack , and her privacy was n’t invaded since “ an Alaska court has issued an order requiring Ms. Palin to preserve the correspondence in her private e-mail accounts on the grounds that the e-mails are public records . ”
Davies is referring to litigation that was filed by an Alaskan activist before the alleged hack occurred .
That lawsuit sought Palin ’s private e-mail .
The activist charged that Palin used her Yahoo accounts to conduct official government business and therefore e-mail in the accounts was part of the public record and should be disclosed under Alaska ’s public records statute .
A judge ruled , after news of the hack broke , that Palin was required to preserve the correspondence in her private accounts until the lawsuit was resolved .
Davies implies in his motion to dismiss that there are reasonable grounds to conclude that Palin ’s Yahoo correspondence was a public record , and cites case law showing that information that already appears on the public record ca n’t be considered private .
As for photos of Palin and family members that Kernell allegedly obtained from the account , Davies says there ’s no expectation of privacy for the images , because the people depicted in the photos “ continue to regularly and voluntarily appear in the national media . ”
Without the privacy violation , the government has no felony case , Davies argues .
Therefore he wants the charge reduced to a misdemeanor .
Calls to Davies and federal prosecutors in Tennessee were not returned , but Rasch finds the argument compelling .
“ He ’s also saying that what was in the e-mails would ultimately have been revealed [ under litigation ] therefore she had no expectation of privacy in it , ” says Rasch .
Rasch says that although the alleged public - records status of the e-mail does n’t give anyone the right to break into the account , “ it would be very difficult for [ the government ] to allege a breach of privacy ” if the e-mail is a public record .
He also says that in order to prove a privacy interest in the e-mails , the government would have to share the contents of the e-mails .
“ I do n’t see how they could prosecute the case without doing it , ” he says .
“ Those are the exhibits .
They can ask the court to submit them under seal , but how do I as a juror decide if there was an invasion of privacy if I do n’t know what he looked at ? ”
Palin ’s office did not return a call seeking comment .
Aside from the computer fraud and privacy charge , Davies also took issue with a wire fraud charge alleging that his client deprived Palin of property by accessing her e-mail .
Davies argues that the charge is n’t valid because e-mails constitute “ ethereal ” property , not “ traditional property ” as defined by the law .
Kernell , he wrote , “ was not trying to steal from Sarah Palin . ”
Rasch says the argument that e-mail is not property is “ interesting ” but will likely fail to get the wire fraud charge dismissed .
However , if the matter goes to trial , he says the attorney might be able to convince a jury that Kernell simply accessed the e-mail out of curiosity , not out of an intent to defraud .
He notes that the issue over whether e-mail constitutes property and therefore carries privacy protection is one that the laws do n’t cover sufficiently .
“ It ’s not to say that there is no property interest in e-mail , but we do n’t do very well in this country about defining the value of it [ in terms of ] privacy , ” he says .
“ It ’s a valid question and it has broader social implications . ”
Kernell ’s trial is scheduled for Oct. 27 .
If convicted of all four charges , he faces 18 to 24 months in prison and a fine of between $ 4,000 and $ 40,000 , according to a federal sentencing guidelines based on the allegations .
Had he been charged with misdemeanors , he would likely have faced probation or house arrest .

It is well known that China has an ancient and glorious history , from the feudal periods ending in 222 BC through the three Imperial and Intermediate Eras , up to the Modern era – over 4000 years of dynastic reigns .
It may also be well known that China is the source of many wonderful and useful inventions from spaghetti to gunpowder .
This list , however , will take a slightly different slant of the topic : Chinese inventions and developments that were not known to or adopted by the Western ( European ) world for many decades and sometimes centuries after they were common place in China .
Some you may be familiar with , others perhaps less so .
As this is not a ‘ top 10 ’ type list , the entries are in a ( mostly ) chronological order of when they were invented or developed .
Please note that these are inventions and technological developments and not discoveries about the natural world – though it is also true that in many cases the Chinese scientists far preceded ‘ The West ’ in discoveries as well ( e.g. William Harvey is credited with discovering the circulation of blood in 1628 .
It was described in Chinese documents in the 2nd Century BC ) .
1 Row Planting Feudal Period – 6 Century BC
The Chinese started planting crops in rows sometime in the 6th century BC .
This technique allows the crops to grow faster and stronger .
It facilitates more efficient planting , watering , weeding and harvesting .
There is also documentation that they realized that as the wind travels over rows of plants there is less damage .
This obvious development was not instituted in the western world for another 2200 years .
Master Lu wrote in the “ Spring and Autumn Annals ” : ‘ If the crops are grown in rows they will mature rapidly because they will not interfere with each other ’s growth .
The horizontal rows must be well drawn , the vertical rows made with skill , for if the lines are straight the wind will pass gently through . ’
This text was compiled around 240 BC .
2 Compass Feudal period – 4th Cent BC
The Chinese developed a lodestone compass to indicate direction sometime in the 4th century BC .
These compasses were south pointing and were primarily used on land as divination tools and direct finders .
Written in the 4th Century BC , in the Book of the Devil Valley Master it is written : “ lodestone makes iron come or it attracts it ” .
The spoons were made from lodestone , while the plates were of bronze .
Thermo - remanence needles were being produced for mariners by the year 1040 , with common use recorded by 1119 .
Thermo - remanence technology , still in use today , was ‘ discovered ’ by William Gilbert in about 1600 .
3 The Seed Drill Han Dynasty : circa 202 BC – 220 AD
The Seed Drill is used to plant seeds into the soil at a uniform depth and covers it .
Without this tool seeds are tossed by hand over the ground resulting in waste and inefficient , uneven growth .
Chinese farmers were using seed drills as early as the 2nd Century BC .
The first known European instance was a patent issued to Camillo Torello in 1566 , but was not adopted by Europeans into general use until the mid 1800’s .
4 Iron Plows Han Dynasty : circa 202 BC – 220 AD
One of the major developments of the ancient Chinese agriculture was the use of the iron moldboard plows .
Though probably first developed in the 4th century BC and promoted by the central government , they were popular and common by the Han Dynasty .
( So I am using the more conservative date ) .
A major invention was the adjustable strut which , by altering the distance of the blade and the beam , could precisely set the depth of the plow .
This technology was not instituted into England and Holland until the 17th century , sparking an abundance of food which some experts say was a necessary prerequisite for the industrial revolution .
5 Deep Drilling Han Dynasty : circa 202 BC – 220 AD
By the first century BC the Chinese had developed the technology for deep drilling boreholes .
Some of these reached depths of 4800 feet ( about 1.5 km ) .
They used technology that would be easily recognizable to a modern engineer and lay person alike .
Derricks would rise as much as 180 feet above the borehole .
They stacked rocks with center holes ( tube or doughnut shaped ) from the surface to the deep stone layer as a guide for their drills ( similar to today ’s guide tubes ) .
With hemp ropes and bamboo cables reaching deep into the ground , they employed cast iron drills to reach the natural gas they used as a fuel to evaporate water from brine to produce salt .
The natural gas was carried via bamboo pipes to where it was needed .
There is also some evidence that the gas was used for light .
While I could not find exactly when deep drilling was first used by the Europeans , I did not find any evidence prior to the early industrial revolution ( mid 18th century ) .
In the United States , the first recorded deep drill was in West Virginia in the 1820s .
6 Ship ’s Rudder Han Dynasty : circa 202 BC – 220 AD
Chinese naval developments occurred far earlier than similar western technology .
The first recorded use of rudder technology in the West was in 1180 .
Chinese pottery models of sophisticated slung axial rudders ( enabling the rudder to be lifted in shallow waters ) dating from the 1st century have been found .
Early rudder technology ( c 100 AD ) also included the easier to use balanced rudder ( where part of the blade was in front of the steering post ) , first adopted by England in 1843 – some 1700 years later .
In another naval development , fenestrated rudders were common on Chinese ships by the 13th century which were not introduced to the west until 1901 .
Fenestration is the adding of holes to the rudder where it does not affect the steering , yet make the rudder easy to turn .
This innovation finally enabled European torpedo boats to use their rudders while traveling at high speed ( about 30 knots ) .
7 Harness for Horses Age of Division ; circa 220 – 581 AD
Throat harnesses have been used throughout the world to harness horses to carts and sleds .
These harnesses press back on the neck of the horse thus limiting the full strength of the animal .
In the late feudal period ( 4th Century BC ) there is pictorial evidence ( from the Chinese state of Chu ) of a horse with a wooden chest yoke .
By the late Han Dynasty the yoke was made from softer straps and was used throughout the country .
By the 5Th century , the horse collar ( pictured above ) , which allows the horse to push with its shoulders , was developed .
This critical invention was introduced into Europe approximately by 970 and became widespread within 200 years .
Because of the greater speed of horses over oxen , as well as greater endurance , agricultural output throughout Europe increased significantly .
8 Porcelain Sui Dynasty : 581 – 618 AD
Porcelain is a very specific kind of ceramic produced by the extreme temperatures of a kiln .
The materials fuse and form a glass and mineral compound known for its strength , translucence and beauty .
Invented during the Sui Dynasty ( but possibly earlier ) and perfected during the Tang Dynasty ( 618-906 ) , most notably by Tao - Yue ( c. 608 – c. 676 ) , Chinese porcelain was highly prized throughout the world .
The porcelain of Tao - Yue used a ‘ white clay ’ that was found on the edge of the Yangtze River , where he lived .
By the time of the Sung Dynasty ( 960 - 1279 ) the art of porcelain had reached its peak .
In 1708 the German Physicist Tschirnhausen invented European porcelain , thus ending the Chinese monopoly .
The picture above is a teabowl with black glaze and leaf pattern from the Southern Sung Dynasty ( 1127-1279 ) .
9 Toilet Paper Sui Dynasty : 581 – 618 AD
As noted above , paper was an early invention of China .
One of the first recorded accounts of using hygienic paper was during the Sui Dynasty in 589 .
In 851 an Arab traveler reported ( with some amazement ) that the Chinese used paper in place of water to cleanse themselves .
By the late 1300 ’s , approximately 720,000 sheets per year was produced in packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets .
In colonial times in America ( late 1700 ’s ) it was still common to use corn-cobs or leaves .
Commercial toilet paper was not introduced until the 1857 and at least one early advertiser noted that their product was ‘ splinter free ’ – something quite far from today ’s ‘ ultra - soft ’ .
One rather odd piece of trivia I picked up during my research is that the Romans used a sponge tied to the end of a stick – which may have been the origin of the expression “ to grab the wrong end of the stick ” .
10 Printing – movable type Song Dynasty : 960 – 1279 AD
That paper was invented by the Chinese is well known ( by Cai Lun c 50 - 121 AD ) , and it is one of the great Chinese inventions .
The recipe for this paper still exists and can be followed by today ’s artisans .
In 868 the first printed book , using full page woodcuts , was produced .
About 100 years later the innovations of Bi Sheng , pictured above , ( 990 - 1051 ) were described .
Using clay fired characters he made re-usable type and developed typesetting techniques .
Though used successfully to produce books , his technology was not perfected until 1298 .
By contrast , Gutenberg ’s bibles – the first European book printed with movable type – were printed in the 1450’s .
Interestingly , the Chinese did not start using metal type until the 1490’s .

This is the devastation left behind after 26 long years of civil war .
Thousands died in Sri Lanka during the government 's clash with the ethnic Tamil people , fighting for their own homeland .
Now the war zone is a wasteland , its earth scorched and pocked by craters .
Cars and trucks lie overturned near bunkers beside clusters of battered tents .
Wasteland :

Civilians ' belongings are scattered about the ground after the attacks
The government has denied firing heavy weapons into what had been a battlefield densely populated with civilians .
But the helicopter tour the military gave U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and a group of journalists Saturday revealed widespread devastation .
Civilians who escaped the zone said they came under intense shelling from both the rebels and the government .
' We ran for our lives from the shelling in the north , ' said one man who gave his name as Krishnathurai .
' It was coming from both sides , the Tamil Tigers and the military , and we were stuck in the middle . '

The sandy coastal strip where the final battles of the quarter - century civil war were fought was dotted with patches of charred earth and deep recessions .
Dark craters were visible amid the greyish earth along the coast .
One area was thick with endless rows of tents , many of them knocked down and damaged .
Abandoned vehicles were overturned , some reduced to burnt skeletons .
Some huts with thatch roofs were destroyed , others had no roofs .
In one area near the tents , bunkers appeared to have been constructed of sandbags and barrels .
Along a nearby beach lay a large boat with the rebels ' roaring tiger emblem .

After touring the area , Ban said the trapped civilians must have undergone ' most inhumane suffering ' .
The government declared victory over the rebels Monday in the civil war that began in 1983 .
In the final weeks , with the rebels boxed into a tiny coastal strip and tens of thousands of civilians trapped inside the battlefield , the government said it would no longer fire heavy weapons .
But government doctors in the area - as well as human rights groups and foreign leaders - said intense shelling continued , killing hundreds of civilians .
The U.N. Human Rights Council has planned a special session on Sri Lanka on Monday in Geneva amid international calls for a war crimes investigation into the military 's conduct .
Military and local people watch as a UN helicopter lands at the camp
According to private U.N. documents , at least 7,000 civilians were killed in the final months of fighting .
The military said again Saturday it had not shelled the area , and blamed the craters on rebel fighters .
' We heard many explosions even in the last days as they exploded their ammunition dumps , ' military spokesman Brig .
Udaya Nanayakkara said .
But many of the trapped civilians , now living behind barbed wire in displacement camps , spoke of unrelenting shelling .
' We walked for three days to get here .
We were shelled and bombed .
There was no food .
Both sides were shelling us , ' said an elderly woman who gave her name as Lechchami .
Another woman , Krishnaleela , 42 , said her family came under shelling from the military and one of her children was killed .
At the Manik Farm displacement camp , some civilians said there was little food or water .
They complained they were not allowed to leave and that their male relatives had been detained by the military , presumably under suspicion they were rebel fighters .

' I do n't know where my husband is , ' Krishnaleela said .
Ban appealed to the government to quickly improve conditions for the nearly 300,000 ethnic Tamil civilians displaced by the fighting .
He also called for aid groups to get unfettered access to the camps and welcomed President Mahinda Rajapaksa 's promise to resettle the bulk of the displaced by the end of the year .
' We will try to work hard to make sure that promise is realised , ' he said as he toured the vast expanse of white tents neatly lined up in rows on dirt paths .
Roads between the tents were crammed with people , and barbed wire fences encircled the area , keeping the tens of thousands of civilians from getting out .
Soldiers were stationed across the camp .
Mark Cutts , a senior U.N. humanitarian officer , said Manik Farm was erected almost overnight and is the world 's largest displacement camp .
' There 's 200,000 people here .
This is a very overcrowded place , a very big place , and there 's a lot of work still to be done .
Conditions , you can see , they 're very basic , ' he said .
After his tour of the battlefield , Ban flew to the central city of Kandy .
There he met with Rajapaksa after the nation 's top Buddhist monks presented the president with the country 's highest honor at a temple reputed to house the Buddha 's tooth .
Ban and other world leaders have called on Rajapaksa to quickly address the grievances of the country 's minorities in the wake of the war .
( CNN ) -- Nearly one - fifth of American 4 - year - olds are obese , and children of color are at higher risk , according to new research .
Obese children are at risk for early onset of diabetes , fatty liver and musculoskeletal problems .
Researchers calculated the body mass index from a sample of 8,550 Hispanic , black , white , Asian and Native American 4 - year - olds .
The children were born in 2001 , and in 2005 , their height and weight were measured -- 18.4 percent of them were obese .
" Significant differences in the prevalence of obesity between racial / ethnic groups were evident at 4 years of age , " the researchers wrote in the April issue of the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine .
Using body mass index , they found that 31.2 percent of American Indian / Native Alaskans , 22 percent of Hispanics , 20.8 percent of blacks , 15.9 percent of whites and 12.8 percent of Asians were obese .
" It 's surprising that there are large differences by racial / ethnic group by that age , " said Sarah Anderson , an assistant professor of epidemiology at The Ohio State University and lead study author .
Anderson and co-author Robert Whitaker 's analysis showed that children were becoming obese even before encountering soda and candy vending machines in schools .
" These results really do point to the need for us to focus attention on early childhood and the need for research to understand how these differences can emerge so early , " Anderson said .
" To do that , we may need to understand the different family and cultural factors that are at play in these children 's lives . "
The cause for the early health disparities is hard to pinpoint , childhood obesity experts said .
" It 's always possible there are biological factors within ethnic groups , " said Dr. Tom Robinson , director of the Center for Healthy Weight at the Stanford University School of Medicine .
" We know most of the changes that have occurred in body fat tend to occur from being in an environment that promotes very easy access to high - caloric foods and limited opportunities for physical activities . "
Michael Rich , an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School , called the disparities between ethnic groups disturbing .
" The expectations , lifestyle , behaviors are different on a cultural and socioeconomic basis , " he said .
" Kids who live in the inner city , whose neighborhoods are perceived as dangerous , stay at home more , sit more , eat more snacks , because that 's all they can get at the local bodega .
There are no supermarkets to get produce .
That 's what mom is eating , so that 's what kid is eating .
What we 're dealing with here is whole life issues . "
Previous research has shown that older children are becoming less active and spending more time in front of a computer or TV .
" That is displacing physical activity , " said Dr. Sarah Barlow , director of the Obesity Center at Texas Children 's Hospital in Houston .
" You can imagine strollers , less outdoor play -- all those kinds of things that have shifted how much activity younger kids are getting .
At the same time , portion sizes are increasing for everybody . "
According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , adults fare no better .
Approximately 45 percent of blacks , 36.8 percent of Mexican Americans and 30 percent of whites are obese .
" It 's a very bad sign if we see obesity at a young age , " Robinson said .
" When we see children obese at age 4 , we 're likely to see complications -- high blood pressure , abnormal lipids -- which can lead to heart disease and stroke , diabetes in children . "
Diseases commonly seen in 40 - or 50 - year - olds are presenting in 6 - and 7 - year - olds .
Obese children are developing type 2 diabetes , fatty liver disease and musculoskeletal problems , which occur because their bodies can't carry that much weight , doctors said .
Calculate your child 's body mass index .
" The heavier you are as a child , the likelier that extra weight will follow you through life , " Robinson said .
" That 's why we see adolescents who need weight - loss surgery , because they have life - threatening complications from obesity . "
If you have an obese child ...
The first step is for the parents to acknowledge that the child is overweight , instead of making excuses or comparing him or her to heavier children .
Many of the parents of obese children are overweight themselves , which makes that acknowledgment difficult , said Rich , who is also director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Children 's Hospital in Boston .
" While it 's important to focus on it and take it seriously , it 's also important not to give up or feel hopeless , " he said .
" Then you wo n't try .
You want to look at it for what it is and not be defeated by it . "
When you 're trying to help your child achieve a healthy weight , remove the stigma attached to obesity .
" It should always be about health , not about losing weight , " Rich said .
" You 're trying to build the positive . "
He recommended the 5 - 2 - 1 - 0 plan .
Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables , cut screen time down to two hours or less , exercise at least one hour , and have zero soda and sugary drinks .
Such changes , which are not seismic shifts to lifestyles , can help the child get into a health weight .
" It 's easier to start that way , rather than try to change habits when they 're 8 or 12 or 16 , " said Barlow , an associate professor of pediatrics at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas .
While it 's possible for some kids to outgrow the excess weight , she warned parents not to count on that .
" We 've seen over time that the environment does n't promote that , " she said .
All About Obesity • Child Nutrition
If anti-piracy lobbyists are to be believed , all content creators hate The Pirate Bay and other torrent sites .
The truth is obviously more balanced .
In fact , some of the most creative minds are BitTorrent users themselves , including best selling author Paulo Coelho , who offered to travel to Sweden to testify in favor of The Pirate Bay .
Novelist Paulo Coelho has sold millions of books , including the all time bestseller “ The Alchemist ” that sold more than 65 million copies worldwide .
It is less known that he is also an avid BitTorrent user and that he admitted to pirating his own books .
Coelho believes that file - sharing is a good thing that can be used as a means of promotion for writers like himself .
To put his money where his mouth is , he volunteered to support The Pirate Bay when they were up for trial .
So , where the prosecution had to beg for support from artists , The Pirate Bay is backed by one of the greatest novelists .
“ I am openly supporting their site .
I even volunteered to travel to Sweden to discuss the case of open contents , but I never got a reply from them , ” Coelho told Torrent Freak .
It is a shame that his email went unnoticed , because it could ’ve been of great help .
Coelho believes that sharing is in people ’s nature , and that it ’s not something that has to be stopped by law .
“ Since the dawn of time , human beings have felt the need to share – from food to art .
Sharing is part of the human condition .
A person who does not share is not only selfish , but bitter and alone , ” Coelho told Torrent Freak in an earlier interview , explaining why he decided to share his books on sites such as The Pirate Bay .
Publishing his books on The Pirate Bay worked out really well for Coelho .
He actually sold tens of thousands of extra books because he shared them on BitTorrent .
“ I do think that when a reader has the possibility to read some chapters , he or she can always decide to buy the book later , ” Coelho said , and he is not alone in that assessment .
Arguments against STV ( and why they ’re wrong )
Argument # 1 used against STV :
It ’s “ too complicated ”
Some sources using this argument :
Mayor criticizes STV – says it ’s ‘ complicated ‘
STV system would be complicated and expensive
STV con :
It just does n’t fit in BC
STV concept too complicated to vote for
Why the argument fails :
British Columbians should actually be offended at this argument and should be e-mailing the head of the “ No STV ” campaign to voice their offence .
This argument has as its major premise that STV is too complicated for the public to understand and , by extension , function properly .
This argument suggests that British Columbians are dumber than the Irish , the Maltese , Australians and British voters in European Union elections since all of these countries have proven smart enough to use STV successfully and effectively in their elections .
The only thing more boggling than the complete untenability of this argument is that somebody in the “ NO STV ” campaign actually thought it would be a good idea to insult the intelligence of British Columbians in such an obvious fashion .
Moreover , if we accept the argument that an electoral system has to be simple for it to work , then the electoral system in the United States would never have lasted as long as it has .
A brief backgrounder :
Americans vote in primary elections for a nominee for each party ’s candidate for all major offices .
In some states , open primaries are used and in other states , closed primaries are used .
Also , in some other states a caucus is used instead of a primary and in Texas both caucuses and a primary are used .
Also , two other exceptions to this rule are that the state of Nebraska has no formal political parties in the state legislature and the state of Louisiana has no separate primary elections , but instead has multiple members of each party run simultaneously during the general election and then uses run-off elections to determine the ultimate winner .
Also , some states use run-off elections on an individual basis if the candidate does not secure at least 50 % of the vote , while other states ( such as Minnesota ) do not .
For presidential elections , Americans do n’t directly vote for their president .
Instead the president is chosen by an “ electoral college ” of voters who are technically free to vote as they see fit , but in practise more or less vote along party lines .
U.S. states are awarded electoral college seats based on the number of representatives plus number of Senators each state is awarded in the Congress ( except for DC which has no senators and no full congressmen but is still awarded 3 electoral college seats ) .
The exception afforded to DC for the electoral college , however , does not apply to other non-state U.S. territories such as the U.S. Virgin Islands or Guam ( although they do vote in primary elections ) .
However , some U.S. states award their electoral college seats in lump - sum to the winner of the State and others award U.S. electoral college seats based on the district - by - district performance of each candidate .
Simple , eh ?
Using the logic of the “ No STV ” crowd , the American electoral system should have collapsed by 1798 under the weight of its own complexity .
But instead , the U.S. system has proven remarkably stable with only relatively minor adjustments made over the years ( such as the election of senators and changing the fashion with which the Vice - President was elected ) .
The last reason why the “ too complicated ” argument of the “ No STV ” side fails is that STV actually is n’t complicated at all .
On the contrary , it ’s actually relatively simple .
As this video demonstrates , it can be explained in layman ’s terms in about 90 seconds .
It Only Takes One Person To Get The Party Started
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Susan
Todd loves her daily coffee fix .
" I can drink four or five cups , easily , comfortably , " said Todd , 59 , of Clinton Township , Michigan .
Skeet Spillane ( right ) got severe headaches when he quit caffeine .
His wife said he was cranky most of the time .
But if she skips her regular dose of caffeine , Todd warned , watch out .
" I feel lousy all over .
It 's not that anything hurts , " she explained .
" I just feel sluggish , and a cup of caffeine will cure that . "
Todd is among the estimated 80 to 90 percent of North American adults and children who consume caffeine products every day .
Experts estimate about half that number will experience headaches and other symptoms from caffeine withdrawal syndrome .
There are a number of reasons why someone might need to reduce or stop their daily caffeine intake .
Experts tell pregnant women not to consume more than 200 milligrams of caffeine a day ( about one 12 - ounce cup of coffee ) .
Caffeinated products are not recommended for people who are prone to panic attacks or those who suffer from anxiety .
Some surgical patients may also experience the symptoms of caffeine withdrawal syndrome on the day of surgery , because they are told not to eat or drink anything .
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , recognized the condition as a disorder five years ago after reviewing decades of studies .
They concluded the higher the caffeine intake , the more likely a patient was to suffer from severe withdrawal symptoms when denied the ingredient .

Researchers also reported that some caffeine users considered themselves addicted to caffeine because they were unable to quit or cut down on their usage .

Michael Kuhar , chief of the division of neuroscience at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , prefers to use the word " dependent " rather than " addicted . "
Even though he called caffeine a drug , Kuhar would n't go so far as saying it has reached the status of cocaine or heroin .
According to Kuhar , caffeine is a mild stimulant .
" If you take a cup of caffeine you 're likely to feel good and energized , " he said .
Miss that cup of " Joe " or can of cola and do n't be surprised if you start feeling funny , Kuhar warned .
He said some people complain of " headache , fatigue , sleepiness , inability to focus and concentrate . "
Others report experiencing flu- like symptoms , irritability , depression and anxiety after skipping as little as one cup of coffee a day .
Kuhar explained that caffeine blocks receptors in the brain that can dilate blood vessels causing headaches .
" Withdrawal symptoms can start from 12 to 20 hours after your last cup of coffee and peak about two days later and can last about as long as a week , " Kuhar added .
It is not just coffee that can lead to caffeine withdrawal .
While a 6 - ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 100 milligrams of caffeine , tea and cola have about 40 milligrams each , a bar of milk chocolate has about 10 milligrams and hot chocolate has about 7 milligrams .

Kuhar said that means adults as well as children may be suffering daily physiological and personality effects of caffeine withdrawal .
He recommended that people who are motivated to give up caffeine , or cut back on consumption , do so very carefully .
" The thing to do is what we do with so many drugs -- basically you wean yourself off slowly , " Kuhar suggested .
" That does n't mean it is going to be easy at every step , but it should be easier than going cold turkey . "
Johns Hopkins researchers also endorsed a stepped approach to quitting caffeine .
They instruct patients to gradually substitute decaffeinated products or noncaffeinated products over time in order to reduce the likelihood of experiencing withdrawal symptoms .
Kuhar suggested the process also can begin with reducing caffeine consumption by a half to a whole cup a day .
Technology consultant Skeet Spillane , 42 , of St. Petersburg , Florida , started a step - down program after years of consuming up to three cups of coffee each day .
He felt he was " drinking way too much caffeine . "
Spillane said he knew right away that he was suffering from caffeine withdrawal when he started getting severe headaches .
His wife told him he was cranky most of the time .
He now drinks tea instead , and occasionally sneaks a cup of coffee .
Looking back , Spillane admitted going through withdrawal was " tough for a while , " but he 's feeling better these days and he 's glad he 's not so dependent on caffeine .

The world 's smallest and rarest pigs are " thriving " following their release into the wild last year , conservationists report .
Camera - trap footage and surveys suggest that the captive - bred pygmy hogs have adapted well to their new home in the grasslands of Assam in India .
The team now plans to reintroduce more of the little pigs to this habitat .
Pygmy hogs stand just 25 cm - tall ( 10in ) and weigh only 6 - 9 kg ( 13 - 20lb ) .
Few are thought to exist in the wild .
An ' enigmatic ' pig Professor John Fa , director of conservation science at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , one of the partners in the Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme ( PHCP ) , described the pigs as " enigmatic " .
He told BBC News : " It is a shy creature and it's about the size of a small dog .
Only one population of the pigs is thought to survive in the wild " It is very well adapted to living in grasslands - it is bullet shaped and has a sloping back , which is a feature of animals that live in very thick vegetation . "
Scientists think the pigs ' range could once have spanned the southern edge of the Himalayas in the Indian sub - continent .
But now just one population is thought to exist in the wild , and these pigs are situated in Manas National Park , in the state of Assam .
However , their habitat is under threat .
William Oliver , chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission 's Pigs , Peccaries and Hippos Specialist Group , said : " The practice of indiscriminate dry - season annual burning and uncontrolled livestock grazing threatens the last surviving wild population of pygmy hogs in Manas and , if continued , will doubtless also affect many other threatened and sensitive grassland species . "
Pig-cam
In 1996 , conservationists began a captive - breeding programme in a bid to boost the pigs ' numbers , and in May 2008 , 16 of these pygmy hogs ( seven males and nine females ) were released into the Sonai Rupai wildlife sanctuary .
Pygmy hogs were released into the wild last year Professor Fa said : " Since the release , we have been doing very extensive surveys every month to find out how they are using their habitat .
The good thing about these pigs , like all pigs , is that they build nests and you can see where they have spent the night .
" And getting the camera - trap footage was the icing on the cake . "
The surveys and films suggest that up to two - thirds of the released pigs are thriving , and one of the female pigs may have given birth .
Now the PHCP plans to release another 14 captive - bred hogs into the same area .
They are currently being held in a " pre-release " facility .
Dr Goutam Narayan , from Durrell , who heads the PHCP in India , explained : " Here , we do n't have much contact with them , they are out on their own and we feed them very little so they have to forage - we are preparing them for the wild . "
Some of the released pigs may have had piglets
As well as bolstering the population , the conservationists say that the released animals are helping them to better understand the wild pigs , which are extremely hard to study .
Professor Fa said : " I call it ' reverse pig-ology ' .
From these [ released ] pigs , we can learn how they choose certain types of grassland , how they behave in certain areas etc .
And this information can then be applied to the wild pigs . "
PHCP is a collaborative project of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , the IUCN Species Survival Commission 's Pigs , Peccaries and Hippos Specialist Group ( IUCN - SSC PPHSG ) , the forest department of the Government of Assam and the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India .

Law enforcement officials justify the frequent use of heavily - armed SWAT teams and no-knock warrants -- police do about 50,000 SWAT raids per year -- as protecting officer safety .
The dramatic deaths of two officers , Chesapeake , Virginia 's Jarrod Shivers and the FBI 's Samuel Hicks , both caused by the choice to use SWAT tactics , suggests the opposite interpretation .
So does the small number of officer fatalities relative to the large number of drug arrests across the country each year -- with 1.8 million drug arrests in the US during 2008 , a total of seven police officers were killed while doing drug enforcement , according to statistics on police line of duty deaths compiled by the Officer Down Memorial Page .
Three of the seven were killed doing drug raids .
An eighth officer was killed following a traffic chase , not initiated as part of drug enforcement , of a suspect ( a former police officer ) who was on bail facing a drug possession charge .
[ Ed : We originally included a ninth officer in this list , Timothy Scott Abernethy , as a second example of a case in which the drug war appeared to have played a role , despite it not having started as a drug investigation .
A colleague of Officer Abernethy criticized our inclusion of his case as having too tenuous of a relation to the drug war if any , and after reviewing it we concluded that our decision to include Officer Abernethy in the listing was erroneous , and we have edited this article accordingly .

drug raids -- not as dangerous as they make them
" In the last 10 or 11 years , traffic accidents killed more officers than anything else , " said Kevin Morison of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund , which also compiles a list of line of duty deaths .
" When it comes to being killed enforcing the laws , traffic stops and domestic violence seem to be the top two .
Serving warrants can also be dangerous , " he said .
According to the foundation , 140 officers died in the line of duty last year , 71 of them in traffic accidents .
Only 41 officers died of gunshot wounds , the lowest figure since 1956 .
One police officer was stabbed , one beaten to death , one drowned , one was electrocuted , one died in a train accident , two were blown up by a bomb , three died in aircraft crashes , and 17 died of job - related illnesses .
Seventeen officers were struck and killed by other vehicles , typically while directing traffic .
According to historical data provided to the Chronicle by the foundation , last year 's low death toll among officers enforcing the drug laws is not a fluke .
In the decade between 1978 and 1988 , an average of 6.5 officers were killed each year ; in the following decade , the number was 6.2 ; and in the last 10 years , an average of 4.3 officers were killed each year enforcing the drug laws .
The single bloodiest year for drug law enforcement was 1988 , when 12 officers died .
There are slight differences between figures provided by the foundation and those provided by Officer Down , most likely related to the way each death is coded .
The numbers below are based on Officer Down 's count , as well as additional investigation done by the Chronicle .
Here is the list of those who gave their lives maintaining drug prohibition :
Chesapeake , Virginia , Police Detective Jarrod Brent Shivers was shot and killed while battering down the door of Ryan Frederick on January 17 , 2008 .
Although Frederick was supposedly running a marijuana grow , no grow was found .
Frederick was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years in prison .
Senior Border Patrol Agent Luis Alberto Aguilar was run over and killed by Mexican drug smugglers near San Diego on January 19 , 2008 .
Harris County , Texas , Constable 's Office Corporal Harry Theilepape died January 26 , 2008 of gunshot wounds suffered nearly a month earlier when he arrested a suspect for possessing drugs and illegally possessing a handgun .
Grundy County , Tennessee , Sheriff 's Deputy Sheriff Anthony Shane was shot and killed June 5 , 2008 , serving a probation violation arrest warrant for a man on a drug charge .
The shooter shot himself as more police closed in , saying , " God just let me die .
I do n't want to live in this hell anymore . "
Virginia Beach , Virginia , Police Detective Michael Smith Phillips was shot and killed while conducting an undercover drug buy on August 7 , 2008 .
Chicago Police Officer Nathaniel Taylor Jr. was shot and killed while executing a search warrant as part of the gangs and drug squad on September 28 , 2008 .
The shooter had a history of violent and drug offenses .
FBI Special Agent Samuel Steele Hicks was shot and killed by a suspect 's wife during a no- knock search of a Pennsylvania home on November 19 , 2008 .
The shooter , who claimed she fired in fear for her life , now faces murder charges .
Another officer , Texas Highway Patrol Trooper James Scott Burns , was shot and killed following a traffic stop and brief car chase on April 29 , 2008 .
The killer was a former police officer turned drug offender and manufacturer , who was out on bail facing a drug possession charge at the time and who eventually committed suicide .
Whether Burns belongs on this list is open to interpretation -- he was not doing drug enforcement , so far as we know , when initiating this traffic stop , but appearances suggest that past drug charges and fear of more may have played a role .
These officers died in a year where there were more than 1.8 million drug arrests , as noted above , meaning police can expect to do 200,000 drug busts for each officer killed .
In addition to the three who were killed on drug raids , two died after stopping drivers who had been arrested and imprisoned before on drug charges and were apparently not ready to return to prison , one was killed doing undercover work , one was killed in an encounter with smugglers , one was killed arresting a drug suspect , and one was killed attempting to bring in a probation - violating drug offender .
SWAT raids seem no less hazardous for the occupants of the homes being hit than they are for the police conducting them .
( The following information is taken from the police militarization archives at Radley Balko 's The Agitator blog .
Readers with the stomach for it can find much , much more there as well . )
On January 6 , 2008 , police in Lima , Ohio , shot and killed a 26 - year - old mother of six , Tarika Wilson , during a raid aimed at her boyfriend .
The police shooter was eventually found not guilty for killing her .
The following day in North Little Rock , Arkansas , a police SWAT team raided the home of Tracy Ingle .
Awakened by a ram battering his door and thinking he was under attack by armed robbers , Ingle grabbed a broken pistol to scare them off .
Officers fired multiple shots , wounding him five times .
He spent a more than a week in intensive care before police removed him , took him to the police station , and questioned him for five hours .
He was charged with running a drug enterprise even though no drugs were found .
In May , Connecticut police raiding an apartment after being informed that people were smoking crack there , shot and killed Gonzalo Guizan , who was unarmed .
Police said he charged at them .
All they found was a crack pipe .
It 's not just people .
Dogs also seem to be a favorite target of drug - raiding police .
In what is only one case out of the dozens that seem to occur every year , Cheye Calvo , the mayor of the Washington , DC , suburb of Berwyn Heights , Maryland , saw his two dogs shot and killed by a Prince George 's County SWAT team that burst into his home after his mother - in - law accepted delivery of a package containing marijuana .
Calvo and his family were twice victimized , once by the pot traders who used his address to have their dope sent to , and again by the gung - ho , itchy trigger finger police .
It is unclear how many people were killed by police enforcing the drug laws in general or conducting drug raids in particular .
Although in 1999 Congress authorized legislation requiring law enforcement agencies to submit such data , it neglected to fund the program .
The incidents mentioned above are only some of the most egregious and well - publicized , but they suggest that even if doing drug raids is n't particularly dangerous for police , it is for their victims .
" Tactically , those SWAT units are quite impressive , but they 're vastly overused , " said Peter Moskos , an assistant professor of Law , Police Science , and Criminal Justice Administration at the City University of New York 's John Jay College of Criminal Justice , former Baltimore police officer , and author of " Cop in the Hood . "
" The problem is once you 've got those units , you 're going to use them .
Their goal is to have overwhelming force and have all the cops live , but innocent people die , " he said .
Law enforcement can have it both ways , said Balko , author of Overkill : the Rise of Paramilitary Policing in America .
" If not many police are being killed in drug raids , they can say these tactics are working , " he said .
" If more are being killed , they can say this is why they need to be more aggressive . "
Drug squad cops are a special breed , said Moskos .
" Many cops never would want to work in one of those units , " he said .
" Even though the raids are pretty safe , they do more dangerous things like undercover operations .
These guys tend to be whiter , more conservative , and guys who like breaking down six doors a day .
In the drug squads in particular , they really tear it up .
There is a certain vindictiveness ; they think ' these people are assholes , they deserve it . ' "
" Nobody has to be killed at all if they would just legalize the stuff , " said David Doddridge , a 21 - year veteran of the LAPD who rose to the rank of narcotics detective before he retired in 1994 .
" When I first started , we used to go to roll call , and they would tell us who has warrants , and we would drive out there and knock on the door .
Then we went to a narcotics bureau , and we worked in teams , with battering rams , " he recalled .
" More citizens died than police , " Doddridge said .
" I spent several years down in South Central kicking in doors and raiding homes , and probably served 50 search warrants , " said Doddridge .
" We were n't SWAT , just a couple of narcotics detectives with our vests on , and none of us got seriously injured .
There was seldom any resistance . "
Narcotics could be dangerous , Doddridge said , but not because of the raids .
" The raids themselves are not very dangerous , more a danger to civilians , " he said .
" Doing plain clothes by yourself and buying drugs when nobody knows you 're a cop is when it gets dangerous .
We had a couple of our officers get beaten up buying drugs undercover on the street . "
Things began to change with the introduction of the federal Byrne grant program to state and local law enforcement in the late 1980s , said Doddridge .
" Then , with Byrne , we got Velcro vests and holsters , we got Kevlar helmets , all that stuff .
Now , there are thousands of SWAT teams across the country .
They do n't have a lot to do , so they end serving drug warrants now . "
It 's a fool 's errand , said Doddridge , who has , since his retirement , joined Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .
" After a year or so of doing those drug busts , I thought it was crazy .
We were n't doing any good .
And I thought about the looks of the faces on those families , the children crying when we 're dragging their Dad or their brother out .
I thought to myself what are we doing ?
-- these were n't real criminals out robbing and attacking people .
I started feeling really bad about all that . "
Short of legalizing drug use and the drug trade , which would be his preferred option , Moskos said , there are a couple of things that could be done .
" One thing we could do is just turn back the clock , " he said .
" It was n't until the 1970s that we got all obsessed about drugs .
I think we should just treat it like other minor crimes , like back in the 1950s .
One problem is the productivity of drug squads is measured by how many doors they knock down .
They need to knock down fewer doors . "
Eliminating outdoor drug markets would help , too , Moskos said .
" If you 're worried about the violence there , you have to push it indoors , off the street .
Fear of arrest and raids on their homes push dealers into the street , but maybe we could call a truce .
Close your blinds , keep the music down , act like a good neighbor , then we could leave you alone . "
People have a deep desire to communicate with animals , as is evident from the way they converse with their dogs , enjoy myths about talking animals or devote lifetimes to teaching chimpanzees how to speak .
A delicate , if tiny , step has now been taken toward the real thing : the creation of a mouse with a human gene for language .
The gene , FOXP2 , was identified in 1998 as the cause of a subtle speech defect in a large London family , half of whose members have difficulties with articulation and grammar .
All those affected inherited a disrupted version of the gene from one parent .
FOXP2 quickly attracted the attention of evolutionary biologists because other animals also possess the gene , and the human version differs significantly in its DNA sequence from those of mice and chimpanzees , just as might be expected for a gene sculpted by natural selection to play an important role in language .
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , have now genetically engineered a strain of mice whose FOXP2 gene has been swapped out for the human version .
Svante Paabo , in whose laboratory the mouse was engineered , promised several years ago that when the project was completed , “ We will speak to the mouse . ”
He did not promise that the mouse would say anything in reply , doubtless because a great many genes must have undergone evolutionary change to endow people with the faculty of language , and the new mouse was gaining only one of them .
So it is perhaps surprising that possession of the human version of FOXP2 does in fact change the sounds that mice use to communicate with other mice , as well as other aspects of brain function .
That is the result reported in the current issue of the journal Cell by Wolfgang Enard , also of the Leipzig institute , and a large team of German researchers who studied 300 features of the humanized mice .
FOXP2 , a gene whose protein product switches on other genes , is important during the embryo’s development and plays an active part in constructing many tissues , including the lungs , stomach and brain .
The gene is so vital that mice in which both copies of the gene are disrupted die after a few weeks .
Researchers have begun a major clinical trial in Africa of what could become the world 's first vaccine against malaria , a disease that kills nearly a million people every year .
The vaccine 's developers -- drug giant GlaxoSmithKline PLC and the Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative , or MVI , a charitable group funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- began a study in 16,000 African children this week , the largest - ever trial of the potential inoculation .

With the recession on and concern about unemployment mounting , many people are starting to consider starting a home business to promote flexibility and perhaps help their finances survive .
And , really , there are a number of benefits that come with working from home .
Many home business ideas can be started for practically nothing , and there are other business ideas that can be started for a little more .
Here are 10 home business ideas :
1. Fitness - related business .
You can be a personal trainer or a yoga instructor .
If you have a room at home that you can use as a sort of private gym , you can use that and help clients in your home .
Or , you can check the local gym or community education center to see if you can teach there .
Many gyms have personal trainers and class instructors that come in on a contract basis .
You set your own hours and earn money from the fees .
You will need to get certified , however , in order to be taken seriously .
2. Personal finance planner .
Many people are looking for financial advice in this recession .
If you get your CFP designation ( which can be costly and difficult ) you can provide financial planning services — and even do it out of your home .
Additionally , I know three CPAs who offer accounting and payroll services from their homes , and a number of tax preparation service providers who work out of a home office .
3. Medical and legal transcription .
Many insurance companies , medical offices and legal practices have need of transcription services .
This is something you can do out of your home if you are properly certified and qualified .
Medical claims billing can fall into this category as well .
4 . Web design .
Talented with graphics ?
Know your way around code ?
You can provide Web design services out of your home .
Buy a server and you can even provide Web hosting as part of your home business .
Other types of graphic design — layout , logo , advertising and more — can also be done from your home office .
5. Photography .
I have two friends that do photography as a home business .
They are hired for weddings , proms , portraits and more .
One of them just goes on site .
The other has turned a spare room into a photo studio with backgrounds , lighting and all the trappings you would expect .
The ability to take digital pictures and have them developed online — in high quality — makes this even more feasible .
6 . Home maintenance and improvement .
If you are handy around the house and yard , you can start a business providing yard care and making home improvements .
Remodeling jobs , sprinkler installation , landscaping and roofing are all related areas .
If you are certified ( and get the insurance ) you can start a home business taking care of other people ’s homes .
7. Event planner .
Weddings , parties , family gatherings and special occasions all require planning .
If you know where to go to get a good deal , and if you are organized and can make things happen , consider running an event planning business out of your home .
8. Child care services .
You can make money taking care of others ’ children in your home .
Check state regulations , though , to make sure you are properly licensed .
Awww , is n't Europe quaint ?
Those gas guzzling Google Street view cars in America have become tricycles on the twisted , cobbled streets of Europe .

In an article published yesterday by the Wall Street Journal , Did the Fed Cause the Housing Bubble ? , David Henderson continues the practice of pulling the wool over the eyes of the public .
He claims that M1 and M2 fell in the early part of the decade , showing ( he says ) that the Fed did not dump new money into the money supply .
His claim is highly deceptive , particularly since he also claims that China and other foreign investors saved dollars as further evidence for his argument .
The reason this is deceptive is that M1 and M2 do not measure most foreign dollar holdings !!!
M3 ( discontinued by the Fed in 2006 ) measures the true money supply much more accurately .
Only M3 includes time deposits , institutional and individual money - market funds , and short - term repurchase agreements .
In other words , unless the money actually gets spent at a cash register or sits in a checking account , Henderson does n't count it !
What rubbish !
Henderson also protests , “ Moreover , if the Fed was the culprit , why was the housing bubble world - wide ?
Do Mr. Greenspan 's critics seriously contend that the Fed was responsible for high housing prices in , say , Spain ? ”
Yes , of course the Fed bears responsibility in Spain !
The Fed controls the dollar , and the dollar serves as the official reserve currency for the entire world - wide currency supply ever since Bretton Woods .
What the dollar does ( and what the Fed does ) directly influences what the other fiat money central banks do , including the Bank of Spain .
His claim that the Fed has no influence over real estate in Spain borders on the absurd and intends to deceive the uninformed , not to enlighten them .
Bear in mind that China recently called for ending the dollar as the reserve currency in the world fiat money system during the upcoming G20 meetings , which President Obama as reported in a Wall Street Journal article strongly protested .
Did China call for such a change just to be mean - spirited ?
No , they did it because they 're terrified that the huge amount of dollar - based savings they already have will lose value dramatically as the Fed continues to expand the money supply , savings which serves as the reserve for their own currency , the yuan , savings which …wait for it !… do n't get counted by the author 's ( and the Fed 's ) biased way of measuring the money supply !!!
Henderson is full of it .
Moreover , I 'd be willing to bet that he knows it .
I believe he intentionally tries to continue the snow job that the Fed , the government , and their supporters have dumped on us for decades .
Like so many before him , he deliberately uses smoke and mirrors to deceive the public .
A trio of words -- one that 's slang for pizza , another defined as a body 's vital life force and a third referring to a snoring sound -- have conspired to change the game of Scrabble .

Four men from Newburgh , N.Y. , were arrested on Wednesday night , charged with trying to carry out what they believed was a bomb attack on two synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and the simultaneous shooting down of military aircraft in Newburgh .
James Cromitie
Officials identified the leader as James Cromitie , a career criminal born in Brooklyn on Dec. 24 , 1964 .
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said he had a record of 27 arrests , at least a dozen for drug offenses , beginning in 1987 .
He spent a total of 12 years in state prison , the most recent stint for a 1998 conviction for selling cocaine to an undercover officer behind a school in the Bronx .
He was paroled in 2004 and moved to Newburgh from the Bronx in March 2005 .
His mother , Adele Cromitie , 65 , said she had last seen her son three years ago , when he came to her apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx , where she has lived for 26 years .
It was the first time she had seen him in years .
He took her up to Newburgh and introduced her to the woman he was living with and said that he had become a Muslim .
He was raised an Episcopalian , she said .
In his first jail stint he listed his religion as Baptist ; in the second and third ones , as Muslim .
The global warming situation has become so dire that Barack Obama 's chief scientific adviser has raised with the president the possibility of massive - scale technological fixes to alter the climate known as ' geo - engineering ' .
John Holdren , who is a member of the president 's cabinet , said today the drastic measures should not be " off the table " in discussions on how best to tackle climate change .
While his office insisted that he was not proposing a dramatic switch in policy , Holdren said geo- engineering could not be ruled out .
" It 's got to be looked at .
We do n't have the luxury of taking any approach off the table , " Holdren said in an interview with Associated Press .
He made clear these were his personal views .
The suite of mega - technological fixes includes everything from placing mirrors in space that reflect sunlight from the Earth , to fertilising the oceans with iron to encourage the growth of algae that can soak up atmospheric carbon dioxide .
Another option is to seed clouds which bounce the sun 's rays back into space so they do not warm the Earth 's surface .
Such global - scale technological solutions to climate change may seem fantastical , but increasing numbers of scientists argue that the technologies should at least be investigated .
Holdren 's comments do not mean that the US government is raising the priority of geo-engineering .
A spokesman for the US Government 's Office of Science and Technology Policy ( OSTP ) - which Holdren directs - said " the administration 's primary focus is still to seek comprehensive energy legislation that can get us closer to a clean energy economy , and can create green jobs while reducing dependence on foreign oil . "
Advocates of the technology have welcomed the comments .
Stephen Salter , an engineer at Edinburgh University and a pioneer of techniques to seed clouds so that they reflect the Sun 's rays back into space , said : " Everyone working in geo - engineering works with some reluctance : we hope it 'll never be needed , but we fear it might be needed very very urgently .
Holden is echoing that exactly .
It 's very encouraging – we've had extremely negative reactions from the UK governments . "
Salter said that geo-engineering techniques were the only methods that would lower world temperatures quickly enough .
Even if the world stopped emitting CO2 tomorrow , he said , the world would continue to get hotter for several decades .
" Opponents say it would take the pressure off getting the renewables developed .
I 've been working on renewables since 1973 and stopped because we 're too late , we wasted too much time .
We may have a panic very soon because of the way the Arctic ice is going . "
Greenpeace chief scientist Doug Parr , however , has said : " The wider point is not the pros and cons of particular technologies , but that the scientific community is becoming so scared of our collective inability to tackle climate emissions that such outlandish schemes are being considered for serious study .
We already have the technology and know - how to make dramatic cuts in global emissions - but it's not happening , and those closest to the climate science are coming near to pressing the panic button . "
Holdren acknowledged that some of the potential geo-engineering solutions could have side effects , and that such actions should not be taken lightly .
Though cloud - seeding , for example , would cool the earth , it would also lead to more acidic oceans , since the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere - and therefore the CO2 absorbed into the seas - would keep increasing .
But Holdren added : " We might get desperate enough to want to use it . "
His comments seemed to go against those he made in a speech to the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007 .
There , he highlighted geo-engineering 's potential to help cool the atmosphere or to remove greenhouse gases , but acknowledged the methods would likely require significant investment , and also warned against expecting a single technological solution to solve energy and climate problems .
" Belief in technological miracles is generally a mistake , " he said .
Writing last year in a special edition of the Royal Society journal Philosophical Transactions that was dedicated to geo-engineering , Brian Launder of the University of Manchester and Michael Thompson of the University of Cambridge said : " While such geo - scale interventions may be risky , the time may well come when they are accepted as less risky than doing nothing .
There is increasingly the sense that governments are failing to come to grips with the urgency of setting in place measures that will assuredly lead to our planet reaching a safe equilibrium . "
In a series of papers , experts said that a reluctance " at virtually all levels " to address rising greenhouse gas emissions meant carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were on track to pass 650 parts per million , which could bring an average global temperature rise of 4C .
They called for more research on geo-engineering options to cool the earth .
Mr. Tankel ’s fears are shared by many analysts and consultants , who say that a decades - long expansion produced too many restaurants even for a good economy , let alone the worst malaise since the Great Depression .
Since 1990 , the number of restaurants and bars has grown to 537,000 from 361,000 , a 49 percent increase , according to the National Restaurant Association .
Population in the United States grew 23 percent in that period .
Amid the seeming prosperity of a credit - fueled era , people got in the habit of eating more and more of their meals out .
The association ’s statistics show that 48 cents of every food dollar is now spent at restaurants , compared with 40.5 cents per dollar in 1985 .
In a recent note to investors , John Glass , an analyst for JPMorgan , said the casual dining industry — midrange restaurants like Applebee ’s — needed to shutter about 1,200 of its roughly 18,000 locations to regain financial health .
“ The chain casual dining industry has been overbuilt since 2005 , ” Mr. Glass wrote , noting that was the last year the industry posted positive numbers for customer traffic .
“ It may take two or more years to reach equilibrium . ”
Others said the pruning of restaurants would extend beyond casual dining to all types of restaurants .
Bob Goldin , executive vice president at Technomic , a Chicago consultancy for the restaurant industry , predicted that more than 20,000 restaurants would close over the next three years .
“ I think 20,000 is a minimum , ” he said .
“ We probably need more than that .
There are a lot of marginal players out there . ”
Mr. Goldin said the rapid expansion was driven by chains that added 300 or more new stores a year , following a “ you build it and they shall come philosophy . ”
“ There is n’t a sector in the retail market that is n’t overbuilt , ” he said .
The result is that after 16 years of sales growth , inflation - adjusted sales declined 1.2 percent last year , an already tough year for restaurateurs as ingredient costs hit record highs .
Sales are expected to decrease another 1 percent in 2009 , according to the National Restaurant Association .
“ There ’s not a day that goes by that I do n’t get a heads - up about somebody closing their doors , ” said Amy Greene , who tracks the industry for Avondale Partners in Nashville .

So far , many of the companies going out of business are small enterprises with one to three locations ; they are struggling because of slower sales and limited access to credit , she said .
The NPD Group , a market research firm , reported in January that unit growth of small chains and independents declined by 1 percent in 2008 .
But larger chains have struggled too , particularly those with a more expensive menu than competitors , or onerous levels of debt .
Outback Steakhouse is one example .
Known for its fried appetizer the Bloomin ’ Onion and its ostensibly Australian décor , Outback was taken private in 2007 at the peak of the private equity buying binge , even as the casual dining sector was struggling with sluggish sales .
Outback ’s owner , OSI Restaurant Partners , now finds itself saddled with debt and declining customer counts .
“ Because of all the debt they took on , there ’s limited cash available to fix the stores , ” said Howard W. Penney , an analyst at Research Edge , in New Haven .
“ The structure for the company is disastrous right now . ”
In early March , the rating agency Moody ’s included OSI Restaurant Partners on its list of “ bottom - rung ” companies that are most likely to default on debt payments .
A company spokesman , Michael Fox , said the company had recently significantly improved its financial position by retiring $ 300 million of debt at a discounted cost of $ 85 million .
The company also is trying to lure customers with values and created a new menu with 15 meals for $ 15.99 each .
Other restaurant chains on that ignoble bottom - rung list included Krispy Kreme Doughnuts , Sbarro and Arby ’s .
Of course , there are some exceptions to the industry ’s malaise , even in the casual dining sector .
Darden Restaurants , which owns Olive Garden and Red Lobster , recently announced a better - than - expected outlook for the coming year .
In the most recent quarter , same - store sales dropped 3 percent , compared with a 6 percent decline for the rest of the casual dining industry .
“ You are not in an environment where a rising tide will raise all boats , ” said Clarence Otis , Darden ’s chief executive , noting that strong brands and mature and efficient operations were crucial .
“ We have a lot of strengths .
We are gaining share . ”
In addition , fast - food restaurants with a value menu like McDonald ’s , Taco Bell and Subway have thrived by offering full meals for less than $ 5 .
“ The guys that are succeeding are the ones that have ingrained in the customer that it is less expensive to eat there than to buy groceries and prepare it at home , ” Ms. Greene said .
Mr. Tankel , whose company owns 30 Applebee ’s franchises in and around New York , has had a first - row seat to the restaurant industry ’s woes .
In 2007 , Applebee ’s was acquired by Dine Equity , the owner of IHOP , and some analysts have worried about its ability to pay off its debt .
He is also on the board of Morton ’s Restaurant Group , which has struggled as expense accounts have dried up , and Perkins & Marie Callender ’s Inc. , which is on Moody ’s “ bottom rung ” chart .
Still , Mr. Tankel , an adventurer who has climbed Mount Everest and visited both poles , said his 30 stores were beating the odds by being up 2 percent so far this year , which he attributes to a relentless focus on service .
He plans to continue expanding during the downturn .
“ Dine Equity ’s problems are not our problem , ” he said .
“ They gave us a brand , and the brand has weight , the brand has firepower . ”
Even so , several passers - by in Times Square said Friday that they had cut back on dining out .
Scott Wood , 37 , said economic uncertainty and a 20 percent pay cut had forced him and wife to cut their restaurant visits in half .
“ We go to the same places , but just not as much , ” said Mr. Wood , who was visiting from Utah .
Renita Dickens , a 42 - year - old from Connecticut , said she too had cut back on restaurant visits , curbing a once - a - week habit to once a month , because of worries about the future .
But she made an exception to her informal rule on Friday , eating lunch at Red Lobster with a friend .
“ We ’re going to treat ourselves , ” she said .
“ But we ’ll pay for it later . ”

From an article here in Norwegian complete with a photo of a big pirate flag fluttering in the breeze .
I prefer this part of the photo below though :
Some parts of the article translated into English :
Around a thousand people gathered today in Medborgarplatsen in Stockholm to demonstrate against the Pirate Bay ruling , where Carl Lundstrøm , Fredrik Neij , Gottfris Svartholm Warg and Peter Sunde were given a year in jail .
One other banner along with the Epic Winning lol one was " Vill ni ha det som i Sovjet ? " ( do you want things like in the USSR ? )
Quote from author Unni Drougge at the demo : " I have taken part in file sharing for a long time .
I have many children that are musicians , and know that they would not have been able to live off their music if it had n't been for downloading . "
Other demonstrations : 200 gathered in Stortorget ( another part of Stockholm ) , with smaller numbers in places like Karlstad and Göteborg .
You can also see a list of blog responses to this article here ( and then use Google to automatically translate the article as Norwegian - English is usually fairly accurate ) , mostly in favour of the Pirate Bay and the Pirate Party , but not all , like this one for example :
" Tyveri er tyveri uansett hva man kaller det

Cessna 182 Loses Power , Takes Out Porta - Potties in Forced Landing
Somewhere out there is a hapless Skylane pilot who is dreading the next time that he and his fellow flyers get together to tell flying stories ... ya know , the ones that start ' there I was ' and then end with some kind of superlative aerial feat of piloting prowess that saves the day .
Ya gotta pity this guy because no matter which way you word it , crashing into a pack of porta - potties simply can't be cleaned up in any way to sound as heroic as the usual flying story .
Though one really has to wonder if he really ( as has been surmised ) uttered the words , " Aw Crap " ( or the scatological equivalent -- I mean , what would YOU say ? ) when he saw what lay before him just before impact .
To get to the point , it appears than some mode of power loss downed a Cessna 182 on takeoff from Thun Field at 1520 local time .
The Friday afternoon incident apparently occurred as the aircraft was less than 200 feet in the air near the Pierce County ( WA ) airport .
Although Sheriff 's officers are reporting that the pilot thought to turn back , the aircraft managed avoid a nearby mobile home and wound up impacting in a storage yard and colliding with a number of porta - potties stored on site .
According to witnesses quoted in media reports , '... the plane bounced off the rows of portable toilets in a storage yard at the north end of the field , flipped , then landed upside down on a pile of wood chips . '
Pierce County Sgt. Mike Blair also said , " If he had made the runway , he would have landed a lot harder than he did by impacting with those Sani-Cans and the wood pile ...
It probably saved his life , I would think . "
When all was said and done , and the dust settled , the aircraft had ultimately flipped over and wound up inverted but with the 67 year old pilot , Clifford Howell , pretty much walking away from it all .
Initial reports of another person on board the aircraft have since been denied .
NTSB investigators had been dispatched to the scene and we have to admit that we 're looking forward to their report ...

Steve Jobs quoted this BusinessWeek story in a keynote a few years ago :
Vista , the latest version of the software giant ’s Windows operating system , looks like it could turn out to be one of the great missteps in tech history .
But this is the wrong way to interpret Microsoft ’s marketshare and mindshare losses to Apple since Windows XP ’s release in 2001 .
Vista , itself , was n’t a misstep .
Microsoft must keep updating Windows regularly to remain competitive and preserve revenue .
It had problems and delays , but the concept was solid and is still defensible even in hindsight .
In 2003 , Joel mentioned Microsoft ’s impeccable strategy relative to the failed software giants of the 90s such as Lotus , VisiCorp , and Micropro :
Microsoft was the only company on the list that never made a fatal , stupid mistake .
Whether this was by dint of superior brainpower or just dumb luck , the biggest mistake Microsoft made was the dancing paperclip .
And how bad was that , really ?
We ridiculed them , shut it off , and went back to using Word , Excel , Outlook , and Internet Explorer every minute of every day .
But for every other software company that once had market leadership and saw it go down the drain , you can point to one or two giant blunders that steered the boat into an iceberg .
I think it ’s safe to say that Microsoft is hurting now .
They ’re probably not going out of business in our lifetimes , and they ’ll likely continue to dominate many markets for at least another decade or two .
But a major shift has occurred between 2001 and today that ’s causing some big problems for Microsoft :
Apple ’s converting a lot of former Windows users .
There ’s still a long way to go , but Apple ’s growth ( into Microsoft ’s market ) shows no signs of slowing down .
Microsoft ’s Windows and Office upgrade revenues have been disappointing .
For the first time in most of Microsoft ’s history , they ’re repeatedly failing to dominate desirable secondary markets , including portable media players , mobile phones , and web search ( actually , every desirable web market ) .
Microsoft ’s entry into a market previously meant imminent death of any other players , but now it ’s usually a source of comedy for the tech press .
Many of their core products , including Windows , Windows Server , Office , and Internet Explorer , have been attacked by either strong competition or creeping irrelevance .
Microsoft ’s brand perception among consumers has been heavily damaged .
Many more people now associate them with bugs , delays , shoddy products , and failure .
As far as I can tell , none of these are Vista ’s fault , specifically .
Vista is just a logical continuation of Microsoft ’s style and culture .
Die -hard Windows fans like it .
The bigger problem is that Microsoft is n’t very good , and I mean that in a big way .
I was too young to appreciate their word - processor and spreadsheet battles of the very early 90s , but that ’s what Joel typically cites as an example of Microsoft ’s excellent strategy and their production of high - quality software .
They may have been great back then , but that ’s not the Microsoft we know today .
Today ’s Microsoft is impulsive and sloppy .
It has become massive and complex with too many layers of management , committees , and bureaucracy to produce anything great — the best they can hope for is good , and even that ’s rare .
Their products are weakly anticipated and receive mediocre reviews .
Most importantly , they ’re unable to grow their positions in the technology industry ’s biggest new markets as their old markets slowly erode .
Top leadership seems to have no strategy or direction for the company , and there ’s no sign of any problems being meaningfully solved in the foreseeable future .
After Internet Explorer 6 ’s release in 2001 , when Microsoft had crushed all competing browsers , they rested on their laurels for too long .
Now , Firefox and Safari are eating their lunch .
Microsoft finally scrambled to release IE 7 and 8 , but they delivered too little , too late — Internet Explorer ’s marketshare will probably dip below 50 % within three years .
( I ’ll bet Jeff Atwood a beer on that . )
This pattern did n’t just happen in web browsers : it applies to the entire company over a longer interval .
After effectively destroying most of the competition by the mid-90s , Microsoft got lazy .
But then the internet exploded , and Microsoft was n’t part of it .
Soon afterward , Apple got their act together .
Linux became a popular server platform .
Google dominated web search , advertising , and applications .
Microsoft ’s being assaulted on nearly every front by companies that are producing much better products , and they ca n’t catch up .
None of this is Vista ’s fault .
Vista has no major failures .
Rather , it ’s an immense collection of tiny failures : awkward interfaces , hostile behavior , ugly design , and tons of small bugs .
They ’re the same of tiny failures that plague all of Microsoft ’s modern products , which is why I have absolutely no doubt that Windows 7 will suffer the same fate .
Microsoft ’s woes are n’t specific failures of strategy or execution : the company culture , structure , inertia , and ethos are so deeply flawed that it ca n’t recover .
Microsoft can never do what Apple and Google are doing today .
It ’s too broken .
Insert your Titanic metaphor of choice .
Joel paraphrased Bill Gates in 2000 :
One of the most important things that made Microsoft successful was Bill Gates ’ devotion to hiring the best people .
If you hire all A people , he said , they ’ll also hire A people .
But if you hire B people , they ’ll hire the C people and then it ’s all over .
Bill Gates is a very smart guy — he ’s fully aware of the problems that his company now exhibits .
Maybe he semi-retired ( or whatever he did ) because he saw that it ’s all over long before we will .
Larry Summers spoke on Friday afternoon at the InterAmerican Development Bank in Washington DC .
As he was addressing a group with much experience living through and dealing professionally as economists with major crises , he spoke the “ language of economics ” ( as he called it ) and largely cut to the analytical chase .
Summers made five points that reveal a great deal about his personal thinking – and the structure of thought that lies behind most of what the Administration is doing vis -a - vis the crisis .
Some of this we knew or guessed at before , but it was still the clearest articulation I have seen .
All crises must end .
The “ self - equilibrating ” nature of the economy will ultimately prevail , although that may take massive one - off government actions .
Such a crisis happens only “ three or four times ” per century , so taking on huge amounts of government debt is fine ; implicitly , we will grow out of that debt burden .
We will get out of the crisis by encouraging exactly the kind of behaviors that “ previously we wanted to discourage ” two years ago .
It is “ this insight , this view ” particularly with regard to leverage ( overborrowing , to you and me ) that “ undergirds the policy program in the United States . ”
There is a critical need to support financial intermediation and to ensure it is adequately capitalized , with a view to the risks inherent in the current situation .
He then said , with a straight face , that the current bank stress tests are designed with this in mind .
Growth in the 1990s and more recently was based too much on finance ( this appears to be a relatively new thought for Summers ) .
The high and rising share of finance in corporate profits “ should have been a warning ” .
The next expansion should be based less on asset bubbles and more on investment in key public services .
The financial regulatory system “ in fundamental respects has been a failure ” .
There have been too many serious crises in the past 20 years ( yes , this statement was somewhat at odds with the low frequency of major crises statement in point 1 ) .
Crises definitely end .
But do they end with rapid recovery or with stagnation ?
There was nothing in Summers speech that addressed how we avoid – at the US or global level – becoming more like Japan in the 1990s , given the state of consumers ’ and firms ’ balance sheets around the world .
There is no issue with debt levels ; apparently , we can turn everything around with fiscal expansion and support for banks .
The essence of the government ’s short - term strategy is obviously to prop up the financial sector , in order to sustain something close to the current levels of debt in the economy .
But there was no hint in his remarks that this creates tension with point # 4 – growth needs to be less finance - oriented in the future , i.e. , talent has to be allocated elsewhere .
If the rents are now government - generated but still in the financial sector , why would people or capital move ?
And if enormous effort goes into sustaining the prosperity ( and apparently the bonuses , according to first quarter set- asides ) of Big Finance , how will that help with serious regulatory reform – which presumably will be opposed by the banks that are now regaining their fortunes ?
This thinking , put next to the NYT article this morning on Tim Geithner ’s work at the NY Fed , is not encouraging .
More generally , there was not even an indirect mention of political economy .
Summers ’ public narrative for the crisis is essentially that there was an accident : stuff happens .
This narrative matters .
Irrespective of what he thinks privately , unless he and other senior Admininistration officials can start to use the language ( even of economics ) regarding regulatory capture , political connections , and the way in which economic booms can create disproportionate political influence for the finance sector , we are unlikely to change the structure of power and the risk of crisis in our economy .
You may not care too much about this – “ let ’s first turn the corner and then worry about other things ” , is a standard refrain .
And for a recovery , obviously , much depends on actions that Summers and the White House can only indirectly influence – including the Federal Reserve ’s push towards inflation and the actions of European governments .
But defering to big banks and prefering fiscal expansion is very much a decision in the hands of Treasury and the White House .
They may feel this is essential to restoring confidence , but that is not the general experience of countries facing major crises .
The usual advice – given by the IMF , often at the behest of the US Treasury – is : manage an insolvency process for failed banks , precisely to reduce fiscal costs now and in the future , and to help restore confidence in the economy .
Come to think of it , was n’t this exact point made – forcefully and publicly – by Summers to the Japanese government during the 1990s ?
Forbearance on banks may work , but at great cost to the taxpayer .
And how is that helpful to either to Summers ’ stated strategy of growth led by further public investment , or – given the existing state of our public finances – to a more plausible strategy of ( nonfinancial ) technological innovation ?

A security researcher has called foul on Microsoft for doing exactly what it has thrashed hackers over for years : revealing information that can be used to hijack computers before a patch is available .
Swa Frantzen , one of the analysts at SANS Institute 's Internet Storm Center ( ISC ) criticized Microsoft for issuing patches Tuesday that fix the Windows versions of PowerPoint while announcing that patches for the same flaws in the Mac editions would not be released until June .
“ Microsoft is the one big company screaming loudest over ‘ responsible disclosure , ’ ” said Frantzen in a post to the ISC blog late Tuesday .
Responsible disclosure , a practice Microsoft has aggressively pushed , demands that researchers delay any disclosure until the bug has been patched .
“ They want an unlimited amount of time to release their patches before those who found the problem are allowed to publish , ” said Frantzen .
“ [ But the ] policy cuts both ways :
You need to obey the rules yourself just as well as demand it from all others involved . ”
Microsoft , claimed Frantzen , broke its own rules of responsible disclosure Tuesday by revealing that Office for Mac 2004 and Office for Mac 2008 contain three unpatched vulnerabilities , and by releasing information about the same bugs in Windows .
The combination , he said , could be used by hackers to craft exploits targeting Macs .
“ We all know from past experience [ that ] the reverse engineering of patches back into exploits starts at the time — if not before — the patches are released , ” said Frantzen .
“ So in the end , Microsoft just released what hackers need to attack . ”
An online poll that Frantzen posted on the ISC site showed that 47 percent agreed Microsoft had been irresponsible in omitting patches for the Mac , while about 24 percent thought Microsoft made the best - possible decision .
John Pescatore , an analyst for Gartner who covers security , agreed with the minority .
“ I think Microsoft did the right thing here , ” he said in an e-mail .
“ I would much rather see solid , well - tested patches for the highest risk vulnerabilities — which means first the ones where there are active exploits out — come out first , rather than wait for all versions to be patched simultaneously , or to rush out immature patches quickly and require re-patching later . ”
Andrew Storms , director of security operations at nCircle Network Security , took a middle path .
“ I would n’t say that [ Frantzen ] has gone too far .
Microsoft really owns ‘ responsible disclosure , ’ both in the PR sense and in the sense that they ’ve been able to get researchers to do it , ” said Storms .
“ You do n’t break your own mantra .
“ Regardless , I disagree with him , ” Storms continued , “ simply because the proof - of - concept code has been out there for a month . ”
If no one has taken that sample code , and used it to investigate , then create a working exploit for the Mac in the past month and more , Storms argued , it was very unlikely that they would go to the additional work of reverse engineering the Windows patches to figure out how to build an exploit for the Mac .
“ Why would they take the harder path , ” Storms asked , “ when they have n't taken the easier ? ”
Microsoft was not able to immediately provide someone from its security response center to argue the company ’s side of the responsible disclosure debate , but Tuesday it explained the decision to release PowerPoint patches for Windows but not for Mac OS X .
“ None of the [ PowerPoint ] exploit samples we have analyzed will reliably exploit the Mac version , so we did n’t want to hold the Windows security update while we wait for Mac packages , ” said Jonathan Ness , an engineer with the Microsoft Security Response Center , in a post to a company blog .
This story , " Researcher : Microsoft puts Mac users at risk with patch policy " was originally published by Computerworld .

BORIS MINKEVICH / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Faron Hall ( right ) and friend Wayne Spence at the Provencher Bridge .
Hall is being hailed for his heroic rescue of a teenage boy near the bridge .
WINNIPEG - A homeless man is being hailed as a hero after diving into the frigid , fast - moving Red River to rescue a teenage boy over the weekend .
Faron Hall and his friend , Wayne Spence , were sitting on a bench on the Tache Avenue riverbank just north of the Provencher Bridge when they spotted a teenage boy tumbling over the bridge 's guardrail and into the Red .
The boy and his friends were on the bridge 's north sidewalk and were trying to race across when the boy pole - vaulted over a railing onto what he thought was the pedestrian bridge .
But the two spans are n't connected , and instead of landing on concrete the boy did a back - flop into the water .
The sound he made on impact was remarkable , say witnesses .
" I thought , ' This is n't going to be a rescue , this is going to be a recovery , ' " said St. Boniface resident Marion Willis , who was walking back from The Forks with her family Sunday afternoon .
But that 's when Hall , without thinking , shucked his backpack and dove into the river , swimming out about 15 metres to grab the boy .
" When he dove in , I thought , ' Are you friggin ' nuts ? " said Spence .
The boy was apparently unable to swim because of injuries to his back , but he was panicking and getting sucked under by the eddies and the undertow .
" He started to fight me and climb on me , " said Hall .
" He ducked me under a couple of times so I had to slap him in the head a couple of times or he would have drowned both of us .
I feel really bad about that but we would have been in Lockport by now if I did n't .
I just said ' You 're cold , I 'm cold .
Just lay on your back and kick . ' "
Just as Hall was nearing the shore and about to give in to the cold and exhaustion , Spence reached out and dragged the two and pulled them onto shore .
By then , paramedics had arrived and took the teenager and Hall to St. Boniface General Hospital .
Hall was able to briefly visit the boy , who was conscious but still shivering .
Late Monday , Winnipeg Fire Paramedic
Service officials had no information on the boy 's condition .
Hall , 44 , has been an alcoholic living under the Provencher Bridge -- " - 51 C with the wind chill is my record , " he recalls -- for about seven years .
A member of the Dakota Tipi First Nation , he says he grew up in a good foster home in Waverley Heights , finished high school and was working as a teaching assistant at Hugh John Macdonald School while taking education classes at the University of Manitoba .
But booze took hold , especially after his mother was murdered on Maryland Street about a decade ago .
About three years ago , his sister was stabbed on Main Street .
" I had potential , " said Hall .
" There have been so many pitfalls in my life . "
But Willis , who went back to visit with Hall Monday , said his quick - thinking bravery should make people think twice when they encounter the homeless .
" This is a man that most people would avoid at all costs , who is kind of scary - looking , " said Willis .
" But he just had both the courage and the humanity to not even think about it and just plunge himself into the water to save a life . "

One reason Silicon Valley is struggling is that there 's no longer an IPO market .
This is making it difficult for VCs to exit investments , putting pressure on company valuations , making it harder to hire and retain people , driving companies to the London markets , etc .
Sarbanes - Oxley is n't the only reason the IPO market is dead , but it 's part of it :
Why spend millions of extra dollars a year complying with a law that wo n't make your investors the tiniest bit safer and might get you thrown in jail for life if you blow a quarter ?
SARBOX should be rewritten just because it 's expensive and ineffective :
If a company really wants to defraud you , they 'll do it with or without SARBOX , and honest companies were already held to high standards before the law was enacted ( the reason so many dotcoms went bust was not that they were committing fraud :
It was that they were risky , early - stage investments in a boom and bust cycle ) .
But if it takes a legal challenge to prompt SARBOX reform , then so be it .
The Supreme Court will now revisit SARBOX 's constitutionality .
Here 's hoping they find it ridiculous .
John Carney : [ T ]he Supreme Court will hear a constitutional challenge to Sarbanes - Oxley may spell trouble for the 2002 law that created a national board to oversee US public company auditors .
The reason the court ’s decision to hear the case is so striking is that many of the usual reasons a case makes it to the Supreme Court are absent .
There is n’t a split between different courts on the matter .
There ’s only been one constitutional challenge to the law that rose to the appeals court level , and there the court sided with the trial court by throwing out the complaint .
The court ’s decision to hear the case suggests that several justices have doubts about its constitutionality .
The case was brought by the Free Enterprise Fund and a smaller Nevada accounting firm .
They argue that the law violates constitutional requirements on separation of powers because the board exercises executive functions but ca n’t be removed by the president .
Members of the PCAOB are appointed by the SEC and can only be removed by the SEC for cause .
The challenge to Sarbox could have far more consequences than just abolishing the accounting oversight board or limiting its powers .
Perhaps because of the haste with which the law was drafted , it contains no provision upholding the rest of the law if part of it is overturned .
This could mean that if the Supreme Court overturns one part of the law , the entire Sarbox edifice would crumble .

THANKS FOR WATCHING !
The European Commission has moved to sue Sweden after the Nordic state failed to implement the EU's Data Retention Directive in a timely fashion .
The Directive was passed back in 2006 and requires all EU member states to implement some form of data retention legislation , with terms of six month to two years .
National laws were to be in place by March of this year , but Sweden still has yet to introduce a bill of its own .
Internet providers and search engines would all need to retain user data and IP addresses so that law enforcement would have a window of time in which to access that information during investigations .
According to Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet , the Swedish government does plan to introduce legislation in the next month or two , asking for a six - month retention period .
Why has n't it happened yet ?
Because the Swedish Justice Ministry has been busy .
Also , it 's not Justice Minister Beatrice Ask's " favorite project . "
The legislation , whenever it appears , will put more pressure on various ISPs that offer anonymity to their users .
Beginning April 1 , 2009 , ISPs in Sweden had to implement the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) , which meant that they could be forced to turn over user account information in some legal cases .
ISPs like Sweden 's Bahnhof responded to IPRED by simply deleting all their data on a regular basis — a perfectly legal move .
But when the Data Retention Directive goes into effect , that option will be taken off the table .
Beatrice
Ask also says that the process of introducing a bill has been slowed by all the consultation the government has been doing .
Which makes sense , since data retention is a sticky wicket for Europeans , who have generally focused on getting ISPs and search engines to store less user data ( and for less time ) .
When all the European countries meet their national Data Retention Directive obligations , the continent will have made it illegal to delete data too quickly , and illegal to store it for too long .
If there is any single lesson in the U.S. to be learned from our current challenges , it is that our culture has been dominated by prevailing individualism at the expense of the interdependent common good .
Ask any non-American what they perceive as the virtues and shortcomings of our economic culture ; you ’ll often hear that we treat individualism and common good as if the two are mutually exclusive , rather than as one - each vitally dependent upon the other .
This recession ’s historic and indiscriminate ‘ take down ’ across our financial infrastructure could not be more conclusive : U.S. business and society must evolve from moving along parallel tracks to fuller integration on one interdependent track that aggregates business , stakeholder , and public interests into initiatives of shared obligation and mutual reward .
How much closer are we getting to a new paradigm as the result of our economic crisis ?

This is the most surreal thing I ’ve seen in months .
This is a guest post from the blogger behind Studenomics a personal finance blog that offers common sense advice for college students and recent graduates .
Studenomics is the ultimate resource for young people looking for advice on how to survive this current recession , grow their careers , manage their
finances , and still be able to enjoy the weekends .
Summer of George Introduction
Four hours of sleep , five exams worth 40 % of your final grade , three cups of coffee a day .
Sound familiar ?
Well that ’s all over now - well for at least the next four months .
The first day and usually the first week after the end of the semester is always odd because you all of a sudden have massive amounts of free time .
You always assume in your mind that when you finish the semester you will be so productive and be able to get so much more done .
Well that ’s the complete opposite of what actually happens .
You sleep in until 2 pm and stay up all night catching up on your favorite tv shows and checking Facebook to see the status of your friends .
The purpose of this project is to act as a guide for college students that want to have a highly productive summer .
The Summer of George is an idea derived from the popular Seinfeld episode where George Costanza claims that he will have the summer of George .
Unfortunately Costanza ends up having the least productive summer ever and sadly the same usually goes for most college students .
All of those big plans to have a productive summer will end up forgotten by July .
The summer of 2009 will be different and by reading through this series of quality articles you will be able to have the most productive summer in every aspect of your life .
Do not worry the articles are not “ boring ” or filled with “ industry information . ”
There is something for everyone in this series so please give all of the articles a quick look .
Every article is easy to read and the information is easy to apply .
Please enjoy and spread the word about Studenomics .
Learn a New Language
For whatever reason you have not really bothered looking for a summer job but you still want to have a productive summer .
No problem you could spend your summer learning a new language .
It does n’t matter where you live it is always beneficial to be bilingual .
There are two popular methods of learning a new language .
1. Language courses .
I used to hate it as a child but now when I look back I ’m glad that my parents FORCED me to take second language classes .
I did n’t mind learning the language but there was one major problem , the classes ran every Saturday from 9 in the morning until noon .
As long as you do n’t have to wake up early on a Saturday morning for your second ( or third or fourth ) language courses then you should have no troubles .
2. Books on CD .
Before a trip to the Dominican Republic a buddy of mine listened to Spanish tutorials every morning while taking the bus to his college campus .
After a few months of this he knew enough of the language to get his point across .
Unfortunately the second language in Canada is French not Spanish .
If you are not completely sold on the idea of learning a new language this summer then here are some of the main benefits :
1 . More work opportunities .
Remember the episode where George Costanza was out of work and considering his options ?
After a few minutes he realized he did n’t have too many skills to offer the workforce .
Well by learning another language you can work as a translator or hold a decent government position ( granted you possess the other qualifications ) .
I have met many individuals that earn a decent living with their bilingual skills and you could be one of those people .
2. Ability to communicate with relatives .
If you ’re like me then you have many relatives that do n’t speak English .
Thankfully I speak their language so we are able to communicate .
If you have a communication barrier with your relatives because of your inability to speak their language then this summer is the time that barrier comes down .
We all want to have a productive summer but we just do n’t know where to start .
Here ’s a little secret : you can start by reading The Summer of George - The Most Productive Summer a College Student Will Ever Have :

Veteran investigative journalist Jim Tucker unveils Bilderberg ’s 2009 agenda
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Saturday , May 16 , 2009
Veteran investigative journalist Jim Tucker has uncovered Bilderberg ’s 2009 agenda , which includes the plan for a global department of health , a global treasury and a shortened depression rather than a longer economic downturn .
Appearing on The Alex Jones Show , Tucker said that former Swedish Prime Minister and regular Bilderberg attendee Carl Bildt , “ Made a speech advocating turning the World Health Organization into a world department of health , advocating turning the IMF into a world department of treasury , both of course under the auspices of the United Nations . ”
Tucker noted that such moves would constitute giant steps toward the world government that Bilderberg has set about to achieve but has been frustrated in finalizing over the past 10 years .
Tucker said that Bilderberg are keen on stressing the problems caused by the economic crisis , as well as the threat of a disease pandemic , as a means of justifying centralization of power .
According to Tucker , Bildt also discussed global warming in the context of a global tax on carbon emissions , which has long been a part of Bilderberg ’s agenda .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The global tax which will be paid directly to the UN will be introduced gradually , first of all as a barely noticeable tax at the gas pump , before being hiked up once it is in place , said Tucker .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Regarding the crucial Lisbon Treaty , which was struck down after Irish voters said no to its passage last year , Tucker said that Bilderberg were planning to privately send representatives to Ireland to talk to political leaders in an effort to push the treaty through .
The EU requires all member states to ratify the treaty before it can be passed and Irish voters will again be asked to vote in a referendum later this year despite having already rejected the treaty last year .
Tucker said that a key component of this year ’s Bilderberg Group meeting was an effort to get President Obama to , “ Slip through ratification of the International Criminal Court treaty , ” by forwarding it to the Senate to be voted on .
“ Their tactics are this , ” said Tucker , “ Obama is to sweet talk the many left - wing Democrats in Congress who really want the International Criminal Court treaty , they ’re just scared because people were so strongly opposed to surrendering sovereignty that they were afraid to vote for it – political cowards – so Obama ’s going to sweet talk them and say do n’t worry , we ’ll have more liberals in the Senate after the 2010 elections so in January of 2011 when the new Senate is seated you can ratify it late on a Saturday night when it ’s too late for Sunday morning papers and to re-plan the Sunday talk shows …. there will be no political reprisals . ”
Tucker confirmed the information first released by Daniel Estulin , that Bilderberg were discussing whether to sink the economy quickly or drag on a long agonizing depression .
“ Treasury Secretary Geithner and Carl Bildt touted a shorter recession not a 10 - year recession …. partly because a 10 year recession would damage Bilderberg industrialists themselves , as much as they want to have a global department of labor and a global department of treasury , they still like making money and such a long recession would cost them big bucks industrially because nobody is buying their toys ….
the tilt is towards keeping it short , ” said Tucker .
Tucker concluded by noting that Bilderberg members seemed grim faced at this year ’s meeting and that geopolitically , “ Things are going bad for them , Americans are responding , Europeans are responding , and their program is being blocked . ”

Comment on this article
I have been wondering why the new administration has continued carrying out the ruinous , misguided policies of the Bush administration when it came to the banks .
I simply could n’t figure out why the hell we were giving away trillions of dollars on absurdly favorable terms to a group of incompetent managers — reckless speculators , really — who destroyed their own companies .
Perhaps this helps shed some light :
“ Top White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers received about $ 5.2 million over the past year in compensation from hedge fund D.E. Shaw , and also received hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from major financial institutions .
A financial disclosure form released by the White House Friday afternoon shows that Mr. Summers made frequent appearances before Wall Street firms including J.P. Morgan , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers .
He also received significant income from Harvard University and from investments , the form shows .
In total , Mr. Summers made a total of about 40 speaking appearances to financial sector firms and other places , with fees totaling about $ 2.77 million .
Fees ranged from $ 10,000 for a Yale University speech to $ 135,000 for an appearance paid for by Goldman Sachs & Co .
The disclosure — in a financial report that is required for federal office holders — comes as Mr. Summers is involved in shaping the Obama administration ’s policy decisions on the financial meltdown as well as the broader recession .
Among the many decisions the economic team has wrestled with has been whether to step up regulation of hedge funds , one of the most contentious subjects during a summit of world leaders this week .
European nations pushed for tougher rules , while the Obama administration preferred a less stringent approach . ” ( emphasis added )
Let ’s review : Summers , along with Robert Rubin , pushed for the repeal of Glass Steagall , and supported the Commodity Futures Modernization Act ;
If memory serves , he was also around during the LTCM bailout .
If the history books eventually judge the Obama administration a failure , they may have to point to one horrific appointment as the root cause of the misguided policies :
The “ Smart Guy ” who decided to continue the “ Dumb Guy ’s policies .
And that ’s not very smart at all . . .

through it .
Over and over again , her voice was cracking as she strained with the volume .
JESAS !
It was super creepy .
She was n't talking about his love , or his wisdom , just JIZAS !
JIZAS !
JIZAS !
OH JIZAS !
I shook my head and wandered off , then began to regret not shouting " YES ? WHAT DO YOU WANT ? "

No What to Say , ENJOY !!!
LUCKNOW : The Samajwadi Party has vowed to work against the use of English in education and computers in new projects .
While these are pitched as populist measures ��� abolition of " expensive education in English " would allegedly create a level playing field for all and less use of computers would generate jobs ��� the steps are being viewed with alarm as they have the potential to drag back the country by years .
Releasing the party manifesto here on Saturday , SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav dwelt on his pet anti-English theme .
The manifesto says that if a new government were to be formed with SP 's support , it would work to abolish schools providing expensive education in English ��� in other words , virtually every public school regarded among the country 's top schools .
Interestingly , Mulayam Singh 's two sons have gone to such schools .
While speaking to reporters , Mulayam Singh said he was against " the compulsory use of English language in education , administration and judiciary " .
He said SP favoured the national language , Hindi , and regional languages .
To give his anti-top grade education a populist spin , he said his party was in favour of free education for girls until graduation .
On computers , Mulayam said their use was leading to unemployment .
He added that wherever work can be done by hand , computers would be abolished .
As everything was done by hand until the advent of computers , the step , if taken to its logical conclusion , could lead to the scrapping of almost all computers .
Later , it was clarified that less use of computers would be enforced only in new projects ��� again , something that could put new projects at a disadvantage vis -a - vis older ones .
Not just these , the SP has also come out against mechanized farming , arguing against agricultural machines .
Harvesters , Mulayam said , would snatch jobs from poor labourers during the harvesting season which , he claimed , gave employment for six months .
The manifesto adds that after tractors were introduced , the bovine population has been coming down .
Instead of ploughing land , bullocks and calves were going to slaughter houses .
Although SP has had close ties with the corporate world , its manifesto advocates bringing corporate salaries on par with government pay .
Taking a leaf from the Left , Mulayam said at present , the economy was benefiting just a handful who had control over capital .
He also opposed forward trading and said if a government was formed with SP 's support , it would work to cut back if not abolish stock trading and mall culture .
The SP manifesto released on Saturday has pledged free agriculture facilities to farmers apart from loan at the rate of 4 % , no forced acquisition of land and steep hike in minimum support price of crops .
And though Mulayam supported the nuclear deal , his manifesto has opposed American dominance in UN .
Advocating friendly ties with neighbours , Mulayam said , " If a government comes to power with our support , we will ensure that action is taken against communal powers and attack terrorism at its roots " .
Interestingly , Mulayam , who is facing CBI inquiry for having disproportionate assets , said that government should seize assets of people having excess wealth .
Mulayam had something for Muslims and Muslim clerics as well ��� for the past 15 years , visas to Muslims students from Bangladesh , Lanka , Afghanistan , Middle East and European countries for studying at the Islamic education centre of Darul - Uloom - Deoband in UP were not being issued , he said .
He assured that if a government was formed with SP support , visa rules would be relaxed .
He also promised implementation of the Sachar panel recommendations .
He also advocated quota for Muslims , backward and SC / ST in IITs , IIMs .
Times View
It seems Samajwadi Party wants to drag India back by decades .
That 's why it wants to scrap English as a medium of education , even though knowledge of the language gives India an edge among developing countries in the world .
In fact , China is going full throttle with English education .
Not just this , the party 's belief that getting rid of machines will ensure employment is absurd .
If that was so , why are millions migrating from vast almost machine - free states like UP and Bihar to cities like Delhi and Mumbai in search of jobs ?
If SP wishes well for the country , it should be working out how to increase productivity rather than dabbling with nonsensical economics .
QnA : In progressive of today , can political parties afford to have such a regressive approach ?

Japan 's exports have fallen faster than had been expected Japan says it expects its economy to shrink by 3.3 % over the coming year - the country 's worst slump in at least half a century .
The news comes as the government prepares to present a 15.4 trillion yen ( $ 159bn ; £ 109 bn ) economic stimulus plan to parliament .
The projected downturn for the 2009 fiscal year would be the worst since Tokyo began measuring growth in 1955 .
It follows an estimated decline of 3.1 % in 2008 , the government said .
Finance Minister Kaoru Yosano said the world 's second biggest economy remained vulnerable to fresh turmoil overseas .
" Exports have plunged much harder than our expectation , " he said .
Government estimates of the decline have been revised radically downward , in what officials described as quickly changing conditions .
" The global economic crisis and economic downturn is increasing in severity , and Japan 's export market is rapidly shrinking , " the Cabinet Office said in a statement .
Opposition victory The Nagoya victory is a boost for the opposition Democratic Party
The government says its planned stimulus spending plan should boost economic output by 2 % this fiscal year .
It will issue a record 10.8 trillion yen in bonds to cover the extra spending , adding to debt pressures .
However , some investors hope the slump in exports may have reached its low and can only improve .
Analysts said figures due to be released this week may show that factory output in Japan picked up for the first time in six months in March .
As newspaper polls suggest the government is gaining popularity in its efforts to cope with the financial crisis , Prime Minister Taro Aso is reported to be considering when he might call national elections .
The opposition Democratic Party has suffered from a funding scandal involving an aide to leader Ichiro Osawa .
But the party won a key by - election at the weekend , when Takashi Kawamura was elected to the the post of mayor of the central city of Nagoya .
Mr Yosano told reporters that the climate was not right for a poll .
" The economic difficulties that people face are too severe so this is no time to hold an election , " he said .

What is the purpose of publications ? (…)
The purpose of data is to support , directly or indirectly , the marketing of our product . ” [ 1 , 2 ]
It is well known that studies with significant positive results are easier to find than those with ‘ negative ’ results .
This so called publication bias can arise from the tendency to submit or accept manuscripts that have a positive rather than a negative or neutral result .
It can also be the consequence of deliberately overemphasizing positive results or even worse : the results can be “ embellished ” , ( partly ) faked or negative results can be “ hidden ”
In fact , pharma - sponsored trials rarely produce results that are unfavorable to the companies ’ products [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] .
For instance , none of the published 56 trials of NSAIDs in arthritis identified by Rochon et al in 1994 [ 3 ] had outcomes that were unfavorable to the company that sponsored the trials .
Another study showed that studies funded by a company were four times more likely to have results favorable to the company than studies funded from other sources [ 1 , 4 ]
Ghostwriters , who write articles that are officially credited to another person , are part of the tactics .
Ghostwriters may be hired by companies to write articles for medical journals that appear under the names of scientists who did n’t substantially contribute to the paper .
In extreme cases pharmaceutical companies and their agents control or shape multiple steps in the research , analysis , writing , and publication of articles .
This so called ghost management can be outsourced to MECC ’s , medical education and communication companies .
All the above approaches , - and more - are said to have been used by Merck to sell their Vioxx ( rofecoxib ) pills , the blockbusting painkiller , that could cause heart attacks and strokes [ 6 ] .
Merck knew , but did n’t disclose ( all ) these adverse effects *.
Later it appeared that many Vioxx - manuscripts were prepared by sponsor employees ( ghost writers ) , but attributed to academic investigators who did not always disclose industry financial support .
Distancing himself from one such article , first author Jeffrey Lisse said in an interview that :
“ Merck designed the trial , paid for the trial , ran the trial … Merck came to me after the study was completed and said , ‘ We want your help to work on the paper . ’
The initial paper was written at Merck , and then it was sent to me for editing ” [ NY - times -[ 2005 ] .
And although Merck has “ voluntarily ” withdrawn Vioxx from the market in 2004 and has agreed to pay billions to settle lawsuits in the US , the Vioxx - ghost keeps hunting Merck ( and us ) .
In a few weeks 3 news - items have crossed my eyes .
A. The Guardian ( May 4 ) mentioned that Merck refused to compensate hundreds of Britons who have suffered serious cardiovascular problems while on Vioxx .
Ministers apparently backed down from supporting these people after lobbying by the company .
B. May 1st NewsInferno com reported that Merck was accused of hiring a ghostwriter for a Circulation paper ( 2001 ) to minimize issues linked to Vioxx ’s safety , while the well known cardiologist Dr. Marvin Konstam agreed to act as lead author .
This was revealed by Prof. Jelinek during an Australian lawsuit against Merck .
C. The above news story was covered by Australian Newspapers including “ the Australian “ .
In its article on the lawsuit , the Australian also devotes one sentence to a fake Elsevier / Merck journal .
It says :
“ The drug company also allegedly produced an entire journal — called The Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine — and passed it off as an independent peer review publication . ”
It is this sentence that has caused a tsunami , starting with the Scientist , via blog .
bioethics.net to many other blogs of researchers , publishers , librarians and to newspapers .
“ Everybody ” was alarmed .
What were the allegations ?
Are they all true ?
Who is to blame ?
Merck or Elsevier ?
Most importantly : is it an isolated incidence , something completely new and what is its impact ?
Points addressed by the Scientist ( mainly based on interviews , i.e. with George Jelinek )
Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine , is published by Exerpta Medica , a division of Elsevier This Journal is not indexed in the MEDLINE database and has no website .
It had the looks of a peer - reviewed medical journal , but contained only reprinted or summarized articles Most of the articles presented data favorable to the Merck products Fosamax ( for osteoporosis ) and Vioxx .
So called “ review ” articles only cited one or two references .
Even a meta - analysis contained 2 references , one of which referring to a real meta-analysis .
The articles are “ simply a summary of already published articles ”
There are several ads for Fosamax and Vioxx .
It is unclear who wrote the editorials
One member of the editorial board , Peter Brooks said that he did n’t ever get manuscripts to review while on the board .
Neither was he paid for his role .
There is no disclosure of company sponsorship .
Merck paid an undisclosed sum to Elsevier to produce several volumes ( confirmed by Elsevier ) .
According to a statement of Merck ( see pdf on their website ) :
“ The Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine (.. ) was published by the medical publishing company Elsevier .
Merck Sharp & Dohme Australia understood that Elsevier envisaged the complimentary publication would draw on the vast resources of Elsevier , publishers of many leading peer - reviewed journals including Lancet , Bone , Joint Bone Spine and others , to deliver novel and timely full - text articles and abstracts to physicians . ”
In the same PDF Merck states that “ ghostwriting ” allegations concerning the 2001 Circulation paper about VIOXX [ item B ] are false and that professor Jelinek has witdrawn his accusation under cross examination .
According to Merck , the lead author Dr. Marvin Konstam , was in fact very much involved in the study .
Indeed , according to the Heartwire , Konstam maintained he acted properly .
He takes full responsibility for everything he has published .
Elsevier acknowledged the concern that the journal did n’t have the appropriate disclosures , ” and although they said they had no plans in looking further into the matter , Elsevier disclosed today that in total 6 such fake Australasian Journals were produced ( see Scientist ) .
Now what ?
An isolated blunder by staff of the Australian Branche of Elsevier who published a fake peer review while Elsevier headquartes and Merck were totally unaware ?
First , although I do n’t want to triviliaze the affair , obviously this Journal does not pretend to be a peer reviewed paper ( i.e. see this pdf , obtained by the Scientist ) .
Any doctor who even considers it to be a peer reviewed paper must have very little experience with critically reading of peer reviewed papers .
It is clear from the start that all articles are just copied from other ( Elsevier ) Journals , the citations are given , articles are classed to type ( in black boxes at the tope ) and the so called meta- analyses just describes another meta - analysis , which is cited .
The editorial board is called “ Honorary ” .
The advertorials and the repeated mentioning of Merck drugs makes it immediately clear that this Journal is just a so - called throwaway .
True , it should have been disclosed at the front page and the Journal ’s name and lay - out might suggest otherwise at first glance .
And to me as a librarian it is particularly strange that there was an annual subscription for institutions of $ 250 .
Throw - aways are usually for free .
Furthermore it is not included in Science Direct nor the usual bibliographic databases .
As a matter of fact , this Journal is what you would expect from an “ Excerpta Medica Journal ” : an excerpt of various articles .
At least that ’s what the name suggests and that ’s what I remember from the old fashioned Excerpta Medica abstract journals I browsed as a post - doc .
But it is remarkable that “ the reliable and authorative ” Elsevier , publisher of journals like the Lancet , lends itself to a biased publication of articles that only serve as promotional material ?
Surely this is an exception ?
Well , whereas Elsevier itself has dismayed the Lancet by sponsoring one of the largest military exhibitions in the world ( CMAJ 2007 ) , its medical and health sciences division Excerpta medica is clearly a separate business .
On the Elsevier website 41 titles of Excerpta Medica are listed , but none of the Australian Excerpta clones .
Here it says that :
Every journal contains bibliographic references and abstracts summarizing original articles from primary research and clinical journals .
The records are carefully selected from 4,000 journals from 70 countries around the world , which makes the Excerpta Medica Abstract Journals very comprehensive .
The home page of Excerpta Medica states that it is an “ Elsevier Business ” , a strategical medical communications agency , partnering with their clients in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries to educate the global health care community to enable them to make well informed decisions ( copied from EBM definition of Sackett , hé ? )
Under the heading “ strategic planning ” it is written that “ Our relationship with Elsevier allows us access to editors and editorial boards who provide professional advice and deep opinion leader networks ” ….(!!)
I ’m not the first one noticing this .
In 2007 the same link was given by the PLOS - paper about ghost management [ 1 ] , discussed above ..
Here Excerpta is mentioned as an example of a MECC .
And not only in this paper .
Both a Medscape [ 7 ] and a Perspectives in Biology and Medicine article [ 2 ] mention the role of Excerpta as a MECC .
A citation from the latter :
Recovered documents show that the pharmaceutical company Wyeth hired the MECC Excerpta / Medica to produce several scientific papers on the dangers of obesity and on obesity treatment as part of their marketing strategy for Fen - Phen .
Mundy documents that Wyeth paid between $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 for Excerpta to prepare each article , of which $ 1,500 would go to the “ named author ” as an honorarium .
Some completed papers , simply listed as “ author to be determined , ” lacked a “ named author , ” while others had made their way in to print or were under review .
One doctor , Dr. Richard Atkinson , was so pleased with the arrangement for “ Therapeutic Effects of Dexfenfluramine : A Review ” that he wrote a thank you note to Excerpta / Medica saying , “ Let me congratulate you and your writer .
. . .
Perhaps I can get you to write all of my papers for me ” ( Mundy 2002 , p. 164 ) .
And Medscape :
What made Excerpta Medica such an inspired choice is that it is a branch of the academic publisher , Reed Elsevier Plc. , which publishes many of the world ’s most prestigious science journals .
Excerpta Medica manages two journals itself : Clinical Therapeutics and Current Therapeutic Research .
According to court documents , Excerpta Medica planned to submit most of the articles it produced to Elsevier journals .
In the actual event , Excerpta managed to publish only two articles before Fen-Phen was withdrawn from the market in 1997 .
One appeared in Clinical Therapeutics , the other in the American Journal of Medicine ( another Elsevier journal ) .
In neither case did the authors of the articles disclose that they were paid by Excerpta Medica .
So clean was the laundering operation , in fact , that many of the authors did not even realize that Wyeth was involved .
By the way Fen_Phen was not particularly effective , and was linked to valvular heart disease , leading to the death of hunderds of people .
Even after withdrawal Wyeth spent $ 100 million on public relations to convince the public that the response had been overblown .
Hereby I do not want to suggest that Excerpta has played a similar role in the Vioxx case , but it does illustrate that Excerpta is a MECC with dangerous principles as it organized the ghostwriting for Wyatt elaborately , using its connections with Elsevier in a very nontransparent way .
I also do n’t want to suggest that the followed procedure is unique for Excerpta .
Several other MECC ’s follow the same approach .
For many other examples see the references below , especially [ 1 , 2 , 7 ] .
It is really tarnishing .
And worth a reading .
However ,
In my opinion we have to fear more from the strategic publication planning of the MECCs in authentic journals then the fake Australian Excerpta series .
Firstly , because the known Journals are far more trustworthy and have far more impact than the throwaways .
Secondly because the phenomenon of ghostwriting is widespread , also among “ first class Journals ” .
A conservative benchmark for ghostwriting of papers published in biomedical journals is roughly 10 % [ 2 ] , but in particular cases the percentage may be much higher [ 1 ] .
This has caused Richard Smith , former editor of the BMJ to sigh that “ Medical Journals Are an Extension of the Marketing Arm of Pharmaceutical Companies . ”
Anyway , I bet that my doctor did not describe Vioxx for my backache 10 years ago because he read “ The Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine ” .
Rather he must directly or indirectly have learned from the results of the VIGOR trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
With respect to the citation I began with , it is not from Merck , but from Pfizer as an answer to the question : “ What is the purpose of publications ? ” on the header on a Pfizer sales document ( 2000 )

GUATEMALA CITY 
An average of 16 murder victims turn up in Guatemala every day , some shot , some stabbed , some bludgeoned , and only about 3 percent of the cases are ever solved .
Even in the rare instances when a killer is arrested , the suspect frequently turns out to be a hit man hired by some shadowy figure who is never identified and gets away to plot again .
But of the more than 2,500 killings on the books this year , one unsolved case has jolted this country like no other .
The recent shooting death of Rodrigo Rosenberg , a prominent lawyer , has incited Guatemalans to pour into the streets by the hundreds of thousands and focused all eyes on a United Nations commission created to prop up Guatemala ’s ailing judiciary .
The killing of Mr. Rosenberg , early in the morning on Mother ’s Day , would have been just one more in a long list of mysterious murders  that is , if Mr. Rosenberg had not foreseen his killing and identified the people he believed were out to get him in a chilling video he prepared days before he died .
“ My name is Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano , and unfortunately , if you are watching the message , it is because I was assassinated by President Álvaro Colom , ” he said , going on to also blame the president ’s wife , Sandra Torres ; the president ’s personal secretary , Gustavo Alejos ; and various bankers and businessmen .
The recession might be crippling the auto industry but a cocooning trend among consumers over the winter fuelled soaring sales of chocolate , cereal , Kraft Dinner and video games .
It ’s also helping sales of wine , beer and spirits as consumers shy away from bars and restaurants and opt for take - home libations .
The success of trusted staple brands and products is due to savvy marketers who have creatively tweaked their messages for a spend - wary public .
" Some messages may resonate more than others right now , " said Valerie Lemant , marketing director for crackers and salty snacks at Kraft Canada .
Recent spots for Delissio frozen pizza , for example , added a specific tag line to the end of the commercial message noting that it was less expensive than either carry - out or delivery pizza .
The brand ’s standard messaging focuses on its taste attributes : " It ’s not delivery .
It ’s Delissio ! "
As the recession hit hard last fall , General Mills resurrected its Hamburger Helper brand ’s " Helping Hand " animated icon in ads by Cossette Communication - Marketing .
Prior to the recession , the brand ’s ads often focused on the convenience of the product , but the new ads showed the Helping Hand appearing alongside a mother tallying her household finances and staring at a calculator while a voiceover says " with milk , vegetables and ground beef , a dinner for four will cost $ 9.80 .
... a complete meal your budget will love for under $ 10 . "
Another spot shows the hand popping out of a couch that is laden with coins before cutting to a scene of a family of four enjoying a Hamburger Helper dinner .
The commercials end with a closing graphic that reads : " Happy Family .
Happy Budget . "
Shifting ad strategy slightly can pay off in bad times .
A review of the 1991 recession by advertising agency N. W. Ayer Inc. cited the growth in products that were able to successfully put a thrift - friendly spin on their marketing .
Ads advised " A - 1 Steak Sauce is n’t just for sirloin anymore " and could be used on hamburgers ; the animated Michelin Man brand tire mascot changed his message to " surprisingly affordable " from the pre-recession " expensive but worth it . "
And Ziploc bag ads focused more on the importance of preserving leftovers properly than on its air - tight seal .
The messages can pay off as consumers shy away from restaurants and spend more at home .
Sales of beer , wine and spirits rose 5.4 % in the year ending February , 2008 , to $ 6.8 - billion , and leapt 2.3 % from January to February alone , according to Statistics Canada .
( That compares with a 1.6 % rise in sales for the prior year period ) .
While grocers Loblaw , Metro and Sobeys have all enjoyed increased sales volumes , meaning people are eating more meals at home , the stay - at - home trend also extends to entertainment :
At video - game maker Nintendo Co. sales jumped 10 % in the fiscal year ended March 31 ; rival Sony , meanwhile , predicts it will sell 13 million PlayStation3 gaming systems this year , a 30 % jump over 2008 .
Obvious evidence of anxious consumers can be seen in the sales of comfort food , most notably brands that have been on the market for decades and normally show stable but very slow growth .
The authorities said yesterday they had foiled a plan to wage jihad , or " holy war " , against the United States by detonating bombs outside a pair of synagogues in New York and using a stinger missile to shoot down National Guard aircraft at a base in Newburgh about 60 miles north of the city .
Capping a surveillance operation that began a year ago , agents arrested four men late on Wednesday night as they planted what they thought were homemade bombs outside the two synagogues in the Bronx neighbourhood of New York City .
The bombs had in fact been made by undercover FBI officers and were harmless .
There was no doubting what the men were hoping to achieve , one police source suggested – to detonate " a fireball that would make the country gasp " in the city that had suffered so much destruction at the hands of terrorists in September 2001 .

Four men were allegedly involved in the Bronx plot .
Three were due in court later yesterday to face conspiracy charges while a fourth was being treated for an undisclosed illness and would be brought before a judge later .
If convicted , all four men , three Americans and one Haitian , could face life in prison , officials said .
They added that three of the men were converts to Islam .
Speaking to reporters at the Riverdale Jewish Centre , one of the targets of the alleged plot , the New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said yesterday that the four men were small - time criminals who had become acquainted with each other in the first place though prison contacts .
They were identified as James Cromitie , David Williams , Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen .
Mr Cromitie was the oldest member of the group .
" They stated that they wanted to commit jihad , " Mr Kelly said .
" They were disturbed about what was happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan , that Muslims were being killed .
They were making statements that Jews were killed in this attack and that would be all right – that sort of thing . "
All four men were snatched on Wednesday evening in the Riverdale area of the Bronx just as one of the band had placed the fake bombs outside the targets .
Mr Kelly said that a large articulated policy lorry was used to block the road as agents swooped in to arrest and handcuff the men .
A fifth man who was behind the wheel of the getaway car was in fact an undercover FBI informer , he revealed .
The state assemblyman from Riverdale , Jeffrey Dinowitz , spoke of the shock felt across the neighbourhood yesterday .
" I think most people will agree that we 're very angry , but very sad that this kind of plot would take place in our community , " he said .
" There are people out there motivated by religious hatred , hatred against Jews frankly , but the good news is that the NYPD and FBI were on top of this from the very beginning . "
Mixed emotions were expressed by the director of the Jewish Centre , David Winter .
Saying he was both " shocked and relieved " , he added : " Instead of a terrible story , it 's a story of success . "
The two targeted Jewish temples were just a few blocks apart and the mock bombs were placed in car boots at each location .
Police officials said that the accused men thought that they were planting 37lb devices .
However , in each case they were packed with inert C - 4 plastic explosives prepared by the FBI .
Each of them had been " totally disabled " and " there was no danger to anyone , " Mr Kelly said .
The undercover operation to track the activities of the men started in June last year in Newburgh , on the Hudson river , where the accused men lived .
The undercover FBI agent convinced the accused men that he was connected to a known terrorist group in Pakistan known as Jaish - e - Mohammed .
By October , the undercover FBI agent began inviting the men to a house in Newburgh to discuss moving their plot forward .
The house was equipped with video cameras .
Material recorded there will now form the basis of the prosecution .
( CNN ) -- Bloggers in Myanmar , Iran and Syria work under some of the most repressive conditions in the world , facing tactics such as regulation , intimidation and even imprisonment , according to a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists .
The organization released a list of the " 10 worst countries to be a blogger " to call attention to online oppression in connection with World Press Freedom Day , which was observed Sunday .
" Bloggers are at the vanguard of the information revolution , and their numbers are expanding rapidly , " the group 's executive director , Joel Simon , said in a report posted on the organization 's Web site .
" But governments are quickly learning how to turn technology against bloggers by censoring and filtering the Internet , restricting online access and mining personal data .
" When all else fails , the authorities simply jail a few bloggers to intimidate the rest of the online community into silence or self - censorship . "
Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- is the worst place in the world to be a blogger , Simon 's organization says .
A military government restricts Web access and throws people into jail for posting critical material .
Burmese authorities have the capability to monitor e-mail and other communication methods and can block users from viewing the Web sites of political opposition parties , the organization says , citing research group OpenNet Initiative .
One Burmese blogger , Maung Thura , is serving a 59 - year prison term for circulating video footage after Cyclone Nargis in 2008 , the Committee to Protect Journalists says .
Number two on the list is Iran , whose authorities , the group says , regularly detain and harass bloggers who dare to criticize religious or political figures , the Islamic revolution or its symbols .
Third is the Syrian government , which the committee says detains bloggers for posting content deemed detrimental to " national unity . "
Cuba is next on the " dishonor roll . "
Its government now holds in jail 21 writers who led online journalism in the early part of the decade , the organization says .
In Saudi Arabia an estimated 400,000 sites are blocked , the committee says , and in Vietnam the Orwellian - sounding Ministry of Information and Communication has created an agency tasked with monitoring the Internet .
Tunisia and Turkmenistan , nations where the Internet is heavily restricted , also find a place on the list .
So , too , does China , which maintains the most comprehensive online censorship program in the world , the organization says .
Chinese authorities , it says , rely on service providers to filter searches , block critical Web sites , delete objectionable content and monitor e-mail traffic .
The committee said its research shows at least 24 online writers are in prison in the country .
Egypt rounds out the list at number 10 .
Local press freedom groups in the country documented the detention of more than 100 bloggers in 2008 alone , the organization says .
Most reported mistreatment , and a number were tortured , it says .
" The governments on the list are trying to roll back the information revolution , and for now they are having success , " Simon said in the report .
" Freedom of expression groups , concerned governments , the online community , and technology companies need to come together to defend the rights of bloggers around the world . "

Advertisement Egyptian pig farmers have clashed with police in Cairo , as they tried to stop their animals being slaughtered .
Hundreds of people at the Manshiyat Nasr slum threw stones and bottles at police who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets .
The government wants to cull all the nation 's pigs , a move UN experts say is not necessary to prevent swine flu .
Egypt 's pigs mostly belong to the Coptic Christian minority who say the cull has reignited religious tensions .
The authorities initially said the pig cull was a precaution against swine flu but now describe as a general public health measure .
There have been no cases of swine flu reported in Egypt .
In Mexico , where the global swine flu outbreak started , the authorities said it could be stabilising .
Overreaction charge Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said the country was seeing fewer cases every day .
CONFIRMED CASES
Mexico : 101 suspected deaths - 19 confirmed US : One death , 160 confirmed cases New Zealand : 4 confirmed cases Canada : 85 confirmed cases Spain : 20 confirmed cases UK : 16 confirmed cases Germany : 6 confirmed cases Israel : 3 confirmed cases France : 2 confirmed cases Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong , South Korea , Italy , Irish Republic , Costa Rica , Colombia : 1 confirmed case Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission : Mexico , US , Canada , Spain , Germany , UK
Mapping the outbreak Swine flu nations make trade plea Did Mexico over - react to flu ?
Globally more than 700 people are known to be infected .
Person - to - person transmission has been confirmed in six countries .
But in cases outside Mexico , the effects of the virus do not appear to be severe .
There are estimated to be more than 300,000 pigs in Egypt , but the World Health Organisation says there is no evidence there of the animals transmitting swine flu to humans .
Pig - farming and consumption is concentrated in Egypt's Coptic Christian minority , estimated at 10 % of the population .
Many are reared in slum areas by rubbish collectors who use the pigs to dispose of organic waste .
They say the cull will harm their businesses and has renewed tensions with Egypt 's Muslim majority .
On Saturday , health officials began the slaughter in earnest , moving in on a Cairo slum where rubbish collectors are said to keep around 60,000 pigs .
The slaughter is expected to take around a month .
Officials now say the cull is aimed at bringing order to the country 's pig-rearing industry , so that in future animals are not reared on rubbish tips but on proper farms .
The government has been criticised for overreacting to the threat , but it was also criticised for responding too slowly to the bird flu crisis two years ago .
When bird flu appeared in the country in 2006 mass culls were carried out but at least 22 humans died from the disease .

OTTAWA – The RCMP has shifted its Taser policy , now training its officers that use of the stun gun poses a risk of death " particularly for acutely agitated individuals . "
In the past , the RCMP had suggested using the weapon was appropriate in cases where " resistant " individuals could be subdued in order for them to be given medical attention .
" We no longer allow that , " RCMP Commissioner William Elliott told a parliamentary committee this morning .
Elliott stressed the force believes the conducted energy weapons , which fire a 50,000 - volt discharge , are still a " useful weapon . "
But the force has changed its training and policy directives to officers in the field to flag the " risks " and to stress it should only be used when " necessary " to ensure " officer or public safety . "
The new policy also says use of the Taser must be " reasonable " in circumstances where otherwise a firearm would be used .
Elliott said it should now only be used where there is " lethal overwatch " or where another police officer is standing by ready to shoot his gun at an individual if the Taser fails to subdue the suspect .
The new instructions also warn of the " hazards of multiple deployment or continuous cycling " of the weapon .
Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski , whose death is being examined by an inquiry in B.C. , was stunned five times by a Taser gun wielded by RCMP officers .
Elliott 's explanations did not satisfy Opposition MPs who suggested the RCMP still has n't tightened its controls enough in response to a report by the public safety committee last year .
NDP MP Jack Harris said " threats to public safety " is a vague phrase open to interpretation .
" You want full and unbridled use " of the Taser weapon , suggested Liberal Rob Oliphant .
But Elliot objected strongly , saying the RCMP has also :
- made it mandatory for officers to report each use of force , including the drawing of a Taser even if not discharged ;
- required the report to written on the shift the Taser is used ;
- required each use of force to be reviewed in Ottawa ; and
- required that data is sent to the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP to produce quarterly and annual reports .

" I believe the facts are we have made significant changes in response to the committee 's report and to respond to the recommendations , " Elliott said .
" We have taken steps to restrict its use . "
Elliott said that since his last appearance before the committee he has " been Tasered , " and went on to explain that it may be appropriate to discharge the weapon more than once , depending on where the probes land on a suspect , in order to control a suspect 's movements .
Dave Mackenzie , Conservative parliamentary secretary to the minister of public safety , said he was " very satisfied " with Elliott's and the RCMP 's response to the committee 's prior recommendations .

( CNN ) -- Debbie Street experienced a spiritual crisis after watching her mother - in - law die .
Grabbing quiet time for prayer is one of the biggest challenges for many mothers .
The 82 - year - old woman suffered from heart disease and severe arthritis .
She was in so much pain that she stopped eating and taking medication , Street says .
She eventually confined herself to her bedroom , where she lingered for 90 days before dying .
" The woman was in constant pain .
It was hard to watch , " Street says .
" I kept asking , ' Why is it this way ? '
My faith took a beating . "
A group of mothers helped Street recharge and reconnect .
Street , a Roman Catholic , started attending the St. Augustine parish in Andover , Massachusetts , when she heard of a popular ministry : MOMS , short for Ministry of Mothers Sharing .
MOMS met once a week for eight weeks .
During each two - hour meeting , mothers shared their struggles , swapped advice , assigned books to one another and wrote in a journal .
They also provided baby sitters for smaller kids .
Street says MOMS taught her to see " the sacred in the ordinary . "
She started to see serving her family and children as a ministry .
She learned how to balance her faith and family .
She began praying more .
" This has had a huge , huge impact on my life , " she says .
" My faith has grown so much .
It gives me everything : new friends , fellowship with women , dinner dates . "
Daily spirituality
When busy mothers do n't make room for God , they become isolated and vulnerable , says Tracy Klehn , author of " Prayer Starters for Busy Moms . "
" That 's when women can get involved in a relationship outside marriage , a relationship with shopping or food , " Klehn says .
" She has to get something to fill her , because she 's depleted , and she does n't realize that she 's hungry for the living water . "
Klehn is an accountant , a cook , a chauffeur , a doctor and a child psychologist .
In other words , she 's your average mom , juggling roles while raising her two children in Santa Clarita , California .
Her daily schedule is so crowded that she says it 's hard to pencil in time for her spiritual life .
" Mothers can feel so alone because so many people need you for different reasons , " Klehn says .
" That 's the reason why I feel this passion to let people know that there 's someone out there to help them . "
That " someone , " to Klehn , is God .
But cultivating a spiritual life is a challenge for many mothers , regardless of their religious beliefs .
Mothers spend so much time taking care of others that many have forgotten how to take care of their spiritual selves , say several mothers who have written about the spiritual challenges of parenting .
Lisa Bergren , author of " The Busy Mom 's Devotional , " says mothers should hone their spirituality by borrowing a concept from dieting : Consistency is the key .
Her advice :
Set aside a little time each day for some kind of spiritual practice , whether it 's prayer or reading a devotional .
" Spirituality is a daily thing , " Bergren says .
" Would n't your yard look better if you even put an hour into it once a week versus not at all ?
Something is better than nothing .
And when you put in that hour a week into your yard , do n't you notice it a bit more every time you pull into the driveway ? "
Friendships also help , others say .
Faith does n't flower in isolation .
Relationships and participating in groups nurture belief , and they give women the emotional tools to cope with motherhood , some say .
Klehn says one of the biggest challenges for busy mothers is learning how to accept help .
She says some mothers feel that they have to do it all .
They should realize that God often shows up through a friend who may offer an encouraging word or even offer to cook dinner , she says .
" We just ca n't be the ones who give it all the time ; we have to be able to receive , " Klehn says .
Breaking free of traditional roles
Some mothers say they discover that they have more to give after they take time to receive .
Miriam Udel - Lambert , a professor of Yiddish language , literature and culture at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , says she had an active spiritual life before she got married and had two sons .
She says she would often go to the synagogue to pray two to three times a day .
She also studied and taught classical Jewish religious texts .
But her life became consumed by diapers and car pools after her sons were born .
Udel - Lambert says she found herself slipping into traditional gender roles for Jewish women .
" What we would think of as an explicitly spiritual life is mostly maintained by men , " she says .
" Women are supposed to find their spirituality in their roles as wives and mothers . "
Udel - Lambert says she took control of her religious life again by forging new friendships .
She started meeting once a month with other Jewish mothers for ice cream .
Ice cream led to a shared study of the Torah ( the first five books of the Hebrew Bible ) .
She now leads the group in an informal Torah study during their monthly meetings .
The small group study has made her a better mom , wife and friend , she says .
" It fills up my cup , " she says .
" And now I 'm approaching everyone in my life with a fuller cup . "
In some cases , motherhood can bolster -- not challenge -- a woman 's faith .
Sarah Khan , who lives in New Jersey , says her Muslim faith was important before the birth of her two children .
But becoming a mother inspired her to delve deeper into Islam .
" If anything , [ motherhood ] strengthened my faith , " she says .
" It made me more aware of what God has given me and being thankful for that .
That gives me a lot of motivation to say my prayers . "
Bergren says , though , that mothers should n't approach developing their faith with the same pressure as other motherhood tasks .
" Busy moms do n't need one more person shaking their finger at them , " she says .
" We 're coping with enormous pressures , balancing all the things the world says we should do . ''
Bergren says they can relieve the pressure to be spiritual supermoms by making a resolution to start small , even if it 's only a five - minute prayer each day .
" Start somewhere .
Start anywhere you can , " Bergren says .
" If you leap into a marathon in terms of your spiritual life -- putting outrageous , uncommon demands on yourself when you 're already tired and overwhelmed -- well , it 's pretty much over before it begins .
The point is to start . "

I often tell friends that a part of me is gay , even though I 've been happily married to my wife for 12 years .
What I mean is that in April 2003 I donated a kidney to my older brother David , who is gay .
The transplant took place at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics -- and it was , in a very real sense , a miraculous event for our entire family .
So ...
Kerry Taylor is good with money .
Fresh out of university , she managed to pay off her $ 17,000 student loan in just six months by continuing to live the impoverished life of a student .
She pays off debt fast , negotiates credit card rates and bank service charges , drives the speed limit and does n't idle her car 's engine – all in the name of saving money .
The thrift - conscious Taylor , whose blog squawkfox.com is all about being frugal , has just written a book , 397 Ways to Save Money ( HarperCollins Canada ) .
Taylor says there 's nothing magical about the number 397 , she just wrote the book until " I felt I was done " and then the publisher counted up the items .
" I wanted these to be quality tips , " Taylor says in an interview , " nothing like cutting off the end of a tube of toothpaste to save a fraction of a cent . "
Saving does n't mean you have to live like a pauper , she says .
" I choose to spend my money on things that really matter to me .
No one would look at me and say I was a miser .
I choose quality over quantity . "
Taylor 's book spells out how to save money – and even shows what you 'll have left in your pocket .
The Toronto Star picked out 15 nuggets that really shine as money - saving techniques .
1. Control cellphone costs .
Children with cellphones prefer to text message , so save yourself a lot of grief by paying $ 15 a month for unlimited text messaging .
2. Student discounts .
Get your student in the house the Student Price Card from the website spclive.com or in participating stores such as Shoppers Drug Mart , Footlocker and Campus Crew for $ 8.50 plus tax and they will get 10 to 15 per cent off every purchase in the dozens of participating stores .
3 . Shop for a no - fee credit card .
Taylor ditched her " gold " travel credit card with an annual payment of $ 120 for a no - fee President 's Choice Financial MasterCard that gives her back 1 per cent of her spending in free groceries .
Compare credit cards on the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada website , fcac-acfc.gc.ca .
4. Avoid ATM fees .
At charges of $ 1.50 or more per transaction , taking money from a machine that is not your bank 's can be costly .
Use the machines sparingly .
5 . No sofa beds .
Sofa beds cost hundreds more than regular couches , are heavy and hard and force guests to sleep in your living room or den .
Instead get an inexpensive inflatable " bed in a box " that can be stored out of sight .
6 . Buy a sofa with removable slipcovers .
When they get threadbare they can be repaired or replaced easily .
Reupholstering an average sofa costs $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 .
Slip covers , such as Ikea 's Stockholm line , cost around $ 500 to $ 700 each .
Older Ikea sofa covers can be found on bemz.com for as little as $ 100 .
7. Consider cloth diapers .
Even with the added expense of rubber pants and laundering , cloth diapers come out about $ 1,000 cheaper over the 30 months most kids are in diapers .
8 . Go for the points .
Use the Aeroplan and Air Miles cards and sign up for other loyalty programs that offer benefits where you shop a lot .
For example , if you can wait for a Shoppers Drug Mart promotion offering 20 times the regular points on its Optimum card , on a purchase of $ 200 you 'll get redemption points worth $ 75 on your next purchase – a saving of 37.5 per cent .
9 . Use free – and legal – software from sites such as download.com .
Open Office , from openoffice.org , will suit any students in your home with its free suite of programs including word processor , spreadsheet and presentation programs that mimic Microsoft Word , Excel and PowerPoint .
The student version of Microsoft Office with those programs can cost $ 150 .
10 .
Use powder instead of liquid detergent .
Powdered soaps cost 20 to 30 cents per load , while liquid soaps cost 30 to 40 cents per load .
Using store brands or generic brands can save $ 41 a year over name - brand soaps .
11 . Be fuel - efficient .
Take out the junk in your trunk and remove the roof rack , as excess weight and drag affect a car 's efficiency .
Slow down ; do n't idle ; do n't warm up your car for long periods ; and consider a more fuel - efficient vehicle .
12 . Use a manual lawn mower .
At a cost of $ 100 to $ 150 , a push mower is much cheaper than a gas - powered machine , which can cost $ 500 , and the push mower does n't require any costly fuel .
It is also quiet , good for the environment , better for your grass ( the reel slices , rather than chops each blade ) and will give you some needed exercise .
13 . Holidays do n't have to mean hotels .
Look for alternatives such as an apartment or house swap through HomeForExchange.com .
Or rent a timeshare from its owner through vrbo.com ( vacation rentals by owner ) .
14 . Save your pet insurance money .
Insurance plans range in cost from $ 10 to $ 50 per month , depending on level of coverage , but putting the same money in a high - interest saving account can give a better return .
A 10 - year span of costs for vet bills covered by insurance at a $ 40 monthly rate might be $ 4,000 , which , after deductibles , could result in an average payout of $ 350 a year to you .
If you instead put aside $ 40 a month for 10 years in a bank account that paid annual interest of 3 per cent , while spending $ 350 a year from those savings on vet bills , you 'd still have about $ 1,500 left over at the end .
15 . Free entertainment .
The library does n't just have free books but also CDs , movie DVDs and magazines .
Borrowing just one movie a month saves about $ 60 a year in rentals .
There are also computer games available free on the Internet .

Students Least Informed about Environmental Science Are Most Optimistic
NSF - funded researcher looks at knowledge and attitudes about the environment among 15 - year - olds who took part in the latest Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA )

Will problems associated with environmental issues improve in the next two decades ?
According to an analysis of student performance on PISA 2006 - - an international assessment of 15 - year - olds -- students who are the best informed about environmental science and the geosciences are also the most realistic about the environmental challenges facing the world in the next 20 years .
Meanwhile , students who are least informed in these areas are the most wildly optimistic that things will improve .
These attitudes are among the results presented in Green at 15 ? , a study done by sociologist David Baker and colleagues at Pennsylvania State University , in collaboration with a team of researchers at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , or OECD , an international organisation that helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy .
A PISA assessment is done every three years .
PISA 2006 focused on science , assessing the knowledge and skills of more than 400,000 students in 57 countries around the world .
" PISA is a very large study , and there is a lot of material that 's not covered in their final report , " Baker said .
" It seemed to me that , given all the attention the environment has captured , it would be useful to know what 15 - year - olds know and think about the environment , particularly environmental science and geoscience . "
The report looks at two broad areas : achievement , or " scientific literacy , " and students ' attitudes about the environment .
In the area of achievement , American students ' performance was typical of other PISA assessments , with scores in the middle of the pack .
The assessment used a combination of multiple choice and fill - in - the - blank questions to give students an opportunity to analyze and interpret data .
For example , a question on the Greenhouse Effect included graphs showing carbon dioxide emissions and the average temperature of Earth 's atmosphere over time and asked students what information in the graphs supported a relationship between temperatures and carbon dioxide emissions .
Seventeen percent of American students demonstrated the highest level of proficiency ( referred to as Level A ) , indicating that they could consistently identify , explain and apply scientific knowledge to a variety of environmental topics .
They also demonstrated the ability to link different information sources and explanations and use evidence from those sources to justify decisions about environmental issues .
At the other end of the spectrum , 42 percent of American students performed at or below Level D. Students at this level showed difficulties answering questions containing scientific information relevant to basic environmental phenomena or issues .
In addition to gauging students ' level of optimism about the environment , the portion of PISA dealing with attitudes about the environment assessed students ' familiarity with and sense of responsibility for environmental issues .
Green at 15 ? showed that the vast majority of students were familiar with issues including air pollution , energy shortages and extinction of plants and animals .
For most countries , there was no strong association between the students ' sense of responsibility for environmental issues and their proficiency in environmental science .
In another finding , 55 percent of participating U.S. schools had a specific course in environmental science , compared with 21 percent of such courses in schools in OECD member countries .
In other countries this content is sometimes captured in geography class , a less common course in the U.S. According to Baker , these are good results for environmental educators to consider here in the U.S .
" The publication of this new study should inform school systems about how well they are doing in addressing important scientific issues about our earth and its environment , " said Larry Suter , program manager at the National Science Foundation .
" This report has applied the methods of scientific investigation to the study of a topic of concern to educators , scientists , and the general public . "

Contributing Writer , [ GAS ]
The term “ cloud computing ” has entered that phase of the buzzword life - cycle in which everyone is talking about it , few people are doing anything with it , and most people ’s understanding of what it means is , at best , cloudy ( sorry ) .
Those who do understand cloud computing usually think of massively parallel servers used to scale up to meet user demand .
But Randy Hayes of CapCal had the opposite idea : why not use the cloud to simulate user demand instead of satisfying it ?
CapCal ’s Web Performance Testing product spawns Linux instances in Amazon ’s Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) to perform load testing of a web site by simulating any number of simultaneous users .
The tester first records a script of whatever use - case scenario they want to test .
The script can include normal pauses for “ think time ” so that it truly represents how a user would interact with the site , and can be recorded from the desktop without having to edit the script at all .
The user then feeds that script into CapCal and specifies how many simultaneous users to simulate .
CapCal starts up the requisite number of Linux instances in the cloud ( about one agent for every 100 simulated users ) , which gradually ramp up to pour the HTTP requests onto the specified site .
Here are some more details on the architecture .
A controller process monitors the agents and gathers data in real time .
This includes all sorts of performance metrics on each and every request including load time , bandwidth required , and any errors encountered .
A summary report classifies the percentage of response times that fall within various categories of acceptability .
The detailed data can be downloaded and fed into Excel so you can do whatever analysis you please on the numbers .
The cloud - based architecture is fairly new , but CapCal has been doing this type of load testing using a distributed network since 2000 .
Amazon ’s EC2 allows them to grow easily to any number of agents at minimal cost .
Pricing for the service is yet to be determined , but Randy told me that he ’s thinking of simply adding on to what Amazon charges for the compute time .
Of course , depending on the load you select , you might have bandwidth costs of your own to consider .
We also discussed the idea of subscription - based pricing for sites that would like to conduct this sort of testing as part of their regular cycle of development - QA - release .
Speaking of the development cycle , CapCal also offers a free service called Agile Performance Testing ( APT ) , which is a scaled - down version of their Web Performance Testing product .
It runs 20 user simulations from a single agent on your local machine , so ( hopefully ) you ca n’t really stretch your site to the breaking point — but you can still gather the performance data to compare what your latest change did to the overall page load experience .
Agile developers could use this in conjunction with unit tests to verify that nothing gets seriously broken with each iteration .
Randy showed me a pretty impressive demo of this product today .
He also demonstrated starting up agents in Amazon EC2 , but we did n’t do any live testing using the cloud - based agents .
I guess they ’re still filing off the rough edges on that product .
To launch the service onto the public stage , CapCal is looking for a site that is willing to undergo testing at the 1 million simultaneous user level .
Randy says he ’s done the research , and nobody has ever load - tested a site at that capacity before , so he hopes to score a line item in the Guinness Book of World Records .
I do n’t know about you , but after enduring a million simultaneous user test , I ’d be ready for a Guinness of a different sort .
Do you think your site could handle 1 million simultaneous users ?
If so , then please contact us and we ’ll put you in touch with Randy right away !
Randy has generously given [ GAS ] permission to give away ten free “ find your limits ” site tests !
So the first ten people who leave a comment requesting this freebie , have their own domain , and do not run their site on a free or shared hosting platform ( VPS ’s and dedicated servers are fine ) , will get the opportunity to bring their own server to its knees .
Please note that if your site includes impression - based advertising ( including Google Adsense ) you may want to disable the ads for the test , in order to avoid violating their Terms of Service .
Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles starred Brit Lena Headey
Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles - the big budget US TV series based on the film franchise - has been cancelled , broadcaster Fox has said .
The show , which starred British actress Lena Headey , ran for two seasons and was shown in the UK on Virgin1 .
It was set after the events of the second instalment of the film series .
Meanwhile , US sitcom Samantha Who ?
starring Christina Applegate has also been axed after two seasons , according to trade paper Hollywood Reporter .
It said ABC had offered to renew the comedy - shown in the UK on E4 - if the producers cut $ 500,000 ( £ 325,000 ) from the show 's budget .
But both the network and producers had decided to pull the plug , the paper added .
Drama record
Fox , which on Monday was the first of the networks to reveal its autumn schedule , announced six new series including musical comedy Glee , about a high school choir .
NBC is expected to announce on Tuesday that it is renewing legal drama Law & Order for a 20th season , which means it will equal the record for US TV 's longest - running primetime drama .
It will match Western drama Gunsmoke , shown on CBS , which ended in 1975 .
Meanwhile , NBC has announced that comedian Will Ferrell and rock band Pearl Jam will appear on Conan O'Brien 's first Tonight Show on 1 June .
The presenter takes over from Jay Leno , who has presented the show for 17 years .
We ’ve been playing Zeno Clash .
Developers Ace
Team were kind enough to suggest that we should furnish you with the world ’s first review of their insane beat ’em up .
Our razor - sharp analysis of defeating elephantmen and bludgeoning lunatics follows .
Jim : Right , our subject today is the esoteric fist ’em up , Zeno Clash , by Chilean types , Ace Team .
Alec : I liked the bit where I repeatedly punched a bird - man in the face .
Jim : Bird - men are scum .
Kieron : Shall I do a brief fact - o- list of the game so we have the FACTS on the table ?
Jim :
Yes , facts , because facts are super - true .
John : I once heard that a fact can be so true it can slice a lie in half .
Kieron : Right – Zeno Clash is a linear first - person fighting ( with bits of shooting ) game built in the Source Engine .
There ’s no multiplayer , bar a challenge mode where you can compete to beat friend ’s scores in set battles .
It ’s ACE team ’s first game .
They live in Chile .
And that is all for the facts .
SUBJECTIVITY ENGINES GO !
Jim : I believe it ’s only available on Steam , at least initially ?
That might be a fact ?
Kieron :
No , it ’s not .
It ’s on Direct To Drive .
Jim :
Ok then , no fact there .
Kieron :
Oh – for the record , how much has everyone actually played of the thing ?
I ’ve finished it and played some of the challenges .
Jim : I finished it and I ’ve not played any challenges .
Alec : I am on the very last fight , but became annoyed by it and have n’t yet completed it .
I ’ve also done a few of the challenges .
John : I ’ve finished it ten minutes ago , so no challenges .
Jim :
So it ’s a game of melee , and of shooting .
But it ’s not much like any FPS I can think of .
Can anyone think of any good comparisons or references to help give this game of context ?
Alec :
It reminded me a little of Riddick , but only a little .
Jim :
Oh yes , Riddick is the closest in terms of sheer fist - action .
John : Hmmm , imagine if Condemned were set in the world of Mirrormask , and not shit .
Alec : Aesthetically , it ’s Outcast meets a slew of crazy late - 90s French adventure games .
Kieron : I think it ’s actually a lot like a trad linear fighting game ala Double Dragon , as in , you move from fight to fight and it makes no pretense of being a “ world ” .
Jim :
Yes , it did feel rather like the FPS rejig of a classic scrolling beat ’em up .
Alec :
It cheerfully repeats its enemies in the same way .
That curious thing of fighting games : “ oh , it ’s that guy again . ”
Kieron : Yeah – in a “ You ’ve had this guy – now fight this guy with a little friend ” way .
Jim :
Even down to food lying about to heal you up .
Kieron :
But fruit instead of chicken .
So healthier .
Alec : Mmmm . Chicken .
Jim :
Yes , and it does feel healthy , as a game .
John : Going back a step : I do n’t think that ’s fair to the aesthetics , Alec .
Those French adventures were lazy in their surrealism , just doodles for the hell of it .
This feels like Bosch meets Dave McKean .
Jim : Quite so .
It ’s really unusual to look at .
The visuals are something of a reward , I felt .
Alec :
Yes , the main driving force for me was to see what new madness they ’d show me .
And agreed , it ’s far more visually imaginative than those old adventure games – I was just scrabbling for some sort of context .
Jim :
Anyone not actually like it ?
John :
Only a dangerous idiot would n’t enjoy it .
Kieron : No , adored it .
Reminded me of French graphic novels too .
Jim :
If one part of it disappointed me , it was that it did n’t escalate the craziness at the end – that final arena was * boring * .
John :
And familiar .
Alec : Yeah , after the boat ride it pretty much just repeated earlier stuff .
Jim :
Where as the beach whale - monster , or the giant elephant - giraffe things were incredible .
Alec :
It does suffer a little from the Halo backtrack / repeat effect .
Kieron : Actually , about the graphical style – it ’s worth noting that Alejandro Jodorowsky is actually Chilean .
It feels a lot like a Jodorowsky joint .
Even the plot .
Jim :
Is he ?
I thought he was Spanish
Kieron : No , Chilean .
Alec :
( The readers will have no idea what we ’re talking about now .
Giant elephant - giraffes , readers !
With sheds hanging from their necks ! )
Jim :
Yeah , those should give you a gist of the kind of world it is , it ’s probably one of the maddest I ’ve seen since Sacrifice .
Kieron :
For the uninitated – Jodorowsky ’s a writer / director chap best known either for his weirdo westerns ( El Topo , etc ) or his comics ( Metabarons ) or just being gloriously mental .
Anyway , yeah – someone paraphrase the plot .
Jim : Hmm , well , the raw story Zeno Clash tells is actually fairly unexciting .
It ’s journey of discovery thing .
A young male protagonist fleeing after killing his monstrous “ Father - Mother ”
John :
And having learned a terrible secret .
Trying to return home , he ’s outcast by his siblings .
He had joined a clan called the Corwids of the Free , a group “ not slaves to reality or common sense . ”
But their insanity makes them his enemies too .
So he ’s trying to escape , along with a friend , to find new hope .
Kieron :
It ’s the mentalness of the details which elevates the stories – the woods full of monomaniacal psychopaths , for example .
They were amazing .
Jim :
His friend seems like the biggest mystery of the game , to me .
The actual key plot “ mystery ” was obvious fairly early on , but his companion remains unexplained .
Kieron :
She ’s an odd un , is n’t she ?
Alec :
She ’s just a friend / lover , with antlers on her ‘ead .
Jim :
That old cliché .
Kieron : She ’s
Alyx with an enormous furry hat .
John : I figured that was splendid hair .
Alec :
She ’s curiously uninvolved – always disappears off to a safe ledge as you face - punch people .
Jim : Going back to what Kieron was saying about the Corwids : the entire game felt a bit like an excuse for the incredible character designs .
Your companion is part of that , but just a tiny part : almost everything you meet is an awesome concept .
Alec : Yes .
The Corwids are really there so that you can tour through a bunch of mad ideas , though they ’re affectingly tragic too .
There ’s that bit where the narration tells you about one who basically curled up and died .
And then later you actually pass her body – it ’s weirdly distressing to do so .
Kieron : There ’ s a real poetry to them .
John : Does this remind people of films like The Labyrinth and MirrorMask ?
A series of extraordinary visuals , loosely sewn together as a story .
Kieron : Yeah , a little – but really , much more the French stuff which you have n’t read .
John : Actually , it reminds me more of a Serbian thing that you ’ve never even heard of .
Jim :
No , it ’s like Chinese stuff from a future only I can see .
Kieron : CHINA !
Alec : I definitely got a vague Metabarons vibe off it .
Jim :
It does have a real whiff of esoterism to it , and I wonder if that will put people off .
Kieron : Maybe .
But I dunno – to choose an example of its ideas , one of the Corwids who believes it ’s most important to be invisible .
To do so , he tears out everyone else ’s eyes .
I think that stuff captures the imagination .
John : Anyway , shall we talk about the game itself ?
I had thought , having played the few preview levels before , that it was just going to be a series of arena fights .
So I was really delighted by the magic torch sequences .
Jim :
Yes , it just about manages to be varied enough
Alec :
If it had just been fight to fight to fight it would have failed , but it ’s impressively diverse , with the exception of the last three - ish levels .
Jim : how does everyone feel about that base - line action : the melee combat ?
I was surprised by how good it felt .
John : I was really worried it would n’t work .
I was convinced it would become a jumble .
But it ’s just stunning .
I never got a good hang of the blocking , but I wonder if that ’s because I never get the hang of blocking in games .
Alec :
The only thing I thought was that some of the modeling is off – some beasts ’ punch - range does n’t seem to match the visible length of their arms , or their distance from you .
Jim :
Boss battles in an FPS are usually achingly rubbish , but with perhaps the exception of the very end , the “ character battles ” in Zeno Clash are really something , especially the parachuting squirrel - bomb sequences .
Kieron :
My main problem was the lock on system – where you lock onto an enemy and can circle them – was on the same key you use to pick up stuff .
So trying to make a grab at an object near a baddie was literally impossible .
And allow me to repeat what Jim just said : “ Parachuting Squirrel Bomb sequences . ”
Jim :
In terms of feeling manageable , and visceral , the melee is about as good as anything other than Riddick .
Alec :
The other thing that annoyed in the melee was if you knocked someone down they were automatically de-targeted , and if you had a gun at the time , that would auto - pop up , which totally alters the fighting style .
Jim :
Yes , that was what was interesting about it how it mixed in the ranged combat : it allowed you to put away your weapon and fight , or to have it knocked from your hands when an enemy got close .
You could try to play a shooter at times , but it would n’t work .
Or , at least , it would only work so far .
Alec : I was actively trying to get my weapon knocked out my hands at times , just so it would n’t pop up whenever I knocked a guy down .
Jim : I did n’t notice that , but then I generally had the weapon knocked away from me .
Kieron :
The problem with that is how long some moves take – like , say , reloading .
How slow you move when you reload is … grating .
John :
On a number of occasions , in the middle of a battle , it would take control away from you and show a cutscene in which you were losing .
And I bloody was n’t !
It did this twice when you ’ve actually beaten the enemy , cutting to your being held to the ground and only winning by an action in the cutscene .
I WON THAT !
John :
So what were the other problems , Kieron ?
Kieron : Does n’t end , for a start .
John :
It sure seemed like it ended .
Kieron : Explain Golem .
What did Golem do ?
Who was the enormous dude ?
All the spoiler stuff we can’t really talk about in this verdict ?
Jim :
The end was unsatisfactory .
I think it needed a bigger reveal to be any good – I ’d already guessed the secret .
Kieron : I did n’t .
I was n’t trying , admittedly .
I thought it was a pretty funny secret .
John : I was perfectly happy with it .
I did n’t guess the secret , which I guess helps .
Alec : I shrugged the story off as cheerfully inchoherent bunkum – just a backbone to show us mad stuff .
Kieron :
But fuck you , y’know ?
I paid for a story .
You did n’t say it would be a Halo 2 .
John : I paid for fistifights .
Well , none of us paid a thing because we ’re too important .
Kieron :
Well , obviously .
John : Regarding linearity , I think that ’s great .
Double Dragon was linear .
Hell , the Half - Life games are linear .
It ’s an ideal way to give us this sort of game .
Jim : Kieron , you ’re not satisfied with just the ideas and the fights ?
I think that would be enough for most people ?
Kieron :
Oh , I like the game a lot .
But I think for developers to end their first game with so many things open is an act of incredible arrogance .
John :
It felt more dreamlike for me .
Aimless start and aimless end , with a couple of threads through the middle .
Jim :
It is quite dreamlike in that way , but then the narrative of dreams tend to not be much good .
It ’s an incredibly visual game , and not in an “ oh we ’re showing off with technology ” way .
It was more about their abilities as animators and artists .
And even the voice acting is okay .
Kieron :
Which is all the more amazing when it appears to have been done by the team .
John :
There ’s so many needless mistakes .
Jim : I think you ’re exaggerating that , John .
Look at it in the context of almost every other foreign game .
The dialogue is fine .
John : I ’m not exaggerating that there were many needless mistakes .
Jim :
Oh come on , the voice acting in Men Of War makes Zeno Clash seem like an Oscar winner .
John :
The subtitles were littered with typos , and many statements were n’t correct .
Jim : I did n’t have any subtitles , mistakes in the subtitles would emphasize it enormously .
Kieron : I dunno .
It felt okay , in a translated foreign film way .
Alec :
When the world it depicts is so strange and alien , it ’s easier to forgive grammar messiness .
They almost add to the strangeness , in the way they did with Russian in Stalker SHOC .
John : I think that ’s nonsense .
Kieron : I did n’t notice a single typo .
Jim :
And in the game ?
Aaaanyway , does anyone have anything they ’ve not yet vented ?
Kieron :
We have n’t even hit the major problems , you know ?
As in , it ’s 4 hours long .
Jim :
How much is it going to cost at release ?
Because for £ 7 on pre-order , that seems okay .
Kieron :
When its released , its 15 quid .
Alec : I genuinely think it would have outstayed its welcome if it got much longer , some of the multi-enemy fights were getting pretty frustrating as they were – if it had been longer , it would probably have involved more escalation and thus become miserably hard .
Jim : I think it could have been longer , if they ’d had more visual awesomeness to throw at us .
Towards the end it was losing that edge , for me .
Alec :
It ’s best they quit while they were still ahead .
Kieron :
Which actually seems reasonable for me – you ’re right , that they ’d have to have added more art assets and general mentalness to justify extending the game .
As a budget game , it sits right .
I think the actual challenges show the game ’s combat system up for the best actually – stuff like enemies fighting each other becomes much more important .
Jim :
Do the challenge mode things have any life to them ?
I mean , I ca n’t see myself replaying the story any time soon
Alec :
If you ’re into competing with your mates for leaderboard places , maybe .
John : I want to say about the melee :
The visceral nature of the combat is just astonishing .
The force and heft makes you reel , and the sense of contact is incredible .
Kieron : Totally .
KICK !
PUNCH !
Alec :
It ’s incredibly brutal in its feedback loop .
I really felt bad about kicking guys when they ’re down .
Kieron : Yeah .
I mean , I did n’t feel bad .
I felt ruthless .
For me , the height of the game is stuff like stunning an enemy , grabbing him , kneeing him in the face three times – no more – and then throwing him to my left , where I know another enemy is , knocking them both over .
Jim : Compared to Mechants
Of Brooklyn – a very similar project in size and attitude – this is a true feat of design and production .
John :
We ’ve been quite picky about bits and pieces , but I think that ’s testament to the fantastic standard overall .
It in no way feels like the first game from an indie developer .
Alec :
Yes , we ’re not criticising its fundamentals .
It ’s an FPS fisticuffs game that looks and feels incredible .
John :
My concluding remarks would be : Amazingly brutal , properly good melee combat , in the most beautiful lunatic world .
Jim : Enough !
VERDICT !
John : BUY !
Alec : The Meerian thumb is aloft .
Jim : BUY !
Kieron : Yeah , thumbs up .
If you ’re interested , I suggest you pre-order now .
It ’s ten dollars on Direct2 Drive right now , a 50 % off offer which ends on Sunday night .
On Steam it ’s only 25 % off , but that ’s up to launch , I believe .
Our verdict : SALE !
Jim : Hooray , good work , Ace Team .
The name proves befitting .
John :
And punching bastard elephants is always good .
Kieron : I ’ve always wanted to punch an elephant .
John : RPS instructs you to buy this immediately .
This Act may be cited as the Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009 .
2 .
Findings
The Congress finds as follows :
(1) In August 2007 , liquidity abruptly dried up in credit and securities markets .
(2) This lack of access to affordable credit was initially limited to financial firms with interests in mortgage - backed securities that contained subprime and predatory mortgages .
(3) The lack of access to credit quickly spread throughout the financial services industry , and eventually worldwide .
(4) At the inception of the financial crisis , the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System responded by exercising its authorities in the traditional manner to effect the Federal funds rate target , which culminated in a December 16 , 2008 , decision to establish a Federal funds rate target range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent .
(5) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , as it employed its traditional tools to provide liquidity and stability to the financial markets , came to acknowledge the severity of the current crisis by exercising its authority to act in response to unusual and exigent circumstances .
(6) The Federal Reserve has exercised its authority to address unusual and exigent circumstances no less than 11 times since the beginning of the financial crisis .
(7) Before this financial crisis , the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System last exercised its authority to address unusual and exigent circumstances in 1934 .
(8) In connection with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ’s efforts to address unusual and exigent circumstances , the Board extended assistance to nonmember institutions , something it had not done since 1959 .
(9) In connection with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ’s efforts to address unusual and exigent circumstances , the Board has purchased debt obligations from government - sponsored enterprises , something it had not done since 1981 .
( 10 ) In the course of the crisis , the Federal Reserve established joint programs with the Department of the Treasury to aid financial markets , such as the guarantee of Citigroup 's and Bank of America 's assets , the Term Asset - Backed Securities Lending Facility , and the Public - Private Partnership Investment Program .
Why is the Medical Research Council run by an arms manufacturer ?
Why is the Natural Environment Research Council run by the head of a construction company ?
Why is the chairman of a real estate firm in charge of higher education funding for England ?
Because our universities are being turned into corporate research departments .
No longer may they pursue knowledge for its own sake : the highest ambition to which they must aspire is finding better ways to make money .
Last month , unremarked by the media , a quiet intellectual revolution took place .
The research councils , which provide 90 % of the funding for acad­em­ic research , introduced a requirement for those seeking grants : they must describe the economic impact of the work they want to conduct .
The councils define impact as the " demonstrable contribution " research can make to society and the economy .
But how do you demonstrate the impact of blue skies research before it has been conducted ?
The idea , the government says , is to transfer knowledge from the universities to industry , boosting the economy and helping to lift us out of recession .
There 's nothing wrong , in principle , with commercialising scientific discoveries .
But imposing this condition on the pursuit of all knowledge does not enrich us ; it impoverishes us , reducing the wonders of the universe to figures in an accountant 's ledger .
Picture Charles Darwin trying to fill out his application form before embarking on the Beagle .
" Explain how the research has the potential to impact on the nation 's health , wealth or culture .
For example : fostering global economic performance , and specifically the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom …
What are the realistic time­scales for the benefits to be realised ? "
If Darwin had been dependent on a grant from a British research council , he would never have set sail .
The government insists that nothing fundamental has changed ; that the Haldane principle , which states that the government should not interfere in research decisions , still holds .
Only the research councils , ministers say , should decide what gets funded .
This is the sort of humbug newspaper proprietors use .
Some of them insist that they never interfere in the decisions their editors make .
But they appoint editors who share their views and know exactly what is expected of them .
All the chairs of the five research councils funding science , and of the three higher education funding councils ( which provide core funding for universities ) , are or were senior corporate executives .
These men are overseen by the minister for science and innovation , Lord Drayson .
Before he became a minister , Paul Drayson was chief executive of the pharmaceutical company PowderJect .
He was involved in a controversy that many feel symbolises the absence of effective barriers between government and commerce .
On 30 November 2001 the ­British ­government decided to buy large ­quantities of a variant of the smallpox vaccine called the Lister strain .
The only company that possessed enough was a firm called Bavarian Nordic .
On 6 December 2001 , Drayson was among a small group of businessmen who took breakfast with the then prime minister , Tony Blair .
At about the same time Drayson gave a donation of £ 50,000 to Labour .
Soon afterwards , government officials sought to buy the vaccine from Bavarian Nordic .
They were told that they were too late : PowderJect had just bought the exclusive distribution rights for the UK .
So the government had to buy it from Drayson 's company .
It paid PowderJect £ 32 m : £ 20 m more than PowderJect had paid Bavarian Nordic .
The prime minister 's office and Drayson both refused to answer questions about whether the Lister strain was discussed at the breakfast in Downing Street .
It is not clear if Drayson was aware at that time of the government 's decision to choose the Lister strain .
Drayson doubtless rubs along well with the chairman of the Medical Research Council , Sir John Chisholm .
He founded a military software company before becoming head of the government 's Defence Research Agency ( DRA ) .
He was in charge of turning it into the commercial company QinetiQ , through a privatisation process that was completed while Drayson was minister for defence procurement .
During this process , Chisholm paid £ 129,000 for a stake in the company .
The stake 's value rose to £ 26 m when QinetiQ was floated .
A former managing director of the DRA described this as " greed of the highest order " .
Lord Gilbert , a former minister of defence procurement , remarked that " frankly the money made by the leading civil servants was obscene …
They did not contribute anything to the turnaround of the company , it was the work of the research staff that made the difference . "
Chisholm remains chairman of QinetiQ .
Is there anyone outside government who believes that these people should be overseeing scientific research in this country ?
In March Drayson told the Royal Society that " the science budget is safe … there will be no retreat from pure ­science " .
A month later this promise was broken , when the budget transferred £ 106 m from the research councils " to support key areas of economic potential " : which means exchanges of staff and research with industry .
Science policy in the UK is now governed by the Sainsbury review , which the government says it will implement in full .
It was written by the Labour donor , former science minister and former supermarket chief executive , Lord Sainsbury .
The research councils , the review says , should " be measured against firm knowledge transfer targets " to show that they are turning enough science into business .
They have been told to fund £ 120 m of research in collaboration with industry .
This has been topped up with £ 180 m from the regional development agencies .
The government is also spending £ 150 m " to change the culture in universities : boosting the work they do with a whole range of businesses and increasing commercial activity " .
All this is another covert bailout , relieving companies of the need to fund their own research .
The economic impact summaries they now write ensure that all researchers will be aware that the business of universities is business .
As the white paper points out , universities are already " providing incentives ( for example promotion assessment ) " to persuade researchers to engage with business .
If your research does n't make someone money , you 're not likely to get very far .
Even judged by its own objectives , this policy makes no sense .
The long - term health of the knowledge economy depends on blue skies research that answers only to itself : when scientists are free to pursue their passions they are more likely to make those serendipitous discoveries whose impacts on society and the economy are both vast and impossible to predict .
Forced to collaborate with industry , they are more likely to pursue applications of existing knowledge than to seek to extend the frontiers of the known world .
Knowledge is not just about impacts .
It is about wonder and insight and beauty .
Much might never have an application , but it makes the world a richer place , in ways that the likes of Lord Drayson would struggle to perceive .
“ I tend to be morose sometimes , ” the justice said .
“ I am rounding the last turn for my 18th term on the court , ” he added , but his work  “ this endeavor , ” he called it , “ or , for some , an ordeal ”  has not gotten easier .
“ That ’s one thing about this job , ” he said .
“ You get a little tired . ”
But he said he had found solace in his den .
“ Sometimes , when I get a little down , ” Justice Thomas said wearily , he goes online .
“ I look up wonderful speeches , like speeches by Douglas MacArthur , to hear him give without a note that speech at West Point  ‘ duty , honor , country . ’
How can you not hear those words and not feel strongly about what we have ? ”
He continued : “ Or how can you not reminisce about a childhood where you began each day with the Pledge of Allegiance as little kids lined up in the schoolyard and then marched in two by two with a flag and a crucifix in each classroom ? ”
A favorite movie can be a comfort , too .
“ I have on many occasions or a number of occasions when things were becoming particularly routine gone down to my basement to watch ‘ Saving Private Ryan , ’ ” he said .
“ I ca n’t tell you why that particular movie , except we have it and it ’s about something important in our lives  World War II . ”
The event , on March 31 , was devoted to the Bill of Rights , but Justice Thomas did not embrace the document , and he proposed a couple of alternatives .
Nachdem in Stuttgart und Nürnberg das Intel Friday Night Game untersagt wurde , legen jetzt auch wieder die Landespolitiker von Baden - Württemberg und Bayern nach .
Viel neues gibts dabei nicht .
Politiker wie Herrmann und Haderthauer , die soviel Ahnung von Computerspielen haben wie eine Vestalische Jungfrau von Fesselsex , brüskieren sich damit , dass „ Killerspiele “ verboten gehören .
Das beste daran , ist dass nun schon wieder die USK im Kreuzfeuer steht .
Haderthauer meinte die Altersfreigabe mache „ den Bock zum Gärtner “ .
Wenn die USK der Bock im Garten ist , dann ist Haderthauer aber allenfalls eine Umweltverschmutzerin , welche die Blumen platt tritt .
Ich will hier einmal mit zwei Vorurteilen gegenüber der USK aufräumen :
1. ) Die Vergabe der Alterskennzeichnung ist von der Spieleindustrie abhängig .
Das ist absoluter Blödsinn .
Die Alterskennzeichnung verleiht nicht das USK - Gremium selbst , sondern der Beauftragte der obersten Landesmedienbehörde , also ein speziell dafür zuständiger und ( hoffentlich ) ausgebildeter Beamter !
Wenn der nicht will , dann stehen alle Räder still .
Und wir erinnern uns : Beamte werden vom Staat bezahlt und müssen auch nicht um ihren Job fürchten .
2. ) Die USK prüft zu lasch :
Auch das klingt wie Hohn in den
Ohren aller , die auch nur für 2 cent Sachverstand im Computerspielbereich haben .
Die USK gilt als die gründlichste und härsteste Kontrolle für Computerspiele weltweit .
So hart , dass die Hersteller die Spiele zum Teil selbst zensieren und schneiden müssen um eine Altersfreigabe ab 18 zu bekommen .
Das Problem ist hier nicht die USK , sondern die Politik .
Nur weil einige der altvorderen Politiker nicht die Medienkompetenz haben , um mit einem Spiel richtig umzugehen , sprechen sie diese anderen sofort ab .
Selbst wenn ein Gremium aus Fachleuten da anderer Ansicht ist .
Aber gut klar .
Setzen wir jugendliche Testkäufer für Computerspiele ein .
Die Jugendlichen sollen ihr Geld ja auch lieber für Zigaretten und Komasaufen in der Disco ausgeben .

The bomb detonated during evening prayers in the mosque
Three men convicted of bombing an Iranian mosque two days ago have been publicly executed , state media says .
The bombing killed at least 19 people during evening prayers in the south - east city of Zahedan on Thursday .
The three men , who were hanged on Saturday morning near the mosque , were already in custody before the attack .
One Iranian official had earlier accused the US of hiring mercenaries to carry out the bombing - a claim dismissed by Washington .
The men were arrested before Thursday 's bombing in connection with other attacks , including a 2007 attack on Iran 's Revolutionary Guard in which 11 people died .
Authorities said they were tried and had legal representation .
A spokesman for the Sistan - Baluchestan province 's judiciary said the three people " confessed to illegally bringing explosives into Iran and giving them to the main person behind the bombing . "
Spokesman Hojatoeslam Ebrahim Hamidi added : " They were convicted of being ' mohareb ' ( enemies of God ) and ' corrupt on the earth ' and acting against national security , " Irna reported .
Part of a Shia mosque , Amir al - Mohini , was destroyed in Zahedan , a mainly Sunni Muslim city .
A Sunni militant group had claimed responsibility , with Abdel Raouf Rigi , described as a spokesman for the Jundallah group , telling Saudi - owned TV channel Al - Arabiya that a suicide bomber had targeted a secret meeting of Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guards inside the mosque .
When an Iranian official accused the US of being behind the bombing , a US state department spokesman denied any involvement .
The bombing , described by the Iranian media as a suicide attack , came at a time of heightened tension ahead of upcoming presidential elections .
A day after the bombing , the President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's Zahedan campaign office was attacked by gunmen .
The government has warned that foreign powers are trying to sabotage the process , the BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says .
With President Ahmadinejad facing an increasingly tough battle for re-election , any growing sense of crisis will certainly not do any harm to this fiercely nationalist and populist leader , our correspondent says .

There has been a distinct increase in the rhetoric concerning the 10th Amendment over the last couple of months .
I first started hearing real rumblings in about February .
It began with the Economic Stimulus Bill and grew from there .
While I have n’t verified it , I even heard that the Governor of Texas , while attending one of the Tax Day Tea Parties , used the word secession in his speech .
There is no doubt that the federal government ’s level of control over the states has grown over the last several years , and the stimulus bill added a significant amount of that in February .
At this point I would have to say that the level of power held by the states is at an all time low .
This , in my opinion , goes against the very ideals of the founders .
Apparently I am not alone in this opinion …
There is a growing movement in this country for states to take back power and control from the federal government .
The recent revival of the 10th Amendment on both popular and political landscapes has underscored the ever - present demarcation between liberty and statism .
It is a fact that the federal government is out of control with spending , expansion , and exertion of control .
Americans are becoming fed up with the federal government ’s expansion of power , and states across the country are fighting back .
At least 35 states have introduced legislation this year that seek to take back their power under the Tenth Amendment to regulate all matters not specifically given to the federal government by the Constitution .
So let ’s be clear about what we are discussing .
The 10th Amendment says :
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
I do n’t think anyone will argue that if this is the definition , the federal government has way overstepped its bounds in terms of power .
But where did this all begin ?
Where is the point that the Federal government began to take over and deny states the right to act as they are entitled under the Constitution ?
Many point to the Civil War .
The southern states , being oppressed by tariffs imposed by the northern states , made a move to either eliminate the tariffs or secede from the Union .
Those of you reading on this site have seen the discussions already around this and are well aware that the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery until the very end .
The problem was that the US government refused to acknowledge the individual state ’s rights to do exactly what the colonies did when England ’s tariffs became too much to bear .
And as many of you have pointed out , it culminated with Lincoln ’s Gettysburg address , in which he stated “ The United States ” instead of “ These United States ” , and such it was from that point forward .
The New Deal , as we covered in the “ March Towards Socialism ” series , resulted in massive increases in the power of the Federal government over the states .
There were many reasons for this and we wo n’t cover them all here .
Not only did the programs under Roosevelt cause problems for state ’s rights advocates , but Roosevelt also got his people into the courts .
That is a whole story in itself , but the result was that the Roosevelt court changed things dramatically .
According to Martin Flaherty , a professor of constitutional law at Fordham Law School , “ From 1937 to 1995 there is not one instance of the Supreme Court knocking back Congress .
In the Constitution the interstate commerce clause gives Congress the right to regulate commerce between the states .
That gives them a lot of power .
There were questions of how far they can reach , but then comes the New Deal , and Roosevelt gets all these picks on the [ Supreme ] Court , and they come upon a theory whereupon congressional power is almost infinite . ”
Since the time of Roosevelt , the court ’s interpretation of the constitution has had the effect of dramatically decreasing the rights of the states .
Those who agree on that side of the issue point to the argument that the size and scope of issues today precludes the state ’s abilities to be able to operate with any sort of autonomy .
I can see their point on some of the very big issues , like the economy .
However , I tend to disagree on most things .
For example , there seems to be no issue with individual states deciding on their own whether or not to allow gay marriage ( of course by no issue , I mean so long as the people of the state vote for it .
Voting against gay marriage results in claims of civil rights violations .
See CA Proposition 8 ) .
If the age of drivers and the legal age for marriage can be regulated at the state level , why ca n’t who gets married ?
The list of areas where the government has overstepped its bounds in regard to the states is long and steeped in failure , for the most part .
TARP is a recent example .
But that deals with the economy , so I am willing to listen to opposing thoughts on that .
Public education is a big example .
Federal control over public education is not mandated in the Constitution , but that has not stopped the federal government from putting their hands in that cookie jar ( see : No Child Left Behind … talk about a failure ) .
The stimulus bill is a GIANT example , hence why so many states are rejecting TARP and stimulus money .
In Utah , 67 percent of the state ’s land is controlled by the federal government through wilderness preserves , limiting state leaders in their bid to fill government coffers through oil and natural gas drilling after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar cancelled 103,000 acres of leases this year .
Federal government exercising control over state lands and not allowing that state to do what is in their best interests .
In fact , environmental laws and the seizing of land for the federal government are two of the biggest issues in terms of state ’s rights today .
For example , federal law stops farmers in Idaho from shooting wolves that are preying on their livestock .
Endangered Species protection is used to prevent states from undertaking many endeavors that would relieve the nation ’s dependence on foreign oil .
It is a means of controlling the states , not protecting some bird or turtle .
Want a great example of how the Federal government usurps state ’s rights ?
The drinking age is set by individual states .
That is a fact .
So how is it that the Federal government was able to have a “ national ” drinking age ?
Simply put , the federal government , which DOES control moneys allocated to the maintenance of interstate highways , told the states that if they did n’t raise it to 21 that the government would cut their available highway money .
Federal extortion .
In fact , when you get right down to it , according to the tenth amendment , the Federal government is doing more that is unconstitutional than they are doing that is within their rights .
The Federal government has no rights under the Constitution to set up the National Endowment for the Arts , Medicare , Social Security , or The Department of ( UN ) Education .
So many states have had enough , and are beginning to fight back .
Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer recently signed into law a bill authorizing the state ’s gun manufacturers to produce “ Made in Montana ” firearms , without seeking licensing from the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
Similar laws are being considered in Utah , Alaska , Texas and Tennessee .
The Montana law will , of course , end up in the courts , where states ’ rights folks hope judges will uphold constitutional rights .
I would n’t hold my breath , given the trends since 1937 noted above .
“ The balance of power between the states and the federal government is way out of whack , ” said Georgia state Senator Chip Pearson .
“ The effect here is incalculable .
Everything you do from the moment you wake up until you get to bed , there is some federal law or restriction . ”
In Georgia , the State Senate passed 43 - to - 1 a motion that said Georgia can declare any federal criminal law null and void unless the U.S. Constitution specifically allows Congress to outlaw that conduct .
The only acts the Constitution allows Congress to prosecute are treason , counterfeiting , piracy , felonies on the high seas , international offenses and slavery .
In this particular case , the motion did n’t pass the Georgia House .
Another state standing up to some of the federal government ’s increase in power comes from Maine .
The Maine State Legislature fought the Department of Homeland Security on the Real ID act , aBush - era law that will require states to issue federally regulated identification cards , complete with biometric data and stringent address checks ( Hello Big Brother ) .
Facing stiff resistance in Maine , the government decided to postpone their fight , and soon other states were fighting the same fight .
The deadline for states to comply with Real ID has now been pushed back until 2011 .
There are many who will claim that this is a Republican issue .
In fact , my bet is that our resident liberals will come in and blast this article ( while telling me I have no facts and live in la la land ) .
But the reality is that it is an issue that belongs to everyone .
George Bush was no better for state ’s rights than any other President in the last 80 years .
Reagan at least believed in state ’s rights and limiting federal power , but could accomplish nothing with an opposition Congress .
That puts him at the top of the list of least offensive to the 10th Amendment .
President Barack Obama , in his short tenure thus far , is in my opinion , vying for the worst violator since FDR .
So the question of the day is whether or not the state ’s have the ability to push back on the Federal government and reclaim some of their sovereign rights ?
Many are finally taking the step of turning down Federal money .
And as noted above , 35 have some sort of legislation in the works or on the books .
Are they wasting their time ?
It seems that many states are finally fed up , and the people are fed up too .
So does this movement have any legs ?
So that folks do n’t get all upset with me , I have bolded the areas in this post that were found in an article written by James Osbourne .
Thank you to PeterB for pointing out that I had forgotten to add this at the bottom of the article when I posted it at 4:45 am , lol .
You can find them in the following article .
Tenth Amendment Movement Aims to Give Power Back to the States – Presidential Politics | Political News – FOXNews.com
Last week , the government released a lengthy document , General Explanations of The Administrations 2010 Revenue Proposals , which includes a 12 page segment titled " Eliminate Oil and Gas Company Preferences " .
I 've excerpted some of these below the fold .
It strikes me that the authors of these rules do not grasp that oil has peaked , and we can't continue business as usual nor pay back our financial debts by importing 70 % + of our oil .
My thoughts follow the excerpts .
Eliminate Oil and Gas Company Preferences LEVY TAX ON CERTAIN OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION
Current Law
No Federal tax is imposed on the production of oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) .
Reasons for Change According to the Government Accountability Office , the return to the taxpayer from OCS production is among the lowest in the world , despite other factors that make the United States a comparatively good place to invest in oil and gas development .
An excise tax on OCS production would advance important policy objectives , such as providing a more level playing field among producers , raising the return to the taxpayer , and encouraging sustainable domestic oil and gas production .
Proposal
The Administration is developing a proposal to impose an excise tax on certain oil and gas produced offshore in the future .
The Administration will work with Congress to develop the details of this proposal
REPEAL CREDIT FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY ( EOR ) PROJECTS Current Law
The general business credit includes a 15 - percent credit for eligible costs attributable to EOR projects .
If the credit is claimed with respect to eligible costs , the taxpayer ’s deduction ( or basis increase ) with respect to those costs is reduced by the amount of the credit .
Eligible costs include the cost of constructing a gas treatment plant to prepare Alaska natural gas for pipeline transportation and any of the following costs with respect to a qualified EOR project : ( 1 ) the cost of depreciable or amortizable tangible property that is an integral part of the project ; ( 2 ) intangible drilling and development costs ( IDCs ) that the taxpayer can elect to deduct ; and ( 3 ) deductible tertiary injectant costs .
A qualified EOR project must be located in the United States and must involve the application of one or more of nine listed tertiary recovery methods that can reasonably be expected to result in more than an insignificant increase in the amount of crude oil which ultimately will be recovered .
The allowable credit is phased out over a $ 6 range for a taxable year if the annual average unregulated wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the taxable year begins ( the reference price ) exceeds an inflation adjusted threshold .
The credit was completely phased out for taxable years beginning in 2008 , because the reference price ( $ 66.52 ) exceeded the inflation adjusted threshold ( $ 41.06 ) by more than $ 6 .
Reasons for Change
The credit , like other oil and gas preferences the Administration proposes to repeal , distorts markets by encouraging more investment in the oil and gas industry than would occur under a neutral system .
To the extent the credit encourages overproduction of oil , it is detrimental to long - term energy security and is also inconsistent with the Administration ’s policy of reducing carbon emissions and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources through a cap - and - trade program .
Moreover , the credit must ultimately be financed with taxes that result in underinvestment in other , potentially more productive , areas of the economy .
Proposal
The investment tax credit for enhanced oil recovery projects would be repealed for taxable years beginning after December 31 , 2010 .
REPEAL DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING
DEDUCTION FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION Current Law A deduction is allowed with respect to income attributable to domestic production activities ( the manufacturing deduction ) .
For taxable years beginning in 2009 , the manufacturing deduction is equal to 6 percent of the lesser of qualified production activities income for the taxable year or taxable income for the taxable year , limited to 50 - percent of the W - 2 wages of the taxpayer for the taxable year .
For taxable years beginning after 2009 , the deduction is computed at a 9 percent rate , except that the deduction for income oil and gas production activities is computed at a 6 percent rate .
Qualified production activities income is generally calculated as a taxpayer ’s domestic production gross receipts ( i.e. , the gross receipts derived from any lease , rental , license , sale , exchange , or other disposition of qualifying production property manufactured , produced , grown , or extracted by the taxpayer in whole or significant part within the U.S. ; any qualified film produced by the taxpayer ; or electricity , natural gas , or potable water produced by the taxpayer in the U.S. ) minus the cost of goods sold and other expenses , losses , or deductions attributable to such receipts .
The manufacturing deduction generally is available to all taxpayers that generate qualified production activities income , which under current law includes income from the sale , exchange or disposition of oil , natural gas or primary products produced in the United States .
Reasons for Change
The manufacturing deduction effectively provides a lower rate of tax with respect to a favored source of income .
The lower rate of tax , like other oil and gas preferences the Administration proposes to repeal , distorts markets by encouraging more investment in the oil and gas industry than would occur under a neutral system .
To the extent the lower tax rate encourages overproduction of oil and gas , it is detrimental to long - term energy security and is also inconsistent with the Administration ’s policy of reducing carbon emissions and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources through a cap - and - trade program .
Moreover , the tax subsidy for oil and gas must ultimately be financed with taxes that result in underinvestment in other , potentially more productive , areas of the economy .
Proposal
The proposal would exclude from the definition of domestic production gross receipts all gross receipts derived from the sale , exchange or other disposition of oil , natural gas or a primary product thereof for taxable years beginning after December 31 , 2010 .
US Oil production peaked 39 years ago .
We have moderated the decline by adding regional production from Alaska and Gulf of Mexico .
We import around 70 % of our oil - the above measures a ) make it more difficult to procure oil from a region where it was already more expensive than the world average b ) take us further away from a the goal of ' energy independence ' by making ' overproduction of oil ' punitive , c ) do not give one mention of conservation , sacrifice , reduced energy use , etc. Enhanced Oil Recovery ( EOR ) which uses technology to go back into old fields and extract a higher percentage of original oil is also having its credit removed .
This all strikes me as pent up 8 year political backlash against the oil industry in general that ignores current energy realities .
I am not a particular fan of the oil and gas industry , ( or any industry for that matter ) -- but we can not put handcuffs on our ' drug procurers ' before we are at least in rehab , and better yet until after we 've recovered .
It is pretty clear that ignoring reducing consumption with a focus on reducing production is fragmented policy .
Energy and natural resources are what we have to spend .
But to spend them we have to invest in them .
Reducing incentives to develop the small remaining US reserves by US junior companies means pushing investment in oil and gas to the international arena .
It will have no impact on scaling alternative energy , reducing energy imports ( which in the face of this will continue to increase , but faster ) , reducing emissions , and all the other political hype .
On the bright side it keeps oil and gas in the ground for the future , when we might better use it .
As such , measures like these would be welcome after a demand paradigm shift , and only appropriately accompanied by an across the board belt tightening and new ' ends ' , not as stand alone energy handicaps .
Until that time comes we have to wisely prioritize or will be left with fewer and fewer energy options .
Half measures like these are not a means to an end , they are just a means to a smaller means .
Anyone with more details / information on what this means of oil / gas industry and energy landscape please post below ...
What would e-mail look like if it were invented today , rather than several years ago ?
Meet Google Wave , a preview application shown off Thursday at the Google I/O conference .
SAN FRANCISCO --
What would e-mail look like if it were invented today , rather than several years ago ?
Meet Google Wave , a preview application shown off Thursday at the Google I/O conference .
The Google Wave site is now up and running , although access to the application will be restricted .
Google Wave was developed by the Google Maps team , led by Lars Rasmussen and his brother Jens .
" One of the best times of my life was in 2005 , just after the launch of Google Maps , when developers started doing crazy things with the APIs , " Rasmussen said , adding that he hopes developers will do the same with Wave .
What is Google Wave ?
Think of an open - source version of Gmail constructed via instant messaging .
To start a wave , two users start what is essentially an instant - message session , which can be archived as a conversation .
Other users can then be invited to join each wave or conversation , and there 's even a " playback " feature to track the process of the conversation .
Google also said it intends
Wave to be a platform as well as a protocol , with the appropriate tools and extensions for each .
In fact , it might not even be accurate to call it a reinvention of e-mail .
Google executives tied the instant - message / e- mail model to real - time document collaboration , even search , and extended it to the Web and to blogs .
Not surprisingly , images can be attached easily .
What 's fascinating , however , is that those images or embedable objects can also be Wave gadgets : for example , in a demo , a Google Map of Bora Bora was dropped into a wave .
However , Rasmussen was able to manipluate the map in real time from his own screen , and the changes showed up dynamically on the screen of Stephanie Hannon , the project manager .
Real - time updates seem to be a critical element of Wave .
Not only can conversations be updated in real time , but users who allow others access to their wave can allow those users the ability to update thier waves in real time .
Rasmussen displayed the design document overseeing Wave , which featured not only collaborative editing but also embedded conversations within Wave , an interesting tweak to the collaborative toos already inside Microsoft Office and other suites .
Want to publish a wave to a blog ?
No problem .
A tool called " Bloggy " allows you to publish the entire wave , which can itself be updated like a normal wave .
Rasmussen and Hannon also said that the Google Wave model will be extended to Android for mobile updates .
Integration with Firefox was also demonstrated as well .
Google will provide APIs so that developers can integrate their own code in to Google Wave .
One of the ones demonstrated was with Twitter .
Tools called " Searchy " and " Linky " also will allow embedded links and real - time search .
Google has come up with extensions called robots , which are embedded tools .
The search is real - time , too : in one demo , Hannon searched for " wave " .
Rasmussen , on his screen , saved his wave as " wav , " then again as " wave " .
When he added the final " e " , the document showed up in Hannon 's search .
Saving it again as " wav " instantly removed it from the list of search results .
The team even added a real - time spell - checker .
Waves can be made private .
Although Google monitors the ongoing waves so that it can add links and other real - time capabilities , making a wave private blocks Google from viewing it at all , Hannon said .
In an amazing closing demonstration , adding a robot called Rosie allowed real - time translation , character by character .
That closing demonstration earned Rasmussen and Hannon a standing ovation from the assembled developers .
No word yet on when Google Wave will be launched , but all I/ O attendees will be given accounts for a more in - depth preview , most likely on Friday .
This does n’t really interest me that much , but a lot of you are talking about it in the comments , so I might as well link to it and get it over with .
Here is Mancow being waterboarded and deciding it is torture :
A couple points :
1. ) I ’m not sure why we have to keep waterboarding wingnut radio hosts to prove that torture is in fact torture , but this is just starting to get silly .
How many times have we now waterboarded someone like this to prove what we have known all along - that waterboarding is torture .
2. ) One of the things that supposedly separates humans from other animals is that we are able to learn from the experiences of other people .
Apparently this ability is not available to right - wing radio hosts .
3. ) Not to diminish Mancow ’s experience , but if he thought that was torture , think what the real deal must be like .
You are snatched out of nowhere , flown across the world , kept awake for days on end in a freezing room with little food , woken every time you fall asleep on your metal bed , thrown against the wall with that lovely procedure known as collaring , slapped , had dogs threatening you , yelled at and beaten , and so on and so forth .
That goes on for a couple weeks to soften you up , then you are dragged by multiple burly men and waterboarded repeatedly .
You have no dead man ’s switch like Hitchens did , you have no “ safe ” word to stop the process , there are no cameras and friends there to make sure you are alright .
These people have been abusing you non -stop for days or weeks , for all you know this is when they finally kill you .
Of course it is torture .
I ’m sick and tired of having this stupid damned debate .
Big Break From Bush on ‘ State Secrets ’ Unlikely Under Obama
Created : April 09 , 2009 00:01 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Attorney General Eric Holder and Katie Couric ( CBS News )
In an interview that aired Wednesday night on the CBS Evening News , Attorney General Eric Holder suggested to Katie Couric that the Obama administration is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Bush administration ’s position on the use of the state secrets privilege , noting just one case out of about 20 currently under review in which the Justice Department is seriously considering changing its stance .
He did not say which case that was .
Most likely , the reversal wo n’t come in the case of Jewel v. NSA , because Holder ’s Justice Department Friday again broadly asserted the “ state secrets ” privilege as a grounds for dismissing the case , brought by AT&T customers alleging the government used dragnet surveillance to monitor the domestic telephone communications of millions of ordinary Americans .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
The Department of Justice – first under President George W. Bush and now under President Obama – has repeatedly invoked this executive privilege , which allows the president to prevent public disclosure of evidence in court by claiming that its release would endanger national security .
And increasingly , the Department of Justice has used the privilege not only to prevent public disclosure of documents , but to dismiss entire cases brought by victims of illegal policies , claiming that the subject matter of the case itself is a state secret , and that even the judge should n’t review the documents in private .
A recent report by the Constitution Project , a bipartisan think tank , found that the Bush administration used the privilege to seek “ blanket dismissal of every case challenging the constitutionality of specific , ongoing government programs ” in 92 percent more cases per year than in the previous decade .
Last night , Holder told Couric that after he took over the attorney general ’s office , he asked lawyers in the Justice Department to see “ if there ’s a way where we can be more surgical , whether there is a way in which we can share more information . ”
The state secrets privilege , he said , is appropriately invoked “ at certain times ” , but “ I want to make sure that we only do it where it ’s absolutely necessary .
I would only apply the doctrine where national security was at stake , where the lives of the American people were at stake , ” he said .
Yet it ’s difficult to see that standard at work in the recent cases where the Justice Department has invoked the state secrets privilege .
For example , in a federal court in San Francisco on Friday , the Obama Justice Department moved to dismiss the Jewel case based in part on the state secrets privilege .
The AT&T customers who filed suit , represented by the Electronic Freedom Foundation , claim the National Security Agency illegally intercepted their calls and obtained their phone records as part of a broad - reaching , ongoing national security surveillance program and in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution , the separation of powers doctrine and federal statutes .
In its legal brief filed with the court , the government ’s lawyers claim the case must be dismissed because allowing it to go forward at all would disclose information about the NSA surveillance program , which is itself a state secret .
Disclosure of the information the customers want to see , claims the government , “ which concerns how the United States seeks to detect and prevent terrorist attacks , would cause exceptionally grave harm to national security , ” Justice Department lawyers said in their filing .
This is the second attempt by ordinary AT&T customers to learn more about the government ’s secret domestic wiretapping program and to hold the government or a company that assisted it accountable .
An earlier case , also brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation against AT&T itself , was quashed when , after the Bush administration had made the state secrets arguments in court , Congress passed a law granting immunity to AT&T and other telecommunications companies from lawsuits from customers who claimed the companies helped the government spy on them .
The broad use of the state secrets privilege to dismiss entire court cases challenging unlawful government actions has outraged civil liberties and open government groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Center for Constitutional Rights .
Such advocates had counted on Obama ’s promises in the first days of his presidency to run a more transparent government than his predecessor .
But the Obama Justice Department already , in several cases seeking information about Bush administration counter - terrorism activities , has invoked the state secrets privilege to prevent the disclosure of critical evidence .
For example , in Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation v. Obama , which TWI has been following , the Obama administration asserted that the Bush administration ’s domestic warrantless wiretapping program , or Terrorist Surveillance Program , is a state secret that cannot be revealed without endangering national security .
Never mind that President George W. Bush had himself acknowledged the program ’s existence , and President Obama has said it is no longer operative .
And in Mohammed v. Jeppesen Dataplan , which TWI first wrote about in January , the Obama administration asserted the state secrets privilege to seek dismissal of a case brought by five victims of the Bush administration ’s “ extraordinary rendition ” program — which transferred prisoners to foreign countries for interrogation under torture .
In that case , the victims , including Binyam Mohamed , the British resident I ’ve written about , sued the subsidiary of Boeing that allegedly assisted the CIA in its torture program .
The Bush administration immediately swooped in and convinced the federal court to dismiss the case because the now - defunct extraordinary rendition program is supposedly a “ state secret . ”
In February , the Obama administration , to the surprise of even some of the judges sitting on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that day , continued to maintain that argument .
During last night ’s interview , Couric asked Holder whether he thought the state secrets doctrine had been abused by the Bush administration .
“ Well , I do n’t know , ” said Holder .
“ On the basis of the two , three cases we ’ve had to review so far , I think that the invocation of the doctrine was correct .
We – reversed – are in the process of looking at one case .
But I think we ’re very likely to reverse it . ”
Presumably , the three cases he ’s referring to are the Jewel , Al - Haramain * and Jeppesen Dataplan * .
But Holder went on to say that there have been more than 20 such assertions in cases that are still open .
He added that a report on the Justice Department ’s use of the privilege is being prepared , and his “ hope is to be able to share the results of that report with the American people . ”
Marc Ambinder , who obtained an early transcript of the interview , wrote Wednesday in The Atlantic that a senior Justice Department official “ declined to elaborate ” on in which case Holder was planning to reverse the department ’s position .
Congress , meanwhile , may not leave the matter in Holder ’s hands .
In February , Rep. Jerold Nadler ( D - N.Y. ) and several co-sponsors introduced the State Secrets Protection
Act of 2009 , which would require a federal judge to look at the disputed evidence rather than dismiss the case outright based solely on the government ’s assertion that its disclosure would endanger national security .
A parallel bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) and has six co-sponsors .

An Exchange With Historic Stakes
 Many people in the world today are wondering how to evaluate the recent developments with the revolution in Nepalwhere , after 10 years of an inspiring Peoples War led by the CPN ( M ) , that war has come to an end , the CPN ( M ) is now the leading Party in the recently elected Constituent Assembly and the Partys Chairman , Prachanda , is the Prime Minister of the government .
Does the current trajectory in Nepal and the course taken by the CPN ( M ) represent an historic new thing , a victory and breakthrough in advancing the communist revolution in the 21st century , as some have claimed ; oras many others fear does this represent a setback and betrayal of the goals of the revolution and of the heroic struggle waged to achieve them , and a serious departure from the communist cause that the CPN ( M ) claims to be fighting for ?
So begins the article which is featured in this issue of Revolution : ON DEVELOPMENTS IN NEPAL AND THE STAKES FOR THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT : LETTERS TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF NEPAL ( MAOIST ) FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMUNIST PARTY , USA , 2005 - 2008 ( WITH A REPLY FROM THE CPN[M ] , 2006 ) .
This article is an introduction to a sharp polemical exchange between the Revolutionary Communist Party , USA ( RCP , USA ) and the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) ( CPN [ M ] ) over a period of several years between October 2005 and November 2008 .
This represents one of the most important two - line struggles which has taken place in the international communist movement in many years .
There are four letters from the RCP , USA to the CPN ( M ) and one reply which are now being made public .
These letters address vital differences of line and a struggle which has been unfolding for a number of years .
These differences center on three questions : in brief , 1 ) the nature of the state , and specifically the need to establish a new state led by the proletariat and its communist vanguard ; 2 ) more specifically , the need to establish , as the first step , upon the overthrow of the old order , a new democratic state which would undertake the development of new economic and social relations in the nation free from imperialist domination and feudal relations ; and 3 ) the dynamic role of theory and two - line struggle vs. eclectics , pragmatism and realpolitik .
The outlook and orientation , strategic conception and method which any Party takes up that is , their line guides its political activity in one direction or another .
In two - line struggles like this , the stakes are very high : which line wins out can lead to advance , setback or even betrayal .
Digging deeply into this article and the letters from the RCP , USA and the CPN ( M ) is serious , and necessary revolutionary work .
This two - line struggle requires an approach which comprehends the life and death stakes of its outcome .
The approach of our Party , the RCP , USA has been to proceed from communist goals and basic principles of the science of communism , to go into the questions in a thorough and all sided way .
Not only does the future of the revolution in Nepal hang ever more precariously in the balance , but only by drawing the lessons from this ideological and political struggle and more deeply grasping what genuine communism is can the revolutionary forces go forward on a correct basis and advance the cause of emancipating all of humanity .
We urge all our readers to study the introductory article and dig into the letters posted on line and to engage in deep , informed discussion with the Party and others concerning these vital questions of ideological and political line .
Come to the presentations which will be sponsored by Revolution Books * and organize discussions ... with your comrades and friends .
This article and the letters need to find their way into the hands of many people from revolutionaries in the U.S. and others who have been following the developments in Nepal , to immigrants and students from abroad , including from South Asia , to the international communist movement .
It needs to get out into the areas of the cities from the ghettos and barrios to the campuses and scenes of intellectual ferment and among people of all strata where the revolutionary and communist movement is developing .
It needs to reach all those who are searching for a way out of this horror and the path to real liberation .
And , it is an opening for those who are searching for such answers to find out what communism really is and how human society could be organized in a whole different way .
This issue of Revolution needs to reach these people and more and this article and the letters it introduces need to spread throughout society and the world on the Internet .
This line struggle further underscores the historic importance of the Manifesto from the Party , Communism : The Beginning of a New Stage .
As that Manifesto says , the international communist movement is at a crossroads .
It confronts the question of whether to be , as the Manifesto puts it , a vanguard of the future or residue of the past ?
The line struggle which is carried out in depth in these letters is both situated within this larger world context and is also a concentration of it .
And it is vital for all to engage with this Manifesto ... as they study and wrestle with the two - line struggle in relation to the revolution in Nepal .
As this issue of the paper gets distributed among all kinds of people , this Manifesto needs to accompany it .
With the defeat of the revolution in China and the restoration of capitalism in that country , the first stage of communist revolution in the world ended .
And Bob Avakian , Chairman of the RCP , has led in scientifically summing up that experience , building on the monumental achievements and critically summing up the shortcomings and , on that basis , bringing forward a new theoretical framework for carrying forward communist revolution in the world .
This synthesis , as concentrated in this Manifesto , urgently needs to be engaged by all who see the horror of the world the way it is and burn for a different future , free of exploitation and oppression .
It represents a source of hope and daring , on a scientific foundation for masses the world over .

Well , if you ’ve ever had Kublai - like aspirations , here are a few proxy tools for scaling the wall , and getting back to reading the nefarious posts of all those Blogspot bloggers , and porn .
Tor : Anonymity Online
Easily the most important tool in a wallcrawler ’s arsenal .
Tor is a group of tools that with a bit of configuring , allows you to surf the net anonymously .
Basically the software routes all your Web page requests through other people ’s IP addresses ( your Internet calling card ) , masking your identity online .
Though effective , the re-routing slows down pageloads considerably .
Because of this , you ’ll want to download Firefox , and get the TorButton extension , which lets you turn
Tor on when you need it and off when you do n’t by the simple click of a button .
Anonymouse : Cuttin’ The Cheese
This no -software solution is a quick and easy way to get to most blocked sites .
A little clunky , expect sites to run a bit slow when loaded through Anonymouse – as well , many commenting systems wont accept the anonymoused links , so leaving your opinion can be limited .
Proxzee : The New Kid’s Speedy
Proxzee is new , so I ’ve really no experience with it other than I plugged in a few sites and they came up fast .
As reported at the Weifang Radish and in more detail at Dave ’s Wagon , this proxy service seems to operate much faster than those solutions mentioned above .
Like both Anonymouse and the about - to - be- mentioned PKBlog , Proxzee relinks all children links on the page to Proxzeefied links ( cure or curse , I ’ll let you decide ) .
PKBlogs : Slap The Block
This site is exclusively for getting around the China / Pakistan / Iran / India blocking of Blogspot / Blogger blogs .
It too is completely Web - based , and you need only enter the blog ’s name to access the site .
For example , if you wish to visit granitestudio.
blogspot.com , you need only enter ‘ granitestudio ’ on the site , or optionally , simply type in http://www.pkblogs.com/granitestudio, or whatever blog you ’re trying to reach .
UPDATE : As of a few hours after writing this , Blogspot blogs became unblocked here in the Mainland .
The CPC seems to block and unblock randomly , so … I ’d suggest bookmarking this for later use .
Psiphon : It Probably Does n’t Suck
Alright , how do I know .
It ’s mere minutes into November 28th , and the site advertises that its download will be available come December 1st – but it looks promising .
Designed by The Citizen Lab , Psiphon allows trusted networks of computers in unblocked countries to provide access to blocked sites for people in places like China .
I remember reading about this months and months ago , and I ’m still not clear how it differs from Tor , but well …
I guess I need only wait a few more days to find out .
And if these do n’t cut it , check out a bazillion others ( thanks to Shaun for this link ) .
Retired Catholic Archbishop Rembert G Weakland , who has been accused of covering up widespread child rape by priests in Milwaukee , has a forthcoming memoir in which he wrote the following bits of wisdom :
" We all considered sexual abuse of minors as a moral evil , but had no understanding of its criminal nature . "
Weakland , who retired in 2002 after it became known that he paid $ 450,000 in 1998 to a man who had accused him of date rape years earlier , said he initially " accepted naively the common view that it was not necessary to worry about the effects on the youngsters : either they would not remember or they would ' grow out of it ' . "
May 13 , 2009 — Thomas ten Cate
In this post , I will describe what my project is all about .
What is it that I intend to do , why do I intend to do it , and how ?
Haskell is a pure functional programming language .
Pure functional means that the entire program is treated as the evaluation of an expression ; the word pure indicates that such an expression can have no side effects .
Hence , no modification of variables , no reading from disk , no drawing to the screen .
Of course Haskell would n’t be very useful if it could n’t do all those things , but indeed it can .
The language is now growing out from its origins in computer science research , as more and more people begin to realize that purity and strict typing are good things .
Although the initial effort that goes into a program may be a bit more than with more mainstream languages , these language features guarantee a certain degree of correctness that impure , dynamically typed , or imperative languages can never achieve .
However , I believe that the further acceptance of Haskell is held back by a lack of tooling .
There is an great compiler , great libraries and a great package management system , but there is no really great IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) .
A good IDE would not only be a great time saver for seasoned Haskell developers ; it would also be of much assistance to newbies who want to learn the language .
There is Leksah ( Haskell spelled backwards , missing an L ) , but it is still under heavy development and not yet in a really usable state .
Yi is an editor written in Haskell , but it does not qualify as a full IDE .
Either way , there is no reason to build yet another IDE from scratch when a perfectly good option is readily available .
Eclipse is one of the most popular IDEs for the imperative programming language Java , and it is also written in Java .
I worked with it years ago and hated it .
It was unwieldy , incomprehensible and terribly slow to boot .
But recently I was forced to work with it again , and I was pleasantly surprised .
Because it is a very powerful IDE there are still many knobs and dials , but they are generally in sensible places and can be understood without a manual .
The speed has also improved greatly .
But the best thing about Eclipse is its feature set .
It has clever code completion .
It has a powerful build system .
It has refactoring features that outdo even the latest Visual Studio releases from Microsoft .
And it is not just about Java : rumour has it that Eclipse can also be used for C++ development , PHP … and Haskell .
Indeed it can .
EclipseFP ( which stands for Eclipse Functional Programming ) is a plugin for Eclipse that allows for Haskell development .
( It also contains discontinued support for OCaml . )
Unfortunately , EclipseFP is only marginally usable , does not offer half as many useful features as it could , and has been standing still for almost a year .
I figured that ’s a shame , so I decided to try and see if I could improve this situation .
Thomas Schilling a.k.a. nominolo has graciously offered to be my mentor , for which I am vary grateful .
Leif Frenzel , the original author of EclipseFP , has also offered his help , so I am in good hands .
I will start by fixing small bugs and making little improvements here and there .
This way , I will familiarize myself with the source code of EclipseFP and with the Eclipse plugin system .
Next , the real work will start .
The current EclipseFP does its own parsing of Haskell , which is a duplication of work : there is already a perfectly good Haskell parser and typechecker available in the form of the compiler , GHC .
The Scion library was developed ( by the aforementioned nominolo ) specifically for interfacing with GHC .
Thus , my next course of action will be to hook EclipseFP up to Scion .
This opens up many exciting possibilities .
The type of an identifier could be shown in a tooltip when you hover the mouse cursor over it .
Inferred type signatures could be automatically added to functions .
Type errors and other compile errors could be highlighted with red squiggly lines .
It could be possible to Ctrl+click on an identifier to jump to its definition .
Near the end of the project , I will add support for the Haskell package manager and build system Cabal .
EclipseFP currently uses its own build files , but using a Cabal file would greatly simplify the transition to Eclipse +
EclipseFP and also allow for easier integration with existing libraries .
Some IDE support in writing the Cabal file would also be great .
So , that ’s the plan for the next months .
It will be a bumpy ride .
It will be difficult at times .
But I ’m definitely going to learn a lot , and will hopefully even turn out a useful product !
Open reading frames ( ORF ) for the glycoprotein precursor GPC , the nucleoprotein NP , the matrix protein analog Z , and the polymerase L , and their orientation are indicated ( A ) ; blue bars represent sequences obtained by pyrosequencing from clinical samples .
Secondary structure predictions of intergenic regions ( IR ) for S ( B , C ) and L segment sequence ( D , E ) in genomic ( B , D ) and antigenomic orientation ( C , E ) were analyzed by mfold ; shading indicates the respective termination codon ( opal , position 1 ) , and its reverse - complement , respectively .
RNA extracts from two post - mortem liver biopsies ( cases 2 and 3 ) and one serum sample ( case 2 ) were independently submitted for unbiased high - throughput pyrosequencing .
The libraries yielded between 87,500 and 106,500 sequence reads .
Alignment of unique singleton and assembled contiguous sequences to the GenBank database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank ) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ( blastn and blastx ; [ 29 ] ) indicated coverage of approximately 5.6 kilobases ( kb ) of sequence distributed along arenavirus genome scaffolds : 2 kb of S segment sequence in two fragments , and 3.6 kb of L segment sequence in 7 fragments ( Figure 2 ) .
The majority of arenavirus sequences were obtained from serum rather than tissue , potentially reflecting lower levels of competing cellular RNA in random amplification reactions .
Our data represent genome sequences directly obtained from liver biopsy and serum ( case 2 ) , and from cell culture isolates obtained from blood at CDC ( case 1 and 2 ) , and from liver biopsies at NICD ( case 2 and 3 ) .
No sequence differences were uncovered between virus detected in primary clinical material and virus isolated in cell culture at the two facilities .
In addition , no changes were detected between each of the viruses derived from these first three cases .
This lack of sequence variation is consistent with the epidemiologic data , indicating an initial natural exposure of the index case , followed by a chain of nosocomial transmission among subsequent cases .
Sequence gaps between the aligned fragments were rapidly filled by specific PCR amplification with primers designed on the pyrosequence data at both , CU and CDC .
Terminal sequences were added by PCR using a universal arenavirus primer , targeting the conserved viral termini ( 5′ - CGC ACM GDG GAT CCT AGG C , modified from [ 30 ] ) combined with 4 specific primers positioned near the ends of the 2 genome segments .
Overlapping primer sets based on the draft genome were synthesized to facilitate sequence validation by conventional dideoxy sequencing .
The accumulated data revealed a classical arenavirus genome structure with a bi-segmented genome encoding in an ambisense strategy two open reading frames ( ORF ) separated by an intergenic stem - loop region on each segment ( Figure 2 ) ( GenBank Accession numbers FJ952384 and FJ952385 ) .
Phylogenetic relationships of LUJV were inferred based on full L ( A ) and S segment nucleotide sequence ( B ) , as well as on deduced amino acid sequences of L ( C ) , NP ( D ) , Signal / G2 ( E ) and G1 ( F ) ORF's .
Phylogenies were reconstructed by neighbor - joining analysis applying a Jukes - Cantor model ; the scale bar indicates substitutions per site ; robust boostrap support for the positioning of LUJV was obtained in all cases ( > 98 % of 1000 pseudoreplicates ) .
GenBank Accession numbers for reference sequences are : ALLV CLHP2472 ( AY216502 , AY012687 ) ; AMAV BeAn70563 ( AF512834 ) ; BCNV AVA0070039 ( AY924390 , AY922491 ) , A0060209 ( AY216503 ) ; CATV AVA0400135 ( DQ865244 ) , AVA0400212 ( DQ865245 ) ; CHPV 810419 ( EU , 260464 , EU260463 ) ; CPXV BeAn119303 ( AY216519 , AF512832 ) ; DANV 0710 -2678 ( EU136039 , EU136038 ) ; FLEV BeAn293022 ( EU627611 , AF512831 ) ; GTOV INH - 95551 ( AY358024 , AF485258 ) , CVH -960101 ( AY497548 ) ; IPPYV DakAnB188d ( DQ328878 , DQ328877 ) ; JUNV MC2 ( AY216507 , D10072 ) , XJ13 ( AY358022 , AY358023 ) , CbalV4454 ( DQ272266 ) ; LASV LP ( AF181853 ) , 803213 ( AF181854 ) , Weller ( AY628206 ) , AV ( AY179171 , AF246121 ) , Z148 ( AY628204 , AY628205 ) , Josiah ( U73034 , J043204 ) , NL ( AY179172 , AY179173 ) ; LATV MARU10924 ( EU627612 , AF485259 ) ; LCMV Armstrong ( AY847351 ) , ARM53 b ( M20869 ) , WE ( AF004519 , M22138 ) , Marseille12 ( DQ286932 , DQ286931 ) , M1 ( AB261991 ) ; MACV Carvallo ( AY619642 , AY619643 ) , Chicava ( AY624354 , AY624355 ) , Mallele ( AY619644 , AY619645 ) , MARU222688 ( AY922407 ) , 9530537 ( AY5 71959 ) ; MOBV ACAR3080MRC5P2 ( DQ328876 , AY342390 ) ; MOPV AN20410 ( AY772169 , AY772170 ) , Mozambique ( DQ328875 , DQ328874 ) ; NAAV AVD1240007 ( EU123329 ) ; OLVV 3229-1 ( AY216514 , U34248 ) ; PARV 12056 ( EU627613 , AF485261 ) ; PICV ( K02734 ) , MunchiqueCoAn4763 ( EF529745 , EF529744 ) , AN3739 ( AF427517 ) ; PIRV VAV - 488 ( AY216505 , AF277659 ) ; SABV SPH114202 ( AY358026 , U41071 ) ; SKTV AVD1000090 ( EU123328 ) ; TAMV W10777 ( EU627614 , AF512828 ) ; TCRV ( J04340 , M20304 ) ; WWAV AV9310135 ( AY924395 , AF228063 ) .
Phylogenetic trees constructed from full L or S segment nucleotide sequence show LUJV branching off the root of the OW arenaviruses , and suggest it represents a highly novel genetic lineage , very distinct from previously characterized virus species and clearly separate from the LCMV lineage ( Figure 3A and 3B ) .
No evidence of genome segment reassortment is found , given the identical placement of LUJV relative to the other OW arenaviruses based on S and L segment nucleotide sequences .
In addition , phylogenetic analysis of each of the individual ORFs reveals similar phylogenetic tree topologies .
A phylogenetic tree constructed from deduced L - polymerase amino acid ( aa ) sequence also shows LUJV near the root of the OW arenaviruses , distinct from characterized species , and separate from the LCMV branch ( Figure 3C ) .
A distant relationship to OW arenaviruses may also be inferred from the analysis of Z protein sequence ( Figure S1 ) .
The NP gene sequence of LUJV differs from other arenaviruses from 36 % ( IPPYV ) to 43 % ( TAMV ) at the nucleotide level , and from 41 % ( MOBV / LASV ) to 55 % ( TAMV ) at the aa level ( Table S1 ) .
This degree of divergence is considerably higher than both , proposed cut - off values within ( < 10 – 12 % ) , or between ( > 21.5 % ) OW arenavirus species [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , and indicates a unique phylogenitic position for LUJV ( Figure 3D ) .
Historically , phylogenetic assignments of arenaviruses have been based on portions of the NP gene [ 1 ] , [ 33 ] , because this is the region for which most sequences are known .
However , as more genomic sequences have become available , analyses of full - length GPC sequence have revealed evidence of possible relationships between OW and NW arenaviruses not revealed by NP sequence alone [ 34 ] .
Because G1 sequences are difficult to align some have pursued phylogenetic analyses by combining the GPC signal peptide and the G2 sequence for phylogenetic analysis [ 16 ] .
We included in our analysis the chimeric signal / G2 sequence ( Figure 3E ) as well as the receptor binding G1 portion ( Figure 3 F ) ; both analyses highlighted the novelty of LUJV , showing an almost similar distance from OW as from NW viruses .
Protein motifs potentially relevant to LUJV biology
Canonical polymerase domains pre-A , A , B , C , D , and E [ 35 ] –[ 37 ] are well conserved in the L ORF of LUJV ( 256 kDa , pI = 6.4 ; Figure 4 ) .
The Z ORF ( 10.5 kDa , pI = 9.3 ) contains two late domain motifs like LASV ; however , in place of the PTAP motif found in LASV , that mediates recognition of the tumor susceptibility gene 101 , Tsg101 [ 38 ] , involved in vacuolar protein sorting [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , LUJV has a unique Y 77 REL motif that matches the YXXL motif of the retrovirus equine infectious anemia virus [ 41 ] , which interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) complex [ 42 ] .
A Tsg101 - interacting motif , P 90 SAP , is found in LUJV in position of the second late domain of LASV , PPPY , which acts as a Nedd4 - like ubiquitin ligase recognition motif [ 43 ] .
The RING motif , containing conserved residue W 44 [ 44 ] , and the conserved myristoylation site G 2 are present [ 45 ] – [ 47 ] ( Figure 4 ) .
The NP of LUJV ( 63.1 kDa , pI = 9.0 ) contains described aa motifs that resemble mostly OW arenaviruses [ 48 ] , including a cytotoxic T - lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitope reported in LCMV ( GVYMGNL ; [ 49 ] ) , corresponding to G 122 VYRGNL in LUJV , and a potential antigenic site reported in the N - terminal portion of LASV NP ( RKSKRND ; [ 50 ] ) , corresponding to R 55 KDKRND in LUJV ( Figure 4 ) .

The GPC precursor ( 52.3 kDa , pI = 9.0 ) is cotranslationally cleaved into the long , stable signal peptide and the mature glycoproteins G1 and G2 [ 51 ] – [ 54 ] .
Based on analogy to LASV [ 55 ] and LCMV [ 56 ] , signalase would be predicted to cleave between D 58 and S 59 in LUJV .
However , aspartate and arginine residues in the −1 and −3 positions , respectively , violate the ( − 3,−1 ) - rule [ 57 ] ; thus , cleavage may occur between S 59 and S 60 as predicted by the SignalP algorithm .
The putative 59 aa signal peptide of LUJV displays a conserved G 2 , implicated in myristoylation in JUNV [ 58 ] , however , it is followed in LUJV by a non-standard valine residue in position + 4 , resembling non-standard glycine residues found in Oliveros virus ( OLVV [ 59 ] ) and Latino virus ( LATV ; http://www2.ncid.cdc.gov/arbocat/catalog-listing.asp?VirusID=263&SI=1 ) .
Conservation is also observed for aa residues P 12 ( except Amapari virus ; AMAV [ 60 ] ) , E 17 [ 61 ] ( except Pirital virus ; PIRV [ 62 ] ) , and N 20 in hydrophobic domain 1 , as well as I 32 KGVFNLYK 40 SG , identified as a CTL epitope in LCMV WE ( I 32 KAVYNFATCG ; [ 63 ] ) ( Figure 4 ) .
Analogous to other arenaviruses , SKI - 1/S1P cleavage C-terminal of RKLM 221 is predicted to separate mature G1 ( 162 aa , 18.9 kDa , pI = 6.4 ) from G2 ( 233 aa , 26.8 kDa , pI = 9.5 ) [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] , [ 64 ] .
G2 appears overall well conserved , including the strictly conserved cysteine residues : 6 in the luminal domain , and 3 in the cytoplasmic tail that are included in a conserved zinc finger motif reported in JUNV [ 65 ] ( Figure 4 ) .
G2 contains 6 potential glycosylation sites , including 2 strictly conserved sites , 2 semi- conserved sites N 335 ( absent in LCMVs and Dandenong virus ; DANV [ 19 ] ) and N 352 ( absent in LATV ) , and 2 unique sites in the predicted cytoplasmic tail ( Figure 4 ) .
G1 is poorly conserved among arenaviruses [ 16 ] , and G1 of LUJV is no exception , being highly divergent from the G1 of the other arenaviruses , and shorter than that of other arenaviruses .
LUJV G1 contains 6 potential glycosylation sites in positions comparable to other arenaviruses , including a conserved site N 93 HS ( Figure 4 ) , which is shifted by one aa in a motif that otherwise aligns well with OW arenaviruses and NW arenavirus clade A and C viruses .
There is no discernable homology to other arenavirus G1 sequences that would point to usage of one of the two identified arenavirus receptors ; Alpha-dystroglycan ( α - DG ) [ 66 ] that binds OW arenaviruses LASV and LCMV , and NW clade C viruses OLVV and LATV [ 67 ] , or transferrin receptor 1 ( TfR1 ) that binds pathogenic NW arenaviruses JUNV , MACV , GTOV , and SABV [ 68 ] ( Figure S2 ) .
In summary , our analysis of the LUJV genome shows a novel virus that is only distantly related to known arenaviruses .
Sequence divergence is evident across the whole genome , but is most pronounced in the G1 protein encoded by the S segment , a region implicated in receptor interactions .
Reassortment of S and L segments leading to changes in pathogenicity has been described in cultured cells infected with different LCMV strains [ 69 ] , and between pathogenic LASV and nonpathogenic MOPV [ 70 ] .
We find no evidence to support reassortment of the LUJV L or S genome segment ( Figure 3A and 3B ) .
Recombination of glycoprotein sequence has been recognized in NW arenaviruses [ 14 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 71 ] – [ 73 ] , resulting in the division of the complex into four sublineages : lineages A , B , C , and an A / recombinant lineage that forms a branch of lineage A when NP and L sequence is considered ( see Figure 3C and 3D ) , but forms an independent branch in between lineages B and C when glycoprotein sequence is considered ( see Figure 3D ) .
While recombination cannot be excluded in case of LUJV , our review of existing databases reveals no candidate donor for the divergent GPC sequence .
To our knowledge is LUJV the first hemorrhagic fever - associated arenavirus from Africa identified in the past 3 decades .
It is also the first such virus originating south of the equator ( Figure 1 ) .
The International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) defines species within the Arenavirus genus based on association with a specific host , geographic distribution , potential to cause human disease , antigenic cross reactivity , and protein sequence similarity to other species .
By these criteria , given the novelty of its presence in southern Africa , capacity to cause hemorrhagic fever , and its genetic distinction , LUJV appears to be a new species .

After today ’s Flight Readiness Review for space shuttle Atlantis ’ STS - 125 mission to the Hubble Space Telescope , mission managers unanimously agreed to set May 11 at 2:01 p.m. EDT as the launch date .
This long awaited flight will repair and upgrade Hubble , likely the most significant satellite ever launched .
And , for the space shuttle , it ’s a final visit to a dear , old friend .
During the 11 - day mission ’s five spacewalks , astronauts will install two new instruments , repair two inactive ones and perform the component replacements that will keep the telescope functioning into at least 2014 .
In addition to the originally scheduled work , Atlantis also will carry a replacement Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit for Hubble .
Astronauts will install the unit on the telescope , removing the one that stopped working on Sept. 27 , 2008 , delaying this servicing mission until the replacement was ready .
Veteran astronaut Scott Altman will command the final space shuttle mission to service NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope , and retired Navy Capt .
Gregory C. Johnson will serve as pilot .
Mission specialists rounding out the crew are : veteran spacewalkers John Grunsfeld and Mike Massimino , and first - time space fliers Andrew Feustel , Michael Good and Megan McArthur .

good luck hope i was helpful to you
There are many things I would do if I was n’t afraid other people were watching .
I know what you ’re thinking ; it ’s a pathetic existence .
I , of anyone , would agree .
But , even as I try to quiet the spontaneous part of my brain , the part that needs to do something unpredictable every once in awhile , needs to wake up at 3:00 in the morning and go outside and lie in the grass , I know it ca n’t be .
The predictable part of my mind disagrees .
The predictable part of me knows that I can do anything I put my mind to .
I always have , and by the looks of it , I always will .
But sometimes , I wonder , sometimes the impulsive part of my mind wants to know what would happen if , in the middle of doing something of great importance , I said no , enough , I ’m done , and dropped everything .
Sometimes I wonder .
Never do I do .
You want to know what I want to do right now ?
I want to run outside and just keep running .
Just spread my arms out , let my hair down , and let the feeling of the wind against me envelope my mind and soul .
But before I can run a foot my mother will be calling after me , my brothers coming from behind .
My father will be reached , out on business in who - knows where .
There would be complications .
There always are .
That ’s the only thing keeping me from running .
From running and never stopping until my legs grow numb , until my heart is beating a mile a minute , until my breathing becomes ragged , tearing my throat .
It sounds funny but I want the pain .
I want to feel it with all my being .
Because then I ’d know I was alive .
I ’d know that I ’d feel something , even if the only something I feel is pain .
Predictability may be painless , may be safe and secure , but it goes farther and more beyond than one could ever imagine ; no longer can you feel anything .
The predictable part of me says no , you ca n’t do that .
You ’re supposed to do what you ’re told , be the nice , little girl you raised to be .
You ’re supposed to go on and be a goody - two shoes , no questions asked .
But now I ’m asking questions .
I ca n’t help the curiosity bubbling inside me .
I want to know who is telling me to be predictable and protected .
I want to know why safe and secure go above happiness and joy .
I want to know if the complications are the only thing keeping me back .
I want to know these things more that anything .
Unfortunately , you ca n’t always get what you want .
Its 3:00 in the morning , no one is awake , rain is pouring down from the high heavens and I am sitting in my bad .
There is something terribly wrong with this picture .
The predictable part of me is happy .
Well , happiness as is safer and more protected .
This part of me does n’t feel happiness --
This part of me does n’t feel anything .
The unpredictable part of me is screaming , yelling , throwing a temper tantrum .
It ’s wants to feel the rain against my skin .
It wants to feel cold and shivering .
It wants to feel happy , not safe and secure .
It wants to feel pure and complete happiness .
Predictability is reminding me of the complications .
Spontaneity is reminding me that want is a feeling .
A good feeling .
Right now , any feeling is a good feeling .
But why is this a struggle in the first place ?
Why does protection from questions and puzzled stares come before my wants and desires ?
Great , more questions added to the bunch .
It ’s 3:30 and here I am still sitting in my bed .
Damn .
I thought that maybe , by some miracle , without any part of my mind interfering , my legs would take me outside and just let the rain wash away everything .
But I ’m still here .
Dammit all to hell !
It ’s 3:42 and yes , the rain is outside and no , I am not with it .
But I ’m coming to realize something .
No one said I could n’t go outside .
No told me that , may there come a time in my life where I would feel the need to venture outside into the pouring rain in the middle of the night , that I should refuse my desire .
So to answer my question , there is only one person I can think of that is telling me not to be spontaneous and unpredictable .
And that ’s me .
I ’m the one telling me to be predictable .
I ’m the one telling me to stay inside the house .
I ’m the one telling me to have no feeling .
I am the one and I am the coward .
And come to think of it , I know why safe and secure go above happiness and joy .
Because I am a coward .
I am afraid of feeling happiness .
I am afraid of feeling too much , letting my emotions take control of me .
I am afraid and I am ashamed .
Look at that , I got what I wanted but it does n’t seem as sweet as I imagined .
A wise man once said that there are two tragedies in life : one is not to get your heart 's desire .
The other is to get it .
Guess which one I got ?
It is 3:45 .
I am searching for my rain jacket .
Actually , never mind , I wo n’t need it .
I want to feel the rain on me , I want it to seep into every pore and wash away everything .
The stairs creek a little as I tiptoe down .
I hold my breath .
This is going to be fun .
Fun .
I am going to feel fun .
The door is close of course .
It stands in front of me , my last barrier holding me back from feeling the rain against my skin .
I scoff a little .
This is easy .
I unlock the last obstacle .
I open the door .
And for the first time in my life , I let myself get completely and utterly drenched .
And it felt good .
I do n’t know what time it is .
I am lying in the mud shivering and cold and feeling complete as I watch the last of the starts fade away .
The day is creeping up but right now , the darkness and the light are in balance and everything is at peace .
Happiness courses through my veins .
It ’s something familiar , my body remembers it , but it still has to become comfortable .
All the same , my body welcomes it back as an old friend , relieved to have it back .
I watch the sunrise , a smile playing at my lips .
Bitlet , the first web - based BitTorrent client , is known for its innovative services and ease of use .
Bitlet 's latest new feature allows users to stream video torrents directly in a web - browser - no additional software required .
In 2007 BitLet launched a web - based Java applet which allows users to download . torrent files without having a BitTorrent client installed .
For this innovation Bitlet received a nomination for the Webware 100 Awards where the hobby project competed with companies backed by millions of dollars .
Although they did n’t win the award , the evolution of Bitlet continued steadily .
After its introduction it added features such as music streaming ( currently utilized by mininova ) and the ‘ bookmarklet ‘ which allows users to inject a direct download link into torrent search engines .
Today Bitlet adds video streaming to this list , another long awaited addition .
The experimental video streaming feature allows users to stream video using BitTorrent and watch the file , even as it ’s still downloading .
The first release only supports videos in the Ogg format , but developer Daniele Castagna told Torrent Freak that he might extend this list , depending on how much time he can spend on the project .
In order to make Bitlet work with streaming video a few modifications had to be made , but its still good old BitTorrent technology under the hood .
Daniele has put up a few example videos on the site and below them are instructions on how to stream your own files using Bitlet .
There are a few important conditions to fulfill in order to achieve an optimal streaming experience .
Of primary importance is the need for sufficient seeds and peers to guarantee a decent download speed .
Besides this , the playback time will depend on the quality of the video – the higher the quality , the more bandwidth is needed .
The streaming feature seems to be working well , and it ’s actually the first live example of BitTorrent video streaming which does n’t require the installation of any obscure third party applications .
The only thing needed is an up - to - date version of Java , which most people already have installed .
Although current bandwidth prices are dropping , most video services such as YouTube are paying millions of dollars for traditional server side streaming .
Especially high quality video is costly to stream , and peer - to - peer technology can certainly make a huge difference there .

Tesla now worth half GM 's value
Chronicle columnist , Andrew Ross , stands for a photograph inside the studio on Tuesday Jan. 27 , 2008 in San Francisco , Calif .

From the what - a- world department : Daimler AG's $ 50 million investment in Tesla Motors this week means the San Carlos electric car maker is worth roughly half the value of the world 's largest auto manufacturer , General Motors Corp .
With one roadster on the market and one sedan in prototype , Tesla , thanks to Daimler 's 9 percent stake , is valued at $ 550 million .
GM sold 8.35 million vehicles worldwide in 2008 ; its market value as of Thursday was $ 1.17 billion , based on the closing stock price of $ 1.92 .
" It 's sort of amusing , " remarked Daimler co-founder , Martin Eberhard .
Green throwdown : Faster than a speeding bullet , San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed 's office sent us the news that his city is now considered America 's greenest .
At least Greentech Media says it is , citing Reed 's drive to bring 25,000 green tech jobs to San Jose , among other items in his 15 - year " Green Vision " program .
Special mentions go to Palo Alto , Berkeley , Greensburg , Kan. , and Gainesville , Fla .
San Francisco is little more than an afterthought in the online magazine 's list of 12 .
Its green cred : " More than half the city 's residents use public or alternative transportation to get to work . "
But has n't Mayor Gavin Newsomrepeatedly told us San Francisco is the greenest of them all ?
" With all due respect to other cities , San Francisco is much greener than everyone else on this list , " Nathan Ballard , Newsom 's spokesman , e-mailed me .
" Sure , mayors around the country have made a lot of pledges , but we have actually done the work . "
Ballard says the city ' srecord on green building , recycling and reducing greenhouse gases is second to none .
Newsom " would be more humble about it , " Ballard added .
Right .

Dark ( green ) horse :
It should be said that this is about the 984th " green cities " survey that has crossed our desk in oh , about the past three months , so one should n't treat it as gospel .
However , Reed , I 'm told , takes his ambition to be the green leader very seriously .
Thus , it was no surprise that he was on hand Monday at the ribbon - cutting on San Jose 's Santana Row for one of the first U.S. dealerships to sell Southern California - based Fisker Automotive 's plug - in hybrids .
Coulomb Technologies , headquartered in Campbell , was also on hand for the installation of one of its electric car - charging stations .
Newsom might humbly point out that San Francisco 's City Hall already has one of those .
Now if only Tesla Motors , flush with Daimler 's $ 50 million , would open a manufacturing plant , as it once said it would , in San Jose .
Satisfied customers :
Of all the banks in California , Oregon and Washington , San Francisco 's Bank of the West ranks highest in customer satisfaction , according to the latest J.D. Power and Associates survey .
That 's the second year in a row for Bank of the West , a subsidiary of France 's BNP Paribas , with branches in 19 Western and Midwestern states .
Not that California 's fifth - largest bank has escaped the woes of its peers .
It recorded an $ 85 million loss in the last quarter , mainly because it raised its reserves to cover loan losses , primarily commercial .
" Prudent management , " said bank spokesman John Stafford , pointing to a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.3 percent as an example of the bank 's sound fundamentals .
Bank deposits also grew 12 percent compared with a year earlier .

Down the hatch :
Here 's a money - raising idea for our budget - challenged leaders .
A 25 - cent per-drink increase in California 's alcohol tax .
Yes , it 's that dreaded TAX word , but the Marin Institute , San Rafael 's self - styled " alcohol industry watchdog , " says it would raise $ 3.4 billion .
A small recompense for the $ 38.4 billion the state lays out in connection with alcohol - related illnesses and lost productivity , according to the organization ( www.marininstitute.org).
Alcohol tax measures are floating around the Legislature , but their prospects are murky at best .
You may have noticed , however , that the Senate Finance Committee just voted for a federal excise tax on alcohol and " sugar - sweetened beverages " to help pay for President Obama 's health care reforms .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Chicago Tribune , the hometown newspaper of the bankrupt Tribune Co , cut 53 editorial employees , or about 11 percent of its newsroom staff , to save money and focus its efforts on local news .

The cuts bring the paper ’s newsroom team to about 430 people , according to a memo from Tribune Editor Gerould Kern .
That is down from about 670 more than three years ago , the Tribune reported in an article on its website on Wednesday .
Previous reports in the Chicago Sun-Times and Crain ’s Chicago Business had put the cuts at 20 percent of the newsroom staff .
A Chicago Tribune spokeswoman declined to say if the Tribune cut jobs outside the newsroom .
It is the latest round of layoffs to hit Tribune , which like many other U.S. newspapers is shedding staff and cutting other costs to survive an exodus of readers of their print editions , along with the advertisers who want to reach them .
“ This process comes with pain : 53 of our friends and colleagues will be leaving the Chicago Tribune as a consequence of changing priorities , ” Kern wrote in the memo .
The newspaper plans to expand its local news operation and establish a new “ watchdog unit ” to increase consumer and investigative coverage , Kern wrote .
Much of the shift involves online news , and Kern said the newspaper ’s digital staff was growing .
The Tribune competes in Chicago with another city daily , the Chicago Sun -Times .
Its parent company , Sun-Times Media Group , also is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
The cuts come during the quarterly financial results season for many companies , including newspapers .
Publishers such as USA Today owner Gannett Co Inc and The New York Times
Co have reported some of the worst declines in advertising revenue that U.S. newspapers have experienced .
This year has proven to be pivotal for the U.S. newspaper business .
Some big-city dailies , including EW Scripps Co ’s Rocky Mountain News , have closed .
Hearst Corp ’s Seattle Post - Intelligencer has stopped its print edition and has an online edition that is far smaller than the printed newspaper was .
Others , like the New York Times - owned Boston Globe and Hearst ’s San Francisco Chronicle , face the threat of shutdown .

The residents of the Carteret Islands have finally lost their long battle with global warming .
Sea levels have been rising for decades , crops no longer grow , and they ’re now left with no choice but to get out .
Dan Box reports :
The evacuation of the Carteret Islands have begun .
This morning I stood on black volcanic sand , pressed up right against the jungle , and watched a small white boat powered by a single outboard engine run in against the shore .
On board were five men from the Islands , the fathers of five families , who have come to finish building houses and gardens already begun in a cleared patch of jungle at Tinputz , on the east coast of Bougainville .
When these homes are ready the five will return to the Carterets , to fetch their wives and children back .
Life , they hope , will be better for them here .
On the Carterets , king tides have washed away their crops and rising sea levels poisoned those that remain with salt .
The people have been forced to move .
This is likely to become an increasingly common story over the upcoming decades , and while there are probably multiple causes , it ’s likely that global warming is one of the big ones .
We may be the ones causing most of the warming , but we ’re not the ones who will pay the biggest price .
A lot of space missions are poised for launch right now !
NASA has the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which will blast off no earlier than June 2 , and the Hubble servicing mission for the Space Shuttle Atlantis is now scheduled for launch on May 11 .
I 'll have lots more about that soon .
Herschel and Planck
The European Space Agency is n't exactly taking it easy , either : Herschel and Planck are two astronomy missions that will launch on a single Ariane 5 rocket on May 14th .
Herschel is a massive infrared telescopic observatory with a 3.5 meter mirror , by far the largest infrared observatory ever put in space .
It will look at far - infrared light , from 55 to 672 microns ( our eyes are sensitive to light out to roughly 0.7 microns , so this is way out in the IR ) .
For comparison , the awesome Spitzer telescope has a mirror 0.85 meters across , so Herschel will return incredible imagery of the sky .
I can't wait to see what it shows us !
Planck will map the entire sky at microwave frequencies , looking at the leftover radiation from the Big Bang .
The NASA satellite WMAP did this a few years back and answered many questions about the physics of the early Universe , but as we have to come to expect in science , any new observations will also raise even more questions .
Planck will have ten times the resolution that WMAP did , so it will see smaller features on the sky .
It 's also more sensitive than WMAP was , so it will see fainter features as well .
This means it may answer a lot of those questions WMAP raised .
Now get this : the Big Bang model is the best one we have to explain the origin of the Universe .
But it does not tell us about how that moment occurred .
Did the Universe get its start from a singular event , a quantum fluctuation in some larger metaverse ?
Are we the last in a series of past Big Bangs and recollapses ( the last because we 're pretty sure the cosmic expansion will go on forever this time ) ?
Are we here because two high - dimensional membranes collided ?
WMAP map of the microwave sky
These questions stretch our brains to the breaking point ... but the thing is , there is science here !
These different ideas predict different structures in the background glow leftover from the Big Bang .
WMAP saw many cooler and warmer spots on the sky in that microwave glow , equal numbers of them .
But some theories say we should see just a hair more cold spots .
WMAP did a fine job observing the sky , but it simply lacked the resolution to be able to see any asymmetries in the hot and cold spot numbers .
Planck may very well have the resolution needed to see that .
Do you understand the implications ?
We may be on the verge of determining if the origin of the Universe was a singular event , or if it was due to some other mechanism .
We 're on the edge of " holy crap ! " territory with this .
We have progressed from last century 's having no clue about how the cosmos got its start , to now possibly being able to get a handle on what happened before the Big Bang .
That 's why I love science !
Some people try to tell me that science will never answer the big questions we have in life .
To them I say : baloney !
The real problem is your questions are n't big enough .

Is Traditional Marriage On Its Last Legs ?
by Dan Eldridge
" ... It probably was n't so much the actual concept of marriage itself that rubbed me the wrong way .
Rather , it was the style in which so many American couples practice their marriages : with constant arguments , with disdain and loathing , and with cheating and lies .
... I 've been involved in an open relationship with my girlfriend for about two years now ....
My girlfriend and I both occasionally see other women .
Eventually we decided it might actually be , you know ... nice to make a public commitment to each other , and to share that moment with our families and close friends .
And after all , by that point we had both managed to admit to each other our respective desires to stay together forever .
And yet neither Carrie Ann 's opinion about traditional marriage , nor mine , had changed one bit :
We still were n't interested .
Nor were we interested in having a ceremony in a church , or on a beach , and we sure as hell were n't going to lay out $ 10,000 for a pile of cheap party favors , a photographer , and a big cake .
And that was when it hit us : Maybe we actually were on the road to inventing something special ....
When Carrie Ann spread the news to her family , she did n't pull any punches in her explanation of what it was that we wanted to do .
And what we wanted to do , essentially , was to have a small ceremony in a private place .
We wanted to publicly declare our love and our devotion to each other , and also our intention to remain together forever .
Afterwards , we planned to have a small party of some sort .
And that was it .
In other words , we wanted to go through the process of getting married , but without the inclusion of a priest , or anyone else who had the power vested in him by the State of Pennsylvania to proclaim us man and wife .
My own parents , when I tried to spell out the thought process behind our UnWedding , were understandably confused ....
Is traditional marriage really on its last legs these days ?
Hell , I do n't know .
But I do know this : Ideas and suggestions for couples interested in an alternative to life - long monogamy seem to be all around us in the 21st century .
I think that 's a good thing , and I think it ’s an honest way to begin a life - long partnership .
... While we may indeed be living in a freaky - deeky world , it ’s a heck of a lot easier to navigate — and a whole lot more fun — when you ’re living through it with a loving and devoted partner in crime .

The U.S. crossed a demographic boundary in 2007 .
The National Center for Health Statistics announced last month that for the first time , 40 % of babies born in the U.S. were born to unwed mothers .
The rate of unmarried births has zoomed up since 2002 , following several years of relative stability before then .
Here in the pleasant , liberal Massachusetts suburbs , people did n't believe the headline .
It was a typo , right ?
But out in Sarah Palin land , having babies without marriage has become almost the accepted norm .
You can blame some of it on abstinence - only sex education , or parents who can't talk about contraception , or scarcity of abortion providers , or lousy opportunities in life for many girls and women .
But among quite a few people ( especially in places like Massachusetts ) , the un-marriage trend is the result of deliberate , carefully considered choice .
And one reason is because " marriage " is supposed to mean " forsaking all others " forever after .
But it does n't have to be that way .
At YourTango.com ( successor tomagazine ) , columnist Dan Eldridge ruminates on his open relationship in a " Life Partnership " with someone who agrees with him that marriage stinks .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Robot fish developed by British scientists are to be released into the sea off north Spain to detect pollution .
If next year ’s trial of the first five robotic fish in the northern Spanish port of Gijon is successful , the team hopes they will be used in rivers , lakes and seas across the world .
The carp - shaped robots , costing 20,000 pounds ( $ 29,000 ) apiece , mimic the movement of real fish and are equipped with chemical sensors to sniff out potentially hazardous pollutants , such as leaks from vessels or underwater pipelines .
They will transmit the information back to shore using Wi -Fi technology .
Unlike earlier robotic fish , which needed remote controls , they will be able to navigate independently without any human interaction .
Rory Doyle , senior research scientist at engineering company BMT Group , which developed the robot fish with researchers at Essex University , said there were good reasons for making a fish - shaped robot , rather than a conventional mini-submarine .
“ In using robotic fish we are building on a design created by hundreds of millions of years ’ worth of evolution which is incredibly energy efficient , ” he said .

NPR has an interesting audio series on brain function , spiritual experience and the growing field of neurotheology .
It ’s takes a fairly broad brush approach and has audio , video , an interactive thingy , and plenty of supporting material .
You might get slightly annoyed at some of the section titles ( ‘ The God Chemical ’ , ‘ The God Spot ’ ) but there are some great little audio vignettes in there where people describe their spiritual experiences , whether they ’ve been caused by prayer or even psilocybin – the main active ingredient in magic mushrooms .
The project borders on the edge of being a bit hokey at times but it saved by the commentary and interviews with neuroscientists working in the area .
There ’s also a good article in June ’s Scientific American entitled ‘ Why People Believe Invisible Agents Control the World ’ which looks at the origin of belief in angels , demons , spirits and the like .

NYT columnist , and Nobel laureate in economics , Paul Krugman raises an interesting point about Blue Cross ’s new Harry and Louise type ads opposing health care reform :
“ We can do a lot better than a government - run health care system , ” says a voice - over in one of the ads .
To which the obvious response is , if that ’s true , why do n’t you ?
Why deny Americans the chance to reject government insurance if it ’s really that bad ?
For none of the reform proposals currently on the table would force people into a government - run insurance plan .
At most they would offer Americans the choice of buying into such a plan .
And the goal of the insurers is to deny Americans that choice .
They fear that many people would prefer a government plan to dealing with private insurance companies that , in the real world as opposed to the world of their ads , are more bureaucratic than any government agency , routinely deny clients their choice of doctor , and often refuse to pay for care .
Several brilliant points .
First , if Blue Cross says we can do better than a government option , then why does n’t Blue Cross do better ?
Why does Blue Cross ’s best , most expensive , plan only offer self - employed people , like me , a maximum of $ 1500 in prescription drugs a year ( which basically means you ’re dead if you get any serious illness ) ?
And why are n’t those benefits indexed to inflation – I get the same $ 1500 today that I got in 1997 when my plan started , even though my premiums are now 3 times higher .
Why did Blue Cross terrorize the widow of my high school Spanish teacher ?
Fernando Mendoza had insurance when doctors inserted a catheter to deliver his chemotherapy last July .
The procedure was covered by his HMO , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois .
But almost 10 months after Mendoza received the catheter–and nearly three months after he died of esophageal cancer–his widow continued to receive statements showing $ 1,743 was unpaid .
Thinking she was being billed , Suzanne Mendoza said she called Blue Cross several times and was told the doctor submitted the claim too late to be covered .
— Chicago Tribune , May 17 , 2006
Blue Cross can surely do better than that .
Second , and this is the crucial point , Blue Cross is saying that we should stop the government from giving you THE CHOICE to join a government plan that “ may , ” Blue Cross claims , ration out health care .
Well , if it ’s only a choice , and if in the end the new government option does n’t work , and ends up rationing health care , then none of us will choose the government option , and if we have already , we ’ll simply switch back to Blue Cross .
So what ’s the problem ?
Why does Blue Cross not even want you to HAVE that choice ?
That tells you much more about Blue Cross than it does Obama ’s health care plan .
It tells you that Blue Cross is afraid that you may like the government option .
And if you do , Blue Cross wo n’t make as much money .
Let me reiterate this .
If you do n’t like the government option , you can always stick with Blue Cross under Obama ’s plan .
So why is Blue Cross fighting Obama ’s plan ?
Because they ’re greedy special interests , and over your dead body they ’re going to permit the government to give you a better option .
Someone needs to start running ads showing Blue Cross terrorizing the wife of my deceased Spanish teacher .
Or ads showing Blue Cross slowly letting my prescription drug benefits wither on the vine .
Where are the hard hitting ads on our side ?
It ’s 1993 all over again .
And the left appears , yet again , to be playing far too nice .
First it was the emails , and the tweets .
This is all nonsense about the aporkalypse , surely ?
Just like with Sars , and bird flu , and MMR , is this all hype ?
The answer is no , but more interesting is this : for so many people , their very first assumption on the story is that the media are lying .
It is the story of the boy who cried wolf .
We are poorly equipped to think around issues involving risk , and infectious diseases epidemiology is a tricky business : the error margins on the models are wide , and it 's extremely hard to make clear predictions .
Here 's an example .
In Glasgow in the 1980s , less than 5 % of injecting drug users were HIV positive .
In Edinburgh at the same time , it was almost 50 % , even though these two places are only an hour apart by train .
Lots of people have got theories about why there should have been such a huge difference in the numbers of people infected , and there 's no doubt that it 's fun to try and come up with a plausible post hoc rationale .
But you certainly would n't have predicted it .
Maybe some bloke with HIV got off the train at Edinburgh station instead of Glasgow on a whim , some fateful day in the early 1980s .
Maybe there was a different culture among heroin users , or services .
Nobody really knows .
We face the same problem with swine flu .
All people have done is raise the possibility of things really kicking off , and they are right to do so , but we do n't have brilliantly accurate information .
Someone has said that up to 40 % of the world could be infected .
Is that scaremongering ?
Well it 's high , and I 'm sure it 's a bit of a guess , but maybe up to 40 % could be .
Annoying , is n't it , not to know .
Someone has said 120 million could die .
Well I suppose they could : I 'm sure it was done on the back of an envelope , by guessing how many would be infected , and what proportion would die , but I do n't think anyone 's pretending otherwise .
You could no more predict what will happen here than you could have predicted the enormous disparity in HIV prevalence between Glasgow and Edinburgh .
Everyone is just saying : we do n't know , it could be bad , and the newspapers are reporting that .
Sure there 's a bit of vaudeville in the headlines , but they 're not saying things that are wrong , and do you really know actual , real people , normally pretty solid , who are suddenly now panicking ?
By Tuesday , pundit - seekers from the media were suddenly contacting me , a massive nobody , to say that swine flu is all nonsense and hype , like some kind of blind , automated naysaying device .
" Will you come and talk about the media overhyping swine flu ? " asked Case Notes on Radio 4 .
No .
" We need someone to say it 's all been overhyped , " said BBC Wales .
I assumed they were adhering , robotically , to the " balance " template , but no : he kept at it , even when I protested and explained .
" Yeah , but you know , it could be like Sars and bird flu , they did n't materialise , they were hype . "
Simon Jenkins suggested the same thing .
It 's not true , I said .
They were risks , risks that did n't materialise , but they were still risks .
That 's what a risk is .
I 've never been hit by a car , but it 's not idiotic to think about it .
Simon Jenkins wo n't be right if nobody dies , he 'll be lucky , like the rest of us .
Do people think this flappily in casinos ?
The terrible truth is yes .
In the time that I have been writing this piece – no embellishment – I 've had similar calls off This Week at the BBC ( " Is the coverage misleading ? " ) , Al - Jazeera English ( " We wanted to talk to someone on the other side , you know , challenging the fear factor " ) , the Richard Bacon Show on Five Live ( " Is it another media scare like Sars and bird flu ? " ) and many more .
I 'm not showing off .
I know I 'm a D - list public intellectual , but I just think it 's interesting : because not only have the public lost all faith in the media ; not only do so many people assume , now , that they are being misled ; but more than that , the media themselves have lost all confidence in their own ability to give us the facts .
There 's so much life around the farm this time of year , so many small animals just learning what it means to be alive .
Out here , you 're just surrounded by it , one soul among many , and even at night when things wind down and the sounds drop to their quietest , you can still feel it .
It 's beautiful , it 's surreal .
I would n't trade a life on a farm for a life anywhere else .
Informed debate is a crucial part of public policy development .
But the behind - the - scenes tug of war between banks and the government over the results of their recent stress tests strains the already tenuous credibility of the exercise .
It also shows that banks have become too powerful .
How so ?
First , banks and their regulators run stress tests all the time , on individual products , divisions and the institutions as a whole .
Without them , it would be very difficult to manage risk or allocate capital among business lines .
The current crisis proved these tests were inadequate  or in some cases , ignored by bank managers .
But that ’s largely because of management incentives to take excessive risks , and the failure of the tests to use sufficiently grim projections .
So it ’s curious that regulators have put so much stock in the tests they announced in February .
The release of their results has been delayed while banks ask for clemency .
Since the results will determine which institutions will be forced to raise private capital or take further government infusions , the stakes are high .
But like the banks ’ earlier and insufficiently stressful stress tests , the government ’s worst - case outlooks are n’t all that far - fetched .
They also use banks ’ own estimates , meaning unscrupulous managers could tweak them to get a better grade .
And bankers say they ’ll produce very little information that regulators do n’t already have .
In the pre-modern era , there was no distinction between sciences and the arts .
They were intertwined enterprises .
In his famous 1959 Rede lecture at Cambridge University CP Snow lamented the fact that , as a result of increasing specialisation , they now occupied entirely different spheres .
This set off a debate that has been raging ever since .
But in recent years it ’s taken some odd twists .
Science , even among the most literary and philosophical of public intellectuals , has taken ascendancy over the arts as the more dominant discipline .
And Snow ’s two cultures have been replaced by a new dichotomy – between science and religion .
Meanwhile the humanities , floundering somewhere in between , are in danger of being lost in the maelstrom .
In that first , ground - breaking lecture , Snow condemned scientists for their “ self impoverishment ” which resulted from their dismissal of the literary and artistic culture , and then denounced members of the literati for being Luddite in their attitude to science .
His argument was ostensibly a plea for intellectual unity and educational reform .
At times , however , his complaint about the two - cultures - divide became particularly a complaint about the lack of public understanding of science .
He wrote : “ A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who , by the standards of the traditional culture , are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists .
Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
The response was cold : it was also negative .
Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of : Have you read a work of Shakespeare’s ? ”
Although the response to Snow ’s lecture was mostly positive , this asymmetry in his argument prompted the literary critic FR Leavis to label Snow a “ public relations man ” for the scientific establishment , and the row between them continued for a decade .
The argument between Snow and Leavis was just one strand in the extensive debate over the “ two cultures ” thesis which followed Snow ’s lecture .
Was the divide being bridged , or was it getting ever wider ?
Were the arts or the sciences more dominant in wider society ?
Eventually the debate erupted into open warfare .
In 1975 , the biologist EO Wilson published Sociobiology : The Synthesis , which introduced neo-Darwinian theories of human behaviour to a general readership .
Inspired by this landmark study , the biologist Richard Dawkins , the linguist Stephen Pinker and the philosopher Daniel Dennett launched a series of incursions into the humanities , in books such as The Selfish Gene ( 1976 ) , The Language Instinct ( 1994 ) and Darwin ’s Dangerous Idea ( 1995 ) .
They claimed that our genes and the instincts of our hunter - gatherer ancestors could explain diverse aspects of human behaviour , from our choice of partner to our ability to appreciate classical music .
Upbringing , class , education , culture and taste – all these influences were considered secondary to the biological template we had inherited .
“ We are survival machines , ” wrote Dawkins , “ robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes . ”
And according to Dennett , “ A scholar is just a library ’s way of making another library . ”
With the rise of cognitive neuroscience , the hard - wiring of our brains was now offered alongside genes as a predetermining influence on our lives .
But the arguments were the same : the privileging of nature over nurture .
The humanities launched a counter - insurgency .
Sociologists , psychoanalysts and literary critics argued that it was our environment , rather than our genetic or neurological hardware , that made us who we were .
These critics accused the sociobiologists of relying on shaky empiricism and circular “ Just So ” causality , and they called attention to the atavistic and retrograde character of many of the sociobiologists ’ claims ; most notoriously the notion that men are predisposed to rape women .
They were helped along by Richard Lewontin and Steven Jay Gould , two biologists who opposed the essentialism of evolutionary psychology ; Lewontin wrote a series of essays for the New York Review of Books during the ’80s and ’90s which were published in 2000 under the title It Ain’t Necessarily So : The Dream of the Human Genome and Other Illusions .
Other critics accused the evolutionary psychologists of concealing a tendentious political agenda beneath what were presented as objective empirical observations .
After all , they argued , science ’s claim to unmediated enquiry was compromised by the fact that scientists were , like everyone else , working with the grubby tools of language and culture .
“ Science studies ” developed as an interdisciplinary field that situated scientific research in the context of history and society .
At the same time , cultural studies and critical theory advocates began enthusiastically and – in their scientific critics ’ eyes indiscriminately – to draw upon the languages of particle physics and cybernetics .
Sadie Plant founded the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at the University of Warwick and Donna Haraway wrote her “ Cyborg Manifesto ” .
Many scientists regarded all this as uninformed and modish appropriation .
This particular phase of the science –humanities debates became known as the Science Wars , which reached a climax in 1996 when Alan Sokal , an American physicist , fabricated an article out of postmodernist pastiche and successfully submitted it for publication in the journal Social Text .
For Sokal and his supporters , this stunt represented a resounding victory for real science .
The science –humanities debates were dogged at times by mutual misunderstandings and Punch - and - Judy stereotypes , but at their height they brilliantly illustrated the competing merits of the two conceptual approaches .
But science ’s aggressive inroads into the humanities took their toll .
Lewis Wolpert , Jared Diamond and others claimed not only that science rivalled the humanities , but that it could do away with the humanities altogether .
“ Art works because it appeals to certain faculties of the mind , ” wrote Pinker in his essay “ A Biological Understanding of Human Nature ” .
“ Music depends on details of the auditory system , painting and sculpture on the visual system .
Poetry and literature depend on language . ”
The humanities receded from battle , cowed by the reductive power of scientific fundamentalism , embarrassed by the now unfashionable discursiveness of literary and sociological theory , and paralysed by a quandary over the question of where value in humanities research actually resides .
In short , science won ; and as a consequence , the science –humanities debates have all but disappeared in recent years .
The general public may be woefully ignorant of actual science , but a quasi- scientific mindset has taken hold in the media and public debate .
In January , a team of evolutionary psychologists from the University of Missouri published research claiming that Victorian novels , with their emphasis on morality , duty and community , helped to spread altruistic genes throughout 19th - century society .
Their findings were reported without scepticism in the British press .
Scientists regularly bemoan the absence of their colleagues on cultural television programmes , but their sense of being left out of the public conversation blinds them to the ubiquitous presence of a new scientism which dictates that every piece of scientific research is uncritically accepted as truth .
It is the public ’s craving for truth , amidst crumbling traditions and certainties , that also accounts for the current resurgence of religion .
Science , humanities and religion are all rival approaches to explaining the world .
But having triumphed over the humanities , and with religion on the rise , science has trained its sights on religion as its new enemy .
This transition is particularly easy to make since many scientists lump the humanities and religion together as wishy - washy in their minds .
But science ’s war on religion is futile .
Science has not only attacked religion ; it has forced it , as it did the humanities , to adopt its own terms .
As books such as God : The Failed Hypothesis by the physicist Victor Stenger and Dennett ’s Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon illustrate , science opposes religion on the basis of fact and evidence .
The pseudo - scientific Intelligent Design argument is one consequence of this , and the insertion of the word “ probably ” into the atheist bus advertisements is another .
But neither side is able either to prove its own case or to disprove the other ’s , and certainly not in a manner that their opponent would be prepared to concede .
As the large number of religious scientists and science teachers illustrates , the opposition is a false dichotomy .
Science and religion are simply different languages , discourses , genres : a case of apples and pears .
Religion is about belief , and science is about testing hypotheses .
Science does n’t have the conceptual language to deconstruct religion , just as religion does n’t have the methodological tools to criticise science .
The inability of either side to win the argument is the reason why it rages tediously on .
The most effective opponent of religion is not science but the humanities .
The humanities can help us move beyond the current redundant debate , because they understand concepts of language , discourse and genre , and are able to compare the two opposing enterprises philosophically .
They have the analytical wherewithal to account for the growth of biblical literalism and scientific fundamentalism .
The humanities are powerful allies of secularism , with their ability to critique the rise of religion historically , politically and culturally .
The fact that research in the sociology of religion has revealed significant variations in religious belief according to gender , race and socio- economic status shows that understanding why particular groups of people are more inclined towards religion than others is a far more potent way of deconstructing adherence to faith than simply telling everyone that God does n’t exist .
We need to recall why we valued the humanities in the first place and to renew our commitment to their incisive , sophisticated and subtle approach .
The old - fashioned literary critics of CP Snow ’s time had a tendency to believe that the point of the humanities was to mine the arts – in particular canonical literature – for material with which to make sonorous and ultimately banal pronouncements on “ the human condition ” .
But the humanities have undergone a revolution since the 1950s .
Literary criticism , critical theory , sociology and cultural studies have evolved into rigorous and systematic tools of enquiry .
The humanities have since Classical times denoted a broad field of study including language , literature and history .
That field is now extraordinarily rich .
History employs a range of historiographical approaches to distinguishing the ways in which we are and are not products of the past .
Sociology and cultural studies not only describe but also account for the ways we organise and perceive the world .
Literary criticism teaches us how to read advertisments and political speeches alongside fiction and poetry .
Psychoanalysis reminds us that despite the attractively straightforward insights of Darwinism , we are still in the grip of self - delusion .
Some of the more technical branches of critical theory may merit a measure of Sokal ’s satire .
But it is lamentable that scientists routinely take no account of these developments , entitling themselves to a vision of the humanities that is stuck in the 1950s , and believing that joining a book group or attending the theatre is essentially all that ’s involved : that “ doing the humanities ” is , in other words , a matter of pleasure and appreciation .
With scientists failing to halt the rise of blind faith and unreason we need to employ the critical and analytical approaches which the humanities provide , because where religion is concerned , the empirical method is not yielding results .

HOW TO HAVE YOUR TEETH DRILLED WITHOUT NOVOCAIN ( OR GAS )
By George Rohrbacher , NORML Board of Directors , medical marijuana patient Science and medicine run deep in my family .
My dad and an uncle had Ph.D.s in parasitology and pathology .
My dad ’s dad was an M.D. Grandpa met my grandmother when they were both attending medical school at the Univ. of California , in 1915 .
My grandma ’s grandmother learned surgical nursing during the Civil War and afterward was the “ doctor ” for Oroville , California for many years .
My mother , brother , and several aunts are all Registered Nurses .
For at least five generations , our family has been committed to science and healing .
It is from this perspective that I view marijuana as a medicine .
Like most Americans , I discovered marijuana as a medicine quite by accident .
60 - years old , I ’ve used pot for over 41 years simply because it makes me feel good .
I like it .
But who would have ever guessed cannabis was actually helping me stay healthy at the same time ?
A ‘ bad back ’ is one of medicine ’s most oft heard adult complaints , and during my 35 - years of farming and ranching , my body has written many a check my back could n’t cash .
Sometimes my back has hurt so bad that if I got down on the floor , I could n’t get up without help .
In the end , after trying numerous back treatments , I found that just plain walking and stretching was the best way to deal with my lower back pain , that is , walking and stretching while consuming marijuana .
I had first bunched these activities together so as to allow me to get my hurting back “ walked out ” , and at the same time , I had the privacy to smoke a little pot out of the sight of my growing children .
I soon found that walking and stretching while using cannabis was many times more effective for treating my back pain than just walking without it !
Marijuana seemed to relax my muscles , reduce spasms and inflammation .
When I later became acquainted with the scientific research on this subject , I found out that was exactly what cannabis , and its cannabinoids , had been doing for my body all along .
Decades of splitting firewood , pounding fence posts and other such farm work has left me with two ruptured discs in my neck and numbness and pain that sometimes plagues my hands and fingers .
Nasty .
Sometimes , very , very nasty .
Cannabis helps control the pain from these pinched nerves and cannabis helps me sleep at night without killing my liver or kidneys , without causing gastric distress or constipation , and without damaging my sex drive or good humor .
Cannabis helps me pursue my non-surgical options , while at the same time it reduces inflammation and muscle soreness from my on - going activities .
Along with the work - related injuries , I am also a walking encyclopedia of old football injuries , some that still have me hobbling around , four decades after the last touchdown .
I ’m a big guy , played defensive tackle and lacrosse , too .
I loved banging heads .
In the process , I ’ve separated a shoulder , had a major knee operation and sprained both ankles numerous times .
But , am I standing in line for a knee or hip replacement like my no -pot using baby sister or brother - in - law ?
NOPE !
Why no replacements of my damaged joints ?
I honestly think it ’s because of the four decades of cannabis use that I can still walk five miles every day on my banged - up knee and ankles without any pain or inflammation .
As it turns out , even the cartilage in one ’s joints has cannabinoid receptor sites .
Oh yes , sure a dislocated ankle really hurts , but for a real front - row seat to the world of pain , there is nothing like a migraine headache .
I am one of the unfortunate millions of Americans who have diet - triggered migraine headaches .
But fortunately , over the years , I ’ve rooted out my dietary ‘ triggers ’ , which include : chocolate , red wine , aged cheese , soy sauce , …and now , I rarely have a migraine anymore .
I avoid those triggers like the plague .
But in my medicine chest , just in case , to help me deal with one of those aura - producing , skull - splitting migraine headaches that still lurk along life ’s path , marijuana is an essential medicine .
Almost instant migraine relief is possible for me with vaporized or smoked cannabis .
In late January , this past winter , we had a freezing fog that glazed - over everything for miles around .
I took a dramatic fall on the ice and landed flat on the back of my ass .
Both feet went out from under me so quickly I had not even gotten an elbow or finger down to help break my fall onto the ice - covered concrete slab .
Well , at least I had n’t cracked my head , I thought , as I lay there on my back on the ice , testing for broken bones .
Slowly I started to move .
Yup , I was OK .
No broken hip , thank God — just the start of one very , very sore ass from taking the full impact of that drop onto the ice - glazed concrete .
I crawled back into the house , went directly to our freezer , and took out a double dose of my special medical marijuana spice cake .
About an hour - and - a - half later , my wife and I walked out the door on the start of a slow , but enjoyable , three - mile hike .
My pelvis was very sore but , with the cannabis properly applied , it was good to go .
I repeated this treatment every day for the next week , cannabis edibles and walking .
As my bruised butt was healing , I went to see my dentist for a check - up .
He looked into my mouth and said I needed a filling , “ Nothing too major . ”
Fortunately I was prepared ; I had taken a good dose of my cannabis edibles an hour or so before my appointment , to allow me to sit , despite my injury , without discomfort in the dentist ’s chair .
I said to my dentist , “ No Novocain today , Doc . ”
He nodded and started to prepare his drill .
He ’d seen me do this before .
Cannabinoid receptor sites are primarily in the peripheral nervous system .
As cannabis calms the underlying causes of most back pain , the inflammation and tightness of the muscles , the cannabinoids also act on the peripheral nervous system to modulate the pain messages transmitted to the major nerves .
The pain from tooth drilling is a bit different , that kind of pain is hard - wired directly into the brain .
Cannabis does n’t block that pain so much as helps a person to simply look past the pain and ignore it .
In having one ’s teeth drilled , due to the fear of pain , virtually everyone trades a very few moments of serious pain from the drilling , for about two hours of having one ’s face defrost from the jaw - numbing shot of Novocain .
I said , “ No Novocain for me today , Doc , ” because I chose the pain , knowing medical marijuana would help me overcome it .
Here ’s how :
Take cannabis edibles an hour or two before you are to sit in the dentist ’s chair .
Not flinching while the dentist is drilling your teeth is a big job .
You must lie there absolutely still , melted into the chair , immobile .
Cannabis is very useful in this process , not so much to block the high - voltage pain from the tooth drilling , but to help your mind reach the meditative state to deflect that pain , so you can let the pain flow over you like water .
Think of your time in that dentist ’s chair like body surfing in big waves .
When a crusher wave comes in , you must dive down deep , hold your breath , and let it roll over you .
When it ’s safe , you can come up again for air .
The ocean is too big to fight ; you have to hold on until the wave passes .
And , it ’s the very same thing having your teeth drilled without gas or Novocain .
The very second the drilling stops , that tooth pain stops , as well , and you can safely come up for air .
With modern high - speed dental drills , the actual total number of seconds of real pain are quite few , providing the excavation is n’t the Grand Canyon ( your dentist can help you judge ) .
So , just relax , it ’s really not that bad , roll your eyes back , and let her rip !
With a little pot spice cake behind you , you ’ll be quite surprised , you can handle it !
And , it ’s only going to hurt for a few seconds , anyway .
Afterward , when the drilling ’s all done , putting in the filling does n’t hurt a bit .
One very nice thing about dentistry without Novocain is you always get the occlusion right , the first time , everytime , because you can actually feel your mouth when the dentist tells you to bite down , and asks , “ Is the new filling too high or low ? ”
And then , when the dentist takes off your dental bib , it ’s all over ; it is really totally over — no frosted face , no needle marks in your gums , nothing else to recover from .
Without the Novocain shot as part of your dental work , you can walk out of your dentist ’s office pain - free after a filling , your cannabis edibles still kicked in , whistling your favorite tune !
Now , you try doing that for the next hour or two with your face and lower lip de-frosting from the Novocain !
I ’ve been using cannabis as a medicine for over 30 years , 5 years legally .
Washington State ’s voters gave me the right to use marijuana as a medicine in 1998 ; I got my doctor ’s recommendation in ‘ 04 .
President Obama ’s Justice Department has said the Feds will no longer interfere with Washington State law in this area .
Decades of worry and paranoia , the fear of a SWAT Team , with their guns drawn , bursting through our front door in the middle of the night , bringing drug dogs to search for my medicine has abated , at least for now .
Help NORML end America ’s marijuana prohibition for good .
Achieving proper titration :
In the words of the DEA ’s own Chief Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young : “ Marijuana , in its natural form , is one of the safest therapeutically active substances know to man … ”
Advances in technology have come in all areas of modern life and making marijuana use even safer is no exception !
In the last five years , I have all but given up smoking pot in favor of using a vaporizer — it ’s clean and very tasty , with no tars or fire - created carcinogens — although for mobility and socialization it will always be hard to replace a joint .
Achieving proper dosing levels using a vaporizer or smoking is quite easy , full effects are seen in about ten minutes and last about an hour - and - a - half before declining .
Homemade cannabis edibles take about 20 - 40 minutes to kick - in , a lot depending on what else is in your stomach , and some experimentation is needed to find the proper dosing levels ; but for long term , high - dose pain relief , edibles are hard to beat .
Irvin Rosenfeld , America ’s longest surviving Federal cannabis patient , has been receiving federally - grown pot for 27 years .
Irv finds smoked pot works best for him .
He consumes 10 - to - 15 joints a day to deal with the challenges of living with a rare form of bone tumors that has afflicted him since childhood .
A stockbroker handling millions of dollars in transactions , Irv has said he never feels a “ high ” from using marijuana , even though he uses it all day long .
About two years ago , when the pinched nerves in my neck were acting their very worst , I began using cannabis at dosing levels where pot ’s marvelous , fun and useful psycho-active effects started disappearing for me as well .
Damn , it ’s the shits to be that sick !
Thank goodness , I ’m better now .

" The open , realtime discussions that occur on FriendFeed , " he says , " are going to become a major new communication medium on the same level as email , IM and blogging . "
That 's a pretty ambitious claim , but Buchheit has the credibility to make it .
The Early Days at Google
When Paul Buchheit was in college in the mid to late 90's , he spent time working at both Microsoft and Sun .
He classifies Microsoft as being in the " Religious Institutions Industry " on his Linked In profile , which is pretty funny .
After graduating he joined Intel for a year and then became the 23rd employee at Google .
He joined Google just 3 months after the company moved out of the garage of someone 's house and he stayed there for the next seven years .
Buchheit left Google in the middle of 2006 , in between the launch of Google Video and the acquisition of YouTube .
Those probably were n't of any concern to him , though .
The same high stock price that made it possible for Google to pay the equivalent of $ 1.65 billion for YouTube presumably made the company 's 23rd employee , Buchheit , a very wealthy man .
Fast Forward to FriendFeed
Now Paul Buchheit is investing in new startups and has co-founded one of his own .
FriendFeed is a fascinating combination of a. ) an aggregation tool bringing information in from all around the web , b. ) a big public conversation and c. ) a publishing tool for original content .
The service pulls in data from all the different social networks you tell it that you participate in , allowing your FriendFeed friends to see and discuss your activities on those networks whether they happen to participate in them or not .
For example , I do n't participate actively in the blog commenting network Disqus but Fred Wilson does .
I follow Fred on FriendFeed , where he imports his Disqus comments automatically , so I can see and discuss that information on FriendFeed .
There 's a long list of services that FriendFeed can import data from , from social bookmarking to YouTube favorites , but the majority of what goes on at the site is conversation about Twitter messages .
The FriendFeed team regularly rolls out new features faster than you can say " cross - platform microblogging aggregation , " but those cool features have n't led to widespread adoption of the service yet .
As tech blogger Michael Arrington points out , " the fact is that FriendFeed may just be too complicated for the average user to quickly understand ...
The power users love it .
Novices can be overwhelmed . "
Facebook also regularly implements the innovative features that FriendFeed comes up with and that certainly does n't help FriendFeed 's market share .
If you want to dive deep into the nitty gritty of how FriendFeed works , our podcast interview with Buchheit and co-founder Bret Taylor from more than a year ago remains one of the best ways to do so .
FriendFeed - Now !
This week FriendFeed pushed forward a radical redesign of the site based on a beta version it had been testing for just under a month .
The biggest changes were a new look and , most importantly , a real - time flow of information .
Using a technology that Buchheit created in October called Long Polling , FriendFeed now streams all the information it finds from your friends down the page , just as soon as it finds it .
David Chartier at ArsTechnica called the new version " more engaging and interactive . "
Dave Winer , one of the first movers in blogging , a key player in content syndication technologies and a big fan of FriendFeed , offered much harsher feedback .
" I wonder if anyone uses the new FriendFeed for any serious purpose , " has asked , on FriendFeed .
" Before I finish reading something , it 's scrolled off , replaced by the next thing .
Feeding the whole write - only - ness of the medium .
I anticipate even more mindless comments based on not having read the thing they 're commenting on .
Now they have an excuse . "
Other power users have had a laundry list of other complaints .
The simplified interface lost some of the most compelling features and made others harder to find .
The service used to offer interesting data analysis like " who you find most interesting " and " who finds you most interesting . "
Those options seem to be gone .
Buchheit told us that he believes " the appearance of our new interface is loved by many , and hated by others .
Most people are probably somewhere in the middle . "
Is Real Time The Next Gmail ?
Many social networking sites are moving towards real time information delivery instead of requiring page advancement or refreshing to find out what 's new .
A year ago we called the real time nexus of Seesmic and Twhirl a vision of the future of the web .
Twitter integrated real time search in February .
Facebook made its newsfeed real time last month .
Bleeding - edge media sharing network Enjoysthin.gs goes so far as to offer a real time view of activity only to paid members of its site !
Buchheit explains the paradigm 's appeal :
" Realtime is often an easier and more efficient way of communicating because an entire conversation can happen in a matter of minutes or seconds .
It 's similar to the difference between a phone call and a series of voice mails -- the phone call occurs in realtime so the entire conversation can often be concluded very quickly .
It 's also critical for timely information -- for example , on our internal FriendFeed group I may post a message about running an update on the live system , and it 's important that everyone see that message immediately .
One of the advantages of FriendFeed over other realtime systems such as IM is that it also works non-realtime .
For example , at the end of the day I 'll often browse my " best of day " view to see what the top stories and discussions of the day were . "
That makes sense to me .
Though real time conversations can feel overwhelming , the pause button on the Friend Feed site should help and in time I expect we 'll all get used to it .
There was a time when I felt totally overwhelmed by Twitter , and the discovery of what RSS feeds can deliver to a feed reader left me in a daze for weeks ( and led to a new career ) .
Enterprise adoption of real time communication in general and FriendFeed in particular is also a topic that some people are discussing .
Sameer Patel has written a lengthy article exploring the potential for using FriendFeed in the enterprise and we 've heard of several companies using the service as a lightweight intranet .
The Future of FriendFeed
Things are changing fast at FriendFeed .
Buchheit says that the company believes aggregation to be less important than real time conversation .
" The open , realtime discussions that occur on FriendFeed are going to become a major new communication medium on the same level as email , IM and blogging .
The aggregation component of FriendFeed is a convinient feature and a component of that openness , but not as central as the discussions . "
People have complained for some time that all the different sources of information and long list of features make the service confusing for new users .
Tackling that problem was a key element of the new redesign .
" It 's very important that new users can look at the product and immediately understand what 's going on and how to use it , " Buchheit told us .
" The new User Interface is much more straightforward because all they see is a list of messages and comments from friends , and a box for posting new things .
Over time they are able to discover other features ( such as groups , saved searches , imported feed , etc ) , but those things are n't part of the initial experience . "
Many early adopters of the service really do n't like what the company has done with its website .
Buchheit says that they will soon have far more control over customizing the experience .
" Visual design is clearly a very personal thing -- the appearance of our new interface is loved by many , and hated by others ( though most people are probably somewhere in the middle ) .
This is why one of the goals of the new design was to accomodate skinning / themes .
We do n't yet know the exact timing of the release , but we hope to have a version 1 of themes available in a matter of weeks . "
The Big Picture
So here 's a summary .
The father of the best web email program on the planet believes that a real - time streaming interface for simplified aggregation of conversation and content from all around the web is going to join the handful of tools we use regularly , like email , IM and blogging .
The biggest question still remaining ?
Facebook .
Buchheit on Facebook :
" Facebook is still very much a closed world of its own .
That 's sometimes useful , but other times I want the ability to interact with the outside world and also other systems .
For example , if I post something on FriendFeed about a product that I 'm using , often someone working on that product ( or very knowledeable about it ) will join in on the conversation .
That kind of things can't happen on Facebook .
[ Because cross -site search is limited by default privacy restrictions .
- ed. ]
FriendFeed also interoperates much more smoothly with other systems , so I can easily import my blog posts , receive updates via email or IM , or post messages on to Twitter .
Things I post on Facebook are not allowed to leave Facebook ( except under very strict terms that require deletion within 24 hours , which is why clients such as Seesmic can interface with it , but services such as FriendFeed have a harder time ) . "
Do you buy that ?
I 'm not sure .
But if anyone can lead the charge against incumbent technologies with a new paradigm that combines powerful richness and ease of use - Paul Buchheit might be that person .
He did it with Gmail , now time will tell if he can do it with FriendFeed .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The U.S. economy contracted violently again in the first quarter of the year as business investment declined at a record rate , the Commerce Department reported Wednesday .
Real gross domestic product -- the inflation - adjusted , seasonally adjusted value of all goods and services produced in the United States -- fell at a 6.1 % annualized rate in the first quarter , nearly matching the 6.3 % decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Read the full report .
Despite the disastrous results , many economists said the report hinted that the worst of the declines may be over .
The data on investment " have a capitulatory feel to them , " said Stephen Stanley , chief economist for RBS Securities .
The two - quarter contraction was the worst in more than 50 years .
Since 1947 , the economy had never contracted by more than 5 % for two consecutive quarters .
With a 0.5 % drop in the third quarter of 2008 , it 's the first time the economy has contracted for three consecutive quarters since 1975 .
In the past four quarters , the economy has fallen 2.6 % , the biggest year - over - year decline since 1982 .
The big story for the first quarter was in the business sector , where firms halted new investments , and shed workers and inventories at a dizzying pace to bring down production and stockpiles to match the lower demand from U.S. and foreign markets .
" The traditional patterns of a business cycle are emerging , " wrote John Silvia , chief economist for Wachovia .
" After a sharp decline in demand in the fourth quarter we are now witnessing the inventory correction .
Ahead is rising demand and recovery at a slower , but still positive , pace . "
The 6.1 % decline in GDP was larger than the 5.1 % contraction expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
Economists expect a 2 % decline in the current quarter , followed by a tepid 1 % gain in the third quarter , as the massive stimulus from Congress and the Federal Reserve kicks in .
See Economic Preview .
Although the decline in GDP in the first quarter was nearly as deep as in the fourth quarter , the report was more varied in tone , with some positives mixed with some record - setting declines .
Much of the drop was due to a large inventory correction , which is helping to rebalance supply and demand and is setting the stage for at least a modest recovery .
The decline in inventories , while large , was less than expected , said economists for Bank of America 's Merrill Lynch .
" Businesses will need to slash far more inventories in the months to come . "
Another economist said the adjustments are well along .
" Businesses have not only cut back aggressively on inventories , but also on business fixed investment , " wrote Harm Bandholz , economist for UniCredit Markets .
" And the size of the declines suggests that the adjustments in these areas have largely been made during the last couple of months . "
The boost in consumer spending probably is n't sustainable , said economists for RDQ Economics , but they still see stabilization in the second half of the year .
Details
Final sales , which exclude inventories , fell at a 3.4 % rate in the first quarter after plunging 6.2 % in the fourth quarter .
Consumer spending rebounded to rise 2.2 % after dropping at a 4 % annual pace in the previous two quarters .
Consumer spending added 1.5 percentage points to GDP .
Spending on durable goods rose 9.4 % , spending on nondurable goods rose 1.3 % , and spending on services increased 1.5 % .
Despite the bump in spending , the savings rate rose to 4.2 % , the most since 1998 .
Real disposable income rose 6.2 % .
Business investments fell at a record 37.9 % annual rate in the first quarter .
Investments in structures dropped a record 44.2 % , and investments in equipment and software fell at a 33.8 % pace , the biggest drop since 1958 .
Business fixed investment subtracted 4.7 percentage points from growth .
Inventories declined by $ 103.7 billion .
The change in inventories subtracted 2.8 percentage points from growth .
Investments in housing fell for the 13th consecutive quarter , dropping at a 38 % annual rate , the largest decline since 1980 .
Residential investments subtracted 1.4 percentage points from growth .
Trade collapsed during the quarter .
Exports fell 30 % , the most in 40 years , reflecting the global recession that is hitting Europe , Japan and other trading partners even harder than the United States .
Imports dropped 34.1 % , the most in 34 years , as U.S. consumers and businesses stopped buying .
Net exports added 2 percentage points to growth , however , as the trade gap narrowed .
Final sales to domestic purchasers - a measure of domestic demand - fell 5.1 % after dropping 5.8 % in the fourth quarter .
Government spending fell at a 3.9 % annual pace , the largest drop in 13 years .
Spending by state and local governments fell 3.9 % , the most since 1981 .
Federal spending fell 4 % , including a 6.2 % drop in the volatile defense spending category .
Government spending subtracted 0.8 percentage points from growth .
The price index for domestic purchases ( prices paid by U.S. residents ) fell 1 % in the quarter .
Consumer prices fell 1 % , while core consumer prices ( which exclude food and energy ) rose 1.5 % .
In current dollar terms , GDP fell 3.5 % to at annual rate of $ 14.01 trillion .
On the basis of the above considerations , the biological specificity , and hence the fidelity , of the Pol II initiation machinery can be estimated .
There are 2,000 nucleotides or potential mRNA initiation sites at an average yeast gene ( 6,000 yeast genes in a 12 - megabase genome ) .
Given 10 % correct initiation events , initiation from a single correct site in an average gene is 200 - fold more likely than from an average position , although incorrect initiation will not occur equally at all sites ...
Interestingly , this specificity factor is comparable to that observed for typical sequence - specific DNA - binding proteins binding a high - affinity site , as compared with a nonspecific site .
This level of fidelity is also similar to the frequency at which incorrect nucleotides or amino acids are incorporated into growing polymers of RNA and protein , although it is far below the 10 - 8 - fold specificity seen for DNA replication , which depends on proofreading mechanisms .
Thus , Pol II initiation from correct promoters seems to be rather error - prone , with a level of fidelity that is roughly comparable to those of other biological processes that are considered to be specific .
Almost 30 years ago , Gould and Lewontin launched a crusade against the adaptive paradigm that functional differences must be adaptive , that is , caused by natural selection .
Although their arguments were controversial at the time , they have been highly influential on the community of evolutionary biologists .
As a new generation of biologists with a background in genomics , molecular biology or bioinformatics has taken leadership in the field of genomic evolutionary biology , the old lessons from Gould and Lewontin seem to have been forgotten .
It is a desirable addition to a story of selection to identify possible functional reasons why selection might be acting , but it will never be a method for identifying or verifying selection .
Many physicists , engineers and computer scientists , and some cell and developmental biologists , are convinced that biological networks exhibit properties that could only be products of natural selection ; however , the matter has rarely been examined in the context of well - established evolutionary principles ...
Although contrarian in tone , the models presented here provide the seeds for the development of biologically realistic null hypotheses for the origins of pathway complexity , a tool that many feel is essential to the development of a rigorous theory for network evolution .
If we are to be confident that the architectural features of genetic networks are advanced by natural selection , it should be possible to formally reject the possibility of neutral evolution .
There is room for disagreement with what constitutes an appropriate null model for network evolution but , given that evolution is a population - level process , we start with the assumption that any such model must incorporate the fundamental principles of population genetics .
Such an approach is a significant departure from most previous work in this area .
Rather than advocating universal utility for retrotransposons , we instead suggest that they contain active promoters and that at least some of these are functional .
The high frequency of retrotransposons in mammalian genomes ensures the concurrence of many thousands of well - expressed retrotransposon promoters proximal to protein - coding genes , with widespread effects upon the regulation and evolution of those genes .
With hot , new technologies , biologists are taking higher - resolution snapshots of what 's going on inside the cell , but the results are stirring up controversy .
One of the most interesting recent discoveries is that transcription is everywhere : DNA is transcribed into RNA all over the genome , even DNA that has long been thought to have a non-functional role .
What is all of this transcription for ?
Does the ' dark matter ' of the genome have some cryptic , undiscovered function ?
Unfortunately , in all of the excitement over possible new functions , many biologists have forgotten how to frame a null hypothesis - the default scenario that you expect to see if there is no function to this transcribed DNA .
As a result , the literature is teeming with wild , implausible speculation about how our excess DNA might be beneficial to us .
So here , let 's step back and look at what we expect from DNA when it 's playing absolutely no functional role ; in other words , let 's look at the null hypothesis of genomic junk and transcriptional noise .
We can then take our null hypothesis and use it to look at a fascinating new study of how genomic parasites sculpt transcription in our cells .
What bothers me most about the recent hullaballoo over pervasive transcription is the tacit assumption that non-functional DNA has to be inert .
This is a terrible assumption from both a biochemical and an evolutionary viewpoint .
We have every reason to expect non-functional DNA to be noisy .
Kevin Struhl , a Harvard biologist with a long track record of pioneering studies in the field of transcription has laid out the case for transcriptional noise in a back - of - the - envelope calculation .
Inside of a yeast cell , there are about 20,000 molecules of RNA Polymerase II , the enzyme that carries out most transcription in the cell .
Of these 20,000 RNA Polymerase molecules , only about 12,000 are bound to DNA ; these are the molecules that are actually producing the transcription in the cell .
Of these 12,000 , only ~ 10 % are necessary to produce all of the observed transcription from the ~ 6,000 yeast protein - coding genes ( see Struhl 's paper for details ) .
In other words , up to 90 % of the DNA - bound RNA polymerase is not transcribing protein - coding genes .
Now a yeast genome is very streamlined compared to ours - most of the genome consists of protein - coding genes and the immediately associated regulatory sequences .
( In our genome , these regions add up to less than 5 % of our total DNA ) .
What Struhl 's calculation shows is that there is a lot of potential to produce transcriptional noise .
Which is exactly what we expect from the biochemistry anyway : no biological molecule is 100 % specific .
Struhl argues that , given the size of the genome , it 's not surprising at all that only 10 % of the total RNA Polymerase molecules are transcribing from the right spot on the DNA : Transcriptional noise is the default assumption - and the problem is much worse in a huge mammalian genome , where the potential for an RNA polymerase to initiate from an ' incorrect ' site is much , much larger .
Conclusion : transcription does not equal function .
With new technologies , we 're getting better and better at detecting even very weak transcription , which also means we 're getting better at detecting biological noise .
From an evolutionary perspective , genomic junk and transcriptional noise is what we expect , although this lesson does n't always sink in .
A recent paper put it this way : Michael Lynch , a biologist at Indiana University , has also taken genome biologists to task for seeing function everywhere .
He 's put together a null hypothesis of what we expect to see in the absence of natural selection : Lynch goes on to show that complex ( but non-functional ) regulatory interactions can evolve under genetic drift .
This should n't be surprising to anyone with an understanding of evolution : functional features in the genome do n't appear by magic ; there has to be some raw material for evolution to work with .
The complex structures that evolve through genetic drift can provide a rich source potential function - all it needs is a mutational tweak to make it functional and thus malleable under natural selection .
It should be clear by now that genomic junk and transcriptional noise are the default hypotheses against which we have to compare any new claims of functional DNA .
Refreshingly , a recent genome paper in Nature Genetics has a healthy perspective on this issue .
Using some of the latest DNA sequencing technology , a group of scientists looked at transcription from virus - like genomic parasites known as transposable elements .
They found that hundreds of thousands of transposable elements are able to drive transcription all over the genome .
Interestingly , much of this transcription takes place only in some cell types but not others : a feature of a lot of functional transcription ( e.g. , muscle genes get expressed in muscle cells , but not fat cells , etc . ) .
Before you get excited though , think about the null hypothesis !
Genomic junk and transcriptional noise are perfectly capable of being restricted only to certain cell types , thus mimicking truly functional genes .
The authors of this paper take a balanced view :
That 's a great bottom line :
Surely some of this is functional , but we should n't expect all of it to be ( and function has to be demonstrated , not assumed ) .
More importantly , functional or not , transposable elements ( as this paper shows in great detail ) exert a very powerful force on the overall transcription in the genome .
Their enormous , dynamic presence inevitably has an impact on both functional and non-functional regions of the genome .
UPDATE : I need to add a clarification : Kevin Struhl argues that up to 90 % of RNA polymerase binding is non-specific , but he 's not arguing that 90 % of transcription is noise .
Much of that ~ 90 % non-specific binding produces very low levels of transcription .
This paper , using sequencing , found that 75 % of the yeast genome is transcribed , but much of it is transcribed at low levels .
The same trend is generally seen in mammalian cells . ,
If after watching the video and you ’re not hooked then you ’ve made me quite speechless .
Frankly , I think every PS3 owner should pick up this game .
Uncharted 2 looks god damn sexy and I could n’t be any more hyped .
See what I mean below .
The detail in the character models , faces , environments , explosions , lighting and animations are absolutely fantastic , I have to give special recognition to just how crisp the textures of this game look , I think the secret to the uniquely crisp textures are the fact that they are hand - painted !
There ’s also gossip going about that are stating Nathan Drakes character model alone contains more detail than in some other games environments .
Various shaders have been applied to his body , and an even more improved expression engine has been used to craft characters organic facial expressions with great care .
In a move with major implications for the economy , some of America ’s largest private healthcare providers plan to tell President Obama they will reduce the spending growth rate of healthcare by 1.5 percentage points per year .
If hospitals and large insurance companies succeed in doing this , it would have major ramifications for both individuals and the nation .
For Americans , the savings could be significant – as much as $ 2,500 a year for a family of four by the fifth year of the program .
For the federal government , the savings could be as much as $ 2 trillion during the next decade .
These amounts could potentially reduce the growth of the federal budget deficit as similar savings are passed on to federal programs such as Medicare , senior White House officials said Sunday .
Offer is a ' game - changer '
“ This is a game - changer , ” said a senior White House official during a Sunday teleconference .
The briefing was given on the condition that the officials not be named because they did not want to trump Mr. Obama 's formal announcement of the deal Monday .
Healthcare reform is one of the priorities of the Obama administration , which wants to find a way to provide healthcare for 46 million Americans who have no private healthcare coverage .
The voluntary effort will be announced by Obama Monday when he meets with representatives of six healthcare groups , including America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the American Medical Association , and the California Hospital Association .
White House officials maintain that the groups came to them with the offer without any quid pro quo .
In the past , White House officials say , the groups have dragged their feet on cost containment .
The change has come about “ because groups now realize we are all in the same boat and going in the same direction , ” said the senior White House official .
“ Now , they are saying we want to be part of the solution , getting healthcare done . ”
Reassuring Republicans and Democrats
Recently , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reassured Republican lawmakers that the Obama administration did not intend to drive private insurers out of business with its Health Care for America Now program , according to news reports .
At the same time , the White House told Democrats it was still committed to a government health - insurance option .
White House officials indicated some of the savings would come from things such as common claims forms that would reduce administrative costs or a universal explanation of benefits .
The groups were expected to come to the White House with concrete proposals .
The steps the healthcare industry will need to take will depend on healthcare reform , the White House said .
For example , under current law providers are penalized if they are more efficient , the official said .
“ We want to move the incentives away from more care and toward better care , ” said the senior official .
“ We want to make it easier for private providers to provide quality and efficiency versus intensity . ”
Healthcare spending rate : 7 percent more a year
White House officials estimate healthcare expenditures are growing at about a 7 percent annual rate .
If the companies succeed , by the fifth year , there would be a zero growth rate .
By the 10th year , calculated one senior White House official , the savings would be equal to 3 percent of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , or $ 700 billion – a figure close to the economic stimulus package that was enacted in January .
“ This could be invested in education or other economic priorities , ” a White House official said .
Without the savings , national health expenditures were on track to grow from 17 percent of GDP to 21 percent by 2010 .
With the annual savings , national healthcare expenditures would represent 18 percent of GDP .
Most analysts have assumed healthcare costs would continue to grow as the baby boomers age and require more medical services .
As baby boomers grow older , their incomes also would probaby rise , meaning they would be able to spend more money on healthcare .
“ We expect some increase in healthcare costs , but there will be a reduction in speed , ” says the senior official .

So offenbar geschehen am Freitag in Kreuzberg : 17 Studierende aus Berlin und Spanien trafen sich nach Angaben des AStA der FU abends im Café Simitdchi in der Adalbertstraße , um mit Journalisten über die im Juni geplanten Bildungsstreiks zu sprechen .
Zu den Pressevertretern zählte Björn Kietzmann von der Jungen Welt .
Er berichtet , dass die Gruppe draußen gesessen und auf einen letzten Teilnehmer gewartet habe , als plötzlich ein Dutzend behelmter Polizisten die Tische umstellte .
Die etwa 100 Beamten hätten verboten zu telefonieren und zu fotografieren .
" Alle Anwesenden wurden einzeln abgeführt und in den Fahrzeugen durchsucht . "
Auch ihre Personalien seien aufgenommen worden .
Ein Mitarbeiter des Cafés Simitdchi bestätigt die Schilderung weitgehend .
" Die haben sich was zu trinken , Tee oder so , gekauft und draußen vor den Laden gesetzt " , erzählt Yasin Selcuk .
Einer habe eine rote Fahne dabeigehabt , sonst sei ihm nichts aufgefallen .
Keiner habe politische Sprüche gerufen oder Transparente entfaltet .
Zehn Minuten später sei die Polizei gekommen und habe die Leute zur Ausweiskontrolle mitgenommen .
Was sollte dieses harte Durchgreifen ?
Die Pressestelle der Polizei sagt , im Rahmen einer Streifenfahrt seien den Beamten rund 20 Personen am Kottbusser Tor aufgefallen .
Der Einsatz habe nicht im Café , sondern " im Bereich der Freitreppe " stattgefunden .
Die Polizisten seien von einer " nicht angemeldeten Versammlung " ausgegangen .
Sie hätten die Teilnehmer überprüft und Platzverweise ausgesprochen .
Ein Taschenmesser , zwei Sturmhauben und eine Fahne seien sichergestellt worden .
" Wir verurteilen diesen Angriff auf politisch engagierte Studierende und auf die Pressefreiheit aus Schärfste " , erklärte das Team der Bildungsstreiks am Dienstag .
Die eingesetzten Mittel seien " in höchstem Maße unverhältnismäßig " gewesen .
Der innenpolitische Sprecher der Grünen , Benedikt Lux , sieht das ähnlich .
Er frage sich , ob nicht politische Motive hinter dem Einsatz stünden .
" Auch über eine radikale Kritik am Bildungssystem muss man sich auf öffentlichem Straßenland unterhalten können " , sagte Lux .
Selbst wenn es sich um eine Versammlung gehandelt habe , sei das kein Grund , das Treffen sofort aufzulösen .
" Die Polizei hätte das einfach dulden können . "
Lux will Innensenator Ehrhart Körting ( SPD ) bei der nächsten Sitzung des Innenausschusses am Montag auf den Vorfall ansprechen .
Auch der innenpolitische Sprecher der SPD , Thomas Kleineidam , kündigte an : " Wenn sich das so abgespielt hat , wie die Studenten berichten , werde ich da noch mal nachhaken . "
Die Deutsche Journalistinnen - und Journalisten - Union ( dju ) verurteilte das Vorgehen der Beamten mit deutlichen Worten .
" Die Begründung , es habe sich um eine unangemeldete Versammlung gehandelt , ist einfach nur absurd " , erklärte Andreas Köhn , stellvertretender Landesbezirksleiter von Ver.di im Namen der dju .
Er gehe davon aus , dass sich die Berliner Polizei an die deutschen Gesetze halte .
" Situationen wie diese erwartet man eigentlich in südamerikanischen Polizeistaaten . "
WASHINGTON  President Obama will announce tough new nationwide rules for automobile emissions and mileage standards on Tuesday , embracing standards that California has sought to enact for years over the objections of the auto industry and the Bush administration .
The rules , which will begin to take effect in 2012 , will put in place a federal standard for fuel efficiency that is as tough as the California program , while imposing the first - ever limits on climate - altering gases from cars and trucks .
The effect will be a single new national standard that will create a car and light truck fleet in the United States that is almost 40 percent cleaner and more fuel - efficient by 2016 than it is today , with an average of 35.5 miles per gallon .
Environmental advocates and industry officials welcomed the new program , but for different reasons .
Environmentalists called it a long - overdue tightening of emissions and fuel economy standards after decades of government delay and industry opposition .
Auto industry officials said it would provide the single national efficiency standard they have long desired , a reasonable timetable to meet it and the certainty they need to proceed with product development plans .
City bankers and financiers are scooping bumper pay rises to compensate for losing multimillion pound bonuses in a controversial development that will trigger fresh " reward for failure " rows .
The Observer has learnt that UBS , the stricken bank that last year received a £ 40 bn Swiss government bailout , is paying London staff increases of between 15 % and 20 % at a time when many workers in Britain are forced to take wage freezes .
Though it is understood some equity traders at UBS have even enjoyed a doubling of salary to over £ 250,000 , bank sources indicate these were " exceptional cases rather than the rule " .
But senior City headhunters confirmed that basic pay rises for senior bank staff were rising sharply , with US banks seeing big hikes .
The development provoked an angry response from TUC general secretary Brendan Barber .
" People at the top of these banks should not be taking rewards unavailable to most staff , " he said last night .
" We have to get away from a culture that says those at the top take huge salary rises while ordinary workers lose jobs and are told to accept wage freezes . "
Big pay rises for financiers will inevitably spark concern that UK banks - most of which have been bailed out by the government - will be forced to compete on basic pay or see an exodus of their brightest talent to foreign - owned banks .
Lloyds Banking Group , which took over HBOS , is awarding staff an average of 3 % this year , though some senior staff are thought to be seeing higher rises .
Bankers argue that if the culture that encouraged risk - taking to scoop huge bonuses is ending , a rise in basic pay is needed .
But big salary hikes for bankers will also take the sting out of Alistair Darling 's increase in the top rate tax to 50 % for those earning over £ 150,000 , introduced in last week 's budget .
A board member of a well - known elite executive headhunting firm said : " We need to understand that people who are getting big pay increases play a critical role in making the City the pre-eminent marketplace in the world . "
Last Friday it emerged that over 70 % of financial services workers got a bonus in 2008 despite the unfolding of the worst crisis for 80 years .
A survey by recruitment firm Morgan McKinley revealed that 16 % of respondents admitted their bonus was higher than the previous year .
At the same time there is growing pressure in Brussels to cap bankers ' bonuses and golden parachutes with tougher remuneration rules .
Angela Knight , British Bankers ' Association chief executive , said : " What 's happening is that banks are going for a new remuneration approach that removes the tendency for short - term boosts that create long - term problems . "
She added that British government - controlled banks will work out their pay policies in consultation with the Financial Services Authority , with bonuses paid in shares and locked in for a long time .
Separately , there is growing anecdotal evidence that many banks , having laid off large numbers of staff in a bid to make huge savings , are now hiring temporary staff from agencies at huge cost .
The problem is thought to be particularly acute at Royal Bank of Scotland .
You know , it really is interesting , how thoroughly they 've scoured almost every public hearing on health - care reform from anyone testifying in favor of single - payer - the only solution that makes economic sense under our dire economic circumstances .
I wonder why ?
They must really be scared .
Health care activists disrupted a Senate Finance Committee hearing Tuesday , standing up one after the other as Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) tried to restore order .
As soon as police escorted one protester out of the room , another would stand up , criticizing the committee for convening a panel of 15 experts and excluding witnesses who support creating a Medicare system for all Americans .
About eight were led out of the hearing .
“ We need more police , ” Baucus said .
The mini-protest was organized by Healthcare Now , Physicians for a National Health Program and Single Payer Action , all of whom support a single - payer , government - run health care system .
“ Single - payer needs to be on the table , ” one of the protesters yelled .
“ This is political theater . ”
Baucus eventually restored order to the hearing , asking those who remained in the audience not to cause further disruptions .
“ I want you to know I care deeply about your views , ” Baucus said .
Uh huh .
From the Physicians for A National Health Program website :
If you are an owner , an investor , a supplier , or an employee of General Motors Corp. , I am willing to bet that you are now sorry GM was not forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings when its dire financial straits first made headlines months ago .
You probably regret even more that it accepted tens of billions of dollars in bailout money from the federal government , providing the company with a taxpayer - financed capital infusion that only delayed the inevitable and predictably came with onerous bureaucratic strings attached .
Years of mismanagement , reinforced by lavish compensation for its unionized workforce and by national fuel economy standards that oblige US automakers to produce vehicles that few consumers want to buy as long as gas remains cheap , raised GMs production costs to levels unsustainable in a globally competitive marketplace .
Rather than making the tough decisions that could have restored profitability if implemented in time , company executives fiddled while a great American business enterprise burned .
Proving that one should be careful about what one asks for , GMs top management went to Washington with tin cup in hand , first by private jet and then , after a firestorm of popular condemnation , by eco-friendly car .
The pitiable spectacle of GM executives begging Congress for financial assistance represented a major reversal of fortune for a company that was once the worlds largest manufacturer .
During the 1950s and 1960s , prior to being challenged seriously by foreign competitors and fearing that the U.S. Department of Justice would accuse it of unlawfully monopolizing domestic auto sales , GM purposely kept its prices high and bypassed other profit opportunities to keep its market share from exceeding 55 percent .
GMs management got most of what it asked for and more than it bargained for .
In return for temporary  loans and other forms of taxpayer investment ,  such as purchases of preferred stock , the federal government essentially took control of the company and began calling the shots .
The first shoe dropped when CEO Rick Wagoner was forced out and replaced by the Obama administrations fair - haired boy , Fritz Henderson .
In so doing , bureaucrats assumed responsibility for a business decision that should have been delegated to GMs board of directors .
Washington has also imposed limits on executive compensation at the new  General Motors , a function that in privately owned companies likewise falls , by majority vote , on the shoulders of the members of the board .
More recently we have learned that President Obamas car czar ,  Steven Rattner , has proposed micromanaging GMs product line .
Arguing that the companys Chevrolet division markets the very same vehicles , Mr. Rattner may substitute his judgment for that of consumers by ordering that GM stop producing SUVs and trucks carrying the GMC nameplate .
Not too surprisingly , following the embarrassments associated with revelations of income tax avoidance by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and former Health and Human Services Secretary designee Tom Daschle , the car czar himself may be implicated in the Quadrangle Groups  pay - to - play  kickback schemes , currently under investigation by New Yorks attorney general .
An investor in a privately owned company who thinks that management means taking the business in a direction that will compromise its long - term profitability can sell out , even if at a capital loss , and avoid further reductions in wealth .
The taxpayers who now own  General Motors have no such option .
They are stuck with the consequences of federal government control .
Perhaps the car czaror his successorcan resurrect GM and create a leaner company able to compete effectively in a brave new automobile world that survives the current economic downturn .
But any American who visited a post office recently and dealt with the long lines , rising postage , threat of reduced delivery , and overall poor service will not be so naive .
It would have been far better to reconfigure GM under an orderly bankruptcy process , subject to the rule of law , than to hand its administration to bureaucrats , whose discretionary powers are more vulnerable to political influence than to the wishes of either consumers or the companys many stakeholders . 
In the operation of a robust private economy , the freedom to fail is just as important as the freedom to succeed .
If GM can not survive without handouts , painful as it might be , it should hit the road .
For every political action , there is an equal but opposite satiric reaction .
The Most Important Safety Tips for Flying During the Pandemic
Duration : 01:28
In the COVID - 19 era , getting on an airplane is a scary thing because of the potential exposure to the Coronavirus .
Buzz60 ’s Maria Mercedes Galuppo has the story .
Earlier this week , sharpshooters on the fantail of the U.S.
Navy destroyer Bainbridge picked off three pirates with single bullets to the head , freeing a hostage merchant marine captain .
Two days later , the Bainbridge sailed to the aid of another American merchant ship attacked by pirates .
William Bainbridge , the naval officer for whom the ship is named , would be pleased .
Bainbridge played an important role cleaning out a similar nest of corsairs who plagued shipping off African coastlines two centuries ago .
Born in Princeton , N.J. , in 1774 , Commodore Bainbridge joined the Navy in 1798 .
It was a time when Congress and President John Adams wrestled over how to deal not only with the combined threats of England and France , the military superpowers of the time , but also with bands of pirates who preyed on the rapidly expanding shipping of a youthful nation without much of a sea force .
After service against French forces in the West Indies during what was called the “ Quasi - War , ” the Navy in 1800 handed Bainbridge the command of a converted merchant ship , the George Washington .
He was told to deliver tribute -- a bribe , in effect -- to the dey of Algiers in return for safe passage .
This was essentially piracy on a state scale .
These days , the Somali pirates take a ship and ask for ransom .
Back then , we just paid rulers in advance to safeguard our merchant fleets from the Barbary pirates who operated off the coast of North Africa .
Advertisement
The Barbary pirate states presented a maritime problem not unlike what we see on the lawless Somali coast today .
As Ian Toll points out in “ Six Frigates , ” his fine book on the early days of the U.S. Navy , the Barbary corsairs in the Mediterranean were also close to major shipping lanes , had myriad places to hide and presented few good targets for retaliation .
When Thomas Jefferson became president , he was loath to launch an expensive , large - scale military operation against these rogue states .
But he also understood that the system of bribes and tributes was unworkable .
In 1801 , Jefferson decided to send a squadron to protect American shipping .
If they observed that Tripoli , in particular , was , as Toll recounts , “ waging war against the United States , ” the officers had the green light to bludgeon the city and its pirates into submission .
Bainbridge was part of the squadron , first as captain of the warship Essex and , after 1803 , as commander of the heavy frigate Philadelphia .
Frigates were the workhorses of the U.S. Navy in that period .
They were fast and versatile floating batteries of wood , some with 50 cannons or more .
They could outrun the largest British battleships of the day , yet they were still powerful enough to bombard cities and fight multi-ship battles .
Although he commanded one of the strongest U.S. warships of the day , there ’s no doubt that if Bainbridge woke up like Rip Van Winkle today , he would view his namesake ship , an Arleigh Burke - class guided missile destroyer , with amazement .
He would marvel at its size and capabilities , right down to the ample fresh water and maggot - free food served on board to officers and enlisted men alike .
Bainbridge , who had a reputation as a strident disciplinarian , also would be surprised to learn that he could no longer use flogging and other forms of physical punishment to keep sailors in order .
Advertisement
Bainbridge ’s command started out well .
He captured the Mirboka , one of the larger Barbary ships , and freed the American brig Celia from the pirates .
But as he chased another pirate ship near Tripoli , he ran the Philadelphia aground on an uncharted reef .
Bainbridge , the ship and his crew were captured .
A daring raid led by Lt. Stephen Decatur burned the Philadelphia to keep the pirates from using what could have been an incredibly strong military asset against the U.S. Navy .
Bainbridge and his crew remained captives for 19 months until they were freed for a $ 60,000 ransom and Tripoli ’s promise of free trade routes .
Losing one of America ’s most important ships did n’t have a lasting effect on Bainbridge ’s career .
During the War of 1812 , he commanded the Constitution , the most storied frigate in the U.S. Navy .
Under Bainbridge , the ship captured the British frigate Java .
It was one of several victories by the Constitution that sent shock waves across the Atlantic by helping demonstrate that , on a single - ship basis , the U.S. Navy was among the best in the world .
Such losses forced the British to use an entire fleet just to keep the handful of U.S. frigates from destroying British shipping .
The war with the British taught the American Navy how to project force and gave our ships and crews a fearsome reputation .
After the war , Decatur -- now Commodore Decatur -- led a squadron back to the Barbary Coast .
Within a matter of weeks , the local states signed treaties promising not to raid our shipping .
Bainbridge was supposed to have commanded the expedition but was delayed .
Advertisement
Decatur had solved the problem of the Barbary pirates by the time Bainbridge ’s squadron reached the Mediterranean .
But that did n’t stop Bainbridge from reinforcing America ’s image as a sea power .
As the senior officer , he took command of the combined forces .
His fleet included 18 warships , including a giant ship of the line that carried almost twice the guns of the standard American frigates and matched the biggest battleships in the British navy .
He also had five frigates , two sloops of war and 10 other assorted ships .
It was the strongest war fleet to have sailed under the young American flag .

Newspapers teach journalists to write using the inverted pyramid .
While t is n’t always the best approach , the inverted pyramid has worked for news writing since the days reporters telegraphed dispatches to editors .
Today it works for online writing .
The structure echoes the classic essay structure you were taught — or should have been taught — at school .
The basic format :
Introduction — say what the piece is about ; answer questions like who , what , where and when .
You can also explain why at this point , although that can wait until later .
— say what the piece is about ; answer questions like , , and .
You can also explain at this point , although that can wait until later .
Then — expand , amplify ;
— expand , amplify ; Keep doing this until you ’ve told the whole story .
Make the most important points first then add more and more detail in each additional paragraph .
Traditional newspaper editors cut a story from the bottom if it needs to fill a specific space on a printed page .
Inverted pyramid online
The inverted pyramid structure , with each paragraph being progressively less important , means editors can easily remove the least important information first .
A news story written using the inverted pyramid structure can be cut at the end of any paragraph , even the first paragraph , and still be a self - contained story .
Online this means search engines pay more attention to the most important words .
This helps people find your writing faster .
It means they can zero in on the story and information they are looking for .
Those opening paragraphs also make neat summaries for listings and similar online uses .
If you write your copy tight enough , your opening sentence will show up as the text in a Google search .
That will help draw in readers .
The most important information goes in the first paragraph and each extra paragraph carries progressively less weight .
That ’s where the inverted pyramid name comes from : the foundation sits at the top , the less important details are at the bottom .

One of them was a list of strange and obscure words .
I copypasted the list into a txt file and have been adding words I come across ever since .
There were 23 words in the original list .
Here are my next 17 words .
I ’ll post the following 17 in some time .
Japan 's industrial output fell 38 pc in February ( year - on - year ) , mostly concentrated into the last four months .
No major economy imploded at this speed in the 1930s .
The country has been hit by a double shock .
As an export power it has taken the brunt of Anglo - Saxon belt - tightening : as the world 's top creditor it is cursed by a " safe - haven " currency that soars in moments of danger – largely because the Japanese bring home their wealth till the storm passes .
Normally , Japan can cope .
This time , the yen 's rise has pushed the economy over a cliff .

ABOUT THE COMMON GOOD FORECASTER [ back to top ]
Our Common Good Forecaster is a powerful tool that lets you see how improving the education level in counties across the U.S. can create a ripple effect of positive change .
Access to quality education leads to better jobs and higher incomes .
And it ’s also linked to health , life expectancy , incarceration and more .
Click on the state , and then drill down to the county level to discover what could happen if educational outcomes improved in your community .
ABOUT THE PARTNERS [ back to top ]
United Way and the Measure of America joined forces in 2008 because both organizations focus on the building blocks of a good life - a quality education that starts from birth and ultimately leads to a stable job , enough income to support a family through retirement , good health , and the ability to achieve one 's full potential .
Out of this partnership came the Common Good Forecaster™ , a tool that shows how vital economic and social issues in your community might change if educational outcomes were better .
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS [ back to top ]
Attention Android users : Firefox is recommended for optimal browsing .
IOS and Desktop users : Firefox , Safari and Chrome are equally ideal .
Step - by - step instructions :
1. Choose the geographic unit ( county , state or nation ) you want to explore .
2 . Move the slider for the educational level in the selected community that marks the boundaries between four different levels of educational attainment for adults age 25 and older :
less than a high school education ,
a high school diploma or equivalency degree ,
some college or an associate 's degree , or
at least a four - year college degree .
You can also view the U.S. and state average for your community .
3. Explore changes in the selected economic or social indicators below the sliders .
4 . Test pre-determined scenarios .
Select an option from the drop - down menu to explore what would happen if :
All adults age 25 + w/o HS graduate HS ( “ Everyone graduates HS ” )
This takes all adults 25 and older who have less than a high school education and " graduates " them from high school .
So , if you were looking at the US educational " mix " for example :
16%/30%/27%/27 % .
After choosing this scenario , the sliders would move to :
0%/46%/27%/27 %.
All adults age 25 + move up 1 educational category ( “ All education levels move up 1 category ” )
The " educator 's dream " scenario takes all adults 25 and older and has them graduate to the next higher of the four defined categories of education .
So , back to the US " mix " :
16%/30%/27%/27 % .
After selecting this scenario , the sliders would move to :
0%/16%/30%/54 % .
Note :
This Forecaster is based on either observed data or peer - reviewed statistical models to forecast what changes might occur in other variables if increased levels of educational attainment are realized .
For the majority of indicators included , the data are broken out by the education levels in these local areas .
When adjustments are made in the " mix " of educational attainment , we are assuming that current relationships between education and all other factors in a given geographic area remain the same .
Extreme adjustments to the sliders can produce unrealistic results in other factors ( i.e. unemployment , poverty , and murder rates falling to zero ) .
What do the levels of education correspond to ?
The Common Good Forecaster uses five - year estimates from the American Community Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau .
This survey includes data on seven categories of educational attainment , on the left .
In the Forecaster , they are presented in the categories on the right :
Less than 9th grade
9th to 12th grade , no diploma Less than high school education High school graduate ( includes GED )
High school graduate ( includes equivalency diploma )
Some college , no degree
Associates degree Some college or associates degree Bachelor 's degree
Graduate or professional degree
At least four - year college graduate
How does the Forecaster work ?
The Common Good Forecaster™ is based on two different types of statistical relationships .
Method 1 is used for every indicator except life expectancy and incarceration , for which we use Method 2 .
METHOD 1 : We forecast the effect that changes in educational attainment will have on various social and economic outcomes based on the specific , current relationship that exists in each state and county between multiple variables .
In county A , for instance , there may be greater economic returns to earning a college degree than in county B ; this method takes that variation into account when predicting how changes in educational attainment might affect poverty or earnings for residents of those counties .
For Method 1 , For the percent of adults age 25 + the weighted average of the indicators of each of the four education groups in a state or county for median personal earnings would be :
( Less than HS x median earnings for this group ) +
( HS degree or GED x median earnings for this group ) +
( Associate 's degree or some college x median earnings for this group ) +
( Bachelor 's degree or more x median earnings for this group )
= today 's median personal earnings .
This is based on estimates from reputable sources ( e.g. Census Bureau , National Center for Health Statistics ) for each community .
All the countless external factors that affect the relationship between education and income , such as racial / ethnic profile , the community 's current economic scenario , industry health and mix , distance from commercial centers , geographic location , etc , are thus taken into account .
Each community has its own unique relationship .
METHOD 2 : We start with data from large surveys or administrative records ( like birth and death certificates ) .
We use peer - reviewed research to establish a nationally representative relationship between the indicator in question and the educational attainment level .
This method ( applied to life expectancy and the incarceration rate ) differs from Method 1 in that these results are education - to - indicator relationships at the national level applied to every local geography where data are available .
The assumption made here is that the national education - to - indicator relationship is valid for all constituent geographies .
For illustrative and forecasting purposes , we find this an acceptable assumption .
Please note that due to the statistical instability of available data for areas with very small populations , counties with fewer than 10,000 residents could not be included in the Forecaster .
The remaining 1,731 counties and county equivalents are home to 97.4 percent of the nation 's population however .
Many factors affect outcomes in such areas as children 's reading proficiency , obesity , income , poverty , and incarceration .
Why pull out education and focus on this alone ?
The Forecaster is an effort to disentangle the effect of education on various important indicators of personal and community well - being from the effects of other factors on those same indicators .
For example , social scientists use the concept of socioeconomic status to describe the social and economic composition of an individual or family in relation to others in society ; this status is based on a combination of factors , among them educational attainment and related prestige , income level , and occupation and associated status , and the resulting power and access to and control over resources that this status affords .
Nevertheless , in practice , social scientists use what they can as a proxy for this broader concept .
Can one ever separate entirely the effects of income and education ?
Often not meaningfully .
Are n't you oversimplifying the relationship between education and other factors in a community ?
Yes and no .
Scientists do this all the time by necessity .
Might there be intermediate factors that are more important in affecting the indicators in this Forecaster ?
It 's possible , but in terms of powerful underlying causes , not many match the breadth of impact that education has on people , their communities and their larger societies .
And yes , by saying the relationship between education and these other factors is one - way only is not always accurate .
For example , research shows that obesity can lead to social stigmatization and mental health issues , preventing some high school seniors from pursuing further education .
By also answering no to this question , we mean to say that in the case of one of our methods ( see above for a discussion of both methods ) , we are actually being as rigorous as possible in honoring the differences of local places .
We take local county estimates and reweight existing relationships determined by the many unique factors in that community .
This method is rooted in the uniqueness of place .
For some indicators , there is no county data available at all .
Why ?
Some indicators are not available at all at the county level .
Furthermore , data for counties with fewer than 10,000 residents could not be presented due to statistical instability .
For incarceration , data are only available by state because many counties do not have prisons and because inmates are rarely imprisoned in their own communities .
What are my options if I live in a county for which there are no data ?
One option is to select neighboring counties that seem similar to yours .
Sometimes major shifts in education produce only limited changes in other indicators .
Why ?
Each state or county has a countless array of factors affecting key social and economic indicators .
( i.e. the community 's current economic scenario , industry health and mix , distance from commercial centers ) .
There are different ranges of what is possible county - by - county and state - by - state , depending on these factors .
In some counties , the difference between the maximum and the minimum values may seem small compared with ranges within other counties because the returns to education may be greater in some places than in others .
If no sliders are moved what am I seeing ?
You are seeing the current situation in that place based on the most recent data available .

Toilet analyzes your stool and beams health results to your cellphone
April 6 , 2009 By Paul Wagorn
The Japanese are an innovative bunch .
Everything from cellphones to cars and TV’s have benefited from the Japanese pass time of making products better more interesting .
The latest device coming from Japan is a terminal that gets attached to toilets made by the toilet giant Imax .
It analyzes your stool and gives you an instant health report to your cell phone .
Japanese toilets have always been a few steps ahead of the west , but this product even takes thinks a step further .
Once you have made your “ deposit ” , sensors in the toilet will analyze your stool for various trace elements , then it beams a report to your cellphone via infrared .
The report includes a unique URL which you can access with your mobile browser where you can find detailed information about the analysis , such as fecal bacteria count , presence or absence of blood , fat content and other wonderful information .
You can even subscribe to an RSS feed for a particular toilet .
How ’s that for a data dump ?
The FKF - 20 M ( from ¥ 55,000 / $ 558 ) has already been launched in Japan ( where else ? ) , and the company plans to market it alongside Japan ’s ‘ Bowel Health Week ’ in July .
WHat ’s next ?
As fun (? ) as this sounds , does n’t it really makes you wonder if the FBI will license the technology to analyze everything coming out of our toilets ?
Maybe they already do ?
How about people insurance companies hacking the toilets and receiving your bodily details ?
I assume that they do not keep user - identifiable information , but if it was , what would happen with this data once compiled ?
stool.google.com ?
Here ’s to flushing away your troubles , just make sure nobody has a cell phone nearby .

Amazing .
What will they think of next ?
In my opinion that 's a pretty great idea .
Any way we can discover health issues before they become major we have a fighting chance .
I know it seems like every time we take one of our pets to the vet a little plastic bag of poop comes along .
Why not analyze ours as well .
Pretty amazing toilet !
I hope that toilet can also function like an occult blood test , it saves money and effort in going to the labs ..
It sounds like the ideal Christmas present for a hypochondriac .
The results would give yet more things to worry about rather than getting on with life .

The agency is also targeting importers of cutting agents
The international cocaine market is " in retreat " after a year of successful operations around the world , the Serious Organised Crime Agency claims .
It says its undercover work has helped send wholesale prices soaring .
Prices per kilo have risen from £ 39,000 in 2008 to over £ 45,000 ( 50,000 euros ) , but street prices have remained stable .
However , new figures obtained by the BBC suggest almost a third of police seizures are now less than 9 % pure , the lowest recorded purity level .
The data , collected by the Forensic Science Service , reveals how drug gangs are using increasing amounts of chemicals - so - called cutting agents - to dilute cocaine powder sold on the streets of Britain .
They include the cancer - causing drug phenacetin , cockroach insecticide and pet worming powder .
What is happening is that dealers are maximising their profits by selling a product that is potentially more harmful and much less pure

Chemicals mixed with cocaine New tactic in war on gangs Soca head of enforcement Trevor Pearce told the BBC : " There is a discernible effect that we are now seeing in relation to the availability of cocaine both in Europe and also across the UK .
" We are now seeing high - quality cocaine at about £ 45,000 ( 50,000 euros ) per kilo wholesale in the UK .
That 's significantly higher than it has been and has to be indicative of the pressure which the importers are under . "
Soca has released its internal estimates of wholesale cocaine prices .
Two years ago , the highest quality blocks typically cost £ 35,000 ( 38,946 euros ) .
By the end of last year , the price had risen to £ 39,000 ( 43,393 euros ) .
But in the first few months of this year the price , according to Soca , has hit a record level ; more than £ 45,000 per kilo .
Soca accepts that the rise in the price of wholesale cocaine measured in Sterling may in part be a consequence of the weakness of the pound .
But it argues that a similar price rise " across Europe " suggest the increases can be attributed to more than fluctuations in the money markets .
" We are seeing wholesale prices of cocaine rising across Europe , in Spain and Belgium .
We think that is due to a large degree to the strategy of working in South America , the Caribbean , across the Atlantic and with European partners - tackling it in a different way , " Mr Pearce said .
Soca - which has been under pressure to prove its effectiveness - claims its activities in the run-up to Christmas stopped 10 tonnes of street - quality cocaine powder being sold in Britain .
But analysts at Drugscope say the shortage of supply has not seen a fall in street prices although purity levels have dropped .
" At the moment price is relatively stable for cocaine , " says Drugscope director Martin Barnes .
" What is happening is that dealers are maximising their profits by selling a product that is potentially more harmful and much less pure and a lot of people buying it probably do n't realise that 's what 's going on . "
The latest figures from the Forensic Science Service reveal how average purity of police seizures of cocaine has fallen to its lowest ever recorded level - less than 20 % pure on average .
Almost a third ( 31 % ) of seizures are below 9 % pure .
Joy Newman , a scientist with the FSS , says there has been a significant decrease in the quality of the wraps of cocaine powder examined at the laboratory .
" Purities now are quite low - between 5 % and 40 % in police seizures and we have seen them as low as 4 % or 5 % in the last few weeks . "
Since last October , every seizure of cocaine is tested for impurities as part of a new Soca initiative codenamed Project Endorse .
A searchable database has been constructed which has identified links between more than 170 seizures that would otherwise not have been connected .
Cutting agents
The agency is also targeting importers of chemicals used as cutting agents , and has sent warning letters to some suppliers who they suspect may be selling the products to drug gangs .
Soca may have decided that , whatever you do on the war on drugs , you cannot win the vital public relations battle by operating from the shadows
Mark Easton 's blog
In the last year there have been 72 " law enforcement operations " involving cutting agents , even though the chemicals themselves are legal .
Critics of Soca suggest trying to limit the supplies of illegal drugs is an unsustainable tactic .
Martin Barnes from Drugscope argues that while something very significant is happening to the cocaine market , " enforcement methods have a limited impact in terms of the availability of drugs and the key is to tackle the demand side " .
Trevor Pearce from Soca accepts that the drug gangs are likely to change their tactics .
" One of the things we have to do is to try to anticipate where the organised criminals are going to next , so we can stay a step ahead of them , " he said .

Hopscotch is an application framework and IDE for Newspeak , a new programming language and platform inspired by Smalltalk , Self and Beta .
Hopscotch avoids a number of design limitations and shortcomings of traditional UIs and UI frameworks by favoring an interaction model and implementing a framework architecture which enable easy composition of interfaces .
Newspeak is a dynamic , class - based language with all names lately bound and having no global scope .
One of the consequences is the lack of static state .
All classes can be nested in each other , they are virtual and there is class hierarchy inheritance .
Hopscotch IDE runs on Brazil , a widget GUI library which is connected to the underlying operating system through a mapping layer which is bound dynamically either to a Squeak window or a native one , Mac or Windows .
The purpose is to be able to take snapshots in order to store the complete state of a process ( memory , stack , processor registries , etc. ) and restart it on a different machine or a different operating system .
For that to happen , it is necessary to have dynamic binding to the underlying windowing system because new window handles need to obtained when the snapshot is restarted .
Hopscotch is not just an IDE for Newspeak but rather a document - based GUI application framework , including a DSL for creating presentation pages from fragments .
Atomic widgets are leaf fragments while aggregates correspond to compound fragments .
A presentation is created using combinators like blank , filler , button : action : , row : , column : or deferred : .
The latest is used for aggregates that are to be constructed in the background .
An IDE tool written in Hopscotch would contain a number of such presentations using hyperlinks to navigate between them .
Usually , an IDE contains tools represented by a form having a certain number of widgets .
Connecting such tools is not an easy task .
Hopscotch has a different approach to creating user interfaces through composition and it is using the subject - presenter paradigm as explained by Vassili Bykov in this paper : Hopscotch : Towards User Interface Composition .
Gilad Bracha , creator of Newspeak , shows in a presentation how several tools , a debugger , a unit tester and an object inspector , can be seamlessly connected in a tool - chain allowing a developer to jump from one tool to another providing more detail information with a single click .
An example of an application written in Newspeak and Hopscotch is a Twitter client written by Luis Diego Fallas .

VIEWPOINT
By David Spiegelhalter
Professor of risk understanding , University of Cambridge
A little of what you fancy ?
Do you waver as you reach for that bacon sarnie or glass of wine ?
Science tells us these things can be bad for us in excess .
But in this week 's Scrubbing Up health column , risk expert David Spiegelhalter , says even those habits linked to risk can have benefits - and maybe people should be a little easier on themselves .
I own up .
I am a serial risk taker .
I live in a flood zone , cycle without a helmet , drink alcohol and on Sunday I had bacon for breakfast .
I know that this is hardly Formula 1 racing , but reading the papers might suggest otherwise .
Health warnings tend to have little influence on behaviour
Read your comments
When the advice from cancer experts for avoiding bowel cancer is " try to avoid processed meats such as bacon , ham , salami , corned beef and some sausages " , and women fearing breast cancer are told " there does n't seem to be a threshold at which alcohol consumption is safe " , then perhaps people like me are being grossly irresponsible .
Such stories bring a predictable response .
The threat from bacon sandwiches gave the opportunity for The Sun to produce the classic headline " Careless pork costs lives " , while the Daily Telegraph was true to form and frothed on about the nanny - state denying us our bacon birthright .
But all these health warnings tend to have little influence on behaviour , just as scientific derision for homeopathy appears to have no effect on many people 's enthusiasm .
So who is being unreasonable - the epidemiologists who give us health advice , or the public that duly ignores it ?
Bacon sarnies
The curious fact is that both might be right .
The reasoning behind these health warnings seems to be this : if you do more of something pleasurable ( which we shall give the generic name yum ) there is a higher risk of something bad occurring ( yuk ) , so therefore you should avoid yum .
But when presented with this argument you might ask two questions .
First , maybe the pleasure of yum makes the risk worth taking , especially if yuk might occur a long time in the future ?
Second , maybe there are other benefits of yum than could cancel out the risks of the particular yuk that has been identified ?
So suppose bacon sandwiches are your particular yum : research shows that 50g per day - that is a great greasy three - rasher sandwich - increases your risk of bowel cancer by 20 % .
We need to look at the whole picture before trying to get people to change what they do , since everything has benefit and harms
But this means that out of every 100 people who stuffed down that big bacon sandwich every day of their lives - just imagine them - the number of bowel cancers would rise from five to six .
And this possible harm is way in the future .
Again The Sun put in their inimitable style : " I would rather have the occasional bacon sarnie than be 110 and dribbling into my All - Bran " .
In addition , if a middle - aged woman gave up alcohol , it might reduce her risk of breast cancer , but could increase risk of some other cancers as well as heart disease .
So we need to look at the whole picture before trying to get people to change what they do , since everything has benefit and harms - just think of the joggers who get knocked down by cars - and people need to be able to find their own balance .
' Nudging '
These issues are tricky , and reflect a basic tension between individuals and society 's points of view .
If everyone improved their lifestyle just a bit , then the benefits to the overall health of the nation would be large but each individual would not notice the difference .
An inspired epidemiologist , Geoffrey Rose , called this the Prevention Paradox and we see it being played out again and again .
That is why it is understandable that attempts to create these shifts in behaviour by exhorting people to change tend to fail - and make them anxious and guilty .
It explains the current call for society - wide actions such as minimum alcohol pricing , and enthusiasm for ' nudging ' people towards better behaviour .
When you find the muesli at the front of the breakfast counter , and the bacon sandwiches in an unmarked gloomy corner of the canteen , you know you 're being nudged .
So as you reach for your yum , perhaps sometimes pause a moment and realise that you are taking a gamble on the yuk occurring , but that it may be a risk worth taking .
What kind of risks should we be taking - and do the warnings and health advice have any effect ?

The Obama administration has also broken a long - standing taboo against discussing Israel 's nuclear weapons , by calling for Israel to declare and give up its weapons arsenal , said to number around 50 warheads .
A senior State Department official said the US wants Israel to sign the nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and commit to disarmament .
What he has not done yet , is query the $ 3 billion in military aid which US taxpayers send Israel every year , although that could yet happen given the straitened times .

Savage appears on hate speech list for opposing illegal immigration
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , May 5 , 2009
American talk show host Michael Savage has been banned from entering the UK by the Home Secretary because of his political opinions and opposition to illegal immigration , which is considered “ hate speech ” in airstrip one .
“ Home Secretary Jacqui Smith ( pictured ) said she decided to make public the names so others could better understand what sort of behaviour Britain was not prepared to tolerate , ” according to an ITN report .
The list of 16 “ unwelcome ” individuals includes Neo -Nazis , former Ku Klux Klan members , racist skinhead groups and Islamic preachers supposedly linked to terrorist groups .
Alongside these appears the name of Savage , who is a conservative talk show host in the mould of Rush Limbaugh who has consistently opposed illegal immigration and the declining stature of U.S. sovereignty .
“ Coming to this country is a privilege .
If you ca n’t live by the rules that we live by , the standards and the values that we live by , we should exclude you from this country and , what ’s more , now we will make public those people that we have excluded , ” said Smith .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Apparently the ‘ rules that people live by ’ in the UK do not include the right to free speech and political opinions considered unpalatable by what whistleblowers have described as a “ Stalinist cabal of control freaks ” currently in power in Britain .
As we have previously reported , people are mandated by government threats , peer pressure and cultural bullying to “ tolerate ” all kinds of minority groups and for the most part we do exactly that .
The problem lies in the fact that the very same crowd that preaches “ tolerance ” is totally intolerant of anyone who dares utter a word against them .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The government in the UK defines “ tolerance ” as being banned from uttering a negative word against any minority group , and hate speech laws have codified the illegality of expressing an opinion which may be considered “ offensive ” to a minority .
Decrees of political correctness and the doctrines of illiberal mind control , which fronts as being liberally progressive when it is in fact fascistic , have swamped Europe to the point where Christian ministers are being arrested for reading Bible passages .
It is also an illegal offence in Britain to criticize homosexuality .
Television presenter Robin Page was arrested by police after he said in a speech that farmers should enjoy the same rights as Muslims and gays .
Police traveled from 200 miles away to question Page , before detaining him in a prison cell with dried feces on the wall and later charging him with incitement to racial hatred .
– In 2001 , Gloucestershire Police set up ‘ Operation Napkin ’ in which senior police officers were sent to ‘ ethnic restaurants ’ to eat four - course dinners and at the same time listen out for “ racist hate speech . ”
Arrests were made as a result of the program .
– In January 2006 a student who called a mounted policeman ’s horse “ gay ” was arrested under section 5 of the Public Order Act for making homophobic remarks and taken to court .
– Also in 2006 , a 14 - year - old school girl was arrested in Manchester England for making a “ racist comment , ” after she refused to work with a group of Asians during a science tutorial because none of them spoke English .
– Reports of “ hate crime raids ” where PC subversives are rounded up like terrorists by police are commonplace in the UK .
– In the U.S. , members of the Repent America organization were arrested and criminally charged , with prosecutors attempting to secure 47 - year prison sentences , for the crime of reading Bible passages on the street during Philadelphia ’s 2004 “ Outfest ” gay pride march .
It seems that the only remaining sectors of society it is permissible to lambaste or make fun of is pedophiles and Christians – question any other minority , sexuality , race , gender or religion and the thought police are on your back in an instant .
The sheep herd the rest of the sheep and no one is allowed to step outside of the pen .
New hate speech laws are now being passed in the United States – such legislation masquerades as being for the purpose of protecting minorities when in reality it is solely aimed at crushing the free speech of all citizens .
Though we have fundamentally disagreed with several of Michael Savage ’s views in the past , the fact that he has been banned from entering the UK , a country that poses as a haven of free speech , once again proves that free speech considered politically incorrect by the government has been all but outlawed .

THE huge signs are up in town squares , city parks and myriad spots where men in overalls dig holes , lay pavements or spruce up public facilities .
They proclaim that the work is being paid for by Plan E , the stimulus package pushed through by Spain 's Socialist prime minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero .
This included € 8 billion ( $ 11 billion ) for immediate spending by town halls .
Plan E was meant to keep Spaniards working .
Yet the latest unemployment figures show that it is not enough .
In April 40,000 more people joined the dole queues .
That was a slower rise than in previous months , but it still leaves Spain with a 17.4 % unemployment rate , the highest in the European Union and twice the EU average .
The European Commission predicts that unemployment will hit 20.5 % next year .
It also says Spain will struggle longer than other countries to recover , getting into positive growth only in 2011 , a full year after the EU as a whole .
“ The sick man of Europe ” was how the pro-government El País newspaper greeted the news .
Perhaps the most worrying thing is that Plan E has , in part , worked .
The government says it has created some 280,000 jobs , even if few are permanent .
The effect is temporary , said Pablo Vázquez of the Foundation for Applied Economic Studies .
In August and September unemployment may climb again .
Spain is lucky that strong social networks ( helped by the black economy ) help to prevent civil unrest .
The economy is in a double bind .
It has been engulfed , like the rest of the world , by recession and shrinking global trade .
To this is added Spain 's own particular crisis , as a model based on cheap labour and a dizzy property market hits the skids .
Economists say that Spain must now make the sacrifices and take the tough decisions that it avoided during the long boom years .
Labour - market reform is perhaps the toughest of all .
In some ways Spain 's labour laws are quite flexible .
With almost a third of the workforce on temporary contracts , marginal workers are easy to shed by the simple expedient of not renewing contracts .
That explains why Spain accounts for over half the additional unemployment within the euro area in the past year .
The rest of the workforce is on Teflon - coated permanent contracts that make people difficult and expensive to sack .
Companies inevitably choose staff to shed on the basis of how easy they are to fire .
Almost everyone favours reform .
Such an initiative is urgently needed , with the government leading it , said a group of 95 academic economists in a letter .
Mr Zapatero , however , does not share their sense of urgency .
And labour - market reforms are not all that he is shying away from .
The Bank of Spain recently issued a warning about a dwindling pension pot , suggesting it was time to push the retirement age above 65 .
Liberalisation of services provided by everyone from notaries and lawyers to veterinarians would help the recovery , said José Carlos Diez of Intermoney , a consultancy .
“ Whenever we have had a liberalisation plan , the economy has shown its potential for growth , ” he added .
So why does Mr Zapatero not reform ?
Besides all the usual worries about strikes , trade unions and public support , his main problem lies in parliament .
Last month his minority government lost its first parliamentary vote .
Although the Socialists are only seven seats short of an absolute majority , they are struggling to find allies .
Basque nationalist deputies are angry that a Socialist , Patxi Lopez , has just become their region 's premier .
Catalan nationalists are similarly tired of the Socialist - led administration in their region .
A fractious group of left - wing parties is not always reliable and unlikely to back tough reforms .
That leaves the main opposition , the conservative People 's Party , which now leads in the opinion polls .
Some Spaniards would like to see the two big parties push a reform agenda through together .
Things will have to get much worse before they are ready to do that .
• Taliban spokesman says ' they did the right thing ' • Renewed controversy over peace deal in Swat valley
The Pakistani government has ordered an inquiry into the flogging of a 17 - year - old woman by Taliban militants in the troubled Swat valley , after public outrage triggered by shocking video footage of the punishment .
The images , played yesterday on private television channels , show a burka - clad woman being pinned to the ground by two men while a third whips her backside 34 times .
The woman is seen screaming and begging for mercy as a crowd of largely silent men look on .
She is accused of having had an illegal sexual relationship , according to local law .
Her brother is among those restraining her .
President Asif Ali Zardari led a wave of public condemnation , and ordered the arrest of the perpetrators .
Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani termed it " shocking " and called for an immediate inquiry .
At the supreme court , the newly reinstated chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , summoned officials to a hearing scheduled for Monday to investigate the incident .
" Our constitution allows no space for such public brutality , and our civilisation and culture have no tolerance for it either , " said Sherry Rehman , a former information minister .
But the talk of arrests and inquiries are unlikely to amount to much .
The Pakistan government 's writ has all but collapsed in Swat , where armed militants loyal to a hardline preacher named Maulana Fazlullah have taken control .
The teenage woman was flogged in Kabbal , a remote district where Taliban rule is the law .
An order by the chief justice to produce the woman in Islamabad next Monday is unlikely to be heeded .
Muslim Khan , a Taliban spokesman , defended the punishment as appropriate under Islamic law , but said it should have been applied by a pre-pubescent boy in a private setting .
" She had to be punished , " he told Geo News .
" The punishment administered by local Taliban was in our knowledge and they did the right thing , but the method was wrong . "
That assertion was challenged by Islamic scholars who appeared on television chat shows throughout the day , often in between clips of outraged comments from ordinary Pakistanis .
Harsh punishments such as flogging and stoning are considered to have been imported from the Middle East , and at odds with the milder version of Islam that is indigenous to South Asia .
Public outrage reignited debate over the merits of a controversial peace deal signed last February , under which the government ceded control of the valley 's judicial system to the militants in an effort to buy peace .
Once a picturesque valley favoured by honeymooning couples , Swat is now better known as a centre of violence and repression .
An estimated 1,200 people have been killed and at least 250,000 have fled since hostilities erupted almost two years ago .
Women have been particularly hard hit .
The Taliban have burned or bombed 200 girls ' schools , shot dead female performing dancers and dumped their bodies in the street , and imposed harsh restrictions on women venturing into public .
The peace deal has brought a measure of peace to Swat , and a hybrid judicial system mixing Islamic and traditional law has become operational .
But Zardari has refused to sign a bill finalising Islamic law , saying he will only do so when peace becomes permanent .
Controversy also erupted over the timing of the video .
Local reporters and human rights activists told the Guardian that the flogging had taken place within the past three weeks .
But the provincial government and the Taliban insisted that it occurred long before the Swat peace deal was signed on February 16 .
In different interviews Khan variously estimated the timing at between two , nine and 12 months ago .
Mian Iftikhar Hussain , the provincial information minister , said the flogging took place on January 3 , and accused those airing the tape of wanting to scupper the peace process .
Debate mostly focused on how to deal with the burgeoning Taliban menace , however .
Some worry that the " Talibanisation " of the frontier could eventually spread into the rest of Pakistan .
The Obama administration has criticised Pakistan for striking peace deals with militants , worrying that they provide safe havens for extremists launching cross - border attacks against US and Nato troops in Afghanistan .
The Vatican instructed Catholic bishops around the world to cover up cases of sexual abuse or risk being thrown out of the Church .
The Observer has obtained a 40 - year - old confidential document from the secret Vatican archive which lawyers are calling a ' blueprint for deception and concealment ' .
One British lawyer acting for Church child abuse victims has described it as ' explosive ' .
The 69 - page Latin document bearing the seal of Pope John XXIII was sent to every bishop in the world .
The instructions outline a policy of ' strictest ' secrecy in dealing with allegations of sexual abuse and threatens those who speak out with excommunication .
They also call for the victim to take an oath of secrecy at the time of making a complaint to Church officials .
It states that the instructions are to 'be diligently stored in the secret archives of the Curia [ Vatican ] as strictly confidential .
Nor is it to be published nor added to with any commentaries . '
The document , which has been confirmed as genuine by the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales , is called ' Crimine solicitationies ' , which translates as ' instruction on proceeding in cases of solicitation ' .
It focuses on sexual abuse initiated as part of the confessional relationship between a priest and a member of his congregation .
But the instructions also cover what it calls the ' worst crime ' , described as an obscene act perpetrated by a cleric with ' youths of either sex or with brute animals ( bestiality ) ' .
Bishops are instructed to pursue these cases ' in the most secretive way ... restrained by a perpetual silence ... and everyone ... is to observe the strictest secret which is commonly regarded as a secret of the Holy Office ... under the penalty of excommunication ' .
Texan lawyer Daniel Shea uncovered the document as part of his work for victims of abuse from Catholic priests in the US .
He has handed it over to US authorities , urging them to launch a federal investigation into the clergy 's alleged cover - up of sexual abuse .
He said : ' These instructions went out to every bishop around the globe and would certainly have applied in Britain .
It proves there was an international conspiracy by the Church to hush up sexual abuse issues .
It is a devious attempt to conceal criminal conduct and is a blueprint for deception and concealment . '
British lawyer Richard Scorer , who acts for children abused by Catholic priests in the UK , echoes this view and has described the document as ' explosive ' .
He said : ' We always suspected that the Catholic Church systematically covered up abuse and tried to silence victims .
This document appears to prove it .
Threatening excommunication to anybody who speaks out shows the lengths the most senior figures in the Vatican were prepared to go to prevent the information getting out to the public domain . '
Scorer pointed out that as the documents dates back to 1962 it rides roughshod over the Catholic Church 's claim that the issue of sexual abuse was a modern phenomenon .
He claims the discovery of the document will raise fresh questions about the actions of Cardinal Cormac Murphy - O'Connor , the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales .
Murphy - O'Connor has been accused of covering up allegations of child abuse when he was Bishop of Arundel and Brighton .
Instead of reporting to the police allegations of abuse against Michael Hill , a priest in his charge , he moved him to another position where he was later convicted for abusing nine children .
Although Murphy - O'Connor has apologised publicly for his mistake , Scorer claims the secret Vatican document raises the question about whether his failure to report Hill was due to him following this instruction from Rome .
Scorer , who acts for some of Hill 's victims , said : ' I want to know whether Murphy - O'Connor knew of these Vatican instructions and , if so , did he apply it .
If not , can he tell us why not ? '
A spokesman for the Catholic Church denied that the secret Vatican orders were part of any organised cover - up and claims lawyers are taking the document ' out of context ' and ' distorting it ' .
He said : ' This document is about the Church 's internal disciplinary procedures should a priest be accused of using confession to solicit sex .
It does not forbid victims to report civil crimes .
The confidentiality talked about is aimed to protect the accused as applies in court procedures today .
It also takes into consideration the special nature of the secrecy involved in the act of confession . '
He also said that in 1983 the Catholic Church in England and Wales introduced its own code dealing with sexual abuse , which would have superseded the 1962 instructions .
Asked whether Murphy - O'Connor was aware of the Vatican edict , he replied : ' He 's never mentioned it to me . '
Lawyers point to a letter the Vatican sent to bishops in May 2001 clearly stating the 1962 instruction was in force until then .
The letter is signed by Cardinal Ratzinger , the most powerful man in Rome beside the Pope and who heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith - the office which ran the Inquisition in the Middle Ages .
Rev Thomas Doyle , a US Air Force chaplain in Germany and a specialist in Church law , has studied the document .
He told The Observer : ' It is certainly an indication of the pathological obsession with secrecy in the Catholic Church , but in itself it is not a smoking gun .
' If , however , this document actually has been the foundation of a continuous policy to cover clergy crimes at all costs , then we have quite another issue .
There are too many authenticated reports of victims having been seriously intimidated into silence by Church authorities to assert that such intimidation is the exception and not the norm .
' If this document has been used as a justification for this intimidation then we possibly have what some commentators have alleged , namely , a blueprint for a cover-up .
This is obviously a big " if " which requires concrete proof . '

I should mention that in fairness to this Kossack , his original anger that provoked those prejudiced statements above was actually understandable .
He made these comments on a diary which was published on May 2 , 2009 ( written , presumably , by a fellow atheist ) which stupidly claimed that most religions are " elitist " by definition , and as evidence for that , the diarist pointed to Catholics who burned people at the stake in the 15th century and the " endless number " of Muslims who have blown themselves up to kill babies and enter heaven as heroes .
Besides being poorly written , that diary was incredibly offensive and written for no other reason than to inflame , and plenty of Kossacks ( including other atheists ) called him out on it .
Unfortunately , the diary also set off a series of offensive anti-atheist remarks such as those stated in the introduction .
plf515 , an atheist , made this great observation :
" Religion does n't make people elitist .
Elitists make religion elitist .
And the same happens with some atheists . "
***********************************
Now , with that out of the way , I 'd like to change the conversation .
Let me explain where I come from and what being an atheist means to me .
WHO I AM
There are many stories of atheists who came of age in highly conservative , religious families , who then rejected the religious teachings later in life -- but that was not the case for me .
I grew up in a very secular household north of Chicago .
Instead of church on Sundays , we would sit around and watch the Bears ( hence , my username ) .
To my recollection , as a young child I went to church only once ( I think when I was 5 ) , and I certainly do n't remember what I heard when I was there .
The two most common terms that my parents use to describe their own personal philosophies are " Dubious Agnostic " and " Secular Humanist . "
They themselves were both raised in different religious cultures ( my mother 's family was Catholic , my father 's was Jewish ) , and while neither of my parents was strongly religious , they both understood what I consider to be sacred values of family togetherness , kindness , empathy , laughter , music , and love .
They instilled these values in me and my brothers at an early age , and they are the values that I hope to inspire in my friends and a future family of my own .
I was able to learn these values without a spiritual belief in a higher power of any kind .
My brothers and my parents have also learned these values without religious faith .
Contrary to a popular stereotype , we were not " angry atheists . "
We just lived our lives as Americans .
WHAT I SEE
I am a heterosexual , white male with no physical disabilities .
Demographically speaking , I am not really in the minority in this country .
It 's also no stretch to say that heterosexual , white males with no physical disabilities have historically been given the most power , money , and influence in society , and thus the most tools with which to unfairly discriminate against others .
I 'm also about average height for men , have a medium - sized build , and have brown hair too , in case you were wondering .
I 'd be willing to bet that at least one of you has built a Sim or a Mii that looks like me .
However , in addition to all these traits , I 'm also someone who happens to believe that there is no God .
That puts me squarely in the minority in the U.S. of A .
If you lump me in with agnostics and those claiming " no religion , " then I fall in with about 15 % of the population -- a proportion that 's been on the rise , to be sure , but still very much in the minority .
There is , based on my count , only ONE openly non-theistic member of Congress : Pete Stark ( D - CA ) .
That amounts to a 0.2 % non-believer population in Congress -- just a little disparity , if you ask me .
Atheism is also , sadly , one of the most despised minorities in the country .
In February 2007 , a Gallup poll found that only 45 % of Americans said they would vote for an atheist even if he or she were well - qualified , and 53 % said they would not -- the worst score for every demographic they tested .
Most of that disparity was driven by conservative voters , sure , but compare that with the 95 % of Americans who would vote for a well - qualified Catholic , and you 've got a bit of a gap , to say the least .
In March 2008 , Gallup tracked my kind at a - 32 net favorability rating ( yeah , take THAT , Mitch McConnell ! ) .
But wait , there 's more !
It also turns out that there are a handful of states in the Union whose constitutions prohibit atheists from holding public office .
Those states are :
Arkansas :
No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State , nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court .
( Article 19 , Section 1 ) Maryland :
That as it is the duty of every man to worship
God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him , all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty ; wherefore , no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate , on account of his religious persuasion , or profession , or for his religious practice , unless , under the color of religion , he shall disturb the good order , peace or safety of the State , or shall infringe the laws of morality , or injure others in their natural , civil or religious rights ; nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent , or maintain , or contribute , unless on contract , to maintain , any place of worship , or any ministry ; nor shall any person , otherwise competent , be deemed incompetent as a witness , or juror , on account of his religious belief ; provided , he believes in the existence of God , and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts , and be rewarded or punished therefor either in this world or in the world to come .
( Declaration of Rights , Article 36 ) Mississippi :
No person who denies the existence of a Supreme Being shall hold any office in this state .
( Article 14 , Section 265 ) .
North Carolina :
The following persons shall be disqualified for office : First , any person who shall deny the being of Almighty God. ( Article 6 , Section 8 ) South Carolina :
No person shall be eligible to the office of Governor who denies the existence of the Supreme Being .
( Article 4 , Section 2 ) Tennessee :
No person who denies the being of God , or a future state of rewards and punishments , shall hold any office in the civil department of this State .
( Article 9 , Section 2 ) Texas :
No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office , or public trust , in this State ; nor shall any one be excluded from holding office on account of his religious sentiments , provided he acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being .
( Article 1 , Section 4 )
All of which seems to conflict with a certain Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which says this :
" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . "
It should be noted , however , that in February , the Arkansas state legislature referred to committee a bill that would repeal the anti-atheist law ( which was first introduced by a Catholic representative , Richard Carroll ) .
The ACLU is keeping an eye on it .
WHAT IT MEANS TO ME
So needless to say , I take my minority status as an atheist seriously .
It upsets me when I read that the Boy Scouts of America not only do not accept scouts and scout leaders who identify as gay , but that it requires scouts to believe in God .
And it hurts me when I read that only 20 years ago , a President named George H.W. Bush stated that atheists should not be considered citizens or patriots of the United States .
Such dismissive attitudes and practices have helped shape prejudicial views towards the non-religious in this country .
However , it thrills me when I hear President Obama acknowledge non-believers in his inauguration address , when no other President before him had done so .
I have been very fortunate that , in my lifetime , I have not experienced thus far any form of systemic , long - term prejudice on the level of what , say , African - Americans faced during the Civil Rights movement , or what our LGBT brothers and sisters have faced for the past thirty - plus years .
But at the end of the day , it really does n't matter who the target of prejudice is .
Discrimination is discrimination , no matter which group is being discriminated against .
I will fully acknowledge that , even though there is a disparity in the number of atheists and agnostics in Congress compared to the general population , I do n't want more atheists in Congress simply for the sake of having more atheists in Congress .
Being atheistic does not mean you automatically have better judgment , nor does being religious mean you automatically have better morals .
George
Will is a self - avowed agnostic , but that does n't stop him from denying that global warming is real .
And man , I CAN'T STAND Christopher Hitchens .
As an atheist , I want to be absolutely clear about one thing .
I hope you will not read this diary as an anti-religion tirade .
It 's not .
One Kossack 's hurtful comments do not represent the views of all Christians .
That certain individuals in history have bastardized Christianity , Islam , and yes -- atheism -- does not mean they represent the whole of any religious or non-religious group .
For what it 's worth , my girlfriend is Catholic .
I love her very much .
She loves me .
I do n't try to convert her , she does n't try to convert me .
She has the right to go to church and practice her faith if she so chooses , and I support her when she does , just as much as I have the right not to go to church or practice a faith .
We love each other for who we are , and our differences in our religious and non-religious preference has nothing to do with it .
Here 's what it all means to me :
Atheism is , for better or worse , a part of my identity .
I will not run from it .
I will not accept being demonized for it .
Yet I still dream of the day when it no longer matters if one believes in a god or not .
I do not feel I need the guiding principles of a higher power to be a good person .
I will respect the choice of religious Americans -- their choice is guaranteed by the Constitution .
I just ask for respect for my choice .
Thanks for reading , and peace to all .

UPDATE # 2 : I appreciate all the feedback .
This diary exploded much , much faster and much , much bigger than I expected it to , so there 's no way I can respond to everybody 's comments .
If you agree with the diary 's premise , that 's cool .
If not , no problem .
Lots of great and reasonable discussion on both sides , either way .
One thing I did not address in this diary is the separation of church and state .
As you might imagine , I have very strong feelings about that .
I do not believe religious groups should force their set of beliefs into legislation .
Jewish and Islamic groups might prohibit eating pork as part of their religion .
But as soon as I 'm told by legislators that I cannot eat pork because a religious doctrine says so , then I have a major problem .
***********************************
UPDATE # 3 : Wow , I think one of the most amazing things that I 've observed here on this diary is the long list of people leaving notes just to say what their religious or non-religious preference is .
Lots of atheists coming out of the woodwork just to say " I 'm an atheist , " as well as a fair share of self - described agnostics and religious Kossacks who have each offered their support , suggestions , constructive criticisms , etc .
No one should have any shame in being an atheist , and I 'm very encouraged to see people letting the community know who they are .
One other point I 'd like to make is about the distinction between atheism and agnosticism .
Lots of Kossacks have written comments beneath about it .
As best as I understand it , atheism does not purport to KNOW that there is no God .
If you claimed that you knew there was no God , that means that you had to have somehow scientifically tested for that , which so far as we know , you can't .
Atheism , however , states plainly the absence of BELIEF in a god or gods .
Richard Dawkins defined it as a scale of 1 - 7 in his book The God Delusion , where 1 = absolute belief in God , and 7 = absolute non-belief in God .
If I remember correctly , he defines himself as a 6 .
Agnosticism , on the other hand , is a little trickier to explain .
It is something of a middle ground between atheism and theism .
It states that you are not sure if there is a God .
Agnostics can lean one way by saying that the question of God 's existence is an unanswerable question , and therefore it 's not worth believing or disbelieving because you can't know the answer .
Or , they can lean another way by saying that we do n't know if God exists , but you must withhold judgment until further evidence is available .
If I 'm wrong in these descriptions , you may feel free to discuss it as always , but given the volume of comments , I can't guarantee I 'll get around to it !
***********************************
UPDATE # 4 : Several commenters have correctly pointed out that the statement in Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights quoted above is immediately followed by this :
" Nothing shall prohibit or require the making reference to belief in , reliance upon , or invoking the aid of God or a Supreme Being in any governmental or public document , proceeding , activity , ceremony , school , institution , or place . "
Based on the language here , it would seem incorrect to categorize Maryland as a state that expressly prohibits atheists from holding public office , certainly not like the other six states do .
For that , I apologize for the confusion .
That said , it 's still curious why Maryland 's Declaration of Rights would include the bolded language to which I originally referred .
Perhaps I 'm misreading it , but it seems to me that Article 36 provides protection from religious persecution in the state of Maryland , but only under the condition that you must believe in God .
So even if the state does not forbid atheists from holding public office , it 's strange that Article 36 would take pains to explain that your freedom of religious liberty is ensured only if you believe in God 's existence .

GeoCities , a free Web hosting service that achieved fame in the mid-90s , died Thursday at the Yahoo headquarters in Silicon Valley .
GeoCities was 15 years old .
GeoCities had suffered a long and drawn - out battle with its health over the past decade .
An antiquated service model and outdated technology are widely blamed for the struggle .
An official cause of death , however , has yet to be determined .
GeoCities : 1995 - 2009
GeoCities was born as " Beverly Hills Internet " in the winter of 1995 .
Its parents , David Bohnett and John Rezner , wanted to create a virtual community that mimicked the real world , with pages hosted in " cyber cities " and other similarly nauseating concepts .
Both teenagers and first - generation Internet dorks ( known then as " former SysOps " ) flocked to the service , setting up personal pages in the " cyber cities " of their choice .
Despite GeoCities ' built - in watermarks and on - page advertisements , the site 's popularity continued to climb , and the shame its users should have felt for creating abhorrent content within its servers continued to remain repressed ( see : " A1PYRO'S WORLD " ) .
The ' Portal Page ' Era
As GeoCities matured , it decided to spread its wings and leap into the then - blossoming business of " portal pages , " joining such companies as Excite , Lycos , AltaVista , and HotBot ( all of which are now listed as being on life support at a San Francisco area assisted - living facility ) .
Standing proud , GeoCities reorganized itself with even more " cyber neighborhoods " that featured news , chat rooms , and polls in which users could express their opinions via multiple - choice forms .
Perhaps most notably , shortly before its third birthday , GeoCities expanded its storage offering from 6MB to an almost - doubled 11 MB -- nearly eight entire floppy disks worth of data .
GeoCities ' Later Years
One year later , in 1999 , GeoCities underwent its largest transformation when the yet - to - become - a- punchline company Yahoo purchased it for $ 4.7 billion .
Yahoo removed many of GeoCities ' trademark assets , including the " cyber city " foundation of the service , and attempted to transform GeoCities into a profit - producing venture .
It was around this time that GeoCities began showing the first symptoms of the medical issues that would plague it for the remainder of its life .
GeoCities grew weaker by the month .
The proliferation of low - cost hosting options , combined with the increasing popularity of social network - style services in place of personal home pages , only contributed to its demise .
GeoCities is survived by two cousins , Angelfire and Tripod , along with an uncle , Jeeves .
All three are believed to be terminally ill .
Of the 12 remaining GeoCities users , only one was available for comment .
" Holy crap ! " said the user , a red - faced fellow named Strong Bad .
" The scroll buttons and animated GIFs on that site were unbeatable . "
The GeoCities site is expected to remain functional through midyear as a tribute to its life .
Funeral arrangements are now pending .

The power of the podcast .
Last week , Adam Carolla ’s popular radio show was abruptly cancelled when station KLSX in California decided to completely switch formats and switch from an FM talk station to top 40 .
For those not familiar with Adam Carolla , he co-hosted “ The Man Show ” on Comedy Central for a number of years , and recently had a stint on ABC ’s Dancing With the Stars .
Still no recollection ?
Well , rest assured that his radio show was extremely popular and un-deniably hilarious .
In fact , “ The Adam Carolla Show ” was the # 1 morning talk show in a number of large markets , but in yet another sign that terrestrial radio is on the way out , CBS decided to ax the show anyways simply because its always cheaper to play music than it is to pay a radio personality .
Carolla , though , took the news in stride and quickly decided to enter the podcasting world .
While his former radio show had previously been available as a podcast on iTunes , it was mostly for users who lived in markets where his radio show was n’t broadcast , or for users who could n’t catch it live .
So when news of his dismissal hit , Carolla decided to start podcasting on his own , and on February 24th , the first podcast went live on iTunes .
Surprisingly , ( or not , if you ’re a fan ) , fans of Carolla responded en masse and within one day of becoming available , the first episode of “ The Adam Carolla Podcast ” was downloaded over 250,000 times and quickly became the # 1 most popular podcast on iTunes , edging out podcasts such as “ Real Time with Bill Maher ” and NPR ’s always popular “ Wait Wait … Do n’t Tell Me ! ”
You can check out the podcasts over here .
Get it on !
Binyam Mohamed , the British resident who was tortured in Morocco on behalf of the CIA , has been free from Guantánamo for nearly two months , but the struggle for access to documents proving his rendition and torture — both in Morocco and in the CIA ’s own “ Dark Prison ” in Afghanistan — continues .
The US government has never explained where he was held between May 2002 , when British agents last saw him in Pakistan , where he was initially seized , and May 2004 , when he surfaced in the US prison at Bagram airbase , and although the British government has conceded that it received intelligence reports about him from July 2002 to February 2003 , officials have always maintained that the US authorities did not inform them about where he was being held .
Last summer , after a judicial review of Mohamed ’s case in the UK , two high court judges — Lord Justice Thomas and Mr. Justice Lloyd Jones — ruled that the British government ’s decision to be involved in an exchange of intelligence about Mohamed , without knowing where he was being held , or receiving assurances that he was not being subjected to ill - treatment or torture , meant that “ the relationship between the United Kingdom Government and the United States authorities went far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing . ”
However , despite this and other trenchant criticisms , the British government has , to date , prevented the judges from either ordering the release of 42 documents in its possession , which deal with Mohamed ’s interrogations in Pakistan , or even releasing a seven - line summary of those documents , even though the judges have clearly stated that they believe the summary should be released in the interests of “ open justice , ” and because there is “ nothing in the redacted paragraphs that would identify any agent or any facility or any secret means of intelligence gathering .
Nor could anything in the redacted paragraphs possibly be described as ‘ highly sensitive classified US intelligence . ’ ”
On Friday , reiterating a well - worn but disputed argument that releasing the summary would cause “ real harm to the national security and international relations of the United Kingdom , ” Foreign Secretary David Miliband again sought to prevent the judges from releasing the summary , but in today ’s Mail on Sunday , David Rose reports that Binyam Mohamed has now stated that a British spy — or a “ mole , ” as Rose calls him — was sent by the British authorities to Morocco in September 2002 , in an attempt “ to persuade him that giving intelligence to the British would end his ordeal . ”
“ It was one of my lowest points , ” Mohamed told Rose .
“ The really bad stuff [ the torture which included having his penis regularly cut by razorblades ] had already been going on for weeks .
I thought he was a friendly face who might get the British to help me — but it was just another way of putting on pressure . ”
Mohamed ’s lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , added that the Moroccans told Mohamed that the man , a British citizen of Moroccan descent , identified only as Informant A , “ was working with the British Government and pressed Mr. Mohamed to do the same if he wanted to end his torture . ”
Stafford Smith also explained that he had written to Gordon Brown demanding an immediate inquiry , calling for the government to finally reveal its involvement with the case , and to “ quit working with the US to hide evidence of criminal acts . ”
Pouring scorn on the British authorities ’ claim that they did not know that he had been rendered to Morocco by the Americans , Stafford Smith added that , in his letter , he had written , “ The suggestion that British officials simply lost track of Mohamed for more than two years and did not know that he had been rendered to Morocco for torture is implausible .
They had their own agent in Morocco who had seen Mohamed there and that person was back in the UK while the razor blades were still being taken to Mohamed ’s genitals . ”
What is even more fascinating about this story , however , is the report of Binyam ’s relationship with Informant A before his capture , and the fact that other Guantánamo prisoners were also aware of the “ mole . ”
As Rose described it , Informant A “ knew Mohamed in London and helped him plan the fateful journey in the spring of 2001 that took him first to Pakistan , then to Taliban - controlled Afghanistan .
After Mohamed had fled the conflict , the mole was wounded fighting alongside Osama Bin Laden in the caves of Tora Bora .
Months after that , Mohamed saw Informant A again in Pakistan shortly before both men were separately captured . ”
In addition , Tarek Dergoul , a British citizen who was released from Guantánamo in 2004 , said that he was “ held at a US base in Afghanistan in 2002 at the same time as Informant A , ” and he told David Rose on Saturday , “ The fact he ’d agreed to become a grass was all over the jail .
One of the guards was saying , ‘ We ’ve got another 007 . ’ ”
According to Stafford Smith , who said that Mohamed told him about Informant A in Guantánamo in 2005 , but that it was “ only recently that new sources have come forward to support his account , ” Shaker Aamer , a British resident who is still held in Guantánamo , was actually seized with Informant A in Afghanistan , and he told Stafford Smith that , when he was flown to Guantánamo , Informant A was “ taken somewhere else by the British . ”
Rose added that another , unidentified source explained that Informant A “ had been allowed to return to London after his capture . ”
While the revelation of the role played by Informant A will undoubtedly renew the pressure on the British authorities to reveal the extent of their involvement in Mohamed ’s interrogations in Morocco , two other important questions also need to be raised .
The first involves trying to ascertain what information was provided by the newly - recruited agent , who was presumably desperate to please his new masters , when he was planted amongst the prisoners in Afghanistan ; and in particular , whether any of this information has been used by the US authorities to justify the detention of prisoners who are still held in Guantánamo , including , of course , Shaker Aamer .
The Saudi - born resident traveled to Afghanistan with another former Guantánamo prisoner , Moazzam Begg , to establish a girl ’s school , funded by a Saudi charity , and also to pursue a number of well - digging projects that they had funded separately , but over the years he has been subjected to several suspicious claims — including an allegation that he “ lived on stipends in Afghanistan paid by [ Osama ] bin Laden ” — whose provenance has never been explained .
The second question , however , is even more explosive , as it involves asking whether Mohamed ’s rendition to Morocco , a country with which he had no connection , was the direct result of information provided by Informant A. Given his Moroccan background , I can only conclude that this seems very likely , and that it also shines an even more uncomfortable light on the British government ’s persistent attempts to claim that it was never directly involved in Mohamed ’s rendition and torture than the revelation that Informant A was sent to Morocco to persuade him to cooperate .
I state this for two reasons : firstly , because it suggests that the British and American intelligence services were in extremely close contact in the three months following Mohamed ’s capture , when he was held in Pakistan , and secondly , because it suggests , bluntly , that the CIA ’s decision to render Mohamed to Morocco only came about because of British input .
I doubt that David Miliband is getting much rest today …

Burmese court rejects three people due to appear in defence of opposition leader accused of breaking terms of house arrest
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Aung San Suu Kyi , the Burmese opposition leader , will only be allowed to call one witness to testify in her defence against charges of breaking the terms of her house arrest , the court trying her case ruled today .
Three other defence witnesses were barred by the court , her lawyers said .
Suu Kyi faces up to five years in prison for allowing an American man to spend two days at her lakeside compound earlier this month .
She has already spent 13 of the last 19 years in detention .
Nyan Win , one of her lawyers , said only a legal expert , Kyi Win , would be allowed to testify .
Suu Kyi's defence is seeking to prove that John Yettaw 's stay did not constitute a violation of the restriction order confining her to her home .
The rejected witnesses were Win Tin , Burma 's longest serving political prisoner until his release last year , Tin Oo , the vice - chairman of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , who has been under house arrest since 2003 , and Khin Moe Moe , a lawyer .
Earlier , Suu Kyi blamed a " security breach " for allowing Yettaw to swim across a lake to her residence using homemade flippers on 4 May , apparently to tell her of his premonition that she was about to be assassinated .
" The fact that I am the only party being prosecuted shows the partiality of the prosecution , " the Nobel peace prize laureate said in the statement , which was submitted to the court .
Suu Kyi pleaded not guilty to the charges last week , but observers believe she will be found guilty in order to allow the government to detain her during next year 's elections .
The NLD won elections in 1990 but the military , which has ruled the country since 1962 , ignored the results and placed her in detention .
Britain and the US have condemned the trial , and last night Barack Obama said that Suu Kyi's continued detention , isolation and " show trial based on spurious charges " cast serious doubt on the Burmese government 's willingness to be a responsible member of the international community .
" I strongly condemn her house arrest and detention , which have also been condemned around the world , " he said in a statement .
" I call on the Burmese government to release National League for Democracy secretary general and Nobel peace prizewinner Aung San Suu Kyi from detention immediately and unconditionally . "
Gordon Brown also demanded her release in a 64 - word statement written to mark her 64th birthday next month .
A number of celebrities , including George Clooney and David Beckham , are also preparing messages of support for 64forSuu.org .
" I add my voice to the growing chorus of those demanding your release , " Brown said .
" For too long the world has failed to act in the face of this intolerable injustice .
That is now changing .
The clamour for your release is growing across Europe , Asia , and the entire world .
We must do all we can to make this birthday the last you spend without your freedom . "
Yesterday , Suu Kyi told the court that she had no prior knowledge of an American man 's plan to visit her home in Rangoon and had not broken the terms of her house arrest .
Outside the Ritz Randwick today , flowers were placed on Charles Tingwell 's plaque in the pavement .
Tingwell was best known as the star of the iconic police show and the much - loved Australian film .
Tingwell was born in Coogee , NSW , in 1923 .
He became the country 's youngest radio announcer when working at 2CH in Sydney before going on to serve in Britain 's Royal Air Force as a Spitfire pilot in World War II .
After the war , his first speaking role was in 1945 in the film , about aviator Charles Kingsford Smith .
After a stint in Hollywood , Tingwell and his wife Audrey lived in London from 1956 until the early ' 70s .
He became well known as the star of a live - to - air drama .
When returning to Australia in 1972 Tingwell went on to star in a number of TV shows including and .
He became the star of the iconic police drama , playing Inspector Reg Lawson .
His recent credits include the 1997 film , the miniseries and a role in .
He also appeared in .
In 1994 , he was admitted to the Gold Logie Hall of Fame .
During an interview with the program in 2004 , Tingwell spoke extensively about his love for his family and his deep sense of loss after his wife died in 1996 .
He was also proud of the late renaissance of his career .
" If you keep your wits about you , you can learn from everything you do , " he said .
Vincent O'Donnell , the former president of the Producers and Director Guild and a friend of Tingwell for more than 25 years , praised the actor for his fine character .
" In an industry where rumour and innuendo are the lingua franca , and mischief and malice is all too commonly the currency of small talk , I was deeply impressed with his charity and humanity , Dr O'Donnell said today .
Tingwell was given the nickname Bud by his family .
It was adopted during his mother 's pregnancy , when her friends at Coogee Surf Club teased her about " what 's budding in there " .
It was later contracted to " the bud " and finally " Bud " .
" I rather liked Charles .
But I also love the ordinariness of Bud , " Tingwell said .
On his website , Tingwell described his great passion for his wife , Audrey .
" I opened the door and there she was : a dark - haired , hazel - eyed sixteen year old vision called Audrey Wilson .
I was dazzled .
I can't remember if I said to myself that this was the girl I was going to marry , but I do know I fell for her quickly and decisively , " he said .

He is survived by his son Christopher and daughter Virginia Tingwell , who is also an actor .
We ca n’t put our people to work .
We ca n’t educate the young .
We ca n’t keep the infrastructure in good repair .
It ’s hard to believe that this nation could be so dysfunctional at the end of the first decade of the 21st century .
It ’s tragic .
Ms. DeLauro ’s bill has an unusual range of support , from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the Service Employees International Union .
One of her co- sponsors is Keith Ellison , a Minnesota Democrat who noted that his hometown , Minneapolis , is where the I - 35W bridge collapsed in 2007 , hurling cars , trucks and vans into the Mississippi River and killing 13 people .
The infrastructure bank would be authorized to issue bonds , provide loans and offer loan guarantees to finance large - scale projects .
The idea would be to leverage substantial amounts of private capital in support of such projects , and to make more prudent decisions about which projects move ahead .
For those who are concerned about whether the government can afford these major projects , I would note that one of the biggest supporters of the creation of an infrastructure bank is Felix Rohatyn , the financier who guided New York City through the harrowing fiscal crisis of the 1970s .
He is hardly a radical when it comes to government finances .
The link between the need to rebuild the nation ’s crumbing infrastructure and the crucial need to find rich new sources of employment in this economic downturn should be obvious , a no-brainer .
The Center for Labor Market Studies is at Northeastern University in Boston .
A memo that I received a few days ago from the center ’s director , Andrew Sum , notes that “ no immediate recovery of jobs ” is anticipated , even if the recession officially ends , as some have projected , by next fall .
The memo said : “ Since unemployment cannot begin to fall until payroll growth hits about one percent  and payroll growth will not hit one percent until [ gross domestic product ] growth hits at least 2.5 percent to 3 percent  we may not see any substantive payroll growth until late 2010 or 2011 , and unemployment could rise until that time . ”
We ’ve already lost nearly 5.7 million jobs in this recession .
Those losses , the center says , “ have been overwhelmingly concentrated among male workers , especially among men under 35 . ”
If the U.S. is to have any hope of getting its economic act together over the next few years , there will have to be a much greater focus on putting people back to work .
Rebuilding the infrastructure is the place to start .

NEW YORK - Canadian actor Kiefer Sutherland was charged with misdemeanour assault Thursday for allegedly head - butting a fashion designer at a Manhattan nightclub .
The star of Fox television 's " 24 " reported to a lower Manhattan police station in a Lincoln Town Car alongside his lawyers , but he did not speak to reporters .
Sutherland , 42 , the son of Canadian actors Donald Sutherland and Shirley Douglas , was interviewed by investigators , given a ticket , ordered to appear in court June 22 and released on his own recognizance .
The minor charge is akin to a speeding ticket .
But the case could create another major legal hassle for Sutherland , who served 48 days in jail on a drunken - driving charge in California last year .
The designer , Jack McCollough of the high - end Proenza Schouler fashion house , claims Sutherland attacked him after an argument , leaving him with a cut on his face .
The incident happened about 2 a.m. Tuesday .
Detectives were planning to question actress Brooke Shields as a witness because she was at the trendy SoHo nightspot SubMercer , in the basement of the Mercer Hotel , where the altercation took place .
Drinks at the ultra-hip club cost around $ 15 .
No decision has been made on whether the charge will affect Sutherland 's probation for a drunken - driving conviction in Los Angeles , said Frank Mateljan , a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney .
Sutherland pleaded no contest to driving with a blood - alcohol level above the legal limit of 0.08 per cent .
He was sentenced to 30 days , in addition to 18 days for violating probation in a 2004 drunken - driving arrest .
Representatives for Sutherland , Shields and McCollough did not return several calls seeking comment .
Sutherland , who plays dashing federal counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer on " 24 , " won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for best actor , and has been nominated multiple times for his work on the wildly popular show .
His gritty portrayal of the counterterrorism agent has made Bauer an iconic character .
The current season , the show 's seventh , finds Bauer scrambling through Washington to save the world from its latest bad day .
Sutherland also has signed on for an eighth season .
The show airs on Mondays .
The victims ( instigators ? ) of the Christmastime tiger mauling that left their ( sort of ) friend , Carlos Sousa Jr. , dead , Kulbir and Amritpal Dhaliwal will receive a cool $ 900.000 from the San Francisco Zoo .
According to SF Chronicle , this settlement by the zoo " resolves claims the brothers brought in U.S. District Court against the city , zoo and Sam Singer , a crisis public relations consultant the zoo hired after the attack . "
The brothers ' lawsuit , among other claims , says that the SF Zoo failed at " keeping the 243 - pound Siberian tiger named Tatiana in an enclosure that had walls 4 feet lower that what is recommended by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums . "
It also says that Kulbir Dhaliwal " was n't attacked until after an employee refused to allow him into the safety of a zoo cafe . "
Which , yeah , regardless of what you think of the hoodlum brothers , that 's kind of cold .
Anyway , the Dhaliwal brothers will split the money , which is sure to buy all of the Grey Goose , Drakkar Noir , and criminal defense attorneys they will ever need .

Padding to protect pedestrians ( Link )
ITN – Tuesday , March 4 05:08 pm Padded lampposts are being trialled in a London street to protect inattentive pedestrians .
A pilot scheme has been launched in Brick Lane after it was found to have the highest number of ‘ walking and texting ’ injuries in the country .
A study carried out by 118 118 found one in ten people has hurt themselves while focused on their mobile phone screen .
The charity Living Streets is so concerned that it has teamed up with the directory enquiries service to test a scheme to wrap up the nation ’s lampposts .
A poll will be carried out on Brick Lane to gauge the response of locals .
If successful , the concept will be rolled out in Birmingham , Manchester , and Liverpool .
Glad they have the sidewalks covered , but what the heck are they going to do for them when they are crossing the road ?
Pad the cars and trucks ?
Oh heck , let ’s just make a big ball pit for these fools !
Quick Facts Essential Facts Interesting Facts
Light is made up of energy .
Light travels in a straight line .
Objects in its path cause light to bend or refract .
The speed of light is exactly 299 792 km per second .
This is the speed when light is travelling in a vacuum and not obstructed by the atmosphere .
Travelling at the speed of light , you could go around Earth 7.5 times in a second .
There are different types of light and each one has its own wavelength .
Some animals can see wavelengths that humans cannot .
Ultraviolet light ( UV light ) , for example .
Sunlight can be seen 80 meters underwater .
Plants are green because they reflect green light while absorbing other colours .
The other colours that they absorb are used in photosynthesis to create food .
A double rainbow occurs when light is reflected twice within each water droplet .
LED lights are made up entirely of visible ( to humans ) light .
This is why they appear that much brighter .
Light from the sun takes over 8 minutes to reach earth .
The speed of light is relevant to the atmosphere that it is travelling through .
Plato thought that we see by shooting light rays out of our eyes .
LED lights produce much less heat than iridescent lights .
Visible light makes up very little of the electromagnetic spectrum .
On the spectrum , you will find everything from infrared to gamma rays .
Birds and lizards can see ultraviolet light .
On the other hand , goldfish can see infrared light .
Light has no mass but it manages to have momentum .
Scientists are working on harnessing the energy provided by this momentum of light .
“ Photography ” translates to mean “ writing with light ” .
The aforementioned term was coined by the son of the man who discovered infrared .

The Right To Light
There is an English law called the ‘ Right to Light ’ .
The law dictates that if someone has received natural light in their building for more than 20 years , they are allowed to forbid the construction of buildings that would block this stream of light .
The Light That Never Went Out A neon lamp was switched on during the Great Depression and continued to burn until it was discovered some 77 years later .
The electricity bill came up to a whopping $ 17 000 !
In A Jiffy When you say you will be somewhere in a ‘ jiffy ’ , you are referring to an existing unit of measurement .
A ‘ jiffy ’ is the time it takes light to travel one centimeter in a vacuum .
This works out to approximately 33.3564 picoseconds .
Additionally , if you were wondering , a picosecond is one - trillionth of a second .

Worse Than The Angler Fish
You might already be familiar with the Angler Fish that hypnotises its prey with a bioluminescent light before devouring it .
However , there is also the less popular Stoplight Loosejaw , who takes advantage of its prey ’s disability to see red light .
It projects a beam of red bioluminescence to hunt with ease .
Talk about an unfair advantage !
Divided By Light From space , you can see quite clearly the division between East and West Germany .
This is since the different regions use different types of lightbulbs .
Hence , the type of light produced is noticeably different .
Bless You !
If you find yourself with a tickle in your nose when faced with bright light , you ’re experiencing what a significant percentage of people experience .
The mildly annoying phenomenon is known as ‘ photic sneeze reflex ’ .
It occurs due to crossed wires in the brain , according to neurologists .
Blue Light Calms You Down
In countries such as Japan and Scotland , the streetlights switch to blue at night .
This has resulted in lowered cases of crime and suicide .
Proof to the theory that blue light has a calming effect on human beings .
Can Humans See Ultraviolet Light ?
The reason human beings cannot detect ultraviolet light is that it is filtered out by your eye ’s lens .
You can undergo surgery to have this lens removed , should you desperately want to be able to see ultraviolet light rays .
Bioluminescent Trees Scientist and developers are working on extracting the bioluminescence that occurs naturally in certain jellyfish and fireflies .
If they are successful , we could soon have bioluminescent trees that will not require energy .

It Spells Hollywood
The blinking light atop the famed Capitol Records Tower spells out ‘ Hollywood ’ in morse code .
Rather appropriate if you ask us !
A Supersonic Blue Glow
There is a blue glow that is emitted when something travels faster than the speed of light in any given medium .
This is likened to the supersonic boom that occurs when things travel at the speed of sound .
It is called Cherenkov Radiation .
A Cursed Diamond
There is a diamond called the Hope Diamond that emits an ominous red glow when exposed to UV light .
We ca n’t blame people for therefore believing that the diamond is cursed .
Human Beings Glow
We as humans are bioluminescent , not unlike the jellyfish and fireflies .
However , the light we emit is much too weak for our eyes to detect it .
Conductors
In Light
There is an element known as Selenium that only conducts electricity when light is shined on it .
As one might expect , in the dark , Selenium acts as an insulator .
Flashes
In Space
If you happen to find yourself out in space you might notice flashes of light that you would n’t here on Earth .
This is due to optic rays hitting your optic nerves .

The company is releasing a retail package that includes all the previous map packs for the title , as well as seven new maps and a new campaign mission that features an all new " stealth mode . "
The package is called the All Fronts Collection , will be sold at retail for $ 20 , and is a great deal for people who want to get caught up with all the downloadable content and be up to date with long - time players .
After the jump , we 'll describe all the new maps , as well as tell you how MS is going to royally annoy long - time fans of the game .
Here are the new maps :
Allfathers Garden :
Honor the sacred grounds of the Coalition founders in this explosive map , where powerful weapons catalyze fast and furious action at this COG landmark .

Tread lightly and practice patience as it ’s better to sacrifice firepower for stealth while navigating this minefield of hidden grenades .
Nowhere :
Set in the middle of what was once a destination for weary desert travellers , the land is now barren and devoid of life .
Pick off your enemies with the Longshot sniper rifle and make your way to the stairwell with a well - fortified team during this intense firefight .
So the package will contain those seven maps , plus the “ Flashback ” Map Pack , “ Combustible ” Map Pack , and the winter - themed “ Snowblind ” Map Pack .
You also get a poster , strategy guide , an Xbox Live theme , and a new video with Cliffy - B .
So your $ 20 is well spent , looking at everything you get in the retail package .
But what happens if you already own all the previous map packs ?
The " Dark Corners " map pack with the seven new maps and campaign chapter will be available as a download through Xbox Live .
The price ?
1600 points , or $ 20 .
Yup , no matter how you buy it , you 're paying for the old map packs .
I do n't know what the thought process behind this pricing could be , but man , that seems greedy .
That 's $ 2.85 a map , approximately .
No poster for you , either .
The retail package is a find if you 're playing catch - up with all the older maps , but everyone else is getting scammed .
Both the download and the retail product will be available for purchase on July 28 for $ 19.99 .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Two U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement lawyers are under investigation by federal criminal authorities for allegedly using insider information to trade stocks , a report by the SEC ’s internal watchdog said .
Traders work at the New York Stock Exchange , March 27 , 2009 .

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Attorney ’s Office are conducting an investigation of possible criminal and civil violations , the SEC ’s inspector general David Kotz said in a March 3 letter to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro .
Kotz ’s report said his investigation revealed suspicious activity , appearance of improprieties and evidence of possible trading on nonpublic information and / or potential insider trading on the part of two SEC enforcement lawyers .
The report redacts the names of the enforcement lawyers .
Both the report and letter were made available on Friday .
The report alleges the two lawyers traded in stock of a large financial services company even though another SEC employee became aware of three separate enforcement investigations of that company .
That employee told the two enforcement lawyers that she could not buy more stock in this company because she had become aware of these investigations .
But the two lawyers did trade in the financial services company and denied they heard about the investigations , the report alleges .
Kotz ’s report does not say whether the two lawyers profited from their trades .
The report also alleges the two lawyers maintained separate folders entitled “ stocks ” in their e-mail accounts and that they often sent e-mails from their SEC account about stocks and their own transactions .
It is not clear whether this violates SEC rules .
One lawyer sent e-mails to his brother and sister - in - law from his SEC e-mail account during the work day recommending particular stocks and sometimes informing his relatives that the other lawyer had also recommended them , the report alleges .
Kotz ’s office , which is investigating how the SEC handled the Bernard Madoff case , obtained and reviewed more than two years of e-mail records of the two SEC lawyers and the enforcement staffer .
His office also reviewed their personnel folders and conduct folders .
An SEC spokesman said : “ We note that the report neither accuses any SEC employee of insider trading nor concludes that any such conduct took place . ”
Kotz ’s report recommends the SEC immediately begin to institute steps to better monitor employee compliance , among other things .
The spokesman said when Schapiro arrived at the SEC she made it a priority to improve the agency ’s ethics and compliance programs around employee stock ownership .
Senate Democrats Deny Specter Committee Seniority
By Paul Kane
The Senate dealt a blow tonight to Sen.
Arlen Specter 's hold on seniority in several key committees , a week after the Pennsylvanian 's party switch placed Democrats on the precipice of a 60 - seat majority .
In a unanimous voice vote , the Senate approved a resolution that added Specter to the Democratic side of the dais on the five committees on which he serves , an expected move that gives Democrats larger margins on key panels such as Judiciary and Appropriations .
But Democrats placed Specter in one of the two most junior slots on each of the five committees for the remainder of this Congress , which goes through December 2010 .
Democrats have suggested that they will consider revisiting Specter 's seniority claim at the committee level only after the midterm elections next year .
" This is all going to be negotiated next Congress , " Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D - Nev. ) , said tonight .
Specter 's office declined to comment .
Without any assurance of seniority , Specter loses a major weapon in his campaign to win reelection in 2010 : the ability to claim that his nearly 30 years of Senate service places him in key positions to benefit his constituents .
Tonight 's committee resolution , quickly read on the Senate floor by Reid himself , contradicts Specter 's assertion last Tuesday when he publicly announced his move from the Republican side of the aisle .
He told reporters that he retained his seniority both in the overall chamber and in the committees on which he serves .
Specter said that becoming chairman of the Appropriations Committee was a personal goal of his , one that would be within reach if he were granted his seniority on the panel and placed as the third - most senior Democrat there .
Specter , if granted seniority , would also be next in line to chair the Judiciary Committee behind the current chairman , Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) .
Without that seniority , though , Specter , 79 , would not even hold an appropriations subcommittee chairmanship in 2011 , a critical foothold Specter has used in the past to disperse billions of dollars to Pennsylvania .
When Supreme Court nomination hearings are held later this summer , Specter will be the last senator to ask questions of the eventual nominee -- a dramatically lower profile than in 2005 and 2006 , when he chaired the committee and ran the confirmations of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr .
Democrats could decide after the 2010 midterms to reward Specter for his move by granting him seniority on committees , but recent precedent has not been kind to such situations .
In 2002 , for instance , Frank Lautenberg came out of retirement to bail out New Jersey Democrats , agreeing to run in place of the ethically disgraced incumbent , Robert G. Torricelli ( D ) . Lautenberg won a seat that was once thought to be out of reach .
But despite his 18 years of prior Senate service , Democrats relegated him to the most junior positions on committees .
Specter , after 43 years as an active Republican , will have to prove his Democratic loyalty over the next 20 months to his colleagues in order to win their support for his seniority .
That effort has gotten off to a rocky start following an interview he gave with the New York Times Magazine , to be published this Sunday .
Specter joked about how Norm Coleman could possibly win his legal contest and reclaim his Minnesota Senate seat , assuring there would still be at least one Jewish Republican in the chamber .
Specter backtracked from those comments in an interview with Congressional Quarterly today ,
" In the swirl of moving from one caucus to another , I have to get used to my new teammates , " he told CQ .
" I 'm ordinarily pretty correct in what I say .
I 've made a career of being precise .
I conclusively misspoke . "
May 14 , 2009  --
The Carlyle Group , a giant Wall Street firm best known for its ties to former President George H.W. Bush and other prominent public officials , made more than $ 13 million in payments to a indicted political fixer who arranged for the firm to receive business from a New York pension fund , New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo said today .
Cuomo said Carlyle had agreed to $ 20 million to " resolve its role " in the ongoing corruption investigation and agreed to a new code of conduct that prohibits the use of such middlemen .
Cuomo said the code would " help eliminate the conflicts of interest and corruption inherent in a system that allows people to buy access to those holding the pension fund purse - strings . "
Carlyle is the latest high - profile firm to be ensnared in a nationwide probe known as the " pay for play " scandal because Wall Street firms allegedly paid politically - connected fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by public officials .
According to Cuomo , his corruption investigation found that in 2003 , Carlyle hired Hank Morris , the chief political aide to then New York state comptroller Alan Hevesi , as " a placement agent " to help obtain investments from the New York Common Retirement Fund .
" If Boss Tweed were alive today , he would be a placement agent , " Cuomo said .
In a statement , Carlyle said it " was unaware of any improper conduct " and " was victimized by Hank Morris ' alleged web of deceit . "
Carlyle said it intended to file suit against Morris and has " cooperated extensively and voluntarily " with Cuomo .
Carlyle paid Morris through shell companies he controlled , according to Cuomo .
Morris allegedly shared the payments with a hedge fund manager , Barrett Wissman , who pleaded guilty earlier this year to securities fraud in connection with the investigation .
Until it hired Morris , said Cuomo , Carlyle had " experienced limited success in obtaining investments " from the New York state fund .
Carlyle then received more than $ 730 million in New York state pension funds for five different projects , according to Cuomo .
Carlyle employees also made about $ 78,000 in campaign contributions to Comptroller Hevesi 's campaign in 2005 and 2006 , according to Cuomo , some solicited by Morris .
Morris was indicted in March in the " pay for play " investigation for allegedly arranging " sham placement fees " for himself and other Hevesi " political cronies " and for extracting " millions of dollars in campaign contributions " to ensure " the Comptroller 's approval of their proposed investments . "
Morris has pleaded not guilty to the charges .
Hevesi has not been charged .
Politically - Connected Powerhouse Firm
Carlyle is a politically connected powerhouse whose board of advisors has been graced by the names of numerous political luminaries from both the Democratic and Republican Parties including former President Bush , his Secretary of State James Baker III , former Secretary of State Colin Powell , former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt , Britain 's former Prime Minister John Major , ex-Time magazine media glitterati Norman Pearlstein and former Clinton White House Chief of Staff , Mack McLarty .
The firm is currently headed by the highly regarded ex-IBM CEO Lou Gerstner .
Carlyle is the first firm to sign the Code of Conduct , which Cuomo first proposed in April .
The Code eliminates the role of middlemen who are hired , retained or compensated for the specific purpose of obtaining pension dollars .
The language is carefully worded to allow for the use of marketing department employees and marketing firms .
According to union records , Carlyle received $ 878 million in private equity investment from " the New York State Common Retirement Fund . "
The fund 's $ 122 billion in assets is for the retirement benefits of state and local employees in New York .
The state paid total management and incentive fees of $ 37.5 million between 2005 and 2008 to Carlyle , according to fund records .
The fund is the third largest in the nation .
The firm has allowed only two outside partners into its ranks over the years .
The nations largest public retirement fund -- the California Public Employee Retirement Fund -- paid $ 175 million for 5.5 percent of Carlyle : now worth a considerable amount more .
The other is Abu Dhabi , the once high growth sheikhdom that paid about $ 1.5. billion for 7.5 percent of the firm .
Cuomo's wide ranging probe has already resulting in two guilty pleas in New York State .
According to published accounts it is said to be one of 30 such probes across the nation .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a related civil suit .
Unregulated Middlemen
In the closely regulated and monitored world of public employee fund investment , the use of unregulated middlemen has been a loophole through which , in return for passing public funds to private firms , at least in some cases , public corruption has resulted , Cuomo 's office has charged .
The practice is rife with the potential for quid - pro-quo , including pay - for - play political contributions , and revolving door government to private sector job hopping , his office and union officials have said .
At the end of April , Cuomo said that practice of using unregulated middlemen to garner public pension fund dollars results in " the worst of both worlds . "
" This is the nexus of private - sector fraudulent operators meeting fraudulent government and political operators , " Cuomo said , according to Bloomberg News .
At the center of the storm is one time New York Democratic Party operative Morris who is accused of steering state pension fund business to firms that paid him millions in kickbacks .
Morris is the target of a 123 count indictment unsealed by Cuomo 's office in March .
It accuses Morris of pension fund related activities including " enterprise corruption , securities fraud , grand larceny , bribery and money laundering . "
At the time of the indictment Cuomo 's office said in a statement , " If proven , the allegations in the indictment reveal a complex criminal scheme involving numerous individuals operating at the highest political and governmental levels of the Office of the State Comptroller .
The charges entail a web of corrupt acts for both political and personal gain .
Also under scrutiny is a firm co-founded by Steve Rattner , President Obama 's auto industry Czar .
That firm , Quadrangle , used Morris firm and is under the spotlight for allegedly failing to disclose the relationship .
Carlyle began receiving New York dollars when Alan Hevesi was state comptroller .
Hevesi pled guilty for a single felony unrelated to his fund management .
Morris was Hevesi 's political consultant .

In the four closest ZIP codes – 60641 , 60618 , 60639 , 60647 – more than 135,000 people were uninsured , according to public data .
Also , there were few safety - net health care facilities in the area – clinics and hospitals whose mission it is to serve the poor and the uninsured .
The longtime friends wanted to locate the clinic in an area with a significant need for health care services .
Market research helped them pick the neighborhood around Addison Street and Pulaski Road .
Dr. Charles Martinez , 74 , who worked as a nuclear medicine specialist , was n’t initially inclined to go along .
But then , at a medical school reunion , he heard an 87 - year - old colleague talk about starting a free clinic and his interest was piqued .
Soon , he embraced the project .
George Maltezos , 72 , came up with the idea first .
“ Each of us felt we needed to do something after retirement , ” said Maltezos , a former mental health and substance abuse professional .
“ And we both were fully aware of how many people do n’t have health insurance . ”
As boys , they lived across the street from each other on the Near North Side .
They ’ve been buddies ever since .
Now , these two older men are engaged in a demanding venture – providing free health care to the uninsured .
A search for space turned up a 750 - square - foot storefront at 4008 W. Addison St. – just enough for two examining rooms -- and the Old Irving Park Community Clinic opened its doors in December 2007 .
Since then , 400 patients have been scheduled for 1,000 medical visits , Maltezos said .
To qualify for care , people have to establish they ’re uninsured , meet income guidelines ( under 250 percent of the federal poverty level , or $ 27,000 for a single person ) and have symptoms or a previously diagnosed existing medical condition such as diabetes .
( The clinic does n’t perform routine physicals or take care of pregnant women . )
Each patient gets a comprehensive assessment and evaluation before being connected with a physician .
Medical visits are by appointment only .
For mental health or substance abuse issues , people are referred to community resources .
It ’s a volunteer operation , funded entirely by private donations and staffed by 10 physicians , 10 nurses , 16 people who contribute clerical services and a part - time paid nurse manager .
If a patient needs specialty care , Martinez turns to rheumatologists , orthopedic surgeons , endocrinologists , dermatologists , cardiologists , podiatrists and gynecologists who have agreed to donate services .
Patients go to a nearby Quest Diagnostics service center for laboratory tests , and the clinic picks up the discounted charge .
For medications , people go to Walgreens , CVS or Target for prescriptions that typically cost $ 4 apiece .
If expensive drugs are required , clinic volunteers try to negotiate a price - break with the manufacturer .
For surgery , patients are referred to Cook County ’s Stroger Hospital .
That leaves a major gap : securing costly imaging studies such as CT scans , MRIs or ultrasounds for patients .
Martinez has asked seven local hospitals to contribute two imaging studies each month .
So far , two have said yes and one is on the cusp , he said .
“ It ’s a little overwhelming , to be perfectly frank , ” said Maltezos , who ’s working harder in his retirement than he did when employed full time .
“ When you compare what we ’re doing to the need that ’s out there , we ’re not even close to providing a significant level of care . ”
Still , the work is a source of satisfaction to both founders .
Martinez said he knows what families are going through from his own experience .
His parents , who had 11 kids , never had much money or any health insurance when he was growing up .
The doctor remembers running into a steel fence when he was 15 years old and thinking “ How are we going to pay for this ? ” as he was taken to the hospital .
To be able to give back now to others in need , he said , is “ very rewarding because the people we ’re helping have no place else to turn . ”
To contact the clinic , call ( 773 ) 427-0298 .
Fear of the unknown continues to grip Capital Markets .
Equities struggle as rhetoric about losses at Financials are grossly underestimated .
US FI class remains better bid , not on the back of the buy - back program , but as a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsaferÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ asset class and all this despite $ 2.5t worth of supply having to be absorbed .
Even the greenback is gnawing its way to global dominance as investors look for that bit of extra quality for now .
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 12 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Twiddling of the thumbs was the order of yesterday as copious amounts of bad news scrolled across the tickers deflating global optimism like a flat tire .
Equities and commodities continue to find it difficult to get off the canvas , like an punched drunk boxer , they seem well beaten as the doomsayers continue to dominate the floorshow .
It has been difficult to maintain the 4 - week market hype , just when we though it was safe to come out and play again , risk aversion strategies are being strapped on .
It is rumored that the IMF is expected to announce that the toxic debts racked up by banks and insurers could spiral to $ 4t , not the $ 2.2t already declared .
By default , banks will need even more capital as losses continue to mount .
Expect to see more going bust and more being nationalized !
A scary stat that appeared yesterday , to date with almost $ 1.3t of losses and write - downs at financial institutions worldwide , mix this with the deepest recession in over 50 - years and what do we have ?
MoodyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s announcing an expected global default rate to peak at 14.6 % in the 4th Q .
There is a bright side to this , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s lower than last months + 15.3 % forecast due to bond spreads declining moderately .
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.59 % , GBP - 0.59 % , CHF - 0.49 % and lower against JPY +0.71 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.31 % and AUD - 0.97 % .
The loonie remained little changed yesterday and continues to error on the side of weakness as global equities and commodities take it on the chin .
This has persuaded speculators to gravitate towards the greenback as they shy away from riskier assets .
Canadian fundamentals this week have not helped the currencyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s cause ; building permits fell by 4 - times the expected pace last month , further proof of how weak the housing sector remains north of the border .
Other factors continue to contribute to a weaker CAD , BOC Governor Carney will announce at the end of this month a plan that would Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœflood banks with cash to halt the hoarding of capital and expand lending Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
We have witnessed other currencies depreciate significantly when their governments entertained quantitative easing methods ( BOE , BOJ , Fed ) .
Secondly , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s difficult to want to own the currency ahead of this weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s employment numbers tomorrow .
For now , one should expect to buy USD on pull backs .
Weaker fundamental data down under continues to put pressure on the AUD , as it enters its longest losing streak this year at 4 - days .
Risk aversion strategies and investor speculation that both equities and commodities will continue to underperform has traders shying away from the higher yielding currencies .
Look to sell on upticks ( 0.7081 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 48.00 down - 120 c ) .
Crude prices slipped yesterday as US equities declined on speculation that bank loan losses will continue to increase and on speculation that the weekly EIA report this morning will show US increased their inventories for the 24th week as this recession curbs fuel demand .
Nervousness about the equity markets has heightened again after analysts recommended selling financials .
Traders are also concerned that the IEA will probably lower its global demand forecast again this month because of slowing world economic growth .
Until we see inventories decline substantially , there will not be a sustained gain in price .
Oil temporarily advanced last week after leaders at the G20 agreed on measures to fight the global recession .
However , industrial reports showing that rising oil inventories and falling demand continues to signal that the worst of the recession may not be over .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report showed that US stock levels rose to a 15 - year high as this global recession continues to curb demand .
It was the 23rd gain in 27 - weeks .
Inventories climbed + 2.84 m barrels to +359.4 m vs. an expected increase of +3 m .
Most surprising was gas supplies , which unexpectedly rose by +2.23 m barrels to +216.8 m w/w.
Investors should treat last weeks advances as a bear market rally until the 2nd - half of the year when by then we will have burned off some of the excess .
Gold has found a toe - hole in the O/N session , the 1st - time in four sessions on speculation that the credit crisis will deepen , thus boosting the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢sÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ appeal as a safer haven ( $ 889 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,595 down - 237 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,284 down - 37 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,904 down - 25 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 3 bp yesterday ( 2.87 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
The front end of the US yield curve fell as investorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s sought the safety of Government bonds as equities fell for a second day on the back of corporate profit concerns yesterday and all this despite the US Government issuing another $ 55+ b of new debt this week !
Supply will eventually trump demand .

You could lose all of your deposited funds .
Just a year ago , working as a product presenter at an auto show was a pretty straightforward job .
You stood next to a vehicle , you called it a marvel of engineering , style and comfort and then you fielded softball questions like , “ What does this baby cost ? ”
But that was before the bailout .
Now that the government has helped General Motors and Chrysler stave off bankruptcy with billions of dollars in loans , these companies are finding somewhat hostile crowds at their exhibits .
Which leads to scenes like the one on Friday at the New York auto show , where a blond woman in a tight black dress stood on a rotating platform and pitched the sporty Dodge Circuit , one of five electric cars that Chrysler is developing .
Donald Han , an accountant from Queens , sounded unmoved .
“ Why now ? ” he asked the woman , rather curtly , once she had finished her patter .
“ How come you ’ve got to nearly go bankrupt before you come out with a car like this ? ”
Long a glamorous showcase for carmakers , auto shows have lately become a place for buyers and gawkers to vent .
Few of the attendees at the Javits Center , where the New York show runs until Sunday , will ever encounter a top executive from G.M. or Chrysler .
But all of them get within heckling range of the presenters and for some , that is good enough .
Sheriff Lott Prepared to Take Phelps ‘ Pot Shots ’
Total Pro Sports -
Just when it seemed like all the buzz about Michael Phelps pot smoking was over , it took a turn for the better ?
Yes , for the better .
What many seemed to think was a big joke , as Sheriff Lott looked to round up all those involved in the popular Phelps bong pics , actually turned in to a joke at a Rotary speech on Monday .
Putting a comedic twist on the whole story , Sheriff Lott put on his bullet proof vest to protect himself from “ pot shots ” , draped himself in medals , and even wore a blond wig .
The interview was not all about the comedy act as he had the following to say :
“ It does n’t matter if it ’s Michael Phelps or who it is .
If you break the law , you ’ve got to be held to the same standard .
That ’s what the law ’s all about . ”
So is he trying to tell us all that he would have taken the same action had he seen a picture of any other random person smoking weed ?
I doubt it , but its about time this story , which seemed to be a joke all along , is finally treated as one .
Just one comment though .
With everyone questioning the actions of Phelps , has anyone questioned his true athletic ability .
I mean , a guy who can break all those records can smoke a bong like a champ too .
Now that ’s talent .
That has also got to make you question the true nature of marijuana smoking .
Maybe it really is n’t as bad as all those conservative seniors tell us .
As for the speech , here it is thanks to The State Newspaper :

I have no rights .
I have no right to freedom from discrimination .
I have no right to secure employment .
I have no right to a safe place to live .
I do n’t even have the right to go to the washroom in peace .
It ’s amazing that I can sit here in the 21st century , in Canada , and be able to say that .
Let me say that again slightly differently : Because I ’m a transsexual person , I have no right to legal protection in case I get discriminated against for being trans .
None at all .
How does this happen ?
It happens because transsexuals are one of the last populations not covered under Canada ’s ( not to say anything about British Columbia ’s ) human - rights legislation .
Because of this lack , Vancouver Rape Relief and Women ’s Shelter was able to exclude Kimberly Nixon simply because she was assigned male at birth .
This case was taken all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada , where on February 1 , 2007 , the cisgendered ( the opposite of transgendered ) judges decided to leave transpeople in legal limbo .
They decided that Kimberly is not enough of a woman to be allowed to work at a women ’s shelter .
Because of this decision , my brothers , sisters , and I can be kicked out of any public space , we can be fired simply for the crime of being ourselves , we can be evicted without recourse , and we can be reviled , harassed , and even physically attacked merely for daring to use a public washroom .
Granted , few of these things have happened to me because I ’m one of the lucky ones .
I ’m just another middle - aged woman .
I blend in well enough that on most days the very worst that will happen to me is someone will get a puzzled look on their face as they try and fit me into one of two mental boxes in their head marked “ male ” or “ female ” .
Some of my brothers and especially sisters are not so lucky .
They do n’t “ pass ” .
They visibly bend the boundaries of gendered expression , which threatens the identities of cisgendered people .
Threatened people tend to react violently .
They may attack , verbally or physically .
They may withhold essential services .
Tyra Hunter was a transwoman in Washington , D.C. , who in 1995 was allowed to bleed to death by emergency workers , who stopped treating her after discovering she was trans and stood back cracking jokes while she bled and suffered in front of them .
Later after finally being transported to a hospital , she was left to die , having received almost no care .
None of the emergency workers and hospital staff who stood back and let her die were ever disciplined .
Threatened employers may choose to fire a transperson rather than be forced to work with them .
Threatened landlords may decide to evict a transperson .
Even the most fundamental portion of my identity is not mine to control ; anyone at any time may choose to deny my identity and impose their own perceptions upon me .
It happens every time I get called “ sir ” .
This has implications that go far beyond the boundaries of the trans community .
How many butch lesbians have been asked to leave a washroom ?
How many gay males were bullied in school for being “ a sissy ” ?
How many times has a homophobic act really been motivated by the transgression of gender norms ?
Transgressing gender norms is one of the severest social “ crimes ” , and the punishment is swift and brutal .
Right now , all of what I have listed above is legal .
Anyone can do any of these horrible things and get away with it .
Transpeople are treated equally brutally by the media .
It ’s still socially acceptable to laugh at us , label us deceivers , hyper - sexualize us , and make our struggles with our bodies the sole factor of our existence .
Look at the characters of Dil in The Crying Game , Lois Einhorn in Ace Ventura : Pet Detective , Roberta Muldoon in The World According to Garp .
Look at the controversy surrounding Isis on America ’s Next Top Model , and the sordid mess that was There ’s Something About Miriam .
The media teaches that treating transsexuals badly is okay , that we ’re not “ real ” enough to warrant compassion and decent treatment .
This situation is intolerable , and it must not be allowed to continue .
All is not bleak , however ; a solution is being worked toward .
Last summer , B.C. ’s Trans Alliance Society began circulating a petition asking the legislature to amend the B.C. Human Rights Code “ so as to include and to specify ” ˜gender identity and gender expression ’ as a prohibited ground of discrimination for all purposes of that legislation in British Columbia ” .
I have no rights .
So , how about it , Gordon Campbell , may I have my rights ?
Jessica Cooper is just another middle - aged woman with a colourful past .
She works for a national retail chain designing department stores , and when she ’s not doing that she ’s fighting for the right of transpeople to be themselves with dignity .
She encourages anyone ( trans or cisgendered ) who wishes to fight beside her to contact the Trans Alliance Society .
Social networking giant Facebook has implemented support for OpenID logins .
The move reflects Facebook 's growing support for interoperability and open standards .
It 's also a win for OpenID , which is rapidly becoming ubiquitous .
OpenID is a distributed authentication system that allows a single login to be used with multiple Web services .
Originally developed for LiveJournal in 2005 , the system has gained significant traction and is now supported by a growing number of large companies , including Microsoft , Google , IBM , and Yahoo .
Many OpenID adopters , however , only support the provider part of the protocol — meaning that you can use your credentials from their service as your OpenID identity but you can't use OpenID to log into their service .
Facebook is doing the opposite .
In an announcement on Monday , the company revealed that it will become an OpenID " relying " party and that users will consequently be able to register for Facebook using their authentication credentials from compatible third - party services .
This makes Facebook the single largest Web service to implement relying party support .
It 's a somewhat intriguing move , because the site offers a service called Facebook Connect that is designed to compete with OpenID as an identity provision service .
In recent months , Facebook has been making a strong effort to expose some of the capabilities of its platform through open standards alongside its own APIs .
Another compelling example of this trend at Facebook is the recent launch of the website 's open stream API .
In addition to making the content of user activity streams accessible to third - party software developers through Facebook 's conventional REST API and FQL query system , the company also decided to supply an XML feed that uses Atom Activity Extensions , an emerging draft - status standard that is built on top of the Atom syndication format
Facebook has traditionally had a reputation for being a walled garden , and its third - party application platform is seemingly engineered to maximize lock - in .
The company 's newfound enthusiasm for interoperability is a promising sign that Facebook is undergoing a cultural shift and is beginning to appreciate the value of playing well with others .
It 's worth noting that the move is n't entirely motivated by a love for open standards .
Facebook has discovered that the practical value of OpenID extends beyond interoperability .
In the company 's official announcement , Facebook engineer Luke Shepard says that OpenID has helped to streamline the registration and login process , lowering the barrier to entry for new users .
This helps Facebook boost its audience and increases the percentage of users that will stick with the service after signing up .
" Over the past several months , we 've taken a number of steps that help to build a scalable , secure , and sustainable framework , one that further defines what it means to be an OpenID relying party , " he wrote .
" In tests we 've run , we 've noticed that first - time users who register on the site with OpenID are more likely to become active Facebook users .
They get up and running after registering even faster than before , find their friends easily , and quickly engage on the site . "
He says that users can now register for Facebook through OpenID , and existing users will also be able to link their Facebook accounts with an OpenID identity .
He characterizes these features as Facebook 's first steps as a member of the OpenID community .
Facebook joined the OpenID Foundation Board earlier this year and intends to participate in the ongoing evolution of the standard .
* Venezuela seizes big oil project from U.S. company
* Sends troops to take boatyards in oil heartland
* Opens door to takeovers of major oil contractors ( Recasts , adds Williams response , details on Wood Group contract , protesters wounded )
CIUDAD OJEDA , Venezuela , May 8 ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez sent troops to seize oil service companies on Friday , tightening his grip on the oil industry as low crude prices pinch the OPEC nation ’s finances .
Chavez is a socialist and former soldier who has already nationalized large chunks of the OPEC nation ’s economy , including most of the energy sector and telecommunications companies .
Williams Companies WMB.N said the government seized two natural gas facilities in eastern Venezuela after building up millions of dollars in debts for services , adding it could demand payment through international arbitration .
Military vehicles rolled through the streets of Ciudad Ojeda , on the shores of oil heartland Lake Maracaibo , where the government seized hundreds of boats and shipyards after Chavez signed a law to nationalize a group of oil service companies .
“ We have started to nationalize all these activities connected to oil exploitation , ” Chavez said from a confiscated boat sailing across the lake .
“ This is a revolutionary offensive . ”
Williams said the government took over the El Furrial and PIGAP II gas compression facilities , which are crucial for boosting the production of fields that produce Venezuela ’s most valuable crude .
Flush with cash amid an oil boom , the president in 2007 nationalized oil projects worth billions of dollars , leading oil giants Exxon Mobil XOM.N and ConocoPhillips COP.N to quit the nation and sue for compensation .
Crude revenues have fallen in recent months and Chavez is now moving against smaller service companies the government has struggled to pay .
The new law gives the government the option to pay compensation in bonds rather than cash .
NEW TAKEOVERS
The move could lead to further declines in oil production by risking slowdowns in key services following years of underinvestment by state - owned oil company PDVSA , which bankrolls the social programs that keep Chavez popular after a decade in office .
The law makes it easier for the government to later seize assets owned by service giants such as Halliburton HAL.N and Schlumberger SLB.N as PDVSA builds up billions of dollars in debts with contractors .
It appears to be targeted at specific service companies that have been hampered by severe cash flow problems due to lack of payment by PDVSA , which as of last year owed at least $ 8 billion to contractors and providers .
Chavez told hundreds of oil workers dressed in the red shirts that identify his supporters that the takeovers included a water injection project part - owned by British company John Wood Group WG.L .
Six people demonstrating near Maracaibo , across the lake from Chavez ’s rally , suffered gunshot wounds when an unidentified gunmen fired on them , the investigative police in Maracaibo said .
Wood Group WG.L said on Friday it was in a strong position to extract compensation for the loss of its 49.5 percent interest in a 16 - year , $ 800 million contract in Lake Maracaibo .
According to Williams ’ filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , it has three gas compressor facilities in Venezuela with a net book value of $ 324 million .
Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said the facilities help PDVSA pump 500,000 barrels of crude per day from Venezuela ’s best quality fields in the eastern state of Monagas .
Other oil service companies in Venezuela include Baker Hughes BHI.N and BJ Services BJS.N .

GOD ’S mercy is not everlasting .
That is why there is death and hell .
Californians will vote Yes on Proposition 8 to establish marriage between a man and woman or they will go down for their wickedness .
In November voters all over the United States should demand that its political leaders reconfirm that the United State is a GOD fearing country or it will move closer to becoming a Third World Country .
GOD will bring this country to its knees via natural disasters that will turn into financial disasters .
From the presidential to local candidates , every politician who stands with and for gay marriage must be defeated in November .
And then Americans must make it clear that the president and governors who nominate gay sympathizers to judgeships will be defeated in the next election .
Following the end of the nearly week - long hostage standoff off the coast of Somalia ( which ended when US troops shot and killed three pirates in a lifeboat ) , there is growing talk both inside and outside the military of how to launch further attacks against the piracy infrastructure along the coast and whether this will include ground attacks in Somalia itself .
At the moment , the military is mulling attacks against the coastal towns used as a base of operations for Somalia ’s pirates , in addition to drawing up proposals to provide American aid to prop up the faltering Somali government .
So far , defense officials insist they are n’t seriously considering anything on the scale of the 1992 invasion of Somalia , which ended in failure .
Whichever operations are taken will presumably be coordinated through AFRICOM , America ’s recently - created operational command for Africa .
But after a week in the news , support for US intervention in the nation seems to be growing .
Senator Russ Feingold ( D – WI ) slammed the Bush Administration for having “ neglected ” Somalia ( the Bush Administration did support the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia ) and has urged President Obama to “ commit to a comprehensive strategy ” aimed at propping up the government .
Former American Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton called for both air strikes and a full - fledged ground invasion of Somalia .
Yet support for American troops without Somalia is likely to be tepid , at best .
Rep. Donald Payne ( D – NJ ) made a visit to Somalia where he defended the killings – Somali insurgents fired mortars at him .
After its support for a particularly bloody Ethiopian occupation , Somalis seems unlikely to take America ’s new - found interest with anything but trepidation , and military intervention would likely be met with fierce opposition from Somalia ’s insurgencies .
Two of the biggest legends in popular music are reportedly planning to team up for the first time .
Superb prices on musical instruments
bass guitar legend Sir Paul McCartney is planning to collaborate with his 60s contemporary Bob Dylan .
Both artists have enjoyed considerable success in the last few months , with Sir Paul 's Electric Arguments album attracting excellent reviews , and Dylan 's recent record topping the charts .
An insider told the Express : " Getting these two together for any length of time is difficult schedule - wise , but they both want this to work out . "
The source added that the music that emerges from a collaboration would be " fascinating " to hear .
Dylan made his name with just an acoustic guitar and a harmonica in the early 1960s , writing songs which reflected the mood of the time such as The Times They Are A - Changing and Blowing in the Wind .
Sir Paul , meanwhile , followed his success in the Beatles with Wings and a solo career that has included collaborations with Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder .

Crohn 's disease is a painful immune disorder that causes people 's intestines to swell .
Some researchers say that the intestines of Crohn sufferers reject the bacteria normally needed for proper functioning .
The prescribed treatments have horrible side effects , including cancer and brain infections .
Some people with Crohn 's are electing to be infected with parasitic hookworms instead .
In order to live as a parasite inside the human , the parasite must convince the host 's immune system to chill and not try to reject it .
With hookworms , they secrete a chemical that distracts the immune system , dampening down its response .
Hookworms are common in undeveloped countries , places where inflammatory bowel disease is rare .
In the United States , thanks to advances in modern sanitation techniques , hookworms are rare but immune disorders on the rise .
Is there a connection ?
There could be .
" As we have made things more hygienic , " Dr. Terdiman explained , " we may in fact be precipitating an outbreak or an increase in the frequency of these immune disorders . "
Worm Therapy is a company that uses hookworms and tapeworms to modulate the immune system .
A single dose of hookworms costs $ 2,399 and tapeworms ( used for weight loss , asthma and allergy ) cost $ 1,299 .

Some anonymous Planet Python poster ( at least I could n't find the author 's name on the blog ) Christian Wyglendowski asks about a surprising difference between old - style and new - style classes .
Since the comments on their blog are closed ( which you find out only after pressing Submit ) , I 'll answer here .
The question , slightly paraphrased : given a class
class LameContainerOld : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
_items = { ' bar ' : ' test ' } def __getitem__ ( self , name ) : return self .
_items [ name ] def __getattr__ ( self , attr ) : return getattr ( self .
_items , attr )
why does the ' in ' operator work
>>> container = LameContainerOld ( ) >>> ' foo ' in container False >>> ' bar ' in container True
when the equivalent new - style class raises a KeyError : 0 exception ?
Also , why does __getattr__ appear to be called to get the bound __getitem__ method of the dict ?
>>> container .
__getitem__ < bound method LameContainerNew.__getitem__ of {'bar ' : ' test'} >
What actually happens here is that LameOldContainer .__getattr__ gets called for special methods such as __contains__ and __repr__ .
This is why ( 1 ) the ' in ' check works , and ( 2 ) it appears , at first glance , that you get the wrong __getitem__ bound method .
If you pay close attention to the output , you 'll see that it's the __getitem__ of LameOldContainer ; it 's just that repr( LameOldContainer ( ) ) gets proxied through to the dict .
__repr__ when you do n't expect it :
>>> container {' bar ' : ' test'}
Special methods never go through __getattr__ for new - style classes , therefore neither __contains__ nor __repr__ are proxied if you make the container inherit object .
If there 's no __contains__ method , Python falls back to the sequence protocol and starts calling __getitem__ for numbers 0 through infinity , or until it gets an IndexError exception .

But in many cases , agents and loan officers say , first - time buyers are receiving loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration , which allow for lower credit scores and a down payment of only 3.5 percent .
Unlike the subprime mortgages doled out a few years ago to nearly anyone who asked , F.H.A. loans include strict income requirements .
Buyers must document two years of employment history with pay stubs and W - 2 forms that are verified by the underwriter , and they can typically borrow only around 31 percent of their income , or 43 percent when other debt is included .
Andrea Heuson , a finance professor at the University of Miami , said the tighter restrictions should help ensure that people who buy can afford to pay what they owe  as long as they keep their jobs .

A second risk is that these new buyers will walk away if property values continue to drop .
Jennifer Vaughn ’s development in Homestead is one of many where prices seem to fall by the day .
A 26 - year - old first - time buyer , Ms. Vaughn closed on a three - bedroom , three - bathroom townhouse in November , paying $ 87,000 for the foreclosed property with an F.H.A. loan .
The price was far below the $ 261,000 the house sold for in October 2006 , but a few weeks ago , a townhouse with the same layout and fancier features sold for $ 75,000 .
And a third is about to close for $ 65,000 , said Andy Lopez , a real estate agent at Keyes Company Realtors who found Ms. Vaughn her townhouse .
So already , she appears to owe more than her home is worth .
Not that she minds .
“ I ’m going to stay for five or six years at least , ” Ms. Vaughn said , “ and I ’m sure prices will go up somewhat by then . ”
What ’s a window manager ?
– 1.1
When talking about the graphical user interface in Linux , people use confusing terms such as “ X Windows ” , “ Window Manager ” , and “ Desktop Environment ” .
Maybe you ’re wondering what ’s the difference between these three – do n’t they all mean the graphical user interface ?
This tuXfile clears the terminology a bit .
< The X Window System >
Microsoft Windows is based on a graphical user interface ( GUI for short ) where you can control the apps by pointing and clicking .
But Linux , just like Unix or MS - DOS , is completely text based .
This means that everything in Linux can be done without any GUI , and it ’s a plus when using Linux , for example , as a server because the computer ’s resources are n’t wasted in running a GUI .
However , most of us normal home users want a pretty GUI where we can use graphical apps and point and click to our heart ’s content .
So how do we get to the GUI ?
Because Linux is text based , you run the GUI on top of it .
In Unix the GUI is called X Window System or X for short .
The term X Windows is also widely used , but it ’s technically incorrect .
I personally use the incorrect term anyway , because it ’s short and handy , but keep in mind some Linux users avoid using the term X Windows .
The X Window System makes it possible to run graphical apps on Linux .
X is responsible for the hardware related settings : it controls , for example , the mouse , keyboard , and the monitor settings like refresh rate and resolution .
The graphical apps themselves do n’t need to care for the hardware they ’re running on .
The apps just talk to X and tell it what they want to display .
X listens to the apps and converts the apps ’ display commands into something that the graphics hardware can display .
So , X makes it possible for the graphical apps to display their interface on the screen , but X does n’t control the windows where the apps are displayed .
The Linux version of X used to be XFree86 , but these days , most newer distros use X.org .
X.org is a fork of XFree86 that was created because of some licensing issues .
So , if you want a GUI in Linux , you must run X.org on top of it .
Most Linux users , including me , mean XFree86 or X.org when they say X Windows or X Window System , or just X .
OTTAWA – Brian Mulroney paid income tax on only half of the $ 225,000 he received from German - Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber , a public inquiry learned today .
It was the first time it has become known that Mulroney actually paid taxes on only $ 112,500 of the money he received in cash payments from Schreiber in 1993 - 94 - - not the total amount of income .
Mulroney held off declaring the payments for tax purposes until 1999 , when he learned that Schreiber was arrested and charged in Germany with bribery , tax evasion and fraud .
Mulroney told the inquiry headed by Justice Jeffrey Oliphant that he did n't pay taxes on the money for several years because he considered the payments to be a retainer .
The amount of taxes paid came as a result of talks with federal and provincial tax authorities , Guy Pratte , Mulroney 's lawyer , said .
Previous information heard at the inquiry suggested Mulroney had paid taxes on the entire $ 225,000 .
Mulroney also said the scandals that have plagued him have made him the most investigated prime minister in the 142 - year history of Canada .
" On July 1 , this country will be 142 years old , " he told a public inquiry today .
" We 've had 22 prime ministers .
I have been investigated more thoroughly and at a greater cost than all 21 other prime ministers combined . "
Despite that , Mulroney said , no one has ever pinned anything on him : " There was no evidence of any kind that I had ever done anything wrong in my life . "
As well , Mulroney admitted that he would have preferred that the controversial payments he received from Schreiber had never become public .
" Obviously , I would have been happier had that not come out , " he testified .
Revealing that he received $ 225,000 from Schreiber would have exposed him and his family to more pressure from police investigators and reporters , Mulroney testified .
He blames them for launching the Airbus investigation that led to Mulroney 's successful libel lawsuit against the federal government .
Mulroney was asked about earlier testimony by author William Kaplan , who said the former prime minister waged a " brutal " campaign to persuade him not to divulge the $ 225,000 payments in a 2003 newspaper article .
" My , my , my -- what a sensitive soul , " Mulroney scoffed , saying he had faced much more trying verbal jousting in the House of Commons .
Mulroney also suggested he might reveal a key question behind the entire decades - old Mulroney - Schreiber affair – who was supposed to receive money from a secret Swiss bank account set up in 1993 and codenamed " Britan . "
The former prime minister said the Swiss account had nothing to do with him .
In an apparent attempt to divert attention away from himself , Mulroney said he had been told the codename was actually " Breton " and it was designed to provide money for a prominent Cape Breton figure .
But then he declined to name that person , saying he was n't going to " trample " on someone else 's reputation the way his had been in the years of controversy over the Airbus scandal .
Mulroney has said he received the money from Schreiber to promote the sale of military vehicles designed by Thyssen AG of Germany .
Schreiber represented the company , and Mulroney says he tried to promote the sale of Thyssen products abroad .
Mulroney also said today that he wanted a public inquiry with a far more wide - ranging mandate than the one now looking into his business dealings with Schreiber .

In a swipe at Prime Minister Stephen Harper , who set up the present inquiry after Mulroney requested it , Mulroney said just examining his dealings with Schreiber is inadequate .
The commission should go back to 1988 and look into the entire Airbus saga , he said .
" When I was asked , my request was to get this thing emptied once and for all and I especially asked that it go back to 1988 and begin and put 'em all in the box – all the prime ministers , all the ministers of justices , all of them , including the journalists , those who had sworn out false information , " he said .
Also this morning , inquiry counsel Richard Wolson said Schreiber , who is recovering at home from gall bladder surgery , will not be able to testify again this week as planned .

( CNN ) --
On a recent episode of " South Park , " Mr. Marsh steals a particle accelerator magnet so his son , Stan , can win the Pinewood Derby .
The magnet 's power results in an alien encounter , and chaos ensues .
The Compact Muon Solenoid , shown here in December , is one of six experiments inside the collider complex .
While the magnets at the real - life Large Hadron Collider may not reach extraterrestrials , scientists hope they will help lead to encounters with never - before - seen phenomena and answers to fundamental questions about the universe .
The collider , the world 's most powerful particle accelerator , is being repaired after an electrical failure in September .
Once it is fixed , the collider will circulate beams of particles with unprecedented energy .
When these particles crash into each other , the resulting activity may help scientists figure out why the submicroscopic stuff that makes up our universe behaves the way it does .
The Large Hadron Collider will start receiving current again in July , and will circulate this year 's first proton beam by the end of September , said Lyn Evans , former project leader for the collider who is currently involved with the machine 's repairs .
The collider is located more than 300 feet below the French - Swiss border at CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research .
See it on a map »
Scientists have been improving two of the main experiments , called ATLAS and CMS , by taking advantage of cosmic rays , which naturally occur and contain the same high - energy particles that will be used when the collider restarts .
This has helped experts better align and calibrate the detectors .
" They 'll be even more perfect than before , " said Bob Cousins , deputy to the scientific leader of the CMS experiment .
ATLAS and CMS were designed to carry out their full physics programs with some parts that do n't function properly , Cousins said .
With the delay , scientists have been able to fix more of that small percentage that did not work .
Learn more about the six experiments »
" The excitement 's building in a similar way that it was a year ago , and , in fact , everybody is working hard to be even more ready than we were a year ago , " Cousins said .
Enthusiasm for the Large Hadron Collider built last summer as the world anticipated the startup of the colossal machine , which will re-create conditions of the universe shortly after it was created in the Big Bang so scientists can study how the universe evolved .
Interest grew as rumors circulated on the Internet that the collider 's power would generate a black hole which would swallow the Earth .
These rumors were widely discredited by the scientific community .
CERN scientists released a report explaining that any black hole created would be tiny , and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving .
Scientists and skeptics alike eagerly awaited the circulation of the first proton beam around the 17 - mile tunnel , which happened successfully on September 10 .
But just days after this success , disaster struck .
While about 9,999 out of 10,000 electrical connections between magnets in the accelerator worked well , one did not , which " made a mess of the magnets , " said Joseph Lykken , theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , who works on CMS .
Repairing the collider costs about 40 million Swiss francs ( nearly $ 35 million ) , although that 's a pittance compared with the overall cost of the collider and its construction ( nearly $ 10 billion ) , Evans said .
The project has not been affected by the worldwide economic recession , he said .
Currently there are about 20 or 30 people in the tunnel welding , conducting electrical tests , and otherwise repairing , Evans said .
For an accelerator of this magnitude -- CMS has twice as much iron as the Eiffel Tower -- the problems in September were " typical growing pains , " Lykken said .
Given that thousands of parts have to work together under extreme conditions of high power , " it 's a wonder that these things work at all , " he said .
" Somehow they have managed to get thousands of gigantic magnets , get them arranged so that they 're within a few microns of where they 're supposed to be , and then cool it down to a couple degrees above absolute zero , " Lykken said .
One of the mysteries scientists seek to uncover at the Large Hadron Collider is the existence of the Higgs boson , sometimes called the " God particle " because , if real , it would help explain the origin of mass .
Finding evidence of this elusive particle will likely take two to three years , he said .
Read about a young scientist testing theories at the accelerator
" It is the thing that gives a being to all the other particles , " Evans said .
While the particles that scientists hope to find are not visible to the naked eye , the detectors are designed to find evidence of them .
Cousins likens this to a Geiger counter , used to detect radiation even though it can not be seen .
The reach of the Large Hadron Collider project extends beyond the complex itself .
CMS alone requires about 100,000 computers worldwide , linked together in a network , Lykken said .
With thousands of scientists around the globe working on it , the Large Hadron Collider is also an opportunity for young physicists , even undergraduate students , to participate in the frontiers of research .
Students can work at the CERN headquarters through programs such as the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience , and participate in the information exchange at the Open Science Grid .
" It is young people that do the nuts and bolts of these experiments , " Lykken said .
" For people like me , who have been waiting 20 years for a supercollider , it 's amazing to see kids just coming into the field .
By this fall , they 'll be looking at what we 've been waiting for all our lives . "
Xiaohang Quan , a Princeton University senior , said her research could improve the way in which CMS chooses which data to record and which to throw away .
Christopher Tully , her physics professor at Princeton who works on CMS , said she " came with up with an improvement that we 're working on implementing . "
" If further studies related to the discovery goes well , it will save people much time and trouble I hope , " Quan said .

Investors Pay Business Plans Little Heed , Study Finds
( Or University of Maryland Business School does a great Onion Parody ?
You decide ! )
According to the New York Times , a study by a team at the University of Maryland 's Business School has revealed that investors do n't read your business plan .
Unbelievable !
And I quote :
Go ahead and write that 50 - page business plan about your fledgling venture if it helps you to focus .
Just do not bother showing it to venture capitalists , because it will do nothing to improve your chances of getting financing .
That is the surprising conclusion of a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland ’s business school .
[ italics mine ]
Surprising conclusion ?
Where have these people been until now ?
Let 's continue :
Researchers found that venture capitalists , who screen hundreds or thousands of solicitations each year , pay little or no heed to the content of business plans .
Instead , the study said , because they make decisions “ under conditions of high uncertainty , ” venture capitalists rely on instinct and their expertise in ferreting out information by other means to evaluate the prospects of a business .
That means , the study said , that they pay little attention to the documentation from entrepreneurs about their academic credentials , work or start - up experience , previous success in raising equity capital , ability to form a top - notch management team or even how much money they want .
This really does sound like an Onion parody , folks .
I discovered this reality about business plans the hard way within a year of completing my undergraduate degree back in the 1980s .
No one ever reads them .
Not venture capitalists .
Not Angel investors .
Not even your momma .
Why not ?
Because everyone with an IQ over room temperature understands that they are as accurate and objective as a personal ad on a dating site .
In other words , they bear little , if any resemblance , to reality .
So , how do you raise money ?
Well , think of it this way .
You have probably heard the old joke about bankers only being willing to lend you money when you do n't need it .
Investors aremuch the same .
They only want to invest after you have proven the concept and need some safe money for expansion .
They do n't do companies which consist of nothing more than a business plan .
Let me share a quick story with you that illustrates this point wonderfully .
A few years ago a doctor I knew was running a highly successful clinic with a very narrow specialty but huge national market potential .
He wrote a business plan and approached a local Seattle venture capital firm .
The VC listened to the short presentation , then leaned back and clasped his hands behind his head , before offering this sage piece of advice .
" Look , the way to get money from us is to open up about 12 clinics first and then come back to us . "
The doctor looked at him in amazement and blurted out , " If I had 12 clinics open why the % $ # ^& would I need you ? ! "
He then got up and left .
And that 's the way the money raising game is .
No one wants to give you capital when you need it most .
It 's too risky .
But everybody wants to give you capital when the risk is gone .

On his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh continued his purge of impure Republicans by targeting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for supporting President Obama ’s emissions proposal .
Limbaugh accused Arnold of hurting the Republican Party by sucking up to Obama .
Here is the audio from Media Matters :

Limbaugh first made the insane claim that the moderates run the Republican Party , and then he claimed that Obama is a radical liberal president who will destroy the essence of America .
Rush blasted Arnold for daring to agree with Obama .
Limbaugh said that the moderates are telling the party that they need to be more like Arnold .
Limbaugh said , “ Arnold is being called a moderate Republican , somebody that we must emulate .
We need more people like Arnold Schwarzenegger in our party if we are to grow the party .
Now I ask you , how are we going to grow the party if more and more moderate Republicans are going to suck up to Barack Obama , show up at his public appearances , endorse him , and campaign for him ?
How in the hell does that expand the Republican Party ? ”
Politically speaking , Rush just proved what a complete moron he is in terms of political strategy .
Arnold supported Obama because he is the governor of one of the most liberal states in the country .
Limbaugh ’s rant shows that the Republicans have n’t learned yet that their idea of a one size fits all Republican does n’t work .
This is the reason why they ca n’t win in the East or West , and are increasing endangered in the South East , and Midwest .
The only way that the Republican Party will ever grow is if it moves off of the right wing and back to the middle .
This is because the right wing only makes up 20 % - 30 % of voters in this country .
If the GOP follows Limbaugh ’s advice and moves more to the right , they will only succeed in isolating themselves from the mainstream of political thought .
What should be obvious now is that Rush Limbaugh is on a crusade to remove every moderate Republican from their party .
He attacks the McCains , Colin Powell , and now Arnold Schwarzenegger on a daily basis .
Democrats would be happy to take in Arnold .
The strategy of saying no to everything is going lead to Republicans getting routed in the next few elections .
Limbaugh has once again proven that he know a lot about entertainment , but nothing about politics .

Nato 's new secretary general took office on 1 August .
He is former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen , who sent troops to fight alongside the Americans in Iraq .
Rasmussen was appointed after a day of frantic diplomatic efforts
The 56 - year - old is taking over from Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , a Dutchman .
Ahead of the April Nato summit , Mr Rasmussen appeared to have the backing of heavyweight Nato members , notably the US , UK , France and Germany .
But Turkey remained a significant obstacle .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Mr Rasmussen personally about the " serious indignation " in Muslim countries over his stance on the row over cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2006 .
' No comment ' Mr Rasmussen , a liberal who has led three consecutive centre - right governments in the last eight years , had repeatedly refused to comment on his candidacy , or even confirm he was in the running .
However , his reticence is believed to have been a tactical move to avoid interfering in any of the diplomatic efforts behind closed doors , rather than signalling a lack of interest in the post .
Mr Rasmussen faces a challenging time at the helm of Nato , with the war in Afghanistan proving costly and arduous and the alliance debating whether to take in more ex-Soviet countries .
But after more than seven years as prime minister , he is considered a veteran of international politics , with a reputation for meticulous planning and strong communication skills .
Deal maker Mr Rasmussen brings considerable experience to the table .
When Denmark held the rotating EU presidency in 2002 , it was Mr Rasmussen who led the complex negotiations which resulted in 10 European countries joining the EU in the union 's biggest enlargement to date .
A personal friend of former US President George W Bush , Mr Rasmussen was one of the foreign leaders who most strongly supported the US - led " war on terror " .
Rasmussen sent Danish troops to help US forces in Iraq Under Mr Rasmussen , Denmark not only supplied troops for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , but also sent 700 soldiers to fight under the Nato banner in Afghanistan .
However , his support for the US in Iraq and Afghanistan and his uncompromising stand in the row over Danish cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad severely damaged his standing in the Muslim world .
Mr Rasmussen has all along refused to apologise for the controversial cartoons published in a Danish newspaper in 2005 .
He has stressed the freedom of the Danish press and said it was not for him to limit or judge what the press published .
Muslims who opposed the cartoons said his tough stance on the matter completely disregarded Islamic sensitivities .
Facebook - friendly
In recent years , Mr Rasmussen has led diplomatic efforts to get major countries such as the US , China , India and Brazil to back a new UN climate agreement , to succeed the 1997 Kyoto Protocol .
The goal is to sign the deal in Copenhagen in December 2009 , at a global climate summit .
But tough negotiations lie ahead .
Mr Rasmussen is also known for being media - savvy .
He was quick off the mark in embracing social networking sites on the internet .
He was the first top European politician to use Facebook , the popular networking service , to engage with voters .
He now boasts 12,000 Facebook friends .
His wife also joined the ranks of celebrity this year when she participated in a television dance show .
She has since quit her job in childcare .
The couple have two daughters and one son .
They regularly go on holiday in France .

Für eine kritische Website ist die Verwendung einer Domain unter Gebrauch eines fremden Namens unter bestimmten Umständen zulässig .
Dies hat der österreichische Oberste Gerichtshof ( OGH ) als letzte Instanz entschieden ( 17 Ob 2/09g ) .
Der Inhaber der Domain aquapol - unzufriedene .at darf damit die Adresse behalten und seine Website , auf der er kritische Beiträge zu Produkt und Verhalten der Firma Aquapol verbreitet , weiter betreiben .
Die Aquapol GmbH bietet Mauertrockenlegungen nach einem Alternativverfahren , das mittels sogenannter Gravomagnetokinese ohne Stromzufuhr Feuchtigkeit aus Mauern zurück ins Erdreich drücken soll .
Dabei soll " Bodenenergie " angesaugt und durch " Raumenergie " verstärkt werden .
Dieses System fällt nach einer früheren OGH - Entscheidung ( 3 Ob 150/02h ) , " nicht in die Gruppe der allgemein anerkannten naturwissenschaftlichen Wirkgrundsätze " .
Damals hatte ein Kunde , bei dem die versprochene Mauertrocknung nicht funktioniert hatte , erfolgreich sein Geld zurück erstritten .
Im vorliegenden Fall ist der Beklagte selbst enttäuschter Aquapol - Kunde .
Trotz Zahlung von über 11.000 Euro soll sich bei ihm der versprochene Erfolg nicht eingestellt haben .
Er registrierte die Domain aquapol - unzufriedene .at , stellte diverse PDF - Dateien zu den Themen Aquapol und " belebtes " sogenanntes Granderwasser online und richtete ein Forum ein .
In diesem Forum sind sowohl positive als auch negative Beiträge über Aquapol zu lesen .
Der Anbieter hatte daraufhin auf Unterlassung der Verwendung des Markenbestandteils und Namens " Aquapol " geklagt .
In erster Instanz wurde die Klage abgewiesen , die zweite Instanz entschied jedoch entgegengesetzt .
Der OGH hat die Klage aber nun endgültig abgewiesen und das erstinstanzliche Urteil wieder hergestellt .
Markenrechtlich ist dem Domainbetreiber demnach nichts anzuhaben , denn durch den Zusatz - unzufriedene sei " geradezu ausgeschlossen , dass Nutzer erwarten , mit Hilfe dieser Domain auf Informationen des Markeninhabers selbst zugreifen zu können . "
Daher liege kein kennzeichenmäßiger Gebrauch der Marke vor .
Auch das Namensrecht der Firma wird laut OGH nicht verletzt , " wenn – wie hier – die Verwendung des Firmenschlagworts keine unerwünschte Identifikation zwischen dem Namensträger und dem Domaininhaber und Betreiber der Website bewirkt und auch sonst keine Zuordnungsverwirrung auslöst " .
Die Verwendung des Namens berühre zwar das Persönlichkeitsrecht des Namensträgers .
Dieses werde aber nicht verletzt , da das " Informationsinteresse höher zu bewerten ist als das Interesse des Namensträgers , nicht im Zusammenhang mit kritischen Äußerungen über seine Waren oder Dienstleistungen genannt zu werden . "
Dabei berücksichtigte der OGH auch , dass " dem Namensträger die Möglichkeit erhalten bleibt , seinen eigenen Namen als Domain registrieren zu lassen " , und dass " keine überzeugende Alternative erkennbar ( ist ) , wie eine kritische Auseinandersetzung mit der Dienstleistung der Klägerin im Internet unter einer Domain geführt werden könnte , die das Firmenschlagwort der Klägerin nicht enthält .

Kerstin Sjoden reports .
Membership in the Swedish Pirate Party has more than doubled in the wake of last Friday 's verdict against The Pirate Bay , dramatically increasing the copyright - reform party 's chances of winning a seat in the European Parliament .
Over 22,000 new party members have joined the Pirate Party since a panel of judges sentenced a financier and three administrators of the torrent - tracking site to a year in prison .
The explosion of support has swelled the party 's membership from 15,000 on Friday morning to more than 37,000 on Wednesday , according to party officials .
Although the verdict is an ideological blow for the party , it 's also without a doubt the best campaign starter imaginable ahead of June 's election .
" It looks promising , " says Pirate Party vice president Christian Engström .
" I think the verdict was just the final straw for a lot of people .
We saw the same phenomenon after the raid against The Pirate Bay in 2006 , when our member count increased from 2,000 to 6,000 .
And it seems like the people who have become members in the last few days are a little older compared to our previous members . "
The pirates will need an estimated 100,000 votes to get a member elected to the European Parliament .
In the Swedish national election in September 2006 , the Pirate Party won only 35,000 votes .
The party stands for radical reform of copyright legislation , abolition of the patent system and guaranteed online - privacy rights .
A protest in Stockholm the day after the Pirate Bay verdict drew about a thousand people to support the file sharing site .
The key questions for the Pirate Party 's future are whether it will be able to mount an effective campaign to convince supporters to go to the polls , notes Ulf Bjereld , professor of Political Science at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden , in a blog post [ Swedish ] .
Even then , Bjereld notes , it 's unclear that file - sharers care enough about the issue to let it determine what party they vote for .
Bjereld told Wired.com last month that he thinks the Pirate Party must reach outside its own group to mobilize voters , if it 's going to have a shot at the parliament .
But Christian Engström is n't worried .
" I will be out campaigning ... talking to people right up until the election in June .
Also , much of the election campaign will be held on the internet , for example on my blog .
But to reach people it's also important to get noticed in traditional media , and we definitely can't complain about the media coverage these last couple of days . "
Elections in the EU's 27 member states will be held between June 4 and June 7 .
The European Parliament is the only directly elected body of the European Union and plays an active role in drafting legislation from its headquarters in Brussels .

IC 4592 : A Blue Horsehead
Credit & Copyright : Rogelio Bernal Andreo
Explanation :
This complex of beautiful , dusty reflection nebulae lies in the constellation Scorpius along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy .
Its overall outline suggests a horsehead in profile , though it covers a much larger region than the better known Horsehead Nebula of Orion .
The star near the eye of the horse and the center of the 5 degree wide field , is embedded in blue reflection nebula IC 4592 over 400 light - years away .
At that distance , the view spans nearly 40 light - years .
The horse 's gaze seems fixed on Beta Scorpii , also named Graffias , the bright star at the lower left .
Toward the top right , near the horse 's ear , is another striking bluish reflection nebula , IC 4601 .
The characteristic blue hue of reflection nebulae is caused by the tendency of interstellar dust to more strongly scatter blue starlight .
The Vim text editor is a favorite of many programmers and system administrators .
Although it provides an exceptional amount of power and flexibility , it can be somewhat intimidating for new users .
Programmers who transition to Vim from a conventional integrated development environment ( IDE ) tend to find the paradigm shift a bit disorienting .
I often get e-mail from readers who are looking for ways to make Vim more developer - friendly .
A common complaint is that the editor does n't come with standard IDE features out of the box and it's not always clear how to configure it to provide equivalent functionality .
The secret to unlocking Vim 's real magic is to take advantage of its powerful plugin system and the large ecosystem of third - party scripts that offer editor augmentations for various tasks .
To get you started , I have compiled a short list of useful tips and programming plugins for Vim that will make IDE refugees feel right at home .
Although Vim is largely designed around text - based interface idioms and is most effective when used accordingly , there are graphical shells available that make the program a bit more manageable for new users .
Instead of running Vim in a terminal window , you might want to try GVim , the basic GUI version .
It has configurable menus and toolbars that make the program 's most essential features easily accessible with a mouse .
It also lets you use native file dialogs and gives you the ability to resize buffer panes by clicking and dragging .
GVim is available for both Linux and Windows .
The equivalent for Mac OS X is MacVim , which provides a native Cocoa user interface , including menu integration .
GVim , with the default menu and toolbar configuration
The most frequent complaint that I see from new Vim users is that the buffer list is somewhat cumbersome and there is no easy way to see at a glance what files are open .
There are several plugins that can address this issue by providing a special pane with a buffer list that can be used to easily navigate between open files .
My favorite is MiniBufExplorer , which displays a list in a pane at the top of the window .
When the MiniBufExplorer list is active , you can hit the tab key to rotate through items and you can select one by hitting enter or double - clicking .
MiniBufExplorer plugin
Many IDEs have a code navigation sidebar that displays the structure of your programming project and allows you to jump to a specific class or method by clicking .
You can get this feature in Vim by using the popular Tag List plugin .
The plugin requires the Exuberant Ctags utility , which it will use to analyze your code .
The plugin's sidebar , which can be activated with the : Tlist command , will show you the classes and methods in the active buffer .
As you open additional files and navigate to other buffers , they will be added to the list .
In GVim , you can click a method name to jump to it .
To do it with the keyboard , move the text cursor to the name of the method that you want to jump to and then hit enter .
TagList plugin demonstrated with a Python program
Automatic text completion is another common IDE feature that users want to bring with them to Vim .
Support for this feature was introduced in Vim 7 , via the Omnicompletion system .
It 's programmable , which means that it can be customized to work with various programming languages .
There are even completion modules available for dynamic languages , such as Python and Ruby .
The proper completion configurations are generally shipped as part of the default Vim package now , so you do n't even have to do anything special to make it work .
To invoke the completion menu , all you have to do is hit ctrl+x followed by ctrl+o .
Then you can use ctrl+n and ctrl+p to navigate through the list of possible completions .
As you rotate through the completion options , Vim will will show you contextual help information with method signatures and properties in a separate scratch buffer .
Vim 's omnicompletion feature demonstrated with Python and the GTK + library
There are many other ways that you can improve your Vim experience .
The Vim wiki and script repository have a very extensive collection of third - party enhancements that you can use to add additional features .
There are plugins that implement snippet systems , outlining tools , project management utilities , and a large number of other features .
There are also many scripts that provide specialized enhancements for particular programming languages or frameworks .
For example , there is an extremely popular script that will give you improved syntax highlighting and convenient navigation features for Ruby on Rails development .
There are also some script collections for the complete beginner that will make Vim behave almost exactly like a conventional text editor with standard keyboard shortcuts and simpler menus .
You can use those to get you started if you are uncomfortable with Vim 's cryptic keyboard commands .
The mutability of Vim allows it to be whatever the user desires .
For those who do n't have the time , expertise , or inclination to build the perfect Vim configuration by hand , the endless number of third - party scripts and plugins can get you most of the way there with very little effort .
The Quest for a Quest
I ’m fond of fiction ; I read a lot of books and watch a lot of movies .
I think that a large part of the appeal of fiction comes from the single - minded focus of the principal characters in the plot .
When the hero of the book or movie is trying to track down a secret or elude his pursuers or find the murderer , he is solely focused on the task at hand .
You seldom see the hero stop to pay his bills or clean up the house or even go to the bathroom .
No , our hero has only one goal for the duration of the book or movie , and he is totally absorbed by the effort of achieving that one goal .
This single - minded focus sometimes occurs in real life .
I ’ve been involved in a number of projects over the years that made me feel like I was part of something bigger — the kind of thing that they make movies about .
You get a wonderful feeling when you ’re part of something like that .
You start each day at work knowing your purpose and knowing what you ’re supposed to do that day .
You see the goal in the distance and you see your team getting closer and closer to the goal as time goes by .
You feel the excitement as the goal approaches .
You do n’t stop the everyday stuff — caring for the kids , mowing the lawn — but you go through those things on autopilot because your thoughts and attention are focused on the goal .
A Quest gives you Productivity
Whether it ’s putting a man on the moon or something much more ordinary like delivering a new software product , the focus of a quest seems to boost your concentration and fuel your productivity .
Petty issues get resolved quickly and smoothly when everyone understands the real purpose of your mission .
When your entire team is heading in the same direction there is far less disagreement over mundane trivia .
With a quest comes a new perspective , a different frame of reference .
Everything is defined in terms of whether it takes us closer to our goal or further away from it .
Life is simple — at least for the duration of the project — and decisions are easy when the objective is clear .
A Quest gives you “ Flow ”
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi talks about “ flow ” in his books and articles .
He describes an altered sense of time where we get so caught up in what we ’re doing that we do n’t notice time passing .
We start working on something and then “ wake up ” hours later , wondering why it ’s so dark outside .
Flow comes from focus , total involvement , and deep concentration on something that completely absorbs us .
Flow is part of the reason that a quest is so appealing .
We go into a flow mode when we ’re working on something associated with a quest .
Flow is enjoyable ; it feels good to be so focused .
This focus also lets us use both our conscious and subconscious mind to deal with challenges we encounter during the quest .
We work on a problem during the day , and finding the solution to the problem becomes so important to us that we devote our subconscious to the task as well .
We have ideas while we ’re sleeping , while taking a shower , or when we ’re doing something that has nothing to do with the quest itself .
Thus the quest helps us devote some of our subconscious energy to the achievement of our objective .
How to Lead a Quest
It ’s really pretty simple to lead quests of your own .
Here ’s how :
1. Define an extremely clear objective , one that ca n’t possibly be misunderstood or misinterpreted .
The objective has to be significant but it also has to be simple : something that can be communicated in a single phrase .
Examples : “ before this decade is out … landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth , ” “ reduce the amount of labor required for the xyz process by 50 % , ” “ sell our products over the Internet by the end of the year , ” “ be the first company to ship a product that does xyz . ”
2 . Frame the objective in a way that makes the achievement of the objective an emotional experience for the participant .
This can be tricky .
You have to tie the objective to a basic human emotion — preferably a positive emotion .
Pride is often a good choice .
Maybe the objective is something that no one else has done , or that no one else has done using your approach .
Pride can be a powerful motivator if you can fuel that emotion in quest participants .
Competition is also a good way to make an objective emotional .
“ We ’re going to beat our leading competitor in introducing this type of product . ”
Survival is also possible as an emotional motivator , although with survival you ’re using a negative emotion : avoidance of a catastrophe .
Often there ’s a mix of emotions .
“ Getting this product on the street before the competition is absolutely required for our company ’s survival .
There ’s no second place — only winners and losers . ”
3 . Include a time component in the objective , even if it ’s arbitrary .
Make sure the deadline is aggressive but achievable .
If the deadline is too easy to achieve or too far out in the future then it will be difficult to motivate day - to - day effort .
If the deadline is impossible to achieve then everyone will give up before they start .
4 . Define the project steps for the achievement of the objective in a way that clearly delineates the work that each sub - team or person needs to accomplish .
You do n’t want a free - for - all ; you want a concerted effort by each member of a team .
You ’ll only get that concerted effort by clearly defining the way in which each team member will contribute to the achievement of the objective .
All Four of these Requirements are Critical
If any one of them is omitted then you wo n’t have a quest .
Leave out the clear objective and people will constantly argue about what you ’re trying to accomplish , and eventually they ’ll lose interest .
Leave out the emotion and no one will care about the project — it will be just another stupid objective that management gives them .
Leave out the time component and there will be no urgency , no need to prioritize the project ahead of others .
Leave out the delineation of effort and everyone will argue about who ’s doing what .
All four requirements have to be included for your quest to be successful .
People Can’t Participate in Multiple Quests Simultaneously
You can have multiple quests going on in your company at the same time , but each individual employee can only be a part of a single quest .
If you give an employee a role in two quests then he or she wo n’t be able to emotionally commit to either of them .
You might be able to get away with two simultaneous quests if you clearly prioritize one quest over the other .
But the second quest distracts the employee , and it does n’t allow the employee to devote subconscious time to solving the challenges that are encountered in the first quest .
The Connection between Quests and IT Strategy
I ’ve talked about IT strategy in other articles and in my book , but I have n’t previously explored the connection between IT strategy and quests .
I believe that the key to an effective IT strategy is focus : being able to communicate a few key objectives that your IT organization is trying to accomplish in order to increase its contribution to business success .
Using a quest approach is an ideal way to achieve those focused IT objectives .
Each major IT objective becomes a quest , and through a series of quests your IT organization will be able to make significant progress by focusing your employees on one thing at a time .
You ’ll be successful , and your employees will get the motivation they need and deserve .
Conclusion
The quest approach is used by many great companies .
Look at the history of Apple , for example , and you ’ll see that all of its major products were built using a quest approach .
You ’ll see the same thing at Pixar , at Sun , at GE and at IBM .
The best products were built using a quest approach , and the best employee experiences came from participating in those quests .
If you have a really big objective — something that ’s important to a significant number of people — then I highly recommend the quest approach .
But while it ’s extremely valuable , the quest approach can also be misused if you violate the rules I ’ve defined in this article .
Make sure you include a clear objective , an emotional tie , a time component and a clear delineation of work .
And make absolutely sure that employees only participate in one quest at a time .
Otherwise you ’ll just discourage your employees , and you ’ll hurt your reputation as a leader and as a motivator .
Life can be a series of quests , just like in books and in the movies .
It can be fun to focus if we ’re truly allowed to focus on one thing .
We ’ve still got a life to lead , and we ’ll still have to do all of those mundane day - to - day things in our non -work time .
But participating in a quest gives us something to be proud of , and it contributes to the meaning in our lives .
Wow , did I like this movie .
They did such a great job creating a great movie , and resetting the series to boot .
One thing , though , made me laugh out loud .
I have noticed that through out the history of Star Trek , many mundane everyday sort of objects end up being used as props for their mildly futuristic looking designs .
I was very happy to see that J.J. Abrams has continued with this tradition .
You see , i work as a manager in a retail office supply store called … well lets just call the place Paperclips , anyway , at our cash registers are equipped with bar code scanners from a company called Symbol .
Funny thing is , the bridge of the Starship USS Enterprise ( NCC - 1701 ) is also equiped with the very same scanners !
Yep , here I am watching this ( AWESOME ! ) movie when I get the first glimpse of the bridge , and right there in front of everything are two of these Symbol bar code scanners .
I actually laughed out loud when I saw them .
Check out the pictures below for yourself .

Here are the scanners at my work
Told you so !

Semi-autonomous robots that can navigate and map drug - smuggling tunnels could be the greatest weapon to emerge from the government 's attempt to stamp out the trade in illicit substances across its borders .
Using special intelligence software developed at Idaho National Laboratory that can be mounted on different machines , the iRobot and Foster Miller robots use lasers to situate themselves in the dark tunnels that have been bored beneath the line that divides Mexico from the United States .
The subterranean passageways are a tough environment for Border Patrol to police .
The agents know nothing beyond that there 's a hole in the ground .
Some tunnels turn out to be crude holes .
Others can reach three - quarters of a mile long and be part of a complex distribution infrastructure .
" They are not places you want to send people , especially ones that are claustrophobic , so it 's a perfect application for robotics , " said INL roboticist David Bruemmer , who has spent a decade developing the software the robots run .
" That 's where we 've really found a niche for the capabilities that we have . "
High - tech border surveillance has taken off since both the Sept. 11 attacks and the surge in illegal immigrants over the last decade .
Tech is playing a bigger and bigger part in Border Patrol efforts because it 's simply too expensive to have agents everywhere .
But for every high - tech solution , say , the controversial " virtual fence " that will begin construction soon in Arizona , there 's a low - tech countermove : mole tech .
In Arizona , more than 30 tunnels have been discovered just since 2006 , when Congress passed the Secure Border Fence Act , which called for the construction of more than 700 miles of fence across California , Arizona , New Mexico and Texas .
Near San Diego , 32 tunnels have been discovered since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Before the heightened vigilance that came in the aftermath of the attack , only two tunnels had been discovered in eight years .
Now , there 's a special multi-agency task force in the area dedicated to stopping the tunneling operations .
In the past , officers have found them more - or - less by chance .
" We 've discovered people coming out of the ground on camera footage , " said Jerry Conlin , a Border Patrol agent and spokesman for San Diego .
" We 've had others where we had an agent witness someone disappearing into the ground . "
At the end of 2007 , a canine unit picked up a scent and followed it to a storage facility near Tecate , Mexico .
Agents eventually pulled 13,700 pounds of marijuana out of the tunnel they found on the premises .
" With our increased operational control , it has literally forced them to go underground , " Conlin maintained .
" We disrupted the traditional smuggling routes . "
That 's created a new need for ways of fighting the subterranean drug trade .
Sophisticated geological techniques for detecting tunnels offer one solution , but once you 've found a tunnel , you 've got to figure out what 's down there .
That 's where Bruemmer 's bots — running what his lab calls the Robotic Intelligence Kernel — come into play .
In December , they brought a sensor - loaded Talon robot to a tunnel that the Department of Homeland Security had seized .
Though it had been entered , the government agents knew little about the space .
Victor Walker , another roboticist at INL , accompanied the bot to the border near Arizona .
" They brought us to this warehouse , " Walker said .
" There was a grate in the ground around back .
Just a drain .
I did not expect that .
The Talon is a pretty big robot .
You pulled it up and it dropped down about 10 feet below the warehouse . "
This anteroom to the tunnel was dark and damp , and about the size of a large bedroom .
In the corner , was a shaft that dropped fifty feet down to the tunnel proper , which ran about 90 meters .
They lowered the robot down with wires and , after a few technical hiccups , traversed the muddy hole .
It output chemical readings , video , and a map like the one you see below , which can be stuck into Google Maps .
" We hooked it up with a chemical sensor .
We were able to map those chemicals to the map .
You could see as it was going along , " Walker said .
" Within a few minutes , we were able to task it down and get the video back so [ Homeland Security officials ] could look at it . "
The INL robots are n't the only ones being used by government officials , nor is the border the only place where robotic border inspectors might be used .
Canadian robot maker Inuktun specializes in pipe inspecting robots operated by human beings .
Most of the more than 1,000 bots they 've sold are used by utilities checking out their sewer pipes or water mains .
In recent years , however , they 've seen requests from government agencies to repurpose their bots for subterranean inspection .
" I do n't think anyone has ever built a robot to go into a tunnel , but if you 've built a bot to go into a nasty sewer pipe , it translates fairly well to going into a tunnel , " Dobell said .
" There are a lot more of these cross border tunnels than people think . "
The company 's president , Colin Dobell , said that he could not reveal the names of the organizations that he 's working for , but that he knew they 'd been deployed .
" I can tell you that they have been used in tunnels and have been used in tunnels that go across borders , " Dobell said .
The INL bots , though , use a fundamentally different control paradigm .
Dobell 's bots are teleoperated , meaning there 's a human with a joystick driving them around .
Bruemmer 's are a kind of hybrid bot that share control between the operator and the robot .
Operators tell Bruemmer 's robots where to go , but the robots drive .
In the tunnel application , the robots use their lasers to locate themselves within the space and help human operators controlling them with a standard joystick or a Wiimote from running them into walls .
" In the Arizona tunnel , there was less than an inch involved on each side , " Bruemmer said .
A teleoperator without some guided motion could n't do it . "
Most importantly , though , they can go exploring and mapping autonomously .
Inside tunnels , you can't always communicate via the standard means with the robots .
If they go deep and far enough away from the operator , they 'll lose communications contact .
In that case , the operator can set a time limit for autonomous exploration , which , when it expires , will send the robot back into communications range to phone home the data it 's found .
That information is integrated into the operator 's heads - up display , and then the robot can be sent a -roving again .
Robots might not be serving us drinks yet , but they are evolving to suit our real needs .
And slowly but surely we 're learning how to take advantage of robots ' potential .
" It 's all about the man -machine interface .
Like Windows just provided this simple user - understood interface , I think that 's what we 're really trying to do with robots , " he said .
" Forget about trying to make robots massively intelligent . "

Hospitals like Sutter Delta Medical Center in Antioch , California , set up triage tents to handle overcrowding
After a week of headlines about the H1N1 virus , or swine flu , many emergency rooms and hospitals are crammed with people , many of whom do n't need to be there .
The visits by the " worried well " have triggered concerns of overburdening the nation 's hospitals and emergency departments , several health care professionals told CNN .
This week , some hospitals saw record numbers of patients .
A few emergency departments shut down to paramedics because of overcrowding .
" We have had a lot of nervous patients with minimal respiratory tract symptoms , " said Dr. Mark Bell , principal of Emergent Medical Associates , which operates 18 emergency departments in Southern California .
" It has caused signficiant amount of delays in emergency care .
They 're all walking well . "
" I have n't seen such a panic among communities perhaps ever , " Bell said .
" We are spending significant time in the emergency department , calming people down .
Right now , people think if they have a cough or a cold , they 're going to die .
That 's a scary , frightening place to be in .
I wish that this hysteria had not occurred and that we had tempered a little bit of our opinions and thoughts and fears in the media .
It just went haywire . "
In California , triage tents were set outside .
Clinics doubled their traffic in major cities like Dallas , Texas , and Chicago , Illinois .
In the Los Angeles area , some Emergent Medical Associates locations shut down their paramedic traffic .
" We 're closing to the real emergencies that may be befalling our community , " said Bell .
" There is a little sense of hysteria among the community about the H1N1 virus . "
Emergency rooms are usually crowded and " if you increase that volume , you 're throwing them right over the edge , " said Bill Briggs , president of the Emergency Nurses ' Association .
" This has the potential to clog the system and emergency departments already facing serious crowding issues throughout the U.S. , " said Briggs , a registered nurse at Tufts Medical Center , in Boston , Massachusetts .
Some came to the hospital because they reported eating pork and having a cough , and thought this meant they had H1N1 virus .
Though commonly known as swine flu , this virus is not contracted through eating pork products .
Even in cities that have yet to have a confirmed case of H1N1 , health care workers have noticed an uptick in the number of patients .
The Minute Clinic , a walk - in health care chain that has 500 offices around the country , saw a 50 percent increase in flu - related visits Thursday .
Chicago Children 's Memorial Hospital 's emergency department had more than double their average number of patients this week .
" It was a lot of ' worried well ' people , " said Cathleen Shanahan , the nursing director for the emergency department at the hospital .
" A lot of parents who were worried they about the flu . "
The anxiety is understandable , but Shanahan cautioned , " At some point , they need to realize it 's still flu season and it could be a normal flu season , and have nothing to do with [ H1N1 ] flu . "
CNN.com : Regular flu has killed thousands since January
" The situation is that people get the flu all the time , " said Dr. Nick Jouriles , president of the American College of Emergency Physicians .
" H1N1 flu is just a bad strain of that .
If you have flu symptoms and you ordinarily see the doctor for that , go ahead .
If you would not ordinarily go to the doctor , do n't . "
If a person has no symptoms , then he does not need to seek emergency care , said Jouriles , an emergency room doctor at Akron General Medical Center in Akron , Ohio .
And if the person does not have a fever or cough , it is extremely unlikely it 's the H1N1 virus .
" Very often when this happens , people naturally become afraid and overinterpret every symptom as a harbinger of the flu or what the epidemic is , " said Dr. Jeffrey Steinbauer , professor of family medicine and the medical director of the Baylor Clinic in Houston , Texas .
" That 's part of providing care to patients and it's kind of expected . "
Rather than panicking when you have a cough or runny nose , Steinbauer advised finding more objective measures .
" A temperature is very objective , " Steinbauer said .
" If the temperature is normal , the allergens in the world and other viruses in the world can give you cough and runny nose .
But if you do n't have a fever , chances of it being a flu is very low . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Influenza
While , the symptoms of the current swine flu and seasonal flu are very similar , reports suggest that this flu virus may result in nausea , vomiting and diarrhea more often than the typical flu .
Symptoms include excrutiating body pains , difficulty breathing , significant nasal congestion and high fever .
Doctors in Mexico have reported seeing sudden dizziness as well .
Health care workers find themselves trying to balance caution while allaying fears and panic about the virus .
" We recognize this as an infectious disease , this is moving , " Dr. Robert Salata , the chief of Infectious Diseases at the University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland , Ohio .
" For the general population , we 're trying to calm the fears of people and the worried well , by stressing other elements like cough and sneezing etiquettes , and that you should n't go to work if you 're feeling sick .
If there is a concern , working through this with your physicians would be very important . "
But dashing into the emergency department because of a runny nose is not helpful .
" We have a tendency in the U.S. to abuse our emergency departments , " Salata said .
" If this escalates , you want to use them for people that are not having mild or moderate symptoms . "

Friday Q&A 2009 - 04 - 24 : Code Generation with LLVM , Part 2 : Fast Objective - C Forwarding
It 's Friday again , and that means another Friday Q&A .
As promised , this week 's edition will pick up where last week 's left off .
Last week I discussed the basics of generating code at runtime using LLVM .
This week I 'm going to build on that base and show how to use LLVM to perform fast forwarding in Objective -C .
Forwarding ?
If you are n't familiar with forwarding , then you 'll want to read over my post from a few weeks ago that talks about it .
Quickie version : forwarding lets you capture a method invocation and then bend it to your will .
Forwarding is really cool and powerful .
Trouble is that it 's also slow .
A forwarded message send is about a thousand times slower than a direct one .
This should come as no surprise .
After all , you perform forwarding by implementing -( void ) forwardInvocation : ( NSInvocation *) invocation
That 's an object parameter , one which has to be freshly created .
The arguments have to be parsed from the method signature , then marshalled and loaded into the invocation object .
Then to make the call , the arguments have to be marshalled out of the invocation object and into the right places to make the call .
All of this takes a significant amount of time .
Higher - Order Messaging
My LLVM demonstration will involve implementing higher - order messaging , so you 'd better know what that is .
Cocoadev.com has a thorough explanation .
The short version is that it's a technique for nested messaging which uses the outer message as an argument to the inner one .
Consider this code :
NSArray * result = [ [ array map ] stringByAppendingString : @ " suffix " ] ;
stringByAppendingString : @" suffix "
map
stringByAppendingString : @" suffix "
What this code will do is iterate through the array , invokeon every element , and return a new array containing the results .
Thecall is the higher - order message , andserves as its argument .
This is pretty neat stuff and is an interesting demonstration of the power of Objective -C .
How does it work ?
It 's actually quite straightforward .
map is defined in a category on NSArray and returns an instance of an NSProxy subclass .
That proxy then implemets - forwardInvocation : to do the work of iterating and returning the new array .
Here 's the full source code for my minimal proxy that implements this :
@interface ArrayMapProxyNormal : NSProxy { NSArray * _array ; } - ( id ) initWithArray :( NSArray * ) array ; @end @implementation ArrayMapProxyNormal - ( id ) initWithArray :( NSArray * ) array { _array = array ; return self ; } - ( NSMethodSignature * ) methodSignatureForSelector :( SEL ) sel { return [ [ _array lastObject ] methodSignatureForSelector : sel ] ; } - ( void ) forwardInvocation :( NSInvocation * ) inv { NSMutableArray * newArray = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; for ( id obj in _array ) { id retval ; [ inv invokeWithTarget : obj ] ; [ inv getReturnValue : & retval ; ] ; [ newArray addObject : retval ] ; } [ inv setReturnValue : & newArray ; ] ; } @end
mapNormal
- ( id ) mapNormal { return [ [ [ ArrayMapProxyNormal alloc ] initWithArray : self ] autorelease ] ; }
" Normal " here in contrast to the fancy LLVM solution that 's coming up .
For completeness , here 's themethod on NSArray : Not too much to it .
But , as mentioned , forwarding is slow .
How can we make it faster ?
Dynamic Methods
This technique gets kind of slow because it has to go through the forwarding path , which as mentioned , is very slow by itself .
NSInvocation is expensive to build and expensive to invoke .
For the stringByAppendingString : example , we could special case that and speed it up by implementing it directly :
- ( id ) stringByAppendingString :( NSString * ) string { NSMutableArary * newArray = [ NSMutableArary array ] ; for ( id obj in _array ) [ newArray addObject :[ obj stringByAppendingString : string ] ] ; return newArray ; }
That gets rid of the forwarding and invocation overhead .
Trouble is , of course , that we'd have to anticipate and reimplement every possible method in advance .
That 's just not practical .
LLVM to the rescue !
Using LLVM we can implement nothing , and see what gets used at runtime .
The forwarding mechanism will get the first message .
The proxy can then generate the appropriate method dynamically , add it to the class , and " forward " the invocation to itself .
Subsequent messages will go straight through .
This is what the forwardImplementation : implementation looks like from the LLVM proxy :
- ( void ) forwardInvocation :( NSInvocation * ) inv { SEL sel = [ inv selector ] ; id obj = [ _array lastObject ] ; Method method = class_getInstanceMethod ( object_getClass ( obj ) , sel ) ; NSParameterAssert ( method ) ; const char * types = method_getTypeEncoding ( method ) ; NSMethodSignature * sig = [ NSMethodSignature signatureWithObjCTypes : types ] ; NSParameterAssert ( [ sig methodReturnType ] [ 0 ] == ' @ ' ) ; class_addMethod ( [ self class ] , sel , [ [ self class ] _trampolineMethodForSignature : sig selector : sel ] , types ) ; [ inv invoke ] ; }
self
_trampolineMethodForSignature:selector :
Mostly straightforward stuff there .
We get the metadata for the method from an object in the array , and then add a new method to our class .
At the end we re-invoke the invocation , which causes it to go back toand hit the newly - added method .
The one tricky bit is thecall .
And that is atricky bit indeed !
Building the Code
If you 'd like to see the entire program at once instead of bit by bit , you can get it here .
In order to simplify the LLVM - generated method , I 'm going to push most of the iteration into Objective - C. Using fast enumeration would make things go even faster , but I 'm not up to building that in LLVM intermediate code .
As such , the generated method will do the equivalent of this :
- ( id ) trampoline { NSMutableArray * array = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; id obj ; while ( ( obj = [ self _nextObject ] ) ) [ array addObject :[ obj trampoline ] ] ; return array ; }
_nextObject
Except that the generated method will take and pass parameters depending on what we tell it to use .
By using this template , themethod can be written in Objective - C , simplifying the job .
There 's a lot of support structure that 's needed before we can actually start building methods .
First , we need to create an LLVM module and execution engine :
static ExecutionEngine * ArrayMapProxyLLVMEngine ; // requires explicit namespace due to conflict with objc header Module type static llvm :: Module * ArrayMapProxyLLVMModule ; + ( void ) initialize { ArrayMapProxyLLVMModule = new llvm :: Module ( " ArrayMapProxyLLVMDynamic " ) ; ArrayMapProxyLLVMEngine = ExecutionEngine :: create ( ArrayMapProxyLLVMModule ) ; }
+ ( void ) printModule { PassManager PM ; ModulePass * pmp = createPrintModulePass ( & outs ;( ) ) ; PM . add ( pmp ) ; PM . run ( * ArrayMapProxyLLVMModule ) ; }
int
char
id
SEL
char *
static const IntegerType * intType ( void ) { return IntegerType :: get ( sizeof ( int ) * CHAR_BIT ) ; } static const IntegerType * charType ( void ) { return IntegerType :: get ( CHAR_BIT ) ; } static const IntegerType * intptrType ( void ) { return IntegerType :: get ( sizeof ( void * ) * CHAR_BIT ) ; } static const PointerType * idType ( void ) { return PointerType :: getUnqual ( charType ( ) ) ; } static const PointerType * selType ( void ) { return PointerType :: getUnqual ( charType ( ) ) ; }
@encode
Type
static const Type * LLVMTypeForObjCType ( const char * type ) { # define IF_ISTYPE ( t ) if ( strcmp( @encode (t ) , type ) == 0 ) #define INT_TYPE (t ) IF_ISTYPE (t ) return IntegerType::get( sizeof ( t ) * CHAR_BIT ) # define PTR_TYPE(t ) IF_ISTYPE (t ) return PointerType::getUnqual( charType( ) )
INT_TYPE ( char ) ; INT_TYPE ( short ) ; INT_TYPE ( int ) ; INT_TYPE ( long ) ; INT_TYPE ( long long ) ; INT_TYPE ( unsigned char ) ; INT_TYPE ( unsigned short ) ; INT_TYPE ( unsigned int ) ; INT_TYPE ( unsigned long ) ; INT_TYPE ( unsigned long long ) ; IF_ISTYPE ( float ) return Type :: FloatTy ; IF_ISTYPE ( double ) return Type :: DoubleTy ; IF_ISTYPE ( void ) return Type :: VoidTy ; PTR_TYPE ( char * ) ; PTR_TYPE ( id ) ; PTR_TYPE ( SEL ) ; PTR_TYPE ( Class ) ; if ( type [ 0 ] == ' ^ ' ) return PointerType :: getUnqual ( charType ( ) ) ; return NULL ; }
struct
We 'll also define a method for printing the module , handy for debugging : Next , I define a bunch of convenience functions for creating LLVM types corresponding to , and various pointer types .
ForandI cheated a bit and defined them as .
Since they 're never dereferenced it does n't really matter .
Another important piece of infrastructure is code to go from an Objective - C type string to an LLVM type .
We get the method argument types as C strings that conform to thedirective , but LLVM obviously expects values of its ownclass .
This function maps from the one to the other : You 'll note that there is absolutely no handling of anytypes .
That was simply too involved and I did n't bother trying to implement it .
It certainly could be done , but it would require considerably greater sophistication .
I need to refer to selectors and classes within the generated function , so here are convenience functions that take a SEL or a Class and generate an LLVM constant with that value :
static Value * PtrValue ( void * ptr , IRBuilder <> & builder , const Type * type , const char * name ) { Value * intv = ConstantInt :: get ( intptrType ( ) , ( int64_t ) ptr , 0 ) ; return builder .
CreateIntToPtr ( intv , type , name ) ; } static Value * SELValue ( SEL sel , IRBuilder <> & builder ) { return PtrValue ( sel , builder , selType ( ) , sel_getName ( sel ) ) ; } static Value * ClassValue ( Class c , IRBuilder <> & builder ) { return PtrValue ( c , builder , idType ( ) , class_getName ( c ) ) ; }
This would never fly in a " real " code generator , because those pointers are n't guaranteed to remain fixed from one run to the next .
But even though we 're ultimately generating real machine code , we 're still operating at runtime .
Since those values can't change during the lifetime of the process there 's no harm in embedding those values right into the code .
One more convenience function , this one for getting an LLVM Function * corresponding to objc_msgSend .
This is actually pretty simple .
By creating a function with that name , LLVM will automatically look it up as a C function within the process if no function with that name exists in the LLVM module .
All we have to do is declare its parameter and return types correctly , and LLVM will call out to it .
static Function * ObjcMsgSendFunction ( void ) { static Function * f ; if ( ! f ) { std :: vector < const Type *> msgSendArgTypes ; msgSendArgTypes .
push_back ( idType ( ) ) ; msgSendArgTypes .
push_back ( selType ( ) ) ; FunctionType * msgSendType = FunctionType :: get ( idType ( ) , msgSendArgTypes , true ) ; f = Function :: Create ( msgSendType , Function :: ExternalLinkage , " objc_msgSend " , ArrayMapProxyLLVMModule ) ; } return f ; }
That 's all the infrastructure needed , now let 's actually build the method .
Building the Method
So again , the generated method is supposed to look like this :
- ( id ) trampoline { NSMutableArray * array = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; id obj ; while ( ( obj = [ self _nextObject ] ) ) [ array addObject :[ obj trampoline ] ] ; return array ; }
id Trampoline ( id self , SEL _cmd , ... ) { NSMutableArray * array = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; id obj ; while ( ( obj = [ self _nextObject ] ) ) [ array addObject : objc_msgSend ( obj , _cmd , ... ) ] ; return array ; }
...
Except that arguments will be added as needed to fit the method signature of the target .
And of course we all know that this really is a function that looks like this :
With thereplaced by the arguments in question .
With our target in mind , let 's code .
We 'll need method which generates the LLVM Function * for this function :
+ ( Function * ) _trampolineFunctionForSignature :( NSMethodSignature * ) sig selector :( SEL ) sel {
NSMethodSignature
std :: vector < const Type *> methodArgTypes ; for ( unsigned i = 0 ; i < [ sig numberOfArguments ] ; i ++ ) methodArgTypes .
push_back ( LLVMTypeForObjCType ( [ sig getArgumentTypeAtIndex : i ] ) ) ;
Function
const Type * methodReturnType = LLVMTypeForObjCType ( [ sig methodReturnType ] ) ; FunctionType * trampolineType = FunctionType :: get ( methodReturnType , methodArgTypes , false ) ; Function * trampoline = ( Function * ) ArrayMapProxyLLVMModule -> getOrInsertFunction ( [ NSStringFromSelector ( sel ) UTF8 String ] , trampolineType ) ; trampoline -> setCallingConv ( CallingConv :: C ) ; // get the ' self ' and ' _cmd ' args as values , and name them // the rest we do n't care about except to pass them along Function :: arg_iterator args = trampoline -> arg_begin ( ) ; Value * selfarg = args ++ ; selfarg -> setName ( " self " ) ; Value * _cmdarg = args ++ ; _cmdarg -> setName ( " _cmd " ) ;

entry : set up selectors array = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; go to loopstart loopstart : obj = [ self _nextObject ] if obj == nil then go to return else go to loopbody loopbody : result = [ obj trampoline ] [ array addObject : result ] ; goto loopstart return : return array
BasicBlock * entry = BasicBlock :: Create ( " entry " , trampoline ) ; BasicBlock * loopstart = BasicBlock :: Create ( " loopstart " , trampoline ) ; BasicBlock * loopbody = BasicBlock :: Create ( " loopbody " , trampoline ) ; BasicBlock * ret = BasicBlock :: Create ( " return " , trampoline ) ;
Function
objc_msgSend
Function * msgsend = ObjcMsgSendFunction ( ) ; IRBuilder <> builder ( entry ) ; Value * arraySEL = SELValue ( @selector ( array ) , builder ) ; Value * addObjectSEL = SELValue ( @selector ( addObject :) , builder ) ; Value * nextObjectSEL = SELValue ( @selector ( _nextObject ) , builder ) ;

+ ( void ) _optimizeFunction :( Function * ) f { static FunctionPassManager * fpm ; if ( ! fpm ) { ExistingModuleProvider * moduleProvider = new ExistingModuleProvider ( ArrayMapProxyLLVMModule ) ; fpm = new FunctionPassManager ( moduleProvider ) ; fpm -> add ( new TargetData ( * ArrayMapProxyLLVMEngine -> getTargetData ( ) ) ) ; fpm -> add ( createInstructionCombiningPass ( ) ) ; fpm -> add ( createReassociatePass ( ) ) ; fpm -> add ( createGVNPass ( ) ) ; fpm -> add ( createCFGSimplificationPass ( ) ) ; } fpm -> run ( * f ) ; }

- _nextObject
- ( id ) _nextObject { return ( _index < _count ? ( id ) CFArrayGetValueAtIndex (( CFArrayRef ) _array , _index ++ ) : nil ) ; }
The first thing this method does is build a vector of argument types , using the helper function I showed earlier to translate theinto LLVM types :
Then we 'll create theobject and extract the arguments , just like last week :
The next thing to do is to set up theobjects that this function will contain .
That means breaking down the model C code into something a little more low level .
Essentially , the function should look like this :
Thus we can see that we 'll need four basic blocks :
We 'll also take the opportunity to do some more setup here .
We need theobject forsince we 'll be doing several of those , and we 'll also get the selectors for messaging set up :
Now we can actually start making calls .
We already know how to call functions from last week .
We know how an Objective - C message translates into a C function call .
We have a helper function to push an Objective - Cpointer into LLVM code .
All the pieces are therefore set to make the call toEasier than I made it sound , huh ?
Last step , unconditionally branch to theblock : Next , fill in .
This is just a message send and then an if statement , nothing we do n't already know how to do .
The one tricky thing here is casting the pointer to an integer before comparing it with zero .
There may be a better way to do this , but this way works .... Next , .
Everything is straightforward here .
The only tricky bit is dynamically generating the arguments for the trampoline call .
This is n't particularly hard : we just copy the original arguments vector , but putin place of .
After that , a standard call to , then a branch back to That 's pretty much the whole function .
Only the return block is left , and all that has to do is return the array we 've built :
Then just return the In addition to this , I 'm also going to introduce something else new : optimization .
Turns out that running optimizations in LLVM is , like most of the rest , surprisingly easy .
Aobject manages passes .
Add some optimization passes , then run the pass manager on the function , and it 's optimized :
Now all the pieces are in place for the really shortmethod :
And for completeness , the implementation of
Performance Testing
In order to see how fast the LLVM version went ( and make sure that it actually worked ! )
I built a little test harness :
@interface NSString ( NOP ) - ( id ) nop ; - ( id ) nop :( int ) x :( int ) y :( int ) z ; @end @implementation NSString ( Logging ) - ( id ) nop { return self ; } - ( id ) nop :( int ) x :( int ) y :( int ) z { NSParameterAssert ( x == 1 && y == 2 && z == 3 ) ; return self ; } @end # define TIME ( expr ) do { \ fprintf ( stderr , " testing % s ... " , #expr ) ; \ /* let stuff happen a few times first for caching etc. */ \ for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) expr ; \ \ NSTimeInterval totalTime = 0 ; \ int iterations = 1 ; \ while ( totalTime < 5 && iterations < 2000000000 ) \ { \ iterations *= 5 ; \ NSTimeInterval start = [ NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate ] ; \ NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [ [ NSAutoreleasePool alloc ] init ] ; \ for ( int i = 0 ; i < iterations ; i++) \ { \ expr ; \ if ( !( i & 0xFF ) ) \ { \ [ pool release ] ; \ pool = [ [ NSAutoreleasePool alloc ] init ] ; \ } \ } \ [ pool release ] ; \ NSTimeInterval end = [ NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate ] ; \ totalTime = end - start ; \ } \ fprintf ( stderr , " % fus / call
" , totalTime * 1000000.0 / iterations ) ; \ } while ( 0 ) int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [ NSAutoreleasePool new ] ; NSArray * reallySmallTimeTestArray = [ NSArray arrayWithObject : @ " 0 " ] ; NSMutableArray * smallTimeTestArray = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++ ) [ smallTimeTestArray addObject :[ NSString stringWithFormat : @ " %d " , i ] ] ; NSMutableArray * largeTimeTestArray = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10000 ; i ++ ) [ largeTimeTestArray addObject :[ NSString stringWithFormat : @ " %d " , i ] ] ; TIME ( [ [ reallySmallTimeTestArray mapLLVM ] nop ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ reallySmallTimeTestArray mapNormal ] nop ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ reallySmallTimeTestArray mapLLVM ] nop : 1 : 2 : 3 ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ reallySmallTimeTestArray mapNormal ] nop : 1 : 2 : 3 ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ smallTimeTestArray mapLLVM ] nop ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ smallTimeTestArray mapNormal ] nop ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ smallTimeTestArray mapLLVM ] nop : 1 : 2 : 3 ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ smallTimeTestArray mapNormal ] nop : 1 : 2 : 3 ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ largeTimeTestArray mapLLVM ] nop ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ largeTimeTestArray mapNormal ] nop ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ largeTimeTestArray mapLLVM ] nop : 1 : 2 : 3 ] ) ; TIME ( [ [ largeTimeTestArray mapNormal ] nop : 1 : 2 : 3 ] ) ; [ pool release ] ; return 0 ; }

NSInvocation
In short , it ranges from about 6 times faster for the one - element array case to a bit over 3 times faster for really long arrays .
The difference is not surprising : much of the cost of standard forwarding is in building the invocation object , something that only happens once for the entire array .
For long arrays , that cost is amortized into nonexistence , and we only pay the cost of invoking the , which is expensive but not as much .
Both techniques also pay a cost for allocating a proxy , allocating an array , and filling that array .
While this hurts both equally , it reduces the relative advantage of the LLVM solution .
Finally , the forwarding solution has the advantage of using fast enumeration .
This is unimportant for the small array but hurts for the big one .
Redoing the LLVM code to use fast enumeration is entirely doable , of course , but would make the code more complicated .
It 's also interesting to watch how the argument marshalling cost hits traditional forwarding with the really short array .
An method with 3 arguments takes over 10 % longer to map onto a 1 - element array than a method with no arguments .
Meanwhile LLVM map pays only about 3 % for the extra arguments , since they 're essentially hardcoded .
Conclusion : up to a 6 x speedup , pretty cool !
Limitations and Improvements
This LLVM forwarding stuff is neat , but it could be better .
Here are some areas where it could use work , if you feel like tinkering :
Fast enumeration : I 've probably mentioned this about sixteen times already , but it would definitely help with speed .
Caching functions :
Right now , the implementation generates a new function for every selector .
This is wasteful , because many selectors will have the same signature , and can reuse the same function .
A cache that allows reusing functions for different selectors with the same method signature would cut down on overhead .
Zero -size arrays :
This implementation simply explodes on empty arrays if the selector has never been seen before , because there 's no object to get a method signature from to generate the function , but map should n't break just because it 's used on an empty array .
Struct support :
This one is a little scary , but writing some code that can properly generate an LLVM struct definition from an Objective - C type string would be nifty .
Conclusion
That wraps up my two week series on runtime code generation with LLVM .
In the first week I showed how to get basic code generation up and running with LLVM , then this week you saw how to take that and actually make it do something useful within an Objective - C program .
LLVM is a tremendously cool project and this kind of runtime code generation is extremely powerful .
This dynamic fast forwarding implementation barely scratches the surface of the kinds of interesting things you can do .

By all accounts , Arianna Huffington ’s Huffington Post has been a fantastic success .
The site , which is an entertaining mix between a news aggregator and a weblog , was started in 2005 and is now the fifteenth most popular site on the internet — just above the BBC and below the Washington Post .
While the site ’s rapid accession is astounding , it ’s also somewhat worrisome .
The site only employs fifty - five staffers ; all the other contributors are unpaid .
If HuffPo , as it ’s commonly referred to ( yeah , its short - form sounds like the name of a Care Bear ) , represents the future of journalism , then professional journalism does n’t stand a chance .
At first glance , Arianna ’s experiment seems noble .
By giving prominent journalists , writers , authors , politicians , entertainers , and amateurs complete creative control , the site encourages unique articles .
The problem is that HuffPo only offers their contributors a means to an end .
Free publicity is great if you ’re already known .
But if you ’re a relatively unknown blogger or journalist who wants to break into the industry , HuffPo really is n’t that useful .
The site gives amateur writers a voice in a respectable organization , but at the same time it also undermines the very industry that these writers want to be a part of .
If HuffPo is able flourish and profit with thousands of free writers , unpaid interns , and a skeleton staff , what ’s to stop every major newspaper from adopting the same format ?
( Besides the obvious fact that if every media organization just aggregated content , there would n’t be anything left to aggregate . )
With all the cutbacks , layoffs , and closures , the news industry seems to be moving closer to the HuffPo ’s lean , mean style .
To survive , several papers , including the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , have abandoned their print editions , slashed costs , and moved entirely online .
As these organizations adopt the HuffPo model , there are going to be fewer jobs out there for paid writers .
Unfortunately , this makes the experience and publicity that the site offers somewhat useless .
This is n’t a shot across the bow of every weblog out there or an argument for pay - to - read online news subscriptions .
There ’s a big future for HuffPo ’s style of citizen journalism , but our fear is that Arianna ’s web model might just extinguish paid professional journalism altogether .
For now , professional writers are content to write for free to promote their paid projects , but when the time comes that they have nothing to promote , they ’ll probably stop writing for free .

Starting a new business can be a daunting prospect .
It can be a number of months , even years before a new business starts generating profits and creating a steady cashflow .
During this period , it can be easy to get down hearted and give up .
However , this does not have to be the case .
You may need to find alternative sources of income during this lean period .
This is nothing to be ashamed about , but it is a challenge that must be overcome and CAN be overcome .
When the business starts making a profit , it can be reivested in the business to make it grow .
The following tips can help a business during this time .
It will help you to calculate what you need financially , streamline your expediture , re-invest any profits and perhaps find further funding and grants for your business .
First and foremost , when starting a new business , make sure that you make a REALISTIC forecast of your financial needs .
Please refer to my article on this subject .
A personal budget is a plan showing living as well as business expenses .
It should set limits about how much you spend and how much you will have coming into the business .
This will help you to keep tabs on how much is going in and out of the business and adjust accordingly .
Do not forget that some things are fixed such as rent / mortgage whilst others change from month to month like phone bills , travel etc .
See where you can make savings .
The first year in business is crucial and some sacrifice may be necessary , so do n't be afraid to make them .
You must identify how much your business will make in the first year and how much profit that you plan to make .
It is possible to do this by :
Estimating how much you will make from sales
Estimating how much your expenses will be
Calculating any salaries , tax , etc and seeing how much is left
It is sometimes difficult to calculate how much the business will make in the first year .
The best thing is to concentrate on managing cashflow rather than profit .
Profit - is the difference between business earnings and the costs paid out during the course of the trading period .
A profitable business can still be in trouble if it runs out of a cash .
Cashflow - is the money coming in and out of the business .
It covers payments of money and not what is owed to and by the business .
Cash enables bills to be paid thus allowing trade to continue .
Wages , rent , equipment are the main things that cash is spent on .
It is important to point out that if you are extending credit or are in receipt of credit to have important controls in place .
The other thing to consider is how to make savings .
The best way to do this is to shop around for the services , loans and deals on your utilities .
Always read the small print and make sure you understand what you are getting for your money .
In addition to this , make sure you adopt money saving practices in your business for example not leaving appliances on and only switching on the heating when it is needed .
Furthermore , you can save money by running your business from rather than renting or buying a premises .
Other sources of income include :
Using savings that are available to you
Starting the business whilst retaining existing employment - it can be done
Selling unwanted stuff
Getting financial help from friends and family but be careful .
Family financial contribution can lead to problems if clear guidelines are not put in place
Business funding / overdrafts - but try and keep these to a minimum especially the latter as debt is not a good thing for a business to be saddled with long term .
Lastly , always look for support from schemes and grants run by local enterprises , business angels etc .
It is there should you need it .
It may not always be easy getting past the first year in business but it can be done with a little hard work , sacrifice and innovation .
Take care readers and all the best ...

DNA profiles of up to 850,000 innocent people held among 4.5 m on an official database are to be removed after a European Court ruling .
But details of those cleared of crimes - or never even charged - will still be held for six years , or 12 in cases of serious violent or sexual offences .
Rights groups say the plan is insulting to the ruling that the database in the UK - apart from Scotland - was illegal .
Ministers argue the cuts are adequate , but say fewer crimes will be solved .
One official estimate suggests there will be 4,500 fewer offences detected on average each year - rising to 26,000 if the proposals are extended to the policies on retaining fingerprints , as planned .
Last year the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the database in England and Wales and Northern Ireland was illegal .
Why does [ the DNA profile ] need to be held on file ?
That should n't be the case unless you 've been convicted
Dr Helen Wallace , Genewatch
Send us your comments Key DNA case studies
It said rules allowing police to retain indefinitely the genetic profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence were indiscriminate .
They did not differentiate between criminals and people who had never been convicted , or the severity of offences , it ruled .
The policy has led to protests from individuals , civil liberty groups and opposition parties that the distinction between the guilty and innocent is being " blurred " .
Supporters say it has played a key role in solving some " cold case " crimes where serious offenders have been caught - or innocent people cleared - many years after the original investigation .
The current database has provided 400,000 crime scene matches over a decade .
Public protection Home Office minister Vernon Coaker told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme that research showed half of those who reoffend after arrest do so within six years , and two - thirds within 12 .
" What we are trying to do is respond in a way that 's proportionate , that conforms to the [ court ] judgement in a way that we do as much as we can to protect the public , " he said .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of civil rights group Liberty , said : " This is n't necessarily a complete two fingers to the court of human rights but it comes pretty close .
" We do n't base the justice system on criminologists ' projections .
" The logic of the government 's position would be to take every man , woman and child in the country and put them on the database , just in case . "
Launching its consultation on how to comply with the court 's judgement , the Home Office said its proposals include : • Destroying all original DNA samples , like mouth swabs , as soon as they are converted into a digital database profile •
Automatically deleting after 12 years the profiles of those arrested but not convicted of a serious violent or sexual crime •
Automatically deleting after six years the profiles of anyone arrested but not convicted of other offences •
Retaining indefinitely the DNA profiles and fingerprints of anyone convicted of a recordable offence •
Remove the profiles of young people arrested but not convicted , or convicted of less serious offences , when they turn 18 While the DNA profiles of all children under 10 have already been deleted , the database is to be expanded to include 30,000 serious offenders who were convicted before the database was established .
Officials estimate that up to 850,000 of the 4.5 m profiles on the database could be affected by the changes and it will take two years to sort through the cases .
In practice many of these profiles may be retained under the 12 and six - year rules .
' Proportionate '
In Scotland , records can only be held beyond three years if police get court permission - a system deemed " fair and proportionate " by the European court .
Prof Jim Fraser , of Strathclyde University , who reported on the issue for the Scottish government , said UK ministers ought to justify their time limits .
" The central question is : ' Is 12 years proportionate ? ' and it's quite a difficult question to answer , " he said .
" Most offences are committed by a relatively small number of people and they tend to reoffend and reoffend quite soon , " he said , adding that he had concluded that most would do this within three years .
SCOTTISH SITUATION DNA sample on arrest
If cleared , profile deleted If cleared of serious sexual or violent offence , profile kept for maximum of five years System praised by European Court of Human Rights Crime victims campaigner Jill Saward said wiping the records would contribute to an ongoing " erosion of justice " in the UK .
" Anything that we do that takes away the possibilities of finding out who the guilty are is very detrimental , " she said .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the proposals would ensure the right people were on the database , as well as establishing when they should come off it .
But shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said a Conservative government would adopt the Scottish model .
He said : " People in Britain should be innocent until proven guilty .
" Ministers are just trying to get away with as little as they possibly can instead of taking real action to remove innocent people from the DNA database .
It 's just not good enough . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " Once again , the Home Office is fighting an undignified rearguard action designed to give as little as possible in response to the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights . "
Dr Helen Wallace from the charity Genewatch told the BBC : " If you are a suspect for a crime you should be able to have your DNA taken during that investigation .
" But why does it need to be held on file ?
That should n't be the case unless you 've been convicted . "

At least four people were killed when a car crashed into the crowd at a parade involving Queen Beatrix and the Dutch royal family .
Cynthia Boll is a photographer who was at the scene taking pictures of the royal family when the incident happened during a parade through the town of Apeldoorn .
She told the BBC she heard a bang and " people lying everywhere " .
Artist 's Statement Awhile ago I had a conversation with Ruben Bolling , author of “ Tom the Dancing Bug , ” about the politics and propriety of using racial or sexual epithets in one ’s work , even if it is in vox personæ ( that is , in the mouth of a character from whom such language would be appropriate and expected ) .
Ruben , after humbling experience , has come around to the conclusion that it ’s never okay to use such words — they ’re just too fraught with hatred and a history of inflicting harm .
Whereas I , perhaps less wisely , continue to follow John Waters ’ challenge to the next generation of humorists to find a way to be un - p.c. without being a jerk about it .
This cartoon representsnot only my formal coming - out as a big fag but my effort to reclaim the word fag from the homophobic bigots , dissociate it from any overt reference to sexual orientation , and reappropriate it as a puerile , middle - school insult .
Of course homosexuals are allowed to call each other faggot harmlessly , just as blacks get to say nigger with a kind of defiant casualness which bothers no one except for everybody around them and maybe each other deep inside .
But I 'd like to rehabilitate faggy to designate things that are not literally homosexual but are nonetheless undeniably faggy , things like V - neck sweaters and Yanni and Dr. Smith on Lost in Space .
( Okay maybe Dr. Smith is a borderline case but come on , it 's a kids ' show , nobody has any real sexuality , except for that little minx Penny . )
Maybe it would help to desaturate the word of its vicious power to broaden and dilute its meaning this way -- just as the word jerk now just means someone insensitive , obnoxious , and stupid and no longer specifically refers to compulsive masturbators .
Alas , there just do n’t seem to be any epithets with any real juice at all that do n’t have their etymological origins in some cruel and wounding term that targets a very specific group : even the now fairly bland idiot once had a very specific medical meaning and was used , in less enlightened times , to mock the mentally disabled or ill .
I realize people are touchy about this sort of thing , and not without just cause .
I once permanently alienated someone , a gay friend of a friend , merely by mentioning the existence of the playground game “ Smear the Queer , ” ( a.k.a. , in some regional variants , the more self - explanatory “ Kill the Guy With the Ball ” ) .
It ’s not like I personally invented this game or named it myself .
But by simply repeating its name I earned his undying antipathy .
And yet , as a pale skinny kid who read books and did n’t play sports or go out with girls in high school , and , later , a guy who hung out in dive bars in Cecil County but talked like a college boy , I got called gay and faggot growing up as much as any bona fide homosexual .
One thing I like about living in New York City is that nobody ever calls you faggot , maybe because people are too grown - up and cosmopolitan here , or because this is the place where all the people who got called faggot in their hometowns fled to , or maybe just because there are so many authentic faggots here for contrast that nobody mistakes you for one just because you ’re wearing a blazer .
One of the very few bits of dumb gender bullshit that , as far as I know , women do n’t have to contend with that men do is this question of being a “ real ” man .
I do n't know -- do women ever worry about being a " real " woman ?
Perhaps there is some whatever 's - the - female - equivalent - of - machismo surrounding issues of childbirth and motherhood , but I do n’t think the whole issue of your gender identity feels as tenuously insecure for women as it does for men .
I remember when I was a kid a ( not very bright ) friend of mine told me not to sit with my legs crossed , because men did n’t sit like that .
I remember thinking , my dad sits like that , but I also uncrossed my legs .
( This was the same kid who instructed me that toilet was pronounced terlet . )
This kind of unspoken but harshly enforced code continued through adolescence : the clothes you wore , the music you listened to , etc. , all were subject to this constant thhreat of being deemed girly or gay .
And of course this sort of anxiety is a useful marketing tool among adolescents , so the culture tends to cultivate it .
Some of these rules verged on superstitions of the Babylonian dog - on - the - bed variety .
Boys , you 'll remember , could not carry their books clasped to their chests -- they had to lug them all under one arm , no matter how large or unweildy a stack they had .
( But then why would a real guy have so many books , anyway ? )
If you wore an earring in your right ear it meant you were gay .
If you wore green on a certain day of the week ( was it Friday ? ) you were gay .
T his fearful cringing bullshit does n’t even end in adulthood .
Until a year or two ago I had a friend who was always presuming to mentor me in what “ a real man ” wears ( fitted shit , sportscoats ) , owns ( expensive cell phones ) , and does ( feels girls up in the street instead of timidly asking them out ) .
On especially frigid days I wear a raccoon coat around town , one that would ’ve been the cat ’s meow in fashion eighty years ago , and is fucking awesome , but now , in 2009 , because I am neither a. ) female or b. ) black , often gets laughed at .
( You watch : two years from now they ’ll be in fashion again , thanks to me , and the same douchebags who made snarky ironic remarks about my coat will be paying $ 3000 for them in vintage stores . )
A lot of grown men seem to experience an almost hysterical fear of ever being perceived as anything other than a 100 % normal , straight , red - blooded American male , a condition which is imaginary and therefore impossible to wholly achieve , which doubtless leaves a lot of them feeling anxious and fraudulent and in constant danger of being found out as only 87 % manly .
Hence homphobia .
And anything we feel anxiety about is a going to be a focus of humor .
( I love the “ You know how I know you ’re gay ? ” routine in The 40 - Year - Old Virgin . )
So it ’s handy to have a word so overtly puerile and middle - schoolish to mock a. ) your friends ’ habits and affectations and also , on a more self - conscious “ meta - ” level , b. ) your own obnoxious presumption in judging them and c. ) the whole notion of some rigid , objective standard of what is manly and normal vs. what is unacceptably faggy or gay .
I do n’t know -- maybe , my years of being called gay on the playground and general fagginess notwithstanding , I still lack what David Foster Wallace called the “ rhetorical authority ” to make this argument , since I am after all a pretty flamboyant , even flaming , heterosexual .
I am certainly way more hesitant to reappropriate and comedically deploy epithets to which I have no conceivable claim .
My late friend John always forbade his friends from using the word retard in his presence , because John had had a sister with Down ’s Syndrome .
And because John was the kind of thoroughly gentle and decent guy who , if you made him angry , you knew it was not because he was being touchy and oversensitive but because you must be an asshole , we knocked it off .
Even though retard also has some of the overtly stupid , vulgar whiff of middle - school that makes fag so embarassingly fun to say .
I have seen it used to humorous effect ( most recently in the legend to The Onion ’s “ Our Dumb World ” atlas , in which the symbol of a ship was accompanied by the explanation : “ It ’s a ship , you fucking retard ” ) , but I still avoid it myself .
I ’m currently reading Cormac McCarthy ’s Suttree , set in Knoxville in 1951 among the very lowest substratum of society , and it would be a blatant bowdlerization or distractingly anachronistic , like some weird parallel - universe child ’s version of that time and place , if no one in it were to use the word nigger .
So they do , pretty often , which is only naturalistic in that book , just as it is in Huck Finn .
But this does n’t stop me from worrying that some black person might notice it on the page over my shoulder on the subway .
So , yes , it is possible that I have failed here and am just a jerk ( in the broad generic sense ) after all .
I await the angry letters - to - the - editor .
Thanks to my friends Tom and Jesse for the inspiration RE Sharks vs. Jets .
( I actually did have to ask some strangers in the café where I was drawing who was playing in the Superbowl this year . )
And thanks to Jesse for suggesting that the final damning proof of my faggotry should be liking girls , a la The Simpsons ’ line : " You ’re kissing a girl — that ’s so gay ! ”
As Jules Feiffer points out in his essay on comic book heroes , “ In our society it is not only homosexuals who do n’t like women .
Almost no one does . ”
The same friend who used to tell me what real men did and did not do also used to berate me for wasting my time hanging around with women he did n’t think were attractive .
Life was pretty much binary for him : every event that did not conclude with fucking a hot girl was , to him , just another disappointing failure .
He was no idiot , and he certainly was n’t faggy ; he was just a jerk .

Speaking on a Sunday talk show , former Vice President Dick Cheney continued to attack President Barack Obama for releasing Bush memos that authorized waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics that may have amounted to torture .
Cheney wants Obama to release more memos that he says will prove valuable intelligence was gleaned from the questionable interrogation tactics .

Former CIA special agent Jack Rice called Cheney “ hypocritical ” for calling for the release of memos after leaving office .
“ If he wanted to release these before [ leaving office ] he could have , ” said Rice .
Rice questioned the timeline Cheney and other use to back up claims that the harsh interrogations produced valuable intelligence .
One such claim says that the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah lead to intelligence that stopped an al Qaeda plot to bomb the Library Tower in Los Angeles .
“ I mean , if we look at the timeline , they already said that they stopped the attack in 2002 and [ Zubaydah ] was n’t arrested until 2003 .
Now , let ’s face it .
If you can get interrogation in 2003 , that stops an attack in 2002 , I want to get me some of that , ” quipped Rice .

The Fate of Paper Money , Fiat Currency
" Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value - zero . " ( Voltaire , 1694 - 1778 )
Paper Money in Asia
The first well - documented widespread use of paper money was in China during the Tang ( 618-907 A.D. ) dynasty around 800 A.D. [ 1 ]
Paper money spread to the city of Tabriz , Persia in 1294 and to parts of India and Japan between 1319 to 1331 .
However , its use was very short - lived in these regions .
In Persia , the merchants refused to recognize the new money , thus bringing trade to a standstill .
Figure 1 .
This Kuan note is the oldest known banknote in the world .
It was made in China circa 1380 .
By 1455 , after over 600 years , the Chinese abandoned paper money due to numerous problems of over issuance and hyperinflation .
An in - depth description of China 's first experience with money can be found here .
Paper Money in Europe
The first instance of paper money in Europe allegedly occurred in Spain in 1438 during a Moorish invasion .
A Spanish military leader issued paper notes to his soldiers that circulated around the city .
No known notes have survived .
In 1574 , the Dutch city of Leyden issued cardboard coins made from the cover of prayer books while Holland was trying to regain its independence from the invading Spanish .
The Italian city of Candia later issued paper money of different denominations until a shipment of coins arrived from Venice .
All notes were fully reimbursed .
In 1633 , the earliest known English goldsmith certificates were being used not only as receipts for reclaiming deposits but also as evidence of ability to pay .
In 1656 , the Bank of Sweden was founded with a charter that authorized it to accept deposits , grant loans and mortgages , and issue bills of credit .
By 1660 , the English Goldsmiths ' receipts became a convenient alternative to handling coins or bullion .
The realisation by goldsmiths that borrowers would find them just as convenient as depositors marks the start of the use of banknotes in England .
In 1661 , the Bank of Sweden became the first chartered bank in Europe to issues notes known as the paper daler .
Figure 2 . A 50 - Daler note from the Bank of Sweden issued in 1666 .
By the 1680's , the use of paper money began to take place in other European countries and the New World .
Circulated notes on playing cards were used in the French colony of Lower Canada .
Other colonies soon developed their own paper notes .
Existing Currencies in Circulation
At present there are 176 currencies in circulation in the world .
Not all currencies are widely used and accepted , such as the various unofficial banknotes of the crown dependencies ( Isle of Man and the Balliwicks of Jersey and Guernsey ) .
The median age for all existing currencies in circulation is only 39 years and at least one , the Zimbabwe dollar , is in the throes of hyperinflation .
The twenty longest running currencies are listed below .

Below are charts showing the declining value of the two longest running currencies - the British pound sterling and the United States dollar , considered to be the most successful paper currencies of all time .
The British Pound originally represented one troy pound of sterling silver back in 1560 .
Sterling silver is 92.5 % pure silver and there are 12 troy ounces in a troy pound .
Elizabeth I and her advisor Sir Thomas Gresham ( of Gresham 's Law fame ) established the new currency to bring about order created by the " Great Debasement " of 1543 - 51 when Henry VIII sought to finance his costly wars with both France and Scotland .
Paper banknotes were issued shortly after the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694 .
As of Feb 23 , 2007 it now takes 86.2 GBP to purchase that same troy pound of sterling silver - a loss of 98.8 % !
Under the US Mint Act of 1792 , the dollar was pegged at 24.75 grains of gold .
There are 480 grains in a troy ounce .
Thus it took 19.4 US dollars to purchase a single troy ounce of gold .
As of Feb 23 , 2007 it takes nearly 863 US dollar to purchase that same troy ounce of gold , representing a 97.8 % drop in value !
Currencies No Longer in Circulation
This analysis includes 599 currencies that are no longer in circulation .
The median age for these currencies is only fifteen years ! [ 2 ]
The following table below groups the fates of these currencies .

Hyperinflation is one of the greatest calamities to strike a nation . [ 3 ]
This devastating process has destroyed currencies in the United States , France , Germany , and many other countries .
Recent Expansions to the US Monetary Base
The monetary base comprises of currency in circulation ( banknotes and coins ) and the commercial banks ' reserves with the central bank .
Recently , there have been unprecedented increases to the bank reserve portion of the US monetary base .
Up until August 2008 , the portion of the monetary base that consisted of bank reserves was between 8 - 12 % .
In December 2008 , that proportion had risen to 47 % !
This drastic increase was due largely in part by the unwillingness of the banks to lend recent ' liquidity injections ' from the Federal Reserve .
The following table shows the increases to the monetary base , as measured in US $ billions for the last six months of 2008 .
These actions by the Fed are responsible for the large spike on the right side of the above chart .
Date Currency in Circulation ( M0 ) Cash Held as Bank Reserves Total Monetary Base Jul-08 774.8 71.7 846.5 Aug-08 775.4 71.9 847.3 Sep -08 776.8 131.2 908.0 Oct -08 793.8 338.7 1132.5 Nov-08 806.5 634.6 1441.1 Dec -08 882.0 782.3 1664.3
These massive expansions to the US monetary base increase the probability of a complete collapse in the confidence of the value of the US dollar .
This shift in sentiment would spark a hyperinflationary fate to the world 's de facto reserve currency .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Watch out scientists -- you may be replaced by a robot .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Two teams of researchers said on Thursday they had created machines that could reason , formulate theories and discover scientific knowledge on their own , marking a major advance in the field of artificial intelligence .
Such robo-scientists could be put to work unraveling complex biological systems , designing new drugs , modeling the world ’s climate or understanding the cosmos .
For the moment , though , they are performing more humble tasks .
At Aberystwyth University in Wales , Ross King and colleagues have created a robot called Adam that can not only carry out experiments on yeast metabolism but also reason about the results and plan the next experiment .
It is the world ’s first example of a machine that has made an independent scientific discovery -- in this case , new facts about the genetic make - up of baker ’s yeast .
“ On its own it can think of hypotheses and then do the experiments , and we ’ve checked that it ’s got the results correct , ” King said in an interview .
“ People have been working on this since the 1960s .
When we first sent robots to Mars , they really dreamt of the robots doing their own experiments on Mars .
After 40 or 50 years , we ’ve now got the capability to do that . ”
Their next robot , Eve , will have much more brain power and will be put to work searching for new medicines .
King hopes the application of intelligent robotic thinking to the process of sifting tens of thousands of compounds for potential new drugs will be particularly valuable in the hunt for treatments for neglected tropical diseases like malaria .
King published his findings in the journal Science , alongside a second paper from Hod Lipson and Michael Schmidt of Cornell University in New York , who have developed a computer program capable of working out the fundamental physical laws behind a swinging double pendulum .
Just by crunching the numbers -- and without any prior instruction in physics -- the Cornell machine was able to decipher Isaac Newton ’s laws of motion and other properties .
Lipson does not think robots will make scientists obsolete any day soon , but believes they could take over much of the routine work in research laboratories .
“ One of the biggest problems in science today is finding the underlying principles in areas where there are lots and lots of data , ” he told reporters in a conference call .
“ This can help in accelerating the rate at which we can discover scientific principles behind the data . ”

It is .
But this is n’t a yard sale nor an eviction .
No T - shirt uniformed street teams promoting Blackberrys to government workers .
No ad - hoc charity lovers selling Krispy Kreme donut boxes for $ 5 in front of the Metro escalators .
No sidewalk floormat signs that appeared until DCRA put the kibosh on them .
Enter Zipcar , the popular car sharing service that has its DC office at 717 D St , NW , and what we think is the most unorthodox attention getter we ’ve seen downtown .
Unorthodox enough that we call it news .
A few weeks ago , camera ready PQ Living reader Kathy caught two Zipcar “ scenes ” – one on F Street , NW , and another on 7th Street , NW – and sent them in to us .
Camp F Street ( photo below ) depicts two folks enjoying themselves at a makeshift campsite while Living Room 7th Street is simply a vacant sofa parked on the sidewalk ( photo above ) .
We ’ll let readers figure out the hook .
We talked to Anthony Marinos , a DC region marketing manager for Zipcar , who told us that this short campaign was one Zipcar thought would be a good fit for DC and for reaching out to people to promote awareness of the service .
How did pedestrians walking by react ?
He said , “ It put a smile on people ’s faces . ”
The pedestrian count on 7th Street , NW , is as high as it gets in Washington DC with workers , residents and tourists making the trek to offices , condos and attractions at all times of the day and also making our neighborhood ’s Main Street a real marketing plum .
Whether you ’re a fan of this kind of public space advertising or not , it does garner attention .
It made us turn our heads .
A hat tip goes out to Kathy for allowing us to use her photos .

Here 's a sweet little student project from ITP : a clock that counts up to a hundred years and falls apart :
Showing ' Time in Six Parts , ' the clock " rotates once every second .
The following pulley rotates once every 5 seconds ( 1:5 ratio ) .
The next rotates once every 60 seconds or 1 minute .
Then 5 minutes , 1 hour , 1 day , 1 month , 1 year , and 1 decade .
The decade wheel carries the load of the large arc .
The large arc rotates once every century .
The final ratio between the 60 - RPM motor and the large arc is approximately 1:31.6 billion .
Each wheel is marked with a black nut to highlight a position that could be tracked over time .
Along the arc , 100 lines mark the divisions of each passing year .
When the clock finally reaches the end of a 100 - year cycle , the arc falls off its track onto the floor . "
The 3.16 Billion Cycles Clock , with the time in six part series , is perhaps an attempt to present time in a prospective like never seen earlier .
If with this the designer intended to take time beyond our consideration and explore its new realms , he has by far succeeded in his effort , but still the clock remains routed to the core , by living every second till eternity ( we are n't living an age to see a 100 years pass ) .
Les députés socialistes ayant choisi de déposer leur recours ce mardi 19 mai , c'est au plus tard le 19 juin prochain que le Conseil constitutionnel rendra sa décision sur la loi Création et Internet .
Mise à jour : le recours a été déposé .
Selon nos informations , les députés socialistes ont prévu de déposer ce mardi le recours contre la loi Création et Internet auprès du Conseil constitutionnel .
Ils auraient pu attendre quelques jours de plus , puisque la juridiction des sages peut être saisie durant les dix jours qui suivent la proclamation des résultats du scrutin , qui a eu lieu le 13 mai dernier pour l’Hadopi .
Mais les opposants à la riposte graduée ont eu tout le temps nécessaire .
Ils avaient déjà mis à profit les deux semaines de répit inattendu offertes par le rejet de la loi en première lecture pour peaufiner leur recours , qu’ils pensaient déposer il y a près d’un mois .
A partir du jour de sa saisine , le Conseil constitutionnel a l’obligation de statuer dans un délai d’un mois .
C’est - à - dire qu’il devra rendre sa décision sur la loi Création et Internet au plus tard le vendredi 19 juin .
Le Conseil constitutionnel est présidé par Jean - Louis Debré et composé de neuf sages , auxquels s’ajoutent les anciens présidents de la République qui sont membres de droit , à vie .
C’est - à- dire actuellement Valéry Giscard D’Estaing et Jacques Chirac .
En 2006 , le Conseil constitutionnel avait déjà censuré la riposte graduée prévue par la loi DADVSI , à l’époque défendue par Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres .
Il avait estimé qu’il n’était pas conforme au principe d’égalité devant la loi pénale de faire un cas particulier de la contrefaçon sur Internet , par rapport aux autres types de contrefaçons , en appliquant des sanctions différenciées .
C’est pour contourner cet obstacle que la loi Hadopi ne sanctionne plus le téléchargement ( la contrefaçon ) , mais le défaut de sécurisation de l’accès à Internet .
Mais ce faisant , la loi ouvre la voie à des censures sur d’autres points : irrespect de la présomption d’innocence , responsabilité du fait des tiers ( y compris lorsqu’ils sont majeurs et responsables ) , divulgation d’informations personnelles sans contrôle du juge , imprécision de la loi sur les faits constitutifs de manquement à l’obligation de sécurisation , etc. , etc .
Nous reviendrons rapidement plus en détails sur les motifs de la saisine .

Advertisement A mother has been reunited with her son , 27 years after she claims he was kidnapped , after her sister saw him on the social networking site Facebook .
Avril Grube , 62 , who lives in Poole , Dorset , says she was given custody of her son Gavin Paros after her marriage to a Hungarian man broke down in 1982 .
His father , who died in 2006 , had visiting rights but took him to Hungary and Ms Grube has not seen him since .
But Mr Paros , 29 , met his mother this week after being found on Facebook .
Ms Grube , who was only discharged from hospital a week ago , said : " I would love it so much to have Gavin back living in Britain . "
It is very important that now is the time she spends with her son because she is not a well lady
Beryl Wilson , Gavin Paros 's aunt She and her sister Beryl Wilson , 59 , who lives in Liverpool , had spent years trying to trace their relative , even contacting the Hungarian Embassy and taking their case to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher .
Ms Wilson told BBC Radio Solent : " [ Mr Paros ' father ] had visitation rights , he said he was going to the zoo or somewhere and when he did n't arrive back we found out he had taken him back to Hungary .
" My sister was devastated , her health suffered .
" I tried everything ... but no - one wanted to know . "
In March , Ms Wilson typed her nephew 's name into an internet search engine and could not believe it when his Facebook profile came up correctly showing he had been born in Liverpool and naming his mother .
" I was so relieved , it took me 27 years but I never gave up , " Ms Wilson said .
' On cloud nine '
He had not logged into the site since October last year and did not respond to initial emails , but after Ms Wilson messaged his children Mr Paros emailed back .
Ms Wilson said : " My sister would phone him on a Sunday and speak to him through an interpreter .
" She is just absolutely on cloud nine .
" They have been hugging , really , really happy .
" At Christmas my sister had a stroke , she suffers from angina , diabetes and chronic nose bleeds ... but it is very important that now is the time she spends with her son because she is not a well lady . "
Plasterer Gavin , who turns 30 on Saturday , is now married with three children and had also been trying to trace his family for the past five years .

In a vote of 47 to 34 , the Knesset ( Israeli Parliament ) has given initial approval to a new bill that would criminalize opposing Israel ’s status as a “ Jewish state , ” punishable by up to a year in prison .
The bill is aimed at Israeli Arabs who object to their status as second - class citizens in the nation .
The bill was criticized by parts of the Israeli left , with Meretz Party MP Haim Oron saying he disagrees with people who believe Israel should not be a Jewish state , but feels the law is “ insane ” and creates “ thought police . ”
It was the third bill this week targeting Israel ’s Arab minority .
On Sunday a committee approved a bill that would jail any Arabs caught commemorating Israel ’s Independence Day as the Nakba , or day of catastrophe .
Advocates of the bill said the Nakba protest marches were a threat to Israel ’s existence .
The very next day , Yisrael Beiteinu made good on its campaign pledge to introduce a bill requiring all Arabs to swear loyalty to Israel as a “ Jewish , Zionist ” state , revoking the citizenship of all that refused .
Such bills are not unheard of in Israel ’s history , but the election of a far right government this year seems to have spawned several ambitious bills curtailing the Israeli Arabs ’ rights to criticize the government .

Theclass defined in the Django Python web application framework is used to manage query results returned from the database .
From the developer perspective , instances provide a high - level interface for dealing with query results .
Part of the reason for this is that instances of this class behave very similarly to other Python primitive types such as lists .
This is accomplished by defining " magic " methods , or , operator overloading .
If an operator for a specific instance is overloaded , it simply means that the default behavior for that operator has been replaced when the operand involves this instance .
This means that we can do things such as use twoinstances in an and expression that will invoke custom behavior rather than the default behavior .
This useful because it is generally easier and more intuitive to use operators in certain contexts than invoking methods .
In the case of using two instances in an and expression , it makes more sense to use the built - in and Python keyword than it does to invoke somemethod on the instance .
The Django provides several " magic " methods that do just this and we will discuss some of them below .
Python instances that need to provide custom pickling behavior need to implement themethod .
Theclass provides an implementation of this method .
The Django implementation removes any references to self by copying theattribute .
Here is an example of how this method might get invoked .
The representation of Python instances is provided by themethod if it is defined .
The Django implementation will call the builtinfunction on itself .
The size of the resulting list is based on thevariable which defaults to 20 .
The result of calling the builtinfunction on this new list is then returned .
Here is an example of how this method might get invoked .
The length of theinstance can be obtained by calling the builtinfunction while using the instance as the parameter .
In order for this to work , amethod must be defined by the instance .
In the case of Django instances , the first thing checked is the length of the result cache .
The result cache is simply a Python list that exists in Python memory to try and save on database query costs .
However , if the result cache is empty , it is filled by theiterator .
If the result cache is not empty , it is extended by theiterator .
This means that the result cache is updated with any results that should be in the result cache but are not at the time of theinvocation .
The builtinfunction is then called on the result cache and returned .
Here is an example of how this method might get invoked .
Python allows user - defined instance to participate in iterations .
In order to do so , the class must define anmethod .
This method defines the behavior for how individual elements in a set are returned in an iteration .
Theimplementation of this method will first check if the result cache exists .
If theresult cache is empty , the iterator defined for theinstance is returned .
The iterator does the actual SQL querying and so in this scenario , the iteration looses out on the performance gained by having cached results .
However , if a result cache does exist in theinstance , the builtinfunction is called on the cache and this new iterator is returned .
Here is an example of how themethod might be invoked .
Python instances can also take part in if statements and invoke custom behavior defined by themethod .
If an instance defines this method , it will be invoked if the instance is an operand in a truth test .
The Django implementation of this method first checks for a result cache , as does most of the other " magic " methods .
If the result cache does exist , it will return the result of calling the builtinfunction on the result cache .
If there is no result cache yet , the method will attempt to retrieve the first item by performing an iteration on theinstance .
If the first item can not be found , false is returned .
Here is an example of how themight be invoked .
Finally , Python instance may be part or and an or Python expressions .
The Django instance defines bothandmethods .
When these methods are invoked , they will change the underlying SQL query used by returning a newinstance .
Here is an example of how both these methods may be used .
Pretty as it is , 70 mm film has been deemed too expensive for shooting Hollywood productions .
So this is how IMAX preps finished movies for the up close and personal demands of IMAX .
Advertisement
( Left , 35 mm reel .
Right , IMAX reel . )
Before we move on , let 's explain IMAX film .
Technically , it 's a 70 mm standard that — unlike the 70 mm that was popular back in the day with big movies like Lawrence of Arabia —has been turned sideways on the celluloid .
So while typical 70 mm motion picture film runs vertically and takes up 5 perforations on the film strip , IMAX runs horizontally and takes up 15 perforations .
Yes , that means that the IMAX 70 mm standard is three times bigger than normal 70 mm and nine times bigger than 35 mm .
Advertisement
Now do you know why we 've been making such a big deal about it ?
Kodak estimates their 35 mm film stock to run at an equivalent of 6 K digital resolution — that 's 2 K better than the famous 4 K Red One camera .
As Kodak makes IMAX film out of the same ink / material that they make 35 mm film , to scale , you can argue that IMAX reaches a theoretical equivalent of 18 K digital , or 252 megapixels .
In real application , even an expert we talked to within IMAX doubted if the viewer can see 18 K projected , estimating that 12 K might be a more accurate guess .
IMAX film is — unquestionably — far more impressive than any other standard on the block , analog or digital .
So how the heck can IMAX claim they can take a normal 35 mm film , like Star Trek , and play it on IMAX screens ?
Advertisement
( Left , 35 mm reel .
Right , IMAX reel . )
To be fair , this insanely high resolution 70 mm film format is only used in the huge free - standing IMAX theaters found in museums and parks throughout the world .
As you might recall from our previous story on IMAX " retrofitting " in multiplexes , IMAX 's digital projection system used in those theaters is a mere 3 K or 4 K in resolution .
There 's definitely a double standard , and though it 's still an impressive theater experience , it 's not the same and you have the right to feel a bit ripped off if you 're expecting a 70 mm print .
Advertisement
But regardless of the film 's destination , it is carried through roughly the same process known as DMR ( which , enigmatically , stands for " digital re-mastering " ) , which starts with a digital encoding of a standard 35 mm Hollywood film , and ends with a remastered , ( usually ) higher - resolution digital format for multiplexes , and a bunch of reels of remastered crazy - high - resolution 70 mm film for the true IMAX theaters .
Advertisement
During my day at IMAX HQ , I kept referring to the process as " uprezzing " — the same mundane miracle that allows DVDs to play on HDTVs .
But every time I used this term , it was met with a shiver from production personnel .
After seeing their process , I still think " uprezzing " fits , but blowing up a film 's resolution requires a lot of tweaking and artistry , so I can appreciate their reaction a bit more .
When IMAX converted Apollo 13 , the first 35 mm movie to be converted to IMAX , the whole process took three months .
Now , a team of about 20 digital artists can convert a movie in three weeks with the help of a powerful render farm .
Advertisement
Source film generally arrives at IMAX pre-digitized in either 2 K ( 2048×1080 ) or 4 K ( 4096×2160 ) resolution .
In the case of the Dark Knight , some footage reached 5.6 K and even 8 K .
It leaves IMAX at anywhere from 4 K to 8 K resolution , sharpened with film grain reduced .
The staff views the movie while analyzing general trends like lighting and coloring in a film .
Each movie has a certain overall look , and then each scene ( exterior night , interior day , spaceship orbiting planet , etc. ) has a certain particular lighting and coloring of its own , so they note all of the overarching trends — the keys to each scene type — and then they tailor uprezzing ( or just polishing ) algorithms to take them into account .
The algorithms are unique to the film but the result , after all the painstaking customization , is a fairly automated hit - the - render - button - get - an - IMAX - movie video - scaling process .
Advertisement
Well , almost .
About 80 % of the film 's frames come out of the automated process looking great .
It 's the remaining 20 % that 's the real bitch .
Sometimes the process arranges pixels in ways that bring forth unforeseen oddities in the image .
These tainted frames are either sent back through the render farm again with tweaked settings , or they are fixed by hand .
I watched a member of the IMAX team screen a clip from Night at the Museum 2 in which Owen Wilson is green screened in front of a pile of sand .
He had just a few frames of the film looped on his monitor , less than a second of real material , and they looked fine by my account .
( Our apologies for a lack of pictures , but acquiring studio rights to images has proven difficult . )
Advertisement
Of course , this was a 20 - inch display , and the film would play on a screen …a bit larger than that .
So the film analyst urged me to look closer , at which point I noticed an aura of softness around Wilson 's figure , killing the texture of the sand .
With a keypress , the screen snapped to the same frames in the 35 mm , which looked fine .
The automated uprez process had highlighted some of the intentionally hidden seams of the special effects .
Advertisement
That footage was sent back to the artists to fix by hand , as are a lot of the 10,000 to 20,000 frames of film IMAX processes during a day of DMR work .
That 's just the artistic side , which happens for both the multiplex digital IMAX and the 70 mm film IMAX — there 's also the delicate matter of assembling all this film properly back into one big strip for the the true IMAX theaters and their film projectors .
Advertisement
IMAX reels and 35 mm reels do n't line up in a convenient 1 - to - 1 ratio .
Because the film is physically bigger , there are almost five IMAX reels for every reel of 35 mm .
Not only do they have to make sure every single cut from one reel to the next is smooth , they have to make sure everything stays in the right order , a huge pain , especially when just a few frames are being fixed at a time .
Advertisement
The film part of the process culminates in a scene - by - scene analysis of the 70 mm dailies — 172,800 frames for a 2 - hour movie — viewed on a lightbox with the 35 mm film right beside the IMAX uprez .
If the in - and - out points are the same , things are generally fine .
If not …it 's gonna be a long night .
But even with all this earnest work of artists and video wizards , will that original 35 mm content look better when either upscaled or just cleaned ?
I 'm going to say yes , not because I 've had the opportunity to analyze a pre- and post - DMR film with my own eyes , but because a staggering amount of the staff 's efforts are simply to eliminate film grain .
And while , to me , that 's a sin to do for archival film restoration or 1080 p
Blu-ray transfers , I can understand the necessary evil when a movie is expanded to epic proportions and the audience is forced to sit in ridiculously close proximity to the screen .
Nobody pays to see blackheads the size of a house , especially on Ben Stiller .
Advertisement
Besides , regular IMAX movies shot on IMAX 70 mm film are always going to look better .
Anyone who 's ever used Photoshop knows there 's no way that digitally enlarging an image will ever look as good as an already - large image in its native resolution .
Parts of The Dark Knight were shot for IMAX , and I 've seen that footage on true 70 mm IMAX projection .
I 've also seen plenty of 35 mm movies ( like Star Trek ) up on the IMAX screen , projected from a 70 mm film print , after DMR .
There is absolutely no comparison .
Star
Trek is fun to watch on a big screen .
The Dark Knight is so ridiculously detailed that your brain can barely process it .
As much as I can admire IMAX 's DMR process and the truly staggering amount of effort going into digital enhancement , this does beg one question of Hollywood :
You 've got hundreds of millions for talent and marketing , but you do n't have enough cash to buy a truckload of 70 mm film and deal with tricky cameras ?
I find that hard to believe .

BEIJING : In a bizarre case , a 13 - year old boy has been arrested for killing a three - year old infant girl and then having sex with the corpse .
The postmortem has confirmed that the girl was first killed and then sexually assaulted , the police said .
" We have arrested the boy and are interrogating him to determine the motive of the murder , ��� the police in Haizhu district of South China���s Guangzhou province said about the May 19 incident in the district .
The arrest took place two days after the incident but the police are holding back the name of the accused because he is a minor .
Under Chinese law , a person below the age of 14 cannot be charged with criminal offense .
This is what has made this case of necrophilia a challenge one for the local legal authorities .
The accused has confessed to have committed the crime , the police said .
He also told police that he acted alone without any accomplice .
The boy noticed the little girl , who was playing near her apartment building , on his way home from school .
He grabbed and took her to his house .
There was no one else in his house at that time .
The boy is believed to have bound the infant���s hands and feet before drowning her in a basin full of water , local reports say .
" My daughter had gone out to play at about 5 pm on May 19 , but when she did n't return till dark , we got worried .���
We went out to search for her , and at about 8 pm we noticed police barricades near an apartment building nearby , ��� the girl���s father was quoted by the Guangzhou - based South China Metropolis Daily as saying .
The local media quoted psychologists as saying that the incident may have been motivated by pornography available on the Internet .
It also quoted local lawyers as saying that the victim���s family could be compensated but the accused would not be subject to criminal charges because he is below the age of 14 .
The father of the accused is a chef , who lives in another city .
His mother is a waitress in the same city and lives with the boy .
It 's been another huge day of data - gathering in the years - long bid to get to the bottom of the secret and illegal torture program set up by Bush and Cheney as their central tool in the war on Jihadist terrorism .
You can download the leaked - and devastating International Committee of the Red Cross report here .
You can read about the chilling similarities between the Bush - Cheney techniques and those used by the Soviet gulag here .
You can read more details of how doctors were implicated in monitoring and measuring the torture of human beings here .
If you need confirmation that this new data is real and dispositive , then go read the partisan right blogs .
Their total radio silence tells you something .
But Mark Danner 's superb piece , after years of superb reporting , comes to an important conclusion that we should not miss .
It is that we need to put all the data on the table - including both the precise techniques and who authorized and perpetrated them and also the alleged intelligence gains from the program .
Danner sees why this latter point , which I have also endorsed , is so important .
Until we can examine the claims from Cheney et al . that torture saved lives , we will never be able to remove the danger of a president reinstigating torture on the same basis in the future .
The GOP is not ashamed of using this as a political weapon .
Cheney has all but declared that without torture , America can not be safe .
Gingrich is reiterating that .
Rove tried to run the 2006 election on the question of who has the balls to torture terror suspects more brutally .
Unless we have clear data that can judge these claims , we cannot dispositively prevent a recurrence .

I am leaving out the activity of this project on YouTube , Twitter , Vodpod , and Vimeo , leaving that for the end of the year .
One interesting note : the top referrer to this blog for this past quarter was Abu Muqawama , a counterinsurgency blog .
The second most prominent referrer , thanks to Lorenz Khazaleh , was antropologi.info .
Canons to the left of me , cannons to the right of me …
I was recently reminded of a remark many years ago by my research assistant , a serious student of philosophy who had the menial task of getting books for me from the library .
Handing over the latest batch of books , she commiserated with me on having to read so many second - rate writers while she had the privilege of reading only the Greats .
The offending books on this occasion were by the English philosopher T.H. Green .
I feebly , almost apologetically , explained that Green was highly respected in his time and played an important part in the subjects I was working on , social philosophy and policy in Victorian England .
I even ventured to suggest that he still had a good deal to say to us , more than a century later .
As it happened , Green himself was only once removed from the Greats – a neo-Kantian , he might be called .
A generation earlier , Macaulay , presented with a translation of Kant , said that he could not understand a word of it “ any more than if it had been written in Sanscrit ” .
Green made Kantianism intelligible as well as respectable to Englishmen because in Anglicising it , he also liberalised and socialised it – domesticated it , so to speak .
That was no small feat .
There were other attempts to bring those most formidable of modern Greats , Kant and Hegel , to the attention of the English , but for the most part , the English went their own way .
John Stuart Mill , who in his youth had read almost everything worth reading , referred in On Liberty to Plato and Aristotle twice in passing , to Kant once and to Hegel not at all .
Mill himself , the most eminent of English philosophers , did not , by the standards of my student , merit the title of greatness .
He was more eminent than Green but still of a lesser order of greatness , a second - best order .
I might have reminded my student that the greatest of the Greats had themselves paid tribute to the second - best .
Plato himself had made the transition from the best , the ideal city of the Republic , to the second - best , in the Laws .
The Athenian Stranger , in the Laws , used that very term when he said that the city should be “ ordered in a manner which , if not the best , is the second best ” .
Aristotle went further in his rejection of the best , sharply criticising the “ best constitution ” of the Republic as impractical and contrary to human nature and proposing instead , in the Politics , a mixed constitution , in effect , a second - best constitution , that is the best practical constitution .
So , too , in the Ethics , he distinguished between “ wisdom ” , which is universal and eternal , and “ prudence ” , which is practical and particular – the former intellectually more exalted , and in this sense the best , but the latter , the second - best , the most basic human virtue .
It is said that we need the best as a measure against which to test the second - best , to show us how far we are deviating from the best .
In this sense , the best is the ideal to which the second - best aspires .
But if the ideal is impractical because inconsonant with human nature , how or why should we aspire to it ?
The case for the second - best goes beyond practicality .
More serious is the fact that the attempt to realise the unrealisable is likely to be pernicious .
Voltaire is credited with the dictum : “ The best is the enemy of the good . ”
What he did write was “ Le mieux est l’ennemi du bien ” – “ le mieux ” translatable as either the better or the best .
It is interesting that the French use the same word for concepts that in English are so sharply distinguished : the better and the best .
One might almost make this symbolic of the historic differences between the two countries .
The unambiguous English version of that dictum makes it clear that it is only the best that is the enemy of the good , and that the better , the second - best , is the friend and ally of the good .
Indeed , the best may be more pernicious still , for it is not only the enemy of the good ; it may be an invitation to the worst .
The perils of utopianism are by now all too familiar .
It was in the name of the best – of so - called “ ideals ” – that some of the worst tyrannies have been perpetrated and rationalised .
Robespierre ’s Reign of Terror was instituted in the name of the “ Republic of Virtue ” , which was a conscious adaptation of Rousseau ’s “ reign of virtue ” .
Leo Strauss once observed that in the 19th century , Germany ’s politics were “ a mess ” while its thinkers were “ first - class ” .
England ’s politics , on the other hand , were “ fine ” , and its thinkers “ second - class ” .
The implication ( which Strauss did not have to spell out to his disciples ) was clear : there may be an inverse relationship between philosophy and politics .
Grand philosophies of the Germanic order – abstract , systematic , comprehensive , engaging all aspects of nature , aspiring to create a whole that would subsume all contingencies and rationally construct ( or reconstruct ) the world – such philosophies were not only irrelevant to the mundane affairs of social and political life but also fatally distracting and disruptive .
Conversely , the modest philosophies favoured by the English ( a German philosopher might say of Mill , as Churchill said of Clement Attlee , that he had much to be modest about ) were attuned to a culture that was practical and prudent and thus conducive to a polity that was humane and responsible .
Economists have recently elaborated a theory of the second - best , in which the optimum resolution of a problem may involve a strategy of second - best devices .
At least one legal philosopher has invoked that model for the discipline of jurisprudence .
But it was more than 150 years ago that Alexis de Tocqueville delivered what may still be the last word on the subject .
Tocqueville was speaking of America when he extolled its philosophy of “ self - interest rightly understood ” .
But he might have been speaking of England too – the source , after all , of the phrase , “ self - interest ” .
And he was speaking , more broadly , of a moral philosophy ( Adam Smith , after all , was a “ moral philosopher ” by trade , as well as an economist ) that went well beyond the economic context of that phrase .
“ The principle of self - interest rightly understood [ Tocqueville wrote ] is not a lofty one , but it is clear and sure .
It does not aim at mighty objects , but it attains without excessive exertion all those at which it aims .
By its admirable conformity to human weaknesses it easily obtains great dominion …
By itself it cannot suffice to make a man virtuous ; but it disciplines a number of persons in habits of regularity , temperance , moderation , foresight , self - command …
If the principle of interest rightly understood were to sway the whole moral world , extraordinary virtues would doubtless be more rare ; but I think that gross depravity would then be less common … [
It ] perhaps prevents men from rising far above the level of mankind , but great number of other men , who were falling far below it , are caught and restrained by it .
Observe some few individuals , they are lowered by it ; survey mankind , they are raised .
I am not afraid to say that the principle of self - interest rightly understood appears to me the best suited of all philosophic theories to the wants of the men of our time . ”
This was the philosophy of the second - best , at its best – “ the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of men of our time ” – and , perhaps , of all time .

Wird die grüne Gentechnik überschätzt ?
Brigitte Zarzer
Der jüngste Bericht des Büros für Technikfolgenabschätzung lässt oft geäußerte Erwartungen an transgene Pflanzen der 2 . und 3 .
Generation als überzogen erscheinen
Das Büro für Technikfolgen - Abschätzung legte dem Bundestagsausschuss für Forschung kürzlich einen Bericht zum Thema „ Grüne Gentechnik – Transgene Pflanzen der 2 . und 3 . Generation “ vor .
Der Bericht behandelt die Potenziale und Perspektiven von nutzungsveränderten Pflanzen als Grundlage für funktionelle Lebensmittel oder zur Produktion neuer nachwachsender Rohstoffe sowie für human - und tiermedizinische Zwecke .
Dabei zeigt sich , dass etliche Optionen von der Industrie bereits wieder verworfen wurden und die Entwicklung in den meisten Fällen weniger weit gediehen ist als erhofft .
Bessere Chancen werden dem Segment der Pharmapflanzen eingeräumt .
MdB Hans - Josef Fell vom Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen nimmt den Bericht zum Anlass , eine forschungspolitische
Wende hin zur weißen Biotechnologie und verstärkter Biodiversitätsforschung zu fordern .
Bis heute haben nur zwei Technologien im Bereich der grünen Gentechnik kommerzielle Bedeutung erlangt : Insektenresistente und herbizidtolerante GV - Pflanzen ( GVP ) , die gewisse agronomische Vorteile für die industrialisierte Landwirtschaft bringen .
Da sie vom Endverbraucher aber als zusätzliches Risiko empfunden werden , setzen Gentech - Befürworter große Hoffnungen in transgene Pflanzen der 2 . und 3 .
Generation , die etwa durch verbesserte Inhaltsstoffe die Akzeptanz der grünen Gentechnik erhöhen könnten .
Auch an den Bereich nachwachsende Rohstoffe oder Pharmapflanzen wurden und werden hohe Erwartungen geknüpft .
Doch wer den TAB - Bericht ( der dem Ausschuss vorgelegte Gesamtbericht liegt der Redaktion vor ) durchliest , gewinnt den Eindruck , dass die meisten Projekte unglaublich aufwändig und darüber hinaus viele technische Fragen noch offen sind .
Der kommerzielle Erfolg ist nicht absehbar .
Am interessantesten erscheint noch das Segment der Pharmapflanzen zu sein .
Das Büro für Technikfolgenabschätzung ist eine selbständige wissenschaftliche Einrichtung , die den Deutschen Bundestag und seine Ausschüsse in Fragen des wissenschaftlich - technischen Wandels berät .
Der Bericht wurde Sommer 2003 in Auftrag gegeben und Mitte Februar 2006 vorgelegt .
Dr. Arnold Sauter und sein Team analysierten – soweit ermittelbar – Aktivitäten rund um GVP der 2 . und 3 . Generation weltweit .
Besonderes Augenmerk wurde auf die drei wichtigsten Hauptgruppen gelegt : GVP zur Produktion funktioneller Lebensmittel bzw . von „ Functional Food “ ( „ FF - GVP “ ) , zur Produktion pharmazeutisch nutzbarer Proteine ( „ PMP - GVP “ ) sowie zur Produktion anderweitig industriell nutzbarer Stoffe ( „ PMI - GVP “ ) .
Der oft in Medien beschworene Anschub der grünen Gentechnik durch die Entwicklung von GVPs mit Verbrauchernutzen dürfte sich vorerst nicht realisieren .
„ Innerhalb des Gesamtkonzepts Funktioneller Lebensmittel wird GVP - Ansätzen in den nächsten Jahren nur eine geringe Bedeutung zukommen “ , so die Studienautoren .
Hier würden die Unternehmen Zurückhaltung zeigen .
Das dürfte auch daran liegen , dass für die meisten zurzeit in GVP erforschten Inhaltstoffe bereits etablierte Produktionsplattformen ( z.B. chemische Synthese , Isolierung aus natürlichen Quellen ) vorhanden sind , mit denen GVP konkurrieren müssen .
Hinzu kommt die Frage , ob sich die mehrheitlich skeptischen Verbraucher aufgrund eines propagierten gesundheitlichen Nutzens tatsächlich zum Konsum von GVP animieren lassen würden .
Im Bericht heißt es dazu :
Es kann wohl aber davon ausgegangen werden , dass ein solcher gesundheitlicher Zusatznutzen allein nicht ausreichen wird , um Akzeptanz für GVP herzustellen .
Auch für – konventionell hergestellte – Funktionelle Lebensmittel ist der gesundheitlich Zusatznutzen eine notwendige , aber keine hinreichende Produkteigenschaft , um am Markt bestehen zu können .
Nachwachsende Rohstoffe ?
Überrascht zeigen sich die Autoren über die eher mageren Ergebnisse im Bereich der Entwicklung von nachwachsenden Rohstoffen für industrielle Zwecke ( PMI ) aus GVP , zumal hier große Hoffnungen gehegt und auch EU - weit viele Projekte gefördert wurden , sich bisher aber ( auch weltweit ) kaum Produkte am Markt bzw. im Zulassungsstadium befinden .
Dabei geht es etwa um gentechnische Modifikation des Fettsäurespektrums ( „ Öl - Design “ ) oder Kohlehydraten ( „ Stärke - Design “ ) , Produktion von Biokunststoff aus GVP , veränderte Holz - und Fasereigenschaften von Bäumen u.ä .
Aus europäischer Sicht interessant ist die Entwicklung der amylosefreien Kartoffel , die bereits 1997 zur Zulassung angemeldet wurde , zunächst aber dem bis Frühjahr 2004 geltendem de facto - Moratorium in der EU zum Opfer gefallen war .
Die Grundidee hinter dieser GV - Kartoffel war ein durchaus ökologischer .
Denn durch die Reduktion von Amylose könnte Amylopektin , ein Stoff , der laut dem TAB - Bericht zur Produktion von Bindemitteln und in der Papierindustrie eingesetzt wird , umweltschonender gewonnen werden .
Durch den Wegfall aufwändiger Trennungsverfahren könnten Energie - und Wasserverbrauch reduziert werden , so die Idee .
Insgesamt zeigt sich der Bericht aber skeptisch gegenüber der Entwicklung GV - Industriepflanzen .
In einer eigens verfassten TAB - Kurzinfo heißt es treffend :
Das biologische ‚ Produktionssystem Pflanze ’ wehrt sich grundsätzlich gegen eine zu große Produktion einzelner Inhaltsstoffe , so dass die erzielten und möglicherweise erzielbaren Ausbeuten meist ( noch ? ) nicht ausreichen , um gegen die konventionelle Konkurrenz ( nicht gentechnisch veränderte Pflanzen , mikrobielle Produktionssysteme oder z.B. aus Erdöl gewonnene chemische Erzeugnisse ) erfolgreich bestehen zu können .
Theoretisch am plausibelsten wirken hier Ansätze der Herstellung von speziellen und hochpreisigen Inhaltsstoffen , die nur in kleineren Mengen benötigt werden und exklusiv in bzw .
mit transgenen Pflanzen produziert werden können – doch dafür gibt es bis jetzt kaum Beispiele .
Die hier eingeräumte Komplexität der Pflanze ist eines der Hauptargumente der Kritiker der grünen Gentechnik .
Die praktischen Schwächen der bisher kommerzialisierten GV - Pflanzen sind tatsächlich nicht wegzudiskutieren .
Nach mehr als zwanzig Jahren Forschung ist schließlich selbst bei GV - Linien der 1 .
Generation das Problem der Ausbreitung von Fremdgenen nicht befriedigend gelöst .
Insofern ist die derzeit in kritischen Kreisen häufig geäußerte Befürchtung nachvollziehbar , dass sich Gentechnik etwa über Energiepflanzen ( Anm. nachwachsende Rohstoffe der 1 .
Generation mit agronomischen Merkmalen wurden im TAB - Bericht nicht behandelt ) auf den Feldern Europas ausbreiten könnten .
Der Verbraucher würde hier möglicherweise weniger skeptisch reagieren als im Nahrungsmittelbereich .
Der Natur allerdings ist es egal , ob sich Fremdgene über Nahrungsmittel - oder Energiepflanzen verbreiten .
Hans - Josef Fell , Berichterstatter für Technikfolgenabschätzung Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen dazu im Telepolis - Gespräch :
Nachwachsende Rohstoffe sind natürlich ein Thema .
Allerdings braucht man dafür nicht die grüne Gentechnik .
Die Natur bietet genügend Pflanzen .
Zum Beispiel muss man bei Energiepflanzen nicht einseitig auf Raps setzen , da es viele andere Ölpflanzen gibt , die dann in Mischkultur angebaut werden können .
Hier gibt es vereinzelt bereits viel versprechende Projekte .
Monokulturen hingegen tendieren dazu , zum Einfallstor für die grüne Gentechnik zu werden .
Neuausrichtung der Forschungspolitik ?
Fell hält die grüne Gentechnik generell für überschätzt .
Der TAB - Bericht macht jedenfalls klar , dass man bei der grünen Gentechnik der 2 . und 3 .
Generation sehr genau hinsehen und vor allem mögliche alternative Produktionsformen gegenüberstellen muss , um dann jene Projekte herauszufiltern , bei denen es überhaupt vertretbar ist , sie mit öffentlichen Geldern zu fördern .
Die Autoren geben einige Handlungsempfehlungen für die Ausrichtung der Forschungspolitik ab .
So wird unter anderem ein ressortübergreifendes Zusammenwirken angeregt .
Empfohlen wird zudem eine stärkere gesellschaftliche Öffnung „ bereits in frühen Forschungsstadien “ .
Der Grünen - Abgeordnete
Fell nimmt den Bericht zum Anlass , grundsätzliche Kritik an der Art und Weise zu üben wie heute Forschungspolitik betrieben wird :
Heute fragt die Politik die - etablierten – Wissenschaftler : ‚ Was haltet ihr für wichtig ?’.
Gerade im Bereich der grünen Gentechnik sind viele Forscher aber nicht unabhängig sondern irgendwie mit der Gentech - Industrie verbandelt .
Die Politik sollte umgekehrt zuerst herausfinden , was ökologisch und sozial förderungswürdig ist und daran ihre Forschungspolitik ausrichten .
Für die Grünen hieße das eine Hinwendung zu nachhaltiger Landwirtschaft , erneuerbaren Energien und im Bereich der Biotechnologie die Förderung der weißen bzw .
grauen Biotechnologie .
Fell im Telepolis - Gespräch :
Wer den Kritikern der grünen Gentechnik ständig Forschungsfeindlichkeit vorwirft , tut dem Gesamtbereich Biotechnologie nichts Gutes .
Wir Grüne sehen gerade in der weißen Biotechnologie - etwa in der besseren Aufschließung und Verwertung von Rohstoffen - große Forschungspotenziale .
Ich persönlich würde mir ein weg von der Petrochemie wünschen und eine Hinwendung zur Pflanzenchemie .
Bei Pflanzenwirkstoffen , Biodiversität etc. gibt es noch jede Menge Forschungsbedarf und Potenzial , das auch für die Wirtschaft interessant ist .
Wie immer man zur Einschätzung Fells stehen mag , eine Grundsatzdebatte über die Ausrichtung von Forschungs - und Agrarpolitik wäre sicher angebracht .
Und diese sollte nicht auf Deutschland beschränkt bleiben sondern auf EU - Ebene unter relevanter Einbindung der Öffentlichkeit geführt werden .
In der Telepolis - Buchreihe ist von Brigitte Zarzer vor kurzem erschienen : Einfach GEN:ial .
Die grüne Gentechnik .
