I nearly called this article ‚Äú Everything I know about blogging I learned from comic books ‚Äù but I was afraid too many people would take it literally , ha .
In fact , there might be an element of truth to it .
My formative reading material was dominated by muscly , spandex - clad guys and gals fighting crime and shooting laser beams out of their eyes .
Like most geeks who grew up in the 1980s , I have been heavily influenced by Marvel , 2000 AD / Judge Dredd , and to a lesser extend , DC comics .
Other than the odd graphic novel purchase , my interest was put to one side due to time , family , and so on .
Recently though , due to the Marvel iPhone app , I have a renewed interest in buying comic books .
This has made me look at them with a new perspective and I realised just how much content creators can learn from these publishers , writers and artists .
As Stan Lee would say ‚Ä¶ excelsior !
Excitement & Anticipation ‚Äì Comics are all about capturing interest , building and maintaining it .
When you get to the end of each issue , what is there ?
That ‚Äôs right ‚Ä¶ a cliff - hanger !
Want to know what happens next ?
Look out for the next issue .
Fans look forward to the next new comic , they devour it , discuss it , swap it , then look forward to the next .
And on and on !
Even when re-issuing older archive stuff , like on the iPhone app , they still serialize the content and make you wait .
Why ?
It builds anticipation and means you will buy a piece at a time .
Lesson : Build anticipation , tell your audience the great stuff that is coming , drip - feed content , syndicate , and make sure you deliver on those promises .
Visual impact ‚Äì Half or more of the joy of comics is in the visuals .
In fact , you do n‚Äôt actually need the words a lot of the time to follow the story .
Comic book artists are masters at telling a story visually and making everything that much more compelling .
Combined with the occasionally really great plot ( Dark Knight , Watchmen ) , this makes the medium really engaging and addictive .
Lesson :
Do n‚Äôt rely on a wall of text .
Spice up your content with visuals .
Rather than try to describe everything , use illustrations and visual guides .
This aids learning and consumption , which means your content will be far more successful .
Cross - selling ‚Äì Comic books are experts at cross-selling .
It ‚Äôs not just in the comic book store or full page ads within the comics , it is actually in the content .
One thing lots of people notice when getting more involved in reading comics is buying one series is not enough to get the full story .
First there are usually years of back story , inside jokes , plot twists , but then while one plot line is taking place , the rest of the story is unfolding in sister comics , for example ‚Äú* See Avengers # 517 ‚Äù .
That is a strong enough pull for many a fan to discover new characters , series , artists , and so - on , but for the truly addicted collector , it never ends .
Lesson :
Where another piece of content or product is relevant , mention it .
Keep adding and creating more relevant content or products while the demand is strong .
Predict what people will want , need next and deliver it .
Create an environment where a customer can discover more of your great stuff .
Human Drama ‚Äì
The stories in these comics never stay still , and while much of the action is crude ( people fighting or spoiling for a fight ) , they also have the power to move you .
We feel involved , we want to know what happens because we care .
Although based in science fiction or fantasy , the drama is most importantly human .
Peter Parker was a bullied school kid who , yes , got bitten by a radiactive spider , but also had relationship problems , career issues , and suffered loss .
The Hulk is profoundly lonely .
And so on .
The web is now very much social , which is about people .
People engage with people , they connect with the person over the brand .
Especially important if you are a non-profit , the human - interest story is your key to making connections .
Lesson : Bring your content alive , show humanity , connect on a personal level .
A lot of the time drama is actually something people in business distance from .
We seem to relate drama with emotional instability .
But people want and like drama when it is the right kind .
Drama might not be your thing , but the point is about discovering ways to lift your content , from adding a simple joke with a surprising punchline through to colorful , lively , engrossing stories .
Longevity ‚Äì How many characters and storylines can continue decades ?
Even in Television long - lived stories are rare , but in comics it is pretty much the norm .
Superman has been around for generations , in print , radio , TV and film .
All the ingredients mentioned here have counted towards that , but in addition they are always moving with the times , changing , evolving , testing , trying new things , but not breaking their core .
Lesson :
Do n‚Äôt be afraid to experiment but keep true to what your audience and customers love you for .
You will be rewarded with loyalty .
Customer - focus ‚Äì Following from the last point , these brands still exist because they have the customer in mind with every decision .
Yes , there have been times when they have stepped out of line .
The fans can be cruel in their vocal reactions sometimes .
But these publishers and writers know how to correct their mistakes , know what the audience likes and they give it to them , and because of that are forgiven when their experiments fall flat .
Most started out as fans before getting into the industry .
They are still fans many of them .
Conventions , workshops and meetups allow the industry and fans to get together , plus now more than ever the customers have a voice that can be heard loud and clear .
Lesson : Keep in tune with your audience and customers .
Know what they are thinking .
Let them know you are listening .
Deliver what they really want , take chances , and do n‚Äôt be afraid to surprise your audience ( in a good way ) .
Brand management ‚Äì I have mentioned a few times that the comic book publishers really know their audience , but are willing to experiment .
A couple of times I also mentioned brands .
The characters and series are brands , and they are much - loved ( to the point of obsession occasionally ) brands at that .
This means there is a delicate balance between pushing the boundaries while also staying true .
Lesson : Knowing what the brand really means to people is vital , and making sure you stay consistent and do not betray the promises you set up .
Skimming and Sound bites ‚Äì
As well as visuals , these stories are told in sound bites .
Unlike a novel , there are very few words used to convey the story , with most of it dialog ( even internal dialog ) .
Short , clipped sentences , speech bubbles and information boxes .
This means the stories can move fast and get across the information required very briefly .
Perfect for distracted , excited , readers .
This format also means that it is very repeatable and quotable .
Characters develop catch phrases , which means playground word of mouth .
Consumption is increased because a reader can get through several comics in one sitting .
Lesson :
If you want to get your point across quickly and not lose your reader ‚Äôs interest , make your content into compact and easy to consume .
Use lots of quotes , images and sound bites .
Multiple media ‚Äì
As mentioned above , once a character gets a following you can expect to see it everywhere from action figures all the way through to the big screen .
The fans watch them , read them and wear them .
You can even read the comics on computer , or on your phone .
Lesson :
Be where your customers are and in the format your customers want .
Try video , audio , print , ebooks , long and short formats .
Repurposing ‚Äì
As content owners we often create something then let it rot , even though a lot of what we produce is evergreen .
Not so with comics .
Initially comics are serialised weekly , fortnightly or monthly , but then there will be collected comics , specials , repeats , graphic novels , re-issues , and as mentioned above , storylines are recycled into other media .
You can even subscribe for an all you can eat plan online for $ 60 a year over at Marvel.com ( which I am tempted to do , although I ca n‚Äôt understand why they do n‚Äôt extend that pricing to the iPhone ‚Ä¶ ) .
Lesson :
Be on the look out for how you can repurpose your existing content in new ways .
Perhaps republish an article , extract a bonus from a product and sell it , or bundle up content into an ebook ?
As is traditional , I stopped at # 10 üôÇ
Were or are you a comics fan ?
Which ?
What have I missed ?
Do you agree or disagree with any items ?
Does this give you any ideas ?
Please share your thoughts in the comments ‚Ä¶
Your cellphone can already tell you where to find the nearest Starbucks or the most convenient subway station .
But it might soon be smart enough to alert you to a toxic threat during your morning commute or coffee break , thanks to a new plan from the Department of Homeland Security .
The last time we heard about cellphones and terrorism , it was an appeal from the NYPD to shut off cell communication during an attack .
Now , Homeland Security 's Science and Technology Directorate want to use cellphones to detect the very threats that might be coordinated using wireless chit-chat .
Their new program , called Cell - All , would embed inexpensive , chemical - sniffing microchips into cellular telephones .
If a dangerous level of air - based toxin is detected , the phone would issue a warning ring ( or vibration ) to alert the owner and send a message to a centralized military monitoring station .
And , since the vast majority of Americans carry cellphones wherever they go , the program would use aggregated reports of toxin detection within a small area .
If hundreds of cellphones in one location start flooding the alert system , the military knows they 've got a serious threat to contend with .
Detection , transmission and analysis would take around 60 seconds , according to a press release from the Directorate .
Given that terrorist attacks are usually launched in highly populated areas ‚Äì subways , malls , office buildings ‚Äì the idea of crowdsourcing the detection of toxic terror threats makes a lot of sense , and using a built - in cellphone app would give the military the ability to detect threats in every corner of the country .
Except that , for now , the program 's manager is describing the initiative as " opt-in . "
" Privacy is as important as technology , " Stephen Dennis said .
" After all , for Cell - All to succeed , people must be comfortable enough to turn it on in the first place . "
That 's good news for privacy zealots and conspiracy theorists , but bad news for the program 's potential effectiveness , given that crowdsourced intelligence depends on knowing that there 's a crowd to be sourced in the first place .
The Directorate is already in research - and - development talks with Apple , IG , Qualcomm and Samsung , and anticipate having 40 different cellphone prototypes within a year .

Memo to NY Times : TV weathermen are not climate experts .
In fact , Dr. Judith Curry , Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech explained to me a few years ago :
Meteorologists are not required to take a course in climate change , this is not part of the NOAA / NWS [ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / National Weather Service ] certification requirements , so university programs do n‚Äôt require the course ( even if they offer it ) .
So we have been educating generations of meteorologists who know nothing at all about climate change .
The reason I am repeating this basic fact for the umpteenth time ‚Äî see ‚Äú Are meteorologists climate experts ? ‚Äù ‚Äî is that the former paper of record has once again equated people who do n‚Äôt know about climate science with people who do ( see ‚Äú NYT Faces Credibility Siege over Unbalanced Climate Coverage ‚Äú ) .
In a new , uber - dreadful he -said , she - said piece , ‚Äú Scientists and Weathercasters at Odds on Warming , ‚Äù the NYT ‚Äôs Leslie Kaufman gives a platform to some of the most uninformed , most widely debunked anti-science weathermen in the country , including Joe Bastardi and , yes , Anthony Watts !
Does anybody read Boykoff any more on ( see ‚Äú Exaggerating Denialism : Media Representations of Outlier Views on Climate Change ‚Äù ) ?
Wow !
I see that this is now a front page story for Tuesday and that the NYT changed the headline in the last hour to the much worse , ‚Äú Among Weathercasters , Doubt on Warming . ‚Äù
Great .
May I suggest instead , ‚Äú Some non-scientists who do n‚Äôt know much about how humans are changing the climate spout nonsense on the subject ‚Äù ?
Either way Andy Revkin ‚Äôs blog hypes the whole damn piece :
‚Äú Meteorologists are far more likely than climatologists to question the science of climate change , ‚Äù Leslie Kaufman reports in an article in The New York Times .
One reason , the article suggests , is that climate scientists study long - term weather patterns and meteorologists make short - term forecasts .
Ya think ?
There are also suggestions that some meteorologists resent the primacy of climatologists with Ph.D.‚Äôs .
So there are ‚Äú suggestions ‚Äù that meteorologists ( i.e. non-experts on climate ) resent the primacy of climatologists with Ph.D. ‚Äôs ( i.e. experts on climate ) .
I can hardly wait for rumors that other people who do n‚Äôt know what they ‚Äôre talking about resent those people who do .
And here ‚Äôs how the blog post ends :
Whom do you trust when it comes to climate science ?
Seriously .
But Revkin is just a blogger these days with a modest , self - selected audience .
The NYT still reaches millions on unsuspecting people expecting to be informed on the key issues of the day .
And this is what passes for front - page journalism in the former paper of record :
Climatologists , who study weather patterns over time , almost universally endorse the view that the earth is warming and that humans have contributed to climate change .
There is less of a consensus among meteorologists , who predict short - term weather patterns .
Huh .
People who do n‚Äôt actually study the climate and are n‚Äôt actually scientists have less of a firm grasp of the overwhelming scientific evidence on human - caused climate change .
Stop the presses , clear page one , get me Clark Kent and Lois Lane on rewrite !
Note also that Kaufman uses the weakest possible attribution statement :
humans have contributed to climate change
I do n‚Äôt think you could find one climate scientist in a thousand who disagrees with that statement .
I ‚Äôm not sure you could find one scientist in a hundred who disagrees with that statement .
Our scientific understanding today is that humans are the primary cause of warming in recent decades .
One can simply assert that it is basic physics that ‚Äú humans have contributed to climate change . ‚Äù
Joe Bastardi , for example , a senior forecaster and meteorologist with AccuWeather , maintains that it is more likely that the planet is cooling , and he distrusts the data put forward by climate scientists as evidence for rising global temperatures .
‚Äú There is a great deal of consternation among a lot of us over the readjustment of data that is going on and some of the portrayals that we are seeing , ‚Äù Mr. Bastardi said in a video segment posted recently on AccuWeather ‚Äôs Web site .
Joe Bastardi knows absolutely nothing about climate science and has been consistently spinning illogical and self - contradictory tripe on the subject .
His beloved satellite data clearly shows we ‚Äôre warming .
And , in any case , it ‚Äôs far from clear how much he really knows about meteorology , based on recent statements :
In MSM - land , being consistently wrong or illogical never discredits you .
But if the media can present you as a contrarian , someone who is supposed to hold one view , but in fact holds a contrary view , then you are the dream ‚Äú expert ‚Äù ( see ‚Äú Contrarian Chic :
Why ca n‚Äôt the media tell the difference between an attack on dubious ‚Äò conventional ‚Äô wisdom and an attack on genuine scientific wisdom ? ‚Äú )
Such skepticism appears to be widespread among TV forecasters , about half of whom have a degree in meteorology .
A study released on Monday by researchers at George Mason University and the University of Texas at Austin found that only about half of the 571 television weathercasters surveyed believed that global warming was occurring and fewer than a third believed that climate change was ‚Äú caused mostly by human activities . ‚Äù
More than a quarter of the weathercasters in the survey agreed with the statement ‚Äú Global warming is a scam , ‚Äù the researchers found .
The split between climate scientists and meteorologists is gaining attention in political and academic circles because polls show that public skepticism about global warming is increasing , and weather forecasters ‚Äî especially those on television ‚Äî dominate communications channels to the public .
A study released this year by researchers at Yale and George Mason found that 56 percent of Americans trusted weathercasters to tell them about global warming far more than they trusted other news media or public figures like former Vice President Al Gore or Sarah Palin , the former vice - presidential candidate .
The George Mason - Texas survey found that about half of the weathercasters said they had discussed global warming on their broadcasts during chats with anchors , and nearly 90 percent said they had talked about climate change at live appearances at Kiwanis Club - type events .
Several well - known forecasters ‚Äî including John Coleman in San Diego and Anthony Watts , a retired Chico , Calif. , weatherman who now has a popular blog ‚Äî have been vociferous in their critiques of global warming .
As an aside , the NYT article shares an awful lot in common with a January Columbia Journalism Review article , ‚Äú Hot Air : Why do n‚Äôt TV weathermen believe in climate change ? ‚Äú
The CJR article notes :
In the fall of 2008 , researchers from George Mason and Yale universities conducted the most fine - grained survey to date about what Americans know and think about climate change ‚Ä¶ .
When asked whom they trusted for information about global warming , 66 percent of the respondents named television weather reporters .
That was well above what the media as a whole got , and higher than the percentage who trusted Vice - President - turned - climate - activist Al Gore , either of the 2008 presidential nominees , religious leaders , or corporations ‚Ä¶ .
There is one little problem with this : most weathercasters are not really scientists .
When Wilson surveyed a broader pool of weathercasters in an earlier study , barely half of them had a college degree in meteorology or another atmospheric science .
Yes , in just 2 years , there has been a 10 point drop in the public ‚Äôs trust in weather reporters on this subject , but only a two point drop in the public ‚Äôs trust in Obama on this subject .
The CJR article is far more straightforward on dismissing the uninformed weatherman :
Coleman had spent half a century in the trenches of TV weathercasting ; he had once been an accredited meteorologist , and remained a virtuoso forecaster .
But his work was more a highly technical art than a science .
His degree , received fifty years earlier at the University of Illinois , was in journalism .
And then there was the fact that the research that Coleman was rejecting was n‚Äôt ‚Äú the science of meteorology ‚Äù at all ‚Äî it was the science of climatology , a field in which Coleman had spent no time whatsoever .
Duh .
But the NYT simply quotes Bastardi ‚Äôs disinformation , links to the inane video I debunked , gives the views of Coleman and Watts ( with a link to his anti-science blog ) , but never debunks their views or mention how utterly outlandish they are :
And yes , careful readers will notice that my headline is flawed .
You ca n‚Äôt keep calling it a ‚Äú journalistic lapse ‚Äù if the newspaper keeps doing it again and again .
At some point the individual pieces of data reporting simply become evidence of an overall anti-scientific approach to the subject :
Memo to rest of media : Asking a meteorologist to opine on the climate is like asking your family doctor what the chances are for an avian flu pandemic in the next few years or asking a mid-West sheriff the prospects for nuclear terrorism .
The answer might be interesting , but not one you should stake your family ‚Äôs life on , let alone the lives of billions of people .

Andrei is a young man with immense power at his fingertips .
He 's a reformed Russian hacker .
Back hunched , eyes fixed on the computer screen in front of him , he demonstrates what he can do .
" Look , here 's the log - in and the password , " he says , pulling up a Georgian government website .
" This site has already been hacked , I 'm just demonstrating the vulnerability .
But it 's easy if you know how . "
At just 20 years old , Andrei works for an information security firm .
He says he does nothing illegal now , but he used to .
" I started when I was 14 .
I hacked a series of military resources , the US army , some Russian departments .
I wanted to examine how well protected they were . "
Andrei sees nothing wrong with what he did , as he made no money from it .
Hacking for him is all about the technical challenge and the thrill .
" It 's like when you have a maths problem , " he says .
" You do n't know what tools to use , you know nothing .
But you want to master it , understand it , and then use that knowledge in the future . "
Technical skill Andrei is not alone in his passion .
Yevgeny Kaspersky describes Russia as a nation of " super hackers " and he should know .

Mr Kaspersky has made his name battling the world 's cyber criminals .
The computer security guru says hackers in China and Latin America generate the greatest number of cyber - attacks .
The most sophisticated come from his own country .
" Russian attacks look more professional .
The malware and design is more complicated and more technical , " Mr Kaspersky says .
" I think it 's thanks to Russia 's technical education .
Its graduates are probably the best . "
Four hours flight east of Moscow , the next generation of those graduates is in training .
In the snow - coated Siberian city of Tomsk , one in every five residents is a student .
Information security is what they excel in .
But in college corridors here , students talk of hacking with respect , even reverence .
" Hacking is an art , the art of breaking - in , " Alexei says .
" A true hacker strives to learn something new .
It 's the art of constantly achieving new heights of expertise . "
Tomsk University is one of many to offer computer security courses
The students do n't learn this art directly in class .
Alexei says his institute only " helps him in the right direction " .
But there are plenty of opportunities to hone your hacking skills on campus .
One , is when the Sibears do battle .
The cyber - warriors of Tomsk university consistently finish among the top three teams in international information protection contests .
They train each week , hunting for flaws in each others cyber defences .
" I 've found lots of flags !
It was a successful attack , " Zheniya whoops as he identifies a weak spot in his opponent 's system .
" Now I can get access to their database , " he grins and prepares to swoop .
Cash call For these Siberian students , hacking is a test of their knowledge and ingenuity .
As Zheniya explained , you can't defend a system unless you understand the principles of attack .
But there is another illegal market for their undoubted skills .
The team members say they 've never been tempted but back in Moscow , Andrei admits that when he started hacking , he was constantly approached and offered money to hire his services .
The Sibears regularly top international hacking contests First , friends and relatives wanted him to break into e-mail accounts , or destroy websites .
Then the demands became more serious .
" There were people who wanted me to infect a large number of users who were clients of a certain bank , so they could use their computers to transfer money , " Andrei remembers , but says he refused .
" That 's not ethical . "
For those who are lured by the promise of riches , Russia 's cyber police insist there 's no such thing as anonymity in the internet .
The department claims it has uncovered more than 7,000 cybercrimes in the past nine months .
Others fear that 's only scraping the surface in the fight against a crime that knows no international boundaries .
That 's why Mr Kaspersky is arguing for some form of government control of cyberspace .
" We depend on this network now , and we do n't control it , " he says , and suggests the introduction of internet passports for every user .
For him , security concerns are more important than preserving full freedom .
That would certainly have complicated life for Andrei once .
But he says he 's abandoned criminal hacking now , and makes a living out of internet security services instead .
" It 's still hacking , but because I get paid it gives me more pleasure .
It 's better than hacking illegally - and for nothing , " he says .
But he estimates there are at least a hundred serious Russian hackers still at work .
And now a whole new generation of cyber - specialists is working its way through the country 's colleges .
Soon , they too will be faced with a choice : whether to set their minds to creating sophisticated information protection systems , or join the ranks of Russia 's hackers for hire .

The python logging package provides a Filter class that can be used for filtering log records .
This is a simple way to ensure that a logger or handler will only output desired log messages .
Here ‚Äôs an example filter that only allows INFO messages to be logged :
import logging class InfoFilter ( logging .
Filter ) : def filter ( self , rec ) : return rec.levelno == logging .
INFO
Configuring Python Logging Filters
Filters can be added to a logger instance or a handler instance using the addFilter ( filt ) method .
For a logger , the best time to do this is probably right after calling getLogger , like so :
log = logging.getLogger( ) log.addFilter( InfoFilter ( ) )
What about adding a filter to a handler ?
If you ‚Äôre programmatically configuring handlers with addHandler ( hdlr ) , then you can do the same thing by calling add Filter ( filt ) on the handler instance .
But if you ‚Äôre using fileConfig to configure handlers and loggers , it ‚Äôs a little bit harder .
Unfortunately , the logging configuration format does not support adding filters .
And it ‚Äôs not always clear which logger the handler instances are attached to in the logger hierarchy .
So the simplest way to add a filter to a handler in this case is to subclass the handler :
class InfoHandler ( logging .StreamHandler ) : def __init__( self , *args , ** kwargs ) : StreamHandler.__init__(self , *args , ** kwargs ) self.addFilter( InfoFilter ( ) )
Then in your file config , make sure to set the class value for your custom handler to a complete code path for import :
[ handler_infohandler ] class=mypackage.mylogging.InfoHandler level=INFO
Now your handler will only handle the log records that pass your custom filter .
As long your handlers are n‚Äôt changing much , the above method is much more reusable than having to call add Filter ( filt ) everytime a new logger is instantiated .
Sounds reasonable
Today , my husband refuses to have sex with me , ever since I told him I wanted to try for a baby .
When I asked him why , he said it was because he likes lack of responsibility and money in the bank more than the thought of a screaming baby , no sleep and strong suicidal urges .

Rampant bribery partly explains the FDA ‚Äôs illogical drug approval process .
There are countless instances of where FDA officials have received bribes from lobbyists and pharmaceutical companies .
The late 1980s is known to have multiple cases of drug manufacturers submitting fraudulent records , where FDA employees received gratuities in exchange for preferential treatment .
In 1989 , a series of generic drug scandals posted the mark for the FDA ‚Äôs cozy relationship with the pharmaceutical industry .
Ironically , it was n‚Äôt the government that exposed the scandal , but the pharmaceutical company Mylan , who suspected corruption in the rapid approval of only certain manufacturers .
Despite so much corruption in the drug approval process , the FDA refuses to act .
Republican U.S. representative Joe Barton of Texas , member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , released a report describing the FDA ‚Äôs debarment ( or lack thereof ) process :
More than 15 years ago , Congress passed a law to let the FDA kick out companies and individuals from the drug industry convicted of crimes related to the FDA approval process ‚Ä¶
This staff report shows in great detail the record of weaknesses in FDA ‚Äôs ability and authority to carry out its duties and to protect its own integrity .
When it comes to excluding the worst of the worst ‚Äî convicted felons ‚Äî FDA ‚Äôs debarment process seems to be non-existent .
It is inexcusable that the FDA can‚Äôt quickly debar convicted felons .
The FDA ‚Äôs debarment list shows they have only used their debarment authority 9 times in over 15 years , during which from 2003 - 2005 alone , staff investigators found 40 convicted criminals .
Even isolated cases where debarments did occur , the FDA delayed proceedings , sometimes for years at a time .
Skewed , inconsistent rules allow the FDA to only debar generic manufacturers , while ignoring all corporations associated with brand - name drugs .
Furthermore , the FDA cannot debar employees of medical device companies who are convicted of crimes that involve the FDA regulatory process .
This is unbelievable .
How are we supposed to reduce corruption in the drug industry when the FDA , our ‚Äú provider ‚Äù and ‚Äú protector ‚Äù , overlooks ‚Äî and participates in ‚Äî bribery and political favoritism ?
This is not all to say a regulatory organization over the drug industry has no benefit , but the FDA has certainly harmed more than it has helped .
It may be true that if the FDA prevented a deadly drug from entering the market , lives would be saved ; however , statistics show that more terminal patients have died because they were denied access to unapproved medications .
It may sound cruel to say drug companies should be able to release drugs to the market without a screening process , but telling a terminally patient he cannot take a drug that might save his life or improve his quality of life is even worse .
Hypothetically , Pfizer releases a drug to the market that on release kills twenty patients .
Obviously this is horrible , but however ‚Äú evil ‚Äù you think pharmaceutical companies are , they will not continue to sell a drug that is killing its customers .
The drug would be recalled immediately .
And you do n‚Äôt have to look at it in a moral context : in continuing to sell a fatal drug , Pfizer would risk a horrible public image and millions of dollars in litigation .
Now , twenty dead patients in itself might justify an extensive drug approval process .
But if Pfizer ‚Äôs drug caused zero fatalities , and within the next decade saves tens of thousands of lives , is the FDA still the benevolent guardian we perceive it to be ?
This may sound extreme , and maybe implausible , but there is no denying , FDA regulation hinders medicinal development .
And with the drugs previously discussed , delaying or refusing lifesaving drugs , from an organization that is known for corruption , is an act of genocide .
The bureaucracy that surrounds the FDA is malignant , a cancer to American health care , as it disrupts medical progress and euthanizes the terminally ill .
The FDA denies and prolongs the approval of lifesaving medications ; it keeps new medical equipment , such as bone screws , joint replacements , and healing products , off the market ; and it uses its political authority to manipulate the industry , by arbitrarily picking winners and losers .
Most importantly , the FDA inhibits patients ‚Äô rights to freely choose treatments and restricts insurers and physicians from doing what they do best : progressing health and saving lives .
Hahahaha .
The teabagger network giveth more hilarity : a new Fox News poll shows that more Americans have a favorable view of the IRS ( 49 % ) than of the tea party movement ( 36 % ) .
It 's not just that people do n't know what the tea party movement is .
The net favorable rating ( favorable minus unfavorable ) of the IRS is +11 % ( 49%/38 % ) compared to +2 % for the tea party movement ( 36%/34 % ) .
Best of all , this poll comes one week from April 15 , the IRS 's worst day of the year and the teabaggers best day of the year .
Ask the same question six months from now , and you 'll probably get even worse news for the teapartiers .
A couple of other things worth noting in this poll :
Fox asked whether Americans felt the Democratic Party , the Republican Party , or the Tea Party movement more closely represented their values .
The results : 40 % said Democratic Party , compared to just 25 % and 19 % for the GOP and teabaggers , respectively .
And as Greg Sargent noted yesterday , the poll not only showed most Americans were n't offended by Biden 's BFD f- bomb , but 51 % said they'd be less likely to vote for a candidate if Sarah Palin campaigned on his or her behalf .
Only 25 % said they'd be more likely to vote for the Palin - backed candidate .
The two games that wo n't ever die come together through a little hackery .
Cloud Strife , the spiky haired hero of Square Enix RPG Final Fantasy VII , has been inserted into Nintendo 's Super Smash Bros .
Brawl , Buster Sword and all .
Cool idea , I guess , but the modders must have made sure Cloud had his Generic Materia equipped as it looks like Cloud is wearing a tight - fitting Janitor 's worksuit .
You can see him in action in the video above ?
Me ?
I 've got no opinion .
I 'll let a commenter from Game Videos do the work :
It 's just a slightly modified Ike , and it really does n't even look like Cloud .
Frankly , I do n't know why modders waste their time make such lame changes to the game .
If you 're going to go to all the effort to change the game , then actually do something good .
And , after being scolded by another commenter :
No crap I could n't do it .
That 's hardly the point .
The point is why bother wasting so much time on something that 's this lame or half assed .
There are plenty of things that I can do extremely well , but I do n't waste my time and talents doing stupid things .
I love that I work on the internet .

BANGKOK , Thailand ‚Äî
Oil slicked Jay Muay ‚Äôs wok , big as a satellite dish , spitting grease at a queue of hungry customers .
First came scallions and tofu , sprinkled from above .
Then eggs , beat into a canary - yellow goop .
The street stall chef ‚Äôs hands flew into double - time : with her left , she joggled the wok ; with her right , she flicked in a few fat - bodied shrimp .
Lastly , Jay Muay reached for her not - so - secret ingredient : processed sugar .
She poured from a jug ‚Äî one Mississippi , two Mississippi , three ‚Äî until her pad thai was sweeter than summer - camp Kool Aid .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs almost impossible to add too much sugar , ‚Äù said Waiwong Wittayakun , Jay Muay ‚Äôs husband and co-owner of their forever - busy pad thai stall in Bangkok ‚Äôs On Nut market .
‚Äú Thai people , we like it sweet .
Just look at that queue ! ‚Äù
Thai cuisine is globally lauded as sophisticated , spiritual and even nutritious .
What many
Thai food fans do n‚Äôt realize , however , is that there ‚Äôs often gratuitous amounts of cheap , processed sugar hiding behind the spice .
The country ‚Äôs sweetness addiction , experts say , is partly responsible for one of it ‚Äôs fastest growing diseases : diabetes .
Nearly one in 10
Thais now suffer from the disease , a rate even worse than America ‚Äôs one in 12 .
‚Äú Traditionally , our food is supposed to have a balance of sugar , ‚Äù said Napaporn Sowattanangoon , a diabetes specialist with Thailand ‚Äôs Mahidol University .
‚Äú You ‚Äôre supposed to taste sweetness balanced with spice , sourness and other flavors .
Now , cooks just go overboard with sugar .
It ‚Äôs like they do n‚Äôt even care about the dangers . ‚Äù
Like U.S. doctors ,
Thai physicians blame the diabetes epidemic on more - sedentary lifestyles and the rise of industrially produced junk food .
The nation ‚Äôs most prevalent store is 7 - 11 , which offers squid - flavored potato chips , starchy pork buns and sugar - loaded energy drinks around the clock .
Worse yet , Napaporn said , are Thai grade schools that serve processed meals .
‚Äú The kids turn into adults who are addicted to sweet food .
And they get fat because no one plays in the fields anymore . ‚Äù
Developing countries such as Thailand , India and China are seeing the most new diabetes cases globally , according to InterAsia , a research cooperative between U.S. , Chinese and Thai universities .
As newfound prosperity spares more Asians from physical labor , it ‚Äôs also driving them to more desk jobs and microwavable food .
Two - third of diabetics , according to InterAsia estimates , now live in the developing world .
And in Thailand , according to estimates , half of all diabetics are oblivious to their disease .
The disease translates from Thai as ‚Äú sweet urine disease ‚Äù and , in rural provinces , it ‚Äôs traditionally self - diagnosed when villagers notice ants gathering around their outdoor toilet .
‚Äú I suspected I was diabetic , as many black ants swarmed around my urine , ‚Äù said one Thai patient evaluated for a 2009 Mahidol University study of cultural influences on diabetes treatment .
‚Äú One time , I slightly dipped my finger in my own urine and tasted it .
It would be sweet if I had drank it . ‚Äù
Treatment in Thailand is further complicated by spiritual beliefs .
Some diabetic
Thais , Napaporn says , blame the illness on misdeeds from past lives , such as undernourishing livestock .
Other patients she ‚Äôs evaluated recite their Buddhist acceptance of illness and death , expressing little desire to change their love of sweet foods .
‚Äú Thai people , especially the elderly , have trouble accepting a disease that wo n‚Äôt let them eat all the foods they want , ‚Äù Napaporn said .
‚Äú By the time the doctor tries to help , it ‚Äôs too late .
They have wounds on their bodies that wo n‚Äôt even heal . ‚Äù
Thai doctors often ask diabetics to forgo starchy white rice , essential as oxygen in the minds of many Thais .
In lieu of unpleasant diet change , TV infomercials offer herbal quick cure - alls .
A recent commercial for Dr. Chula ‚Äôs ‚Äú Thai - Chinese - Lao Herbs ‚Äù features the testimonial of Sod Suchuen , an elderly Thai diabetic woman , who professes that ‚Äú after drinking two or three pots , my weight shot up from 44 to 49 kilos ! ‚Äù
Thailand ‚Äôs Ministry of Health , as part of its ‚Äú Paunchless Thais ‚Äù weight - loss campaign , has warned the public that Type - 2 diabetes can bring on blindness , infirmity and death .
Government doctors should use more Buddhist logic to help steer
Thais away from poor diets , Napaporn said .
She ‚Äôs currently studying how Buddhist principles of resisting gluttony play to diabetic
Thais , especially the elderly who say their religion has taught them to ‚Äú accept illness ‚Äù and eat as they please .
Physicians , she said , should inspire patients to imitate monks , who lower blood pressure by meditating and avoid eating large meals .
Diabetics might also consider staying far away from Bangkok ‚Äôs On Nut market around sundown .
That ‚Äôs when Jay Muay ‚Äôs wok is at its busiest and the smell of simmering scallions and caramelizing sugar attracts queues that choke the sidewalk .
‚Äú The sugar ?
We use a lot to make it come out really sweet , really sour , ‚Äù Waiwong said .
‚Äú It might look like a lot , but that ‚Äôs how much you have to add to keep them coming back . ‚Äù
( CNN ) -- Rumors were rampant when Christian music artist Jennifer Knapp walked away from a successful career seven years ago .
After selling about a million records and winning at Christian music 's prestigious Dove Awards in 1999 , the Grammy - nominated singer / songwriter simply vanished in 2003 -- leaving fans wondering where she had gone .
There were countless theories as to why Knapp checked out , including the possibility of illness .
But the one that raised the most ruckus among her die - hard fans was the one which proved to be true : Jennifer Knapp is gay .
This week Knapp burst back onto the music scene with news of a comeback and a coming out .
Her new album will be released in May , and she has revealed that she has been in a same - sex relationship for the past eight years .
The revelation rocked the Christian music scene , where Knapp was a darling of fans and critics before her self - imposed exile .
The intensely private singer said she 's not at all surprised by the shock waves .
" I'm aware that the evangelical community has problems with divorce and many other facets of their artists , let alone homosexuality , " Knapp said .
" I really felt a strong obligation to be able to address that because for many people , it was really clear that they would n't participate in buying a record because it was against their beliefs . "
" For many people who buy Christian music or have been familiar with me and my writings as a person of faith , I felt like it was the honest thing to do , " she added .
" The last thing I wanted to do was to have someone go out and buy a record and feel like they had been hoodwinked . "
Knapp is not the first artist to find fame in the genre before revealing their sexuality .
In 2008 , Christian singer / songwriter Ray Boltz came out as a gay man after a 20 - year career in the industry .
In 2009 , gospel star Tonex went public with his homosexuality as a guest on " The Lexi Show , " a popular program on the Christian channel The Word Network .
Lexi , who is also a gospel music artist , said that while many in the Christian music industry are aware of who is gay , " we do n't talk about it , because that 's the unspoken rule . "
Lexi said she doubts most fans will ever fully embrace an openly gay artist , but she points to other artists who have been able to straddle the line between secular music and songs of faith .
" I think some Christians will totally avoid [ Knapp ] and say that she is the devil and all that , but there are some that are more open who will embrace her new material , " Lexi said .
" Then she will find a new audience . "
Mark Moring , senior associate editor for Christianity Today , was one of the first to write about Knapp 's revelation and said it has been extremely polarizing among his publication 's audience .
People have vacillated between anger that Christianity Today would even write the story and praise for Knapp 's honesty , he said .
" There are people who will always love Jennifer Knapp , no matter what decisions she may make , " Moring said .
" I think the word that I 've read the most often [ among those commenting on the Christianity Today web site ] is ' sad ' as in ' I 'm sad that she has made this choice , but I still love her music . '
I think that has been a recurrent theme . "
Rev. DL Foster is the founder of the Gay Christian Movement Watch Web site and said he believes as society has become more accepting of homosexuality , Knapp and other artists are finding it easier to go public .
" For a person to try and combine [ being gay and being a Christian music artist ] is not biblically correct , and I would hope that the church would reject such music because it does not represent us , " he said .
" To me , it does n't matter if you are openly gay or closeted gay , sin is still sin . "
Knapp is very clear that she is not marketing herself as a Christian artist , a term with which she said she has never been comfortable .
She 's no longer on a Christian - based record label , and her new album of folksy rock songs is described as being about " inner - conflicts , spirituality and life lessons . "
Knapp quit the industry and moved to Australia , she said , because she was simply exhausted by all the performing and unprepared for the challenges being a music star brought her way .
She said she began writing music again in earnest two years ago and the music , as well as the decision to go public with her sexuality , all happened " organically . "
Knapp said she is no longer afraid of her gifts as a musician and now realizes that who she is as a private person can remain intact even as she shares herself with the world through her music .
" I was tired of not writing because I was afraid of what other people were going to think of me , " she said .
" So for me it was a really healing process . "
Knapp said she realizes that some fans will now view her earlier work with lyrics about inner turmoil as evidence of the struggle between her beliefs and her sexuality .
But she says she has always struggled as a person of faith to be the person she wants to be , and her sexuality was only a part of that , she said .
God has always known she would walk this path , Knapp said .
" I would rather be judged before God as being an honest human being , " she said .
" If I am in any way unpleasing in his sight , I can only hope and pray that he gives me the opportunity to find who I am supposed to be . "
Perhaps the most telling clue to where Jennifer Knapp finds herself in life after so many years is contained in the title of her new album .
It 's called " Letting Go . "
A Boulder woman returned to Colorado on Friday morning with the little Haitian boy she thought she might never see again .
Suzanne Schmidt , a third - grade teacher at Boulder Community School of Integrated Studies , was in the process of adopting 14 - month - old Gavin from an orphanage in Port - au - Prince , Haiti , when last week ‚Äôs devastating earthquake destroyed his home and left his future and that of 130 other children in doubt .
‚Äú This is absolute elation , ‚Äù she said after landing at Denver International Airport around 10:30 a.m. Friday .
‚Äú I feel like crying because I ‚Äôve been holding it in for so long . ‚Äù
Gavin was one of 53 orphans awaiting adoption who were evacuated Tuesday from the Bresma orphanage through the efforts of Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell , Rep. Jason Altmire and officials from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , which runs Children ‚Äôs Hospital .
The American women who ran the orphanage are from Pennsylvania .
Their building was severely damaged during the 7.0 - magnitude earthquake , which flattened much of the city , and they had nearly run out of food and water by the weekend .
Schmidt flew to Pittsburgh on Tuesday , where Gavin ‚Äôs release was facilitated by federal immigration authorities .
Holding a wide - eyed and uncertain little boy in an infant carrier , Schmidt was met by friends , family and more than a dozen of her current and former students at Denver ‚Äôs airport .

It started as a college student ‚Äôs snide response to an Iranian cleric ‚Äôs assertion that scantily clad women cause earthquakes .
But as of Thursday , it had become much , much bigger .
Jen McCreight , a self - described atheist , feminist and geek ‚Äú trapped in Indiana , ‚Äù took issue with Hojatoleslam Kazim Sadeghi ‚Äôs message during Friday prayers in Tehran , the Iranian capital .
The hard - line cleric , who was standing in for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei , said women who dress provocatively ‚Äì thereby tempting men ‚Äì are to blame for the world ‚Äôs temblors .
Read cleric story
‚Äú When promiscuity spreads , earthquakes increase , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú There is no way other than taking refuge in religion and adapting ourselves to Islamic behavior . ‚Äù
McCreight , who is pursuing a double major in genetics and evolution , took to her blog , Blag Hag , on Monday , demanding that the world ‚Äôs women band together in a scientific experiment to test the merits of Sadeghi ‚Äôs hypothesis .
‚Äú Time for a Boobquake , ‚Äù she wrote .
‚Äú On Monday , April 26 , I will wear the most cleavage - showing shirt I own .
... I encourage other female skeptics to join me and embrace the supposed supernatural power of their breasts .
Or short shorts , if that 's your preferred form of immodesty . ‚Äù
She continued , ‚Äú With the power of our scandalous bodies combined , we should surely produce an earthquake .
If not , I 'm sure [ Sadeghi ] can come up with a rational explanation for why the ground did n‚Äôt rumble . ‚Äù
Boobquake ‚Äôs
Twitter account quickly snared more tweets than a bird sanctuary , and its Facebook page had almost 50,000 ‚Äú confirmed guests ‚Äù as of Thursday afternoon .
‚Äú Nice to know that WOMEN are SO powerful that they can make men AND nature quake with a flash of her breasts !
LOL ! ‚Äù wrote one visitor to the Boobquake Facebook page .
McCreight ‚Äôs idea garnered so much attention , including criticism from people who feared she was making light of natural disasters , the Purdue University senior returned to her blog Wednesday to offer a ‚Äú quick clarification . ‚Äù
She acknowledged the widespread attention Boobquake had drawn and said a Canadian newspaper and an Irish radio station had requested interviews with her .
‚Äú Because I made a boob joke , ‚Äù she wrote .
‚Äú I just want to apologize if this comes off as demeaning toward women .
To be honest , it started as a silly joke that I hurriedly fired off since I was about to miss the beginning of ‚Äò House . ‚Äô
I never thought it would get the attention it did .
If I would have known , I would have spent more time being careful about my wording . ‚Äù
She did n‚Äôt back off , however , and said she was asking women to don immodest outfits on the same day ‚Äú for the sake of the experiment . ‚Äù
To allay concerns of unnamed scientists , she promised to collect statistics on the frequency and severity of earthquakes that day .
‚Äú And yes , I know I need a larger sample size to make this good science .
Maybe I 'll include Mardi Gras in my calculations , ‚Äù she wrote .
She said no woman should feel pressured to participate .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs not supposed to be serious activism that is going to revolutionize women ‚Äôs rights , but just a bit of fun juvenile humor , ‚Äù she wrote .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm a firm believer that when someone says something so stupid and hateful , serious discourse is n't going to accomplish anything - sometimes light - hearted mockery is worthwhile . ‚Äù
Back on Boobquake ‚Äôs Facebook page , McCreight took a moment to be serious and encouraged followers to consider donating money to the American Red Cross ‚Äô disaster relief efforts or to the AHA Foundation , an organization that strives to ‚Äú defend the rights of women in the West against militant Islam . ‚Äù
Up to 7,400 barrels of crude oil a day could be spewing into the depths of the Gulf of Mexico after Tuesday night 's explosion aboard the semi-submersible Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig caused it to capsize and sink Thursday morning .
After listing for most of Wednesday , the $ 600 million platform 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana sank in 5,000 feet of water at about 10 a.m. Thursday .
Seventeen people were injured , and 11 are still missing from the explosion .
The rest of the crew of 126 filed into lifeboats or jumped nearly 100 feet from the platform before being pulled from the water by Coast Guard rescue crews .
As the intense fire burned the spewing oil off on Wednesday , early indications were that the rig fire did n't present significant danger to the coastal ecosystem .
But with the rig now sunk and the fire out , concerns are now growing that the situation could mirror a deep - water spill caused by a fire on the West Atlas rig off Australia last year , which environmentalists likened to a " disaster movie . "

" This is already a serious accident , and if this crude is allowed to flow uncontrolled out of the well for days or weeks , the environmental impact could be really substantial , " says Robert Bryce , an energy expert at the Manhattan Institute and author of " Power Hungry :
The myths of ' green ' energy and the real fuels of the future . "
" They now have to figure out how to stop the blowout from the well .
There are a tremendous number of unknowns now . "
Coast Guard officials estimated that up to 13,000 gallons of crude an hour was coming out of the exploratory hole 41 miles offshore of Plaquemines Parish , La .
An early suggestion that damage would be minimal because the fire was consuming most of the fuel " does have the potential to change , " BP official David Rainey told the New York Times .
A BP spokesman told reporters that contractors using remote - controlled submarines ( ROVs ) are on the scene attempting to plug the well pipe via something they called a " hot- stabbing " operation .
Early efforts to plug the well were unsuccessful , BP reported .
The Coast Guard is also reporting that it is assembling environmental cleanup crews .
" We are looking at dispersant options , and we have planes and vessels on standby , should it be necessary , " Coast Guard spokeswoman Sue Kerver told the oil and gas industry newspaper Upstream .
The viscosity of the leaking crude could determine whether it floats to the top or becomes an underwater slick .
A two - mile surface slick has been spotted flowing from the site , but it is not yet clear whether that originated from on - board diesel fuel or well oil .
On Thursday , lawyers filed a federal negligence suit on behalf of the 11 missing crew members against BP and Transocean .
Transocean , an exploratory company based in Geneva , is leasing the rig to BP for $ 500,000 a day .
Both companies are on the forefront of deep water exploration .
The explosion , fire , and leak have put new focus on the Obama administration 's decision to open up more deep water zones in the Gulf for oil exploration .
Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D ) of Louisiana called for a swift and thorough investigation .
" It is critical that [ federal ] agencies examine what went wrong and the environmental impact this incident has created , " Sen .
Landrieu said in a statement .
" These findings should be reported to Congress as soon as possible . "
Added Rep. Jim Costa ( D ) of California : ‚Äú This incident is a grim reminder of the risks involved in developing public energy resources off America ‚Äôs shores . "
Even without the possible environmental damage , the Deepwater Horizon accident is likely to be the worst US offshore oil rig disaster since 21 crew members were killed in a blowout on a Gulf drilling barge in 1964 .

Seventeen people suspected of helping to smuggle children into Britain for crime have been arrested in Romania .
About 300 police officers , including 20 from the Metropolitan Police , carried out searches at homes in the south - east Romanian town of Tandarei .
Thirty people were questioned on suspicion of taking 168 Roma ( Gypsy ) children to Britain for " criminal activities " , Romanian police said .
Pistols , hunting rifles and money were seized , and 17 people were arrested .
A Met Police spokesman said : " The Romanian national police organised crime unit executed search warrants at 33 addresses in Tandarei , south east Romania .
" The operation is being supported by Metropolitan Police officers from Operation Golf - an investigation into child trafficking . "
The spokesman added : " We believe some of the children may be in the UK and they have been referred to local safeguarding youth boards and other relevant agencies . "
Officers continued to share intelligence with Romanian authorities , with 26 Met officers remaining in the country as part of the investigation , the spokesman added .
Britain based Peratech is endowing machines with a human - like sense of touch .
Their material , a quantum tunneling composite ( QTC ) , increases the electricity it conducts as it is put under pressure .
This allows QTC to effectively measure how hard you touch it .
Generally it is in the form of a rubber - like pliable layer .
The material has already been used in NASA ‚Äôs Robonaut , and with Shadow ‚Äôs robotic hand .
Peratech had a flood of press releases this year announcing its partnerships with Samsung for mobile phone interfaces , Nissha for mobile phone touchscreens , and the MIT Media Lab for new robot skin .
The company also recently received more than ¬£ 1.1 million in funding which it plans to help cover the costs of expanding into these new ventures .
Peratech is aggressively bringing QTC to market and may push the material into becoming an important new platform for human - machine interaction .
Giving electronics a sense of touch opens a wide field of options .
All you need is a simple circuit that can measure ( or use ) varying levels of electric resistance , and QTC can transform it into a very precise pressure sensor .
There ‚Äôs the straight forward applications like pressure sensitive keyboards , and touchscreens .
QTC could also be used to provide feed back from prosthetics or robot limbs .
Considering the importance of touch on the development of human infants , this material could help shape learning machine projects like iCub.
QTC has even been embedded inside fabric allowing for computerized clothing with controls that blend in .
Peratech is likely to pursue many different applications , but for now they seem focused on mobile phones and robots .
Samsung and Nissha are interested in QTC enabled controls that would provide cheaper and more resilient alternatives to thin - film transistors ( TFT ) .
The MIT Media Lab is seeking to have Peratech develop a robotic skin that will tell where and how hard a robot has been touched .
That skin will require QTC to interact with many small sensors embedded on the robot .
Looking through the Media Lab ‚Äôs current projects , there seem to be dozens that could use the new QTC robot skin .
Hugh Herr ‚Äôs powered prosthetic ankles and feet could start to provide some sort of haptic feedback if covered in the material .
MML also has a social interaction robot , the Huggable , which looks like a teddy bear .
QTC could help the bot understand the difference between a toddler giving it a loving squeeze and a child clutching it in terror .
While QTC may seem like it suddenly exploded onto the scene , the material has been around since 1996 .
Working with Durham University , Peratech has been developing QTC for a while , but it ‚Äôs this latest round of applications that I really find promising .
Conceptual uses are nice and all , but you can really start believing in a technology when you see millions poured into getting it into marketable products .
Hopefully Peratech will get QTC to transform the surfaces of our electronics into tactile interfaces .
This is just one of the many ways in which technology could allow our physical world to ‚Äú wake up ‚Äù by infusing it with digital sensing and information .
I ca n‚Äôt wait until my TV remote understands that I ‚Äôm squeezing it so tightly because I want it to work .
I ‚Äôd ruin fewer remotes that way .

A Method to Republican ' Madness ' Washington ‚Äôs conventional wisdom for explaining the intensity of Republican obstructionism toward President Barack Obama breaks down one of two ways : either it ‚Äôs a philosophical disagreement over the role of government or a desperate need to stay in line with a radicalized right - wing base .

But there is another way to view the GOP political strategy , as neither principled nor reactive to the rantings of Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh and the Tea Partiers .
It is that the Republicans are following a playbook that has evolved over more than four decades , to regain power by sabotaging Democratic presidents .
In this analysis , the Republicans believe they can reclaim the lucrative levers of national authority by making the country as ungovernable as possible while a Democrat is in the White House , essentially holding governance hostage until they are restored to power .
Then , the Democrats are expected to behave as a docile opposition ‚Äú for the good of the country ‚Äù ( and usually do ) .
The ‚Äú destroy Obama ‚Äù game plan tracks most closely with Newt Gingrich ‚Äôs strategy for undermining Bill Clinton 16 years ago .
But today ‚Äôs strategy also traces back to Richard Nixon ‚Äôs sabotage of President Lyndon B. Johnson ‚Äôs Vietnam peace talks in 1968 and Ronald Reagan ‚Äôs October Surprise gambit against President Jimmy Carter ‚Äôs Iran hostage negotiations in 1980 .
In all four cases ‚Äì covering the last four Democratic presidencies ‚Äì the Republicans did not behave as a loyal opposition but rather as a single - minded political enemy that viewed the White House as its birthright and Democratic control of the Executive Branch as illegitimate .
During the first years of Clinton ‚Äôs presidency , leading Republicans , such as Sen.
Bob Dole , actually denounced President Clinton as a ‚Äú pretender . ‚Äù
They noted that Clinton gained the White House with less than a majority of the popular vote ( because of the third - party run of Ross Perot ) .
Rather than accept Clinton as a legitimate president , the Republicans unleashed their newly minted right - wing media machine ( much of it having been assembled during the Reagan - Bush - 41 years with the help of conservative foundations and right - wing media moguls ) .
Magazines , such as The American Spectator , and newspapers , like the Washington Times and the Wall Street Journal , spread ugly rumors about the Clintons , while radio talk show hosts , such as Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy , filled the airwaves with hours and hours of Clinton - bashing .
In Congress , House Republican firebrand Gingrich whipped his party into line against Clinton ‚Äôs top legislative goals .
For the first time , every Republican voted against the federal budget , which included tax increases to rein in the deficit that had surged to unprecedented levels under Reagan and George H.W. Bush ( 41 ) .
Meanwhile , the escalating anti-Clinton media assault drew in the Washington Post and the New York Times , which were determined to prove they could be tougher on a Democrat than any Republican and thus to shed once and for all the ‚Äú liberal media ‚Äù label .
By 1994 , the Whitewater ‚Äú scandal ‚Äù about an obscure Clinton real - estate investment had become front - page news and a Republican - controlled judicial panel had picked former Reagan - Bush - 41 appointee Kenneth Starr to head up an aggressive investigation into the Clintons ‚Äô personal finances ‚Äì and later into their private life .
Back on Capitol Hill , Gingrich's ‚Äú revolutionaries ‚Äù rallied ‚Äì and railed ‚Äì against Hillary Clinton ‚Äôs ill - fated health - reform bill .
‚Äò Black Helicopters ‚Äô
Across the countryside , the harsh language in Congress and the ugly accusations from talk radio fed into a right - wing paranoia .
Armed militia groups began forming to resist the threat of ‚Äú one - world government ‚Äù and its ‚Äú black helicopters ‚Äù arriving from the United Nations to strip away American liberties .
Every day , Americans were confronted with a level of disorder in their political system that they had not seen in decades ‚Äì and President Clinton took most of the blame for the government disarray .
Having covered CIA destabilization campaigns in Third World countries , particularly Nicaragua , I was struck by the similarities .
In the 1980s , the Reagan - Bush - 41 administrations destroyed Nicaragua ‚Äôs leftist Sandinista revolution by systematically making the country ungovernable via a combination of economic dislocations , political / media propaganda , and paramilitary activities .
Finally , in 1990 , Nicaraguan voters ‚Äì faced with a choice of electing the U.S. - financed candidate Violeta Chamorro or suffering a continued U.S. economic embargo and a resumption of attacks by U.S. - supported contra rebels ‚Äì opted to accede to Washington ‚Äôs desires and voted for Chamorro .
By the second year of the Clinton administration , it seemed something similar was occurring in the United States , in part , because the Reagan - Bush - 41 administrations had left behind not only a capacity for ‚Äú information warfare ‚Äù in the Third World but a domestic version of that propaganda infrastructure .
Documentary evidence from Reagan ‚Äôs presidential library now shows that the overseas and domestic propaganda machines were built simultaneously as Reagan ‚Äôs CIA Director William Casey recruited conservative foundation executives like Richard Mellon Scaife to help finance these activities .
Casey also put a senior CIA propagandist , Walter Raymond Jr. , into Reagan ‚Äôs National Security Council to create an inter-agency propaganda bureaucracy and to oversee its operation .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ‚Äôs ‚Äú How Reagan ‚Äôs Propaganda Succeeded . ‚Äù ]
Another major accomplishment of the Reagan administration was the creation of the National Endowment for Democracy , which on the surface was intended to finance pro-U.S. political / media entities around the globe .
But NED had another side .
Since many of the NED - funded organizations were based in Washington ‚Äì and since the NED bureaucracy was dominated by neoconservatives ‚Äì NED , in effect , became a permanent funding mechanism for the neocon community in the U.S. capital .
Ironically , NED , which currently has a $ 100 million annual budget , may have done more to influence the course of the United States than any of the countries it has targeted for ‚Äú democratization . ‚Äù
NED funding explains why Washington ‚Äôs neocons have remained so influential despite their involvement in so many policy disasters , such as the Iraq War .
Even when the neocons find themselves adrift during brief periods out of power , many of them remain afloat with the help of NED grant money .
They can hang onto a financial life - preserver tossed from some institute that benefits from the federal funding .
That way , the neocons can continue writing op - eds and books , while weighing in on TV talk shows and at conferences that shape U.S. government policies .
These political / media mechanisms dating back to the Reagan years may have been originally designed to protect the political flanks of a Republican administration , but it turned out they could be put to use just as effectively for offense as for defense .
When Clinton managed to wrest the White House from the Republicans after 12 years of Reagan and Bush - 41 , the GOP realized that it could well shorten its time out of power by savaging the new President and creating chaos to undermine his political power and his popularity .
Clinton - Hating
In February 1994 , I attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington and was stunned to see the array of Clinton - hating paraphernalia , including slick videos suggesting that Bill Clinton was a murderer and semi-nude photo - shopped images of Hillary Clinton .
( Some of the anti-Clinton propaganda was being financed by the same right - wing foundations that had collaborated with Reagan and Casey . )
By early fall 1994 , the anti-Clinton hysteria was sweeping the country , though Democrats were mostly oblivious to its ferocity .
Shortly before the 1994 elections , I had dinner with a savvy Democratic operative at the Monocle restaurant on Capitol Hill and told him that it looked to me like the Democrats would lose both the House and the Senate .
He responded that I might be right about the Senate but that there was no way the House would fall to the Republicans .
A few days later , however , that was exactly what happened .
While the Democrats were slow on the uptake , the Republicans definitely ‚Äú got ‚Äù what was happening and why .
In celebration , the Gingrich ‚Äú revolutionaries ‚Äù made Rush Limbaugh an honorary member of the new Republican congressional majority , hailing him as their ‚Äú national precinct captain . ‚Äù
Though today ‚Äôs conventional wisdom holds that a big difference between 1994 and 2010 is that Gingrich had a positive message in his ‚Äú Contract for America , ‚Äù that analysis misses the point that it was the tearing down of the Clintons ‚Äì represented by Limbaugh ‚Äôs daily tirades ‚Äì and the impression of national disarray under Clinton that were key to the GOP victory in 1994 .
In the years that followed , the anti-Clinton hysteria would have other consequences .
On April 19 , 1995 , right - wing militia fanatic Timothy McVeigh detonated a bomb at the Oklahoma City federal building killing 168 people .
Limbaugh and others who had stoked the fires of paranoia would angrily deny any suggestion that they had contributed to the catastrophe .
Despite Clinton ‚Äôs reelection in 1996 , the Republicans did not give up their determination to destroy him .
In 1998 - 99 , they instituted impeachment proceedings that sought to oust him from office for lying about his extramarital sex life .
Though Clinton survived a Senate trial , he and his family were humiliated and Republicans were energized to restore the Reagan - Bush dynasty by putting George W. Bush into the White House , even if he did lose the popular vote to Al Gore .
The same two elements ‚Äì tearing down a Democratic president and creating a sense of political havoc ‚Äì are again at the center of Republican strategy , except that today the GOP is even better placed to carry out a repeat than the party was in 1994 .
Then , there was no Fox News dominating the cable TV ratings and the right - wing media was far less developed than it is today .
Though the Republicans ca n‚Äôt say that Obama was n‚Äôt legitimately elected ( he won with 53 percent of the vote and a record 66.8 million ballots ) , the Right has questioned his legitimacy in other ways , such as the spurious claims that he was born in Kenya despite his Hawaii birth certificate .
The Tea Party crowd also has decried him as some Islamic - terrorist - loving , America - hating communist , socialist or Nazi ‚Äì if not the anti-Christ .
A popular Tea Party poster shows Obama as a white - faced Joker , the sociopathic character from the latest Batman movie .
With funding from corporate and other right - wing interests , the Tea Partiers also have done their best to create political chaos .
Last summer , Tea Party activists disrupted ‚Äú town hall ‚Äù meetings on health care , and this spring , they forced Democratic members of Congress to run a gauntlet of insults and other abuse as they walked to the Capitol to vote on health - care reform ‚Äì scenes reminiscent of white racists shouting at black students at Little Rock Central High School in 1957 .
High - Level Encouragement
The organized chaos even entered the Congress itself , as Republican lawmakers cheered protesters on ‚Äì and at times acted like them .
Last year , Rep. Joe Wilson , R - South Carolina , shouted ‚Äú you lie ‚Äù at Obama during a presidential address .
During the health - care vote , Rep. Randy Neugebauer , R - Texas , yelled ‚Äú baby killer ‚Äù while Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Michigan , was speaking against a Republican motion to stop the bill by requiring revised anti-abortion language .
Republican leaders also engaged in apocalyptic rhetoric , with House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio declaring that passage of health - care reform would lead to ‚Äú Armageddon , ‚Äù a religious reference to the end - times battle between a warrior Jesus and the anti-Christ .
In the days after the health - care vote , the disruptions did spill over into violence , with bricks thrown through the windows of Democratic offices and death threats made against members of Congress .
Some militant Tea Partiers vowed to stage an armed rally near Washington .
Though Boehner and a few other Republican leaders finally criticized acts of violence , others continued to wink at the unruly behavior or shift the blame onto the Democrats for talking about it .
" It is reckless to use these incidents as media vehicles for political gain , " said House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia , criticizing Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D - Maryland , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , and Democratic National Chairman Tim Kaine for " dangerously fanning the flames by suggesting that these incidents be used as a political weapon . "
For her part , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin defended her advice that her backers should ‚Äú reload ‚Äù and her decision to put crosshairs on the districts of endangered Democrats , saying the references had nothing to do with violence .
She blamed the controversy on ‚Äú this BS coming from the lame - stream media , lately , about us inciting violence . ‚Äù
Amid these mixed messages , right - wing extremists now appear to be shifting from aggressive words and disruptive protests to going operational .
On Monday , FBI agents arrested nine alleged members of a Michigan - based Christian militia group , called Hutaree , charging them with a plot to kill a police officer , bomb the funeral and touch off an armed uprising against the U.S. government .
The Hutaree see themselves as at war with the anti-Christ .
Despite the growing specter of political violence , the Republicans appear set in their determination to foment as much disruption as possible between now and the November elections , and thus reap expected gains , with hopes that they can win back the House and Senate and then further neutralize Obama .
Inside - Outside
While some Washington pundits see the Republicans as captives of the extremism on the Right ‚Äì unable to dismount a dangerous tiger ‚Äì the counter - analysis would be that the GOP and the Tea Party / militia crowd are just two parts of the same political movement , one inside the system and the other outside , but both working toward the same goal , a restoration of Republican / Right control of government .
In their view , only then would political comity and governmental normalcy be restored , because the Democrats always seem eager to get along and do what ‚Äôs necessary to make government work .
To refer back to the Nicaragua comparison , the GOP ‚Äôs inside - outside game is like Nicaragua ‚Äôs pro-U.S. ‚Äú internal opposition ‚Äù operating as a non-violent political arm while the U.S. - funded paramilitary contras wreaked havoc in the countryside , both with the goal of removing the Sandinistas from power .
And as long as this ‚Äú make - the - political - system - scream ‚Äù strategy continues to work , it is probably unrealistic to expect the Republicans to disavow it .
Washington power and the money that comes with it are so intoxicating that the political risks appear well worth it , especially if Democrats and the American Left do n‚Äôt have the means or the courage to stand against abuses by Republicans and the Right .
That pattern of acquiescence by the Democrats and the Left dates back to the emergence of this Republican anything - goes strategy more than four decades ago .
As audiotapes at LBJ ‚Äôs presidential library make clear , Johnson was aware of Nixon ‚Äôs pre-election sabotaging of the Paris peace talks in 1968 , but remained silent to avoid risking damage to Nixon ‚Äôs presidential legitimacy .
Similarly , Jimmy Carter and other leading Democrats , such as former Rep. Lee Hamilton , were aware of substantial evidence that Ronald Reagan ‚Äôs campaign secretly undercut Carter ‚Äôs efforts to win the release of 52 American hostages held in Iran in 1980 , but the Democrats have chosen to look the other way .
Hamilton , who prides himself on his ‚Äú bipartisanship , ‚Äù led a congressional investigation into the Iran - hostage ‚Äú October Surprise ‚Äù mystery in 1992 , but refused to pursue late - developing evidence pointing to Republican guilt even after his chief counsel , Lawrence Barcella , asked for an extension because so much new information was pouring in by the end of 1992 .
Barcella told me later that Hamilton simply ordered the inquiry brought to a close with its finding of Republican innocence .
Much of the new evidence implicating the Republicans was then stored away , including a Russian intelligence report confirming secret meetings between Republicans and Iranians .
[ For details , see Robert Parry ‚Äôs Secrecy & Privilege ]
For his part , ex-President Carter appeared more concerned about the danger of being accused of sour grapes than learning anything new about how the Republicans sank his presidency .
In 1996 , while meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasir Arafat , Carter reportedly raised his hands into a physical stop position when Arafat tried to confess to his role in the Republican maneuvering to block Carter ‚Äôs Iran - hostage negotiations .
‚Äú There is something I want to tell you , ‚Äù Arafat said , addressing Carter at a meeting in Arafat ‚Äôs bunker in Gaza City .
‚Äú You should know that in 1980 the Republicans approached me with an arms deal [ for the PLO ] if I could arrange to keep the hostages in Iran until after the [ U.S. presidential ] election . ‚Äù
Arafat was apparently prepared to provide additional details and evidence , but Carter raised his hands , indicating that he did n‚Äôt want to hear anymore .
The Pattern Continues So , the Republicans have never been made to pay a political price for their scheming to undercut sitting Democratic presidents -- and to grease the GOP ‚Äôs route back to power .
Whenever a Democrat is in the White House , the Republicans believe they are free do whatever they want to block him from solving national problems , making him look weak and ineffectual .
That was true of Johnson , Carter , Clinton and now Obama .
This GOP strategy is pursued even if it tarnishes the international image of the United States or if it undermines national security , even if it means more than 20,000 additional U.S. soldiers dying in Vietnam , or 52 American hostages facing longer captivity in Iran , or the likes of Timothy McVeigh feeling empowered to blow up a federal building .
The strategy continues even if it raises the current threat level against President Obama and Democratic lawmakers .
The strategy continues because it works .

Mike Modano is 39 years old , due to be an unrestricted free agent , and has spent his entire career , spanning 20 seasons , with one franchise .
Evidently that 's the way he likes it .
Mike Heika dropped this little nugget on everyone last night after the loss at Buffalo : Modano had the chance to be traded , but turned it down .
Three teams were pursuing Mike Modano at the trade deadline , but Modano said he did not want to waive his no - trade clause and leave the only team he has been a part of .
``We talked about this a couple of months ago , and we agreed at the time that if there were teams interested , I would bring the information to Mike , '' Nieuwendyk said .
``I did that , and he decided he wanted to stay . ''
Modano said it would have felt strange to leave the team .
``Honestly , I just could n't do it , '' he said .
`` We were in pretty good shape in the playoff race , and there 's no guarantee with a new team .
I 've been with this team my whole life and I want to stay with this team . ''
Modano , 39 , will be an unrestricted free agent in the summer , but he said he still has not decided if this will be his last season .
`` That 's something for Joe and I to talk about in the summer , '' he said .
Say what you will about Mike Modano and his performance over the last several seasons .
He has had an ever changing role with an ever changing team that has needed him to be 4 or 5 different kinds of player , all of which are different than the guy he was 10 or even 20 years ago , and he 's done all of it with no complaint .
Now it turns out that all of that speculation coming out of Washington about Modano trade rumors was a little more correct than Stars fans would have believed at the time ;
In fact , there were as many as three teams interested .
We all said it together last month : " Joe would never trade Mike , " but it turns out he at least asked him about it , and Mike declined .
The one - franchise player is a dying breed across all of sports .
It would appear that Modano values the increasing rarity and significance of such a thing .
It should also be noted that he 's expressed a desire to stay with the team in one capacity or another , possibly even becoming a minority owner .
In a season that seems full of disappointment , does it comfort you at all that this franchise 's greatest player shows this loyalty to his team ?
Or will you turn a cynical eye on it , cracking a joke about his wife , etc ?
As for me , it makes me appreciate him all over again .
His last season or not , it might be appropriate to start appreciating Mike Modano a little more while there 's still time .
It was a surreal sight .
As victory was sealed , the bench erupted , joy and relief suddenly jostling for supremacy on those rows of hitherto tense , sweaty faces .
Every man was on his feet exulting , with one exception .
There was a moment when his knees flickered , impelled by long - honed instinct to hoist their owner in solidarity , but Yuvraj Singh 's head and heart were in no mood to be dictated to by mere force of habit .
He stayed put .
Punjab had just shrugged off their listlessness by beating Mumbai , delaying their victims ' qualification for the IPL semi-finals , yet Yuvraj was plainly a man apart , a man alone , his glazed eyes turned inward .
Had he forgotten he was playing a team game ?
The evidence seemed incontrovertible .
Here in Britain , on ITV4 , the studio pundits were having trouble suppressing their gall .
John Emburey , the epitome of the gnarled , old - fashioned pro , was seething : it was well out of order , simply was n't on .
Graeme Hick , who drew even more affection from his dressing - room confreres , was gentler , yet still made his feelings clear : you must enjoy your co-workers ' successes if you want to play a team sport , he reasoned .
After all , you wo n't always play a significant role yourself .
Not that Yuvraj is the only member of a prominent sporting team to have his community spirit questioned this month .
Two Saturdays ago , the footballer Kevin McDonald , who plays for Burnley in the English Premier League , stoutly resisted the conventional responses to being substituted .
At the time , Burnley were 0 - 5 down to Manchester City and being thoroughly shamed in front of their home crowd , albeit by opponents infinitely richer in resources ; McDonald 's embarrassment was personal as well as collective .
He was livid with his manager for taking him off .
So , instead of marching stoically from the field , or ripping off his shirt and flinging it over the touchline in a fit of understandable pique , he decided to leave the ground altogether .
And head for the pub .
( In mitigation , at least he chose one that was broadcasting the game . )
Two days later McDonald was fined a fortnight 's wages .
Repentance was fulsome .
" I now realise it was na√Øve , disrespectful and totally wrong of me .
It was a gross misjudgement and instead I should have remained ‚Ä¶ to support my club and team - mates .
I acknowledge that I also showed a serious lack of respect to all the fans who were at the ground and who pay good money to watch their team play ...
I would like to reassure all supporters that I am fully committed to helping the team as we fight to stay in the Premier League . "
As I write , two days after that Mumbai match , Yuvraj has yet to acknowledge anything , much less express contrition .
By the time these words are read he may well have followed McDonald 's example , though the signs are inauspicious .
With attention focused on the middle , perhaps he imagined that nobody saw his ( non ) reaction to the victory .
But while his misdemeanour may not have been apparent to the spectators , television viewers saw all .
And he was arguably even more culpable than McDonald .
At least every other member of that Burnley team felt as fed up as the latter did ( they ultimately lost 1 - 6 ) .
Yuvraj , though , seemed in no shape to share in anything .
Would he have behaved thus had he been representing a nation rather than a business concern ?
It is desperately difficult to believe he would .
IT DIDN'T HELP , OF COURSE , that , according to a story in the Times of India on April 2 , Yuvraj would have preferred to have been playing for another franchise , having been ditched as Punjab captain in favour of Kumar Sangakkara .
Purportedly refusing to play ball , Kings XI co-owner Ness Wadia , suspecting that Yuvraj might not lend quite all his might to the cause , was said to have urged the BCCI to have a quiet word .
If the board did so ( and they denied having received a complaint ) , the fruits have been undetectable to the point of invisibility .
Yuvraj , who has attributed his poor returns to the strain of returning from injury , vented his spleen via Twitter : " I am disgusted and horrified that a news reporter can stoop down to such a level .
I , in all my career , have n't seen such a disgusting piece of news . "
No player , he reckoned , more than a little risibly , " underperforms at will " .
Preity Zinta , Punjab's other co-owner , also expressed disgust and horror ; Gautam Gambhir , too , sprang to Yuvraj 's defence .
You would therefore have been forgiven , after all that , for expecting him to join those Kings XI celebrations , however confused or unhappy he may have felt .
As Alan Price sings in Lindsay Anderson 's magnificent career - defining movie O Lucky Man :
Smile while you 're making it
Laugh while you 're taking it
Even though you 're faking it
Nobody 's gonna know ‚Ä¶
" Fortunately , the impending World Twenty20 in the Caribbean offers him a swift opportunity to atone , to remind us , not what Brand Yuvraj can do , but what Cricketer Yuvraj can "
On the other hand , if Yuvraj truly cared about the bigger picture and the greater good , he certainly did an exemplary job of disguising it .
If the Times story is true , Wadia would have been better off cutting his losses and letting Yuvraj go .
After Mark Ramprakash was relieved of the Middlesex captaincy in 1999 , he grew increasingly disillusioned with the club and , the following year , resolved to leave .
Middlesex were equally determined to make him stay , and had the contract to do so .
Discussing the matter with Angus Fraser and Vinny Codrington , the county secretary , I implored them to be pragmatic : what was the point in trying to keep someone who did n't want to be there ?
The odds on the team benefiting , after all , were anything but promising .
Soon afterwards , Ramprakash was released from his obligations .
Given how little Yuvraj has done for him lately , Wadia would have been better advised to do likewise .
As it is , Yuvraj 's pitiful , almost pitiable form , culminating in last Friday 's non-jubilation , could so easily be interpreted as the hallmarks of a spoilt , sullen , stroppy teenager immersed in an interminable sulk .
It would be easier to sympathise if he had n't just signed to play the lead in an animated movie with the rather optimistic title of Captain India .
The plot , according to the publicity , finds Yuvraj growing up in Mumbai and discovering a magical multi-purpose " cricket stick " , one that not only enables him to help India win the World Cup but also to battle crime .
The film is co-produced by Cornerstone Sports and Entertainment Pvt Ltd , a management company whose clients include ‚Ä¶
Yuvraj .
" Cornerstone has always made best efforts to promote brand Yuvraj as uniquely as possible , " explained the press release helpfully .
" This project is one such opportunity for Yuvi to reach out to the millions of children across the countries who aspire to be like him one day . "
" Brand Yuvraj " ?
Maybe that 's the problem .
The cricketer has become the brand .
In any event , if Cornerstone can claim that their client is a role model for " millions of children across the countries " , one can only wonder what this says about their market research .
The sadness is the waste .
" Yuvi " has so much to give .
Already one of the planet 's most destructive 50 - over batsmen , those six sixes off one Stuart Broad over in the inaugural World Twenty20 three years ago elevated him to a rarefied plane .
Now he was up there with Sachin and Mahendra Singh , potentially the most glittering star of the next decade , one of those for whom surnames are superfluous .
Now that next decade has come and he has not really progressed ; has not , crucially , become a five - day champion .
Discerning judges , noting his impatience and impetuosity , will not be altogether surprised .
In December 2007 he made a fabulous career - best 169 against Pakistan in Bangalore , his first Test knock after those half - dozen fence - clearers , dwelling more than four hours at an international crease for the first time .
His 20 subsequent innings have seen a rapid return to modesty : no centuries , more single - figure scores than fifties ( six to five ) , 13 dismissals for under 30 and , all told , 583 runs at 32 .
Now younger men are being preferred .
He is clearly not where he believes he could be , should be .
Yet still the rewards flow , and still the celebrity grows .
Grappling with that little irony takes some doing .
Fortunately , the impending World Twenty20 in the Caribbean offers him a swift opportunity to atone , to remind us , not what Brand Yuvraj can do , but what Cricketer Yuvraj can .
The difference , on this occasion , is that he will be playing for his country , not an unloved franchise .
There will be no suspicion of divided loyalties , no team for whom he would allegedly rather be playing .
That 's why , for the foreseeable future , international cricket will remain the best brand in town .
Many diallers lurk on sites hawking pornography
As mobile phones get more sophisticated , hi-tech criminals are dusting off some old tricks .
Security companies have noticed a rise in trojans known as diallers that used to be popular during the days of dial - up net access .
On a smartphone the diallers are being used to call premium rate lines leaving victims with a big bill .
Experts say the diallers are proving popular as a quick way for criminals to cash in .
Diallers were widely used during the days of dial - up net access when most people connected via modem .
Many diallers lurked on porn sites and , once they snared a victim , disconnected their modem and then placed a long distance call .
Many victims were left with huge phone bills .
The economics of international calls meant that some of the cash spent on the call would be shared with the criminals .
Some diallers were very sneaky in that they muted the speaker on a modem so victims could not spot when the overseas call was being placed .
Now , the security wing of software firm CA has said it is seeing a rise in diallers for smartphones .
This time , instead of calling international numbers , the diallers call premium rate lines and land victims with the bill .
Writing on the CA security blog , Akhil Menon said it was seeing a " an increasing trend of trojan diallers " .
Mr Menon profiled one such virus , called Swapi.B , which sends premium SMS messages .
" The messages sent out are in the typical format to invoke premium services and land the mobile user with heavy mobile bills without the user 's knowledge and consent , " wrote Mr Menon .
Many diallers , including Swapi.B , are contracted from porn sites which disguise themselves as software , video clips or helper programs .
Mikko Hypponen , head of research at F - Secure which makes security software for mobiles , said it had seen a " handful " of diallers in recent months .
They were popular , he said , because they get round one of the big problems facing anyone wanting to make money out of Windows viruses .
" PC malware can't just directly steal money from your machine ; it has to jump through hoops like keylogging your credit card number or sending spam , " he said .
" However , mobile malware can just instantly steal from you by making premium - rate calls or messages , " said Mr Hypponen .
Some creators of diallers were also working to ensure that it was hard to shut down the premium rate service they had set up to cash in .
Mr Hypponen said some diallers sent messages or rang many different numbers , including legitimate ones .
" The trojan can place calls to , say , 100 different premium - rate numbers , only one of which is his own number , " said Mr Hypponen .
" How would you fight this ?
Shut down all the numbers , including the innocent ones ? "

Thai security forces have tried but failed to arrest several red-shirt anti-government protest leaders .
Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban had said the police were there to catch " terrorists " - the government 's word for an alleged protest hard core .
But one leader was filmed climbing down a cable while two others also escaped .
It remains unclear how the government intends to handle the protests - now in their fifth week ; protesters are demanding new elections .
" It is an unsuccessful operation , but we will continue further operations , " government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn told reporters .
" We have to wait for reports from the operation team . "
Earlier reports of several policemen " taken hostage " remained unconfirmed .
' Terrorists '
Mr Suthep , who is in charge of security , had earlier said the red - shirt leaders would be detained .
" The government 's special team is surrounding the SC Park hotel where we have learned that there are terrorists and some of their leaders hiding , " he said .
ANALYSIS By Rachel Harvey , BBC News , Bangkok
It is fair to say that the rhetoric we are hearing on both sides is hardening .
It seems as if there is very little room now for a negotiated settlement , though that is what the more moderate voices are calling for .
But even the government now is talking about " action against terrorists " and calling on those who it describes as innocent demonstrators to separate themselves from the " terrorists " so as not , in the government 's words , to be used as human shields .
One protest leader , Arisman Pongruanrong , scaled down the hotel facade into a waiting crowd of red - shirt supporters who then helped him into a car and drove away .
His escape and that of two others was described by observers as a major embarrassment to the government , which is already smarting from its inability to clear the protesters from the city last weekend .
That attempted crackdown left at least 23 people dead and more than 800 injured , many of them members of the security forces .
The government 's warnings appear to be intensifying however .
Speaking on national television , Mr Suthep urged " innocent " protesters to leave the anti-government rally site in Bangkok 's commercial district .
" Innocent people should leave the protests because the authorities have to take decisive measures against terrorists , " he said .
Downturn
The red-shirts had consolidated their protests camps into one in recent days , citing a fear of another crackdown .

Are cracks emerging in military ?
Bangkok violence : Thai voices
The district is home to major shopping centres , five - star hotels and office buildings , many of which have been closing early , or completely closed , over the past 10 days .
The stock exchange reopened on Friday after a three - day New Year holiday , only to drop 3 % .
It recorded its first falls in weeks of protests on Monday , after the weekend crackdown .
More protest sympathisers are reported by local media to be heading towards Bangkok from northern provinces .
The protesters are demanding that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve parliament and call new elections .
They have rejected the government 's latest offer to dissolve parliament in six months .
Mr Abhisit was reported to be planning to speak to the country on Friday but those plans were delayed .
He has rejected calls to step down - and has not made any public statement in several days .

A TASMANIAN man bashed and choked his girlfriend until she blacked out after he tried to leave the scene where she engaged him in a threesome .
The Supreme Court in Burnie heard the woman brought her female friend along on a camping trip last April and confessed to her partner , Phillip Hilton Bissett , that she was bisexual .
She plied Bissett , 44 , with alcohol to make him " more receptive " to the notion of a threesome .
The court heard the three engaged in some " mild intimacy " but , as the two women became more involved with each other , Bissett decided to leave .
He drove off but , drunk , crashed into bushes .
His partner ran after him and tried to take the car keys from him .
By this stage others in the camping area were looking on .
As the woman again grabbed at the keys , Bissett slapped her and pushed her to the ground .
She tried to run off , but Bissett punched her to the head , chest and back before choking her until she lost consciousness .
The victim suffered bruising and a sore neck but recovered .
Bissett spent the night and next day in police custody .
He pleaded guilty yesterday to two counts of assault .
Justice David Porter said the relationship continued and the pair had since become engaged .
" She has been reluctant to see the matter pursued , " Justice Porter said .
" I am told , and I accept , that there was no violence in this relationship , nor has there been since . "
The judge said domestic violence cases were normally considered a serious breach of trust in a relationship .
" I accept that you are remorseful and that there is little likelihood of repetition , " he said .
" It must be noted that the events were witnessed or heard by a number of children and young persons . "
Bissett received a three - month jail sentence , wholly suspended on condition he is of good behaviour for two years .

Chatroulette has become all the rage among folks in the online video and social media scene , prompting coverage in the NY Times , CNN and other major national news outlets .
Well if you ‚Äôve ever wanted to learn more about Chatroulette but were afraid to sign on yourself , a new mini documentary by New York - based filmmaker Casey Neistat has about all you ‚Äôll ever need to know about the experience .
To get a feel for who participates in Chatroulette , Neistat took a cross section of the site by clicking through 90 people and breaking them down into three categories : ‚Äú boys , ‚Äù ‚Äú girls ‚Äù and ‚Äú perverts . ‚Äù
( While the boy and girl categories are pretty self - explanatory , Neistat acknowledged that it was difficult to describe the pervert category without getting into graphic detail . )
In his relatively small sample , taken at 4 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon , he found the site to be about 71 percent male , 15 percent female and 14 percent pervert .
He also found that Chatroulette skewed young , with 83 percent young people and 17 percent old people on the site ( although Neistat did n‚Äôt explain how he differentiated between those two groups ) .
For a guy like me ( or like Neistat ) , the Chatroulette experience is n‚Äôt just about meeting random strangers on the Internet .
It ‚Äôs also about being blatantly rejected by those strangers when they choose to hit the ‚Äú Next ‚Äù button .
In a brilliant example of self - flagellation , Neistat decided to measure the average length of his interaction with those strangers before they ‚Äú Nexted ‚Äù him .
What he found was worse than you might expect ( but not totally out of line with my own Chatroullette experience ) :
Out of 20 random strangers , 19 of them clicked next , spending an average time of 2.9 seconds before making the decision .
So Neistat invited his friend Genevieve ‚Äî ‚Äú a really pretty girl , ‚Äù he says ‚Äî to chat in his place and see if she has any better luck .
The result ?
Nine out of 10 people talked to her , each for a minimum of 2 minutes , or until she nexted them .
Despite all this , Neistat sums things up nicely : ‚Äú There is something magical about Chatroulette .
If you can ignore all the masturbators ‚Ä¶ you ‚Äôre left with this something that transports you around the world into a stranger ‚Äôs life , and does it over and over and over again ‚Ä¶ I am glad that Chatroulette lives on my laptop .
I do n‚Äôt think I ‚Äôd like a world where you could just click someone away . ‚Äù

( CNN ) --
A passenger with diplomatic credentials of Qatar was detained Wednesday night after a disturbance aboard a United Airlines flight en route to Denver , Colorado , federal authorities said .
Initial reports were that the incident involved an attempt to set a shoe on fire , but there were later indications that the situation may have resulted from a misunderstanding involving smoking during the flight .
The passenger was in a lavatory and may have been smoking , a U.S. official said .
He also may have made an " unfortunate comment " referring to a shoe bomb when questioned on the plane , the official said .
Fran Townsend , a former homeland security official under President George W. Bush , said that the person involved was a Qatar diplomat and that her sources said the incident may in fact have been a misunderstanding .
She said law enforcement officials examined the man 's shoes and were satisfied there were no explosives .
The Boeing 757 carrying 157 passengers and six crew members took off from Reagan National Airport in Washington .
Two F - 16 fighters responded to the incident and intercepted the United jet , escorting it to the Denver airport .
The United flight landed safely at approximately 6:50 p.m. ( 8:50 p.m. ET ) .
Crew members asked law enforcement officials to meet the plane , said United spokesman Mike Trevino .
The FBI has responded to the incident .
Were you on the flight ?

" The situation is under control , " said one of the law enforcement officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Late last week , Eric Enge of Stone Temple ( and a co-author of mine on The Art of SEO ) published a fascinating interview with Google 's head of Webspam , Matt Cutts .
I think the whole of the SEO community can agree that Matt taking time for these types of interviews is phenomenal and I can only hope he does more of them in the future .
Understanding more about Google 's positions , their technology and their goals will benefit website creators and marketers dramatically .
The interview itself is certainly worth a read , but as one mozzer noted to me during the email string on the subject " I 'm embarassed to say I could n't make it all the way through . "
Fair enough ; and that 's why I 'm presenting Matt 's primary points in graphical , cartoon format .
I 've also included some adlibbing , interpretation and fun into these .
Only the bits surrounded by quotes were actually taken directly from Matt 's words , so please do keep in mind that this is my opinion of what Matt means ( along with the occassional editorial ) .
# 1 - There is No Hard Indexation Cap ; But Indexation Has Limits
# 2 - Duplicate Content Might Hurt Your Indexation
# 3 - Lots of Qualifiers on Whether Affiliate Links Count
# 4 - 301 Redirects Pass Some , But Not All of a Page 's Link Juice
# 5 - Low Quality , Non-Unique Pages Might Drop Your Indexation
# 6 - Faceted Navigation and PageRank Sculpting are Thorny Issues
Personally , I liked how much Eric pushed Matt with scenarios that would require some advanced methods of showing faceted navigation to users but not search engines .
However , I also understand that Matt needs to take a position that 's right for 95 % of site owners 95 % of the time or risk creating a new " PR sculpting " issue .
One other item that really stood out and got me excited was this response :
Matt Cutts : ( with regard to links in ads )
Our stance has not changed on that , and in fact we might put out a call for people to report more about link spam in the coming months .
We have some new tools and technology coming online with ways to tackle that .
We might put out a call for some feedback on different types of link spam sometime down the road .
That sounds really good - a huge frustration for the SEO world has been the fact that so many SEOs perceive their competitors to be outranking them with black / gray hat linking techniques and feel they must engage as well is order to stay competitive .
Shutting this down or making SEOs feel that Google is taking consistent action when obvious manipulation is reported would go a long way to quelling this thorny problem .
My last recommendation is that you check out Eric's 29 Tidbits from my Interview with Matt Cutts ; a post that summarizes a lot of the critical information and takeaways quite neatly .
To end , I thought I 'd add the four questions I wish Eric would have asked Matt ( maybe next time ! ) :
With Google 's new recognition of internal anchor links and listings of those URLs in the search results , is it still safe to link to internal anchors on pages and trust that the link juice will flow to the page as a whole , or are content blocks inside individual pages now being treated as unique entities ?
With the handling of nofollow changing and Google crawling / executing Javascript , what 's the best way to link to a document on the web so human visitors can access it but search engines cannot WITHOUT wasting link juice / PageRank ( robots.txt , for example , could n't do this ) or cloaking ?
Does Google now ( or will you in the future ) consider the sharing / linking activities happening on Twitter , Facebook , etc. to have any impact on the overall link graph of the web ( assuming we 're talking only about those links that do n't make their way onto standard web documents ) ?
When people ask the question , " why is my competitor ranking so well with low quality / manipulative links ? " you often reply that they should be careful in presuming that Google has n't already discounted the value of spammy links and the competitor is actually ranking on the basis of quality link sources .
This creates an environment where marketers are constantly trying to discern which links pass value and which do n't - could you give advice for relatively savvy , experienced SEOs to help them make those determinations so they can pursue the right links and stop paying spammers for the wrong ones ?
If you 've got thoughts to share , questions outstanding from the interview or my amateur drawings or things you wish Eric had asked Matt , feel free to post them below .
Over the last decade , more children with behavior and emotional troubles have received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
This is a condition in which moods swing dramatically between depression and mania .
Traditionally , bipolar was diagnosed only in adults .
A fierce debate has raged in recent years over diagnosing children with bipolar illness because the symptoms vary so much in children compared with adults , and because the medications used to treat the disorder carry some serious side effects .
The American Psychiatric Assn. has proposed changes to how the diagnosis is made in children for the next edition of its diagnosing guide , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , or DSM - 5 .
An expert panel has suggested two new diagnoses to account for the symptoms seen in children : " severe mood dysregulation " and " temper dysregulation disorder with dysphoria . "
There appears to be growing support for backing away from the child bipolar diagnosis .
In a paper published this week in the journal Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health , experts from the Hastings Center summarized findings from a series of workshops on the issue and concluded that it may be better to avoid giving a child a diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
The authors say the label simply does not fit many children who have been given it over the last decade .
Moreover , there is still too much debate and confusion over what the children 's symptoms represent .
For example , it 's unclear what mania really looks like in children compared with a much more precise concept of mania in adults .
" Using new labels such as SMD or TDD reflects that physicians do not yet know exactly what is wrong with these children or how to treat it , " Josephine Johnston , a co-author of the study , said in a news release .
" Facing up to this uncertainty could lead to better treatment recommendations and more accurate long - term prognosis . "
This is not to say that these children and their families do n't need help , the authors state .
The concept of treating troubled children and their families without pinning a firm label on the behavior is a good idea .
Unfortunately , health insurers often demand such labels in order to provide coverage for care .
I wonder if insurers will cover care for " severe mood dysregulation " in the same way they would for " child bipolar disorder . "

Joseph Beuys , How to Explain Paintings to a Dead Hare , Nov. 26 , 1965
The 1965 photograph of Joseph Beuys ( 1921 - 1986 ) cradling , almost mothering , a dead hare today seems iconic .
It ‚Äôs certainly more accessible and far - reaching than his drawings and installations .
What was he explaining to the dead hare in 1965 ?
The failure of the modernist revolution ?
The end of old German culture ?
Why does he always look like a hunter without a rifle ?
Or is this part of the performance art ?
The dead hare figures as a motif in numerous Dutch still - lifes , and the living hare is the subject for one of the greatest portraits achieved by Albrecht D√ºrer .
When we appropriate or employ nature in art , we create new creatures of design and appetite .
The hare of D√ºrer has the fine lines and detail of the artist ‚Äôs own self - portraits .
Strangely , Beuys ‚Äô performance with the dead hare creates a similar mirror effect , conveying the artist ‚Äôs charity and warmth through dialogue with it . . .
The pose , with Beuys ‚Äôs face covered in honey and gold leaf , conjures several associations , beginning with the classical pose of the Madonna and child ( Christ ) .
This religious association is not far off the mark , since Beuys was a spiritual man , influenced by the teachings of the anthroposophist , Rudolf Steiner , and throughout his career as an artist , Beuys was keen on the redemptive and regenerative aspects of creation .
In his autobiography , he identified with the Tatars of the Crimea who he claimed rescued him after he was shot down during the Second World War .
They kept him alive in furs and animal fat‚Äìhence his almost fetishistic interest in fat .
The mythic rescue evidently brought him closer to nature and metaphysical forces .
The dead hare is then emblematic of nature and also death , in which the ‚Äú shaman ‚Äù Beuys attempts to raise the animal back to life .
The hare figures throughout his oeuvre , but no image is more fascinating than the photograph of Beuys as he sits zombie - like , explaining art to a dead hare .
Yet this picture we have of him is outside the context of the original performance of the dialogue with the hare , and the still wider context of the international Fluxus movement emanating from the experimental music of the American composer John Cage .
To some , Beuys ‚Äôs antics were a vaudeville act , and his performances visual gags , not to be taken seriously ‚Äìakin to the fun of the Dadaists .
We would see on the Flux ‚Äú bill ‚Äù many such visual gags , and all of them testing and provocative .
However , there is something different going on with Beuys , and perhaps we should consider what exactly that might be .
The hare , apart from its symbolic value , is game .
It has been hunted and eaten for centuries .
Also consider : Joseph Beuys , like Andy Warhol , wore easily - identifiable clothes .
For Beuys , it was a hat that covered his war wound ( the ‚Äú wound badge ‚Äù he received from the Nazis ) , a fur coat that made him look like a Berlin pimp , or a hunter ‚Äôs jacket .
I like America and America likes me , 1974
Action piece .

He frequently draws on canidae ( carnivorous mammals ) , including the wolf and coyote .
His affinity and obsession with fur and animal fat is suggestive of the carnivore .
Here an identification with wolf - like animals , and a love of the holistic and the regenerative , have their parallels in Nazi culture , whose leader saw himself as a Wolf .
That dangerous line of thought should be qualified , however , since Beuys himself was against Nazism , and his art was heavily influenced by the so - called ‚Äú degenerate art , ‚Äù destroyed or censored in the cultural purges of the 1930‚Äôs .
Moreover , he first came to the public eye after being assaulted during a cultural performance that commemorated the anniversary of the failed assassination attempt of Hitler .
But like the novelist G√ºnter Grass , who had problems connected with his Nazi past , Beuys was plagued by doubts .
This is the very rub of the German artist living at this time .
German culture after 1945 had been effectively orphaned .
It lay in ruins .
The projects of Beuys served several functions , one was to bridge the period prior to 1933 , the well spring of German culture , and another was to create a new , regenerated culture from the subject matter of Germany ‚Äôs ruins , hence the vitrines and the lectures .
Schlitten mit Filter ( Sled with Filter ) , 1983
Vitrine .
Mixed Media . 205.7 x 219.7 x 49.5 cm. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum , New York .
We can see Beuys having a curatorial role in re-writing or re-inventing German culture .
There was a need for a new language after the War .
Beuys ‚Äôs performance art , or ‚Äú actions , ‚Äù were linguistic experiments .
There was also a sense of rebirth .
Part of this rebirth involved the appropriation of foreign cultures .
In the era of German Expressionism , the sources of exoticism were from other continents , and they coloured the lens that saw the landscape at home .
In the case of Beuys , his interest lay in cultures that enjoyed a contiguity with the Teutonic , for example , the Turkic - Slavic and Celtic .
There he could draw on imagery and mythology that was similar to the German culture .
Despite the assertions that Beuys and other German artists of his generation were poking fun at the academy , Beuys ‚Äôs artistic mentor was Wilhelm Lehmbruck ( 1881 - 1919 ) whose sculpture while not formally academic , subscribed to the same values .
Importantly , Lehmbruck ‚Äôs naturalist nudes were inspired by Gothicism .
Throughout his career , Beuys would draw the nude and had the figurative in mind .
One could argue that his approach to art was similar to the philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend ( 1924-1994 ) who raged against the scientific method , although he needed it to situate his own anarchic philosophy .
I argue that both were conservative in this respect .
Returning to the 1965 performance , if we compare it with the Expressionist and Dada schools and the early work of the American Jim Dine , we will realize that there are significant differences .
When the German artists of the WWI period performed or executed their installations , they had a specific target , namely the German middle class and military .
Much of the art , though provocative in a fun way , was political .
Satire in its traditional form asserts an alternative to the ideology or status quo that it attacks .
The shitification of art by Kurt Schwitters ( 1887 - 1948 ) is a case in point .
Jim Dine ‚Äôs installations , like those of the Flux movement , were an attack on consumer culture and the values of the American Dream .
Of course later , as Raymond Duchamp complained , these artists became avaricious themselves .
But in Jim Dine ‚Äôs performance art we see , aside from references to 1950 ‚Äôs B movies , a centre of humanity .
This does not seem to be the case in Beuys .
The object of satire is not transparent , the hare is the victim and Beuys is the hunter .
The hare recalls the leitmotif of High German art going back to Albrecht D√ºrer ‚Äôs hare .
We might , momentarily , see in the original photograph ( at the beginning of this essay ) a sense of tenderness and aspects of the comic .
After all , the artist has much in common with the silent movie star Buster Keaton .
The tell - tale clothes , the ‚Äú stone - face , ‚Äù the installations , the gags .
Yet Keaton ‚Äôs father forced him to perform from an early age , and even constructed his son ‚Äôs alter - ego .
Whatever there was of the real Keaton , not much was left in adulthood .
He had become the ‚Äú stone - face ‚Äù .
The identity Beuys created for himself similarly took over .
In the case of Beuys it was brought about not by an abusive father , but by the Second World War .
If Germany had won the war , he would have been a hero of sorts .
Instead , he became the hated enemy .
The physical and psychological trauma of his wounds , especially the wound to the head , must have exacted a dreadful toll .
He could not express or expect comfort .
Artists of the WWI period who sustained similar injuries , could vent their anger against the Third Reich .
Unfortunately , Beuys fought on behalf of the Nazis .
His performance as Joseph Beuys , like Andy Warhol ‚Äôs dark glasses and Buster Keaton ‚Äôs ‚Äú stone face , ‚Äù hid the real Joseph .
He had wanted to be a zoologist or work with animals before the war .
He had valued German culture and history .
Both of these strands of his development were reintegrated into his art to provide a conservative foundation .
Toward the end of his life , in an interview , he articulated his feelings about German art and culture .
His word choice revealed his deep affinity with the ‚Äú spirit ‚Äù of German culture‚Äìsuch language was typical of the Third Reich , though of course Beuys did not mean it in the same way Hitler did .
Nevertheless , German culture was seen by Beuys as a transcendental force .
When we look at photographs of Buster Keaton ( 1895 - 1966 ) , we see some notable differences .
Though Keaton ‚Äôs stone - face appears to lack empathy , he exudes a sensitivity to the presence of others .
He has a humanity .
His pathos invites the Other .
Buster Keaton in Go West ( 1925 ) .
In the above picture , Keaton is staring into the remote distance .
His body language and general posture , however , keenly acknowledge the presence of the cow .
He is standing with the cow , and their togetherness almost seems immutable .
Ironically , the cow ‚Äôs demeanor is more suggestive of a mood than Keaton ‚Äôs , whose face is characteristically deadpan .
This look was stylized and learnt through a brutal regime in vaudeville moves overseen by his father .
It was a costly look .
Beuys on the other hand is enigmatic .
What do the honey and gold leaf achieve ?
A de-facement ?
Are we to look at Beuys as the persona and not the person ?
Are we to take him as art ?
The hare is dead .
It does not respond .
Its cousin was used to perform magic tricks .
A rabbit once had its entrails pulled into a work of art .
There is no compassion here : we are looking at the hare from the wolf ‚Äôs point of view .
The twentieth century literary critic Paul de Man ( 1919 - 1983 ) spent years creating deconstructionist theory .
His principal stance was against the romantic notion of the self .
But in a sad twist of fate , he had hidden his real self in a drawer .
The revelations of his past as a journalist of anti-Semitic articles were used to de-construct his own life . . .
Could it be possible that Beuys , like de Man , was disguising himself ?
Was the construction of Joseph Beuys a disguise ?
Either way , Joseph Beuys has left us a great legacy to ponder .
I was born in London in 1956 .

PRP members protest against the Indonesia president , October 20 , 2009 .
Photo by PRP international department .
March 31 , 2010 -- Socialist Alliance national convenor Peter Boyle interviews Ignatius Mahendra Kusumawardhana , the international relations officer for the Working People 's Association ( Perhimpunian Rakyat Pekerja ‚Äì PRP ) of Indonesia , who was in Australia to speak at Socialist Alternative 's " Marxism 2010 " conference in Melbourne , April 2 - 5 , 2010 .
In 2003 , Mahendra was imprisoned for two years for ‚Äú insulting the government ‚Äù of President Megawati Sukarnoputri .
He was a member of the People 's Democratic Party ( PRD ) at the time of his arrest .
Over the last six months , the PRP has initiated a number of joint statements issued by left groups from various political traditions in the Asia - Pacific region .
* * *
Mahendra :
The PRP has the view that the main problem of politics and democracy in Indonesia is the absence of working - class politics .
Therefore this can only be solved by presenting a political party that has the political ideology and program of the working class .
Establishing a political party of the working class has been the objective of the PRP since the very beginning of our existence in 2004 .
Our last congress in 2009 set the timeline with a target of 2012 in order to set a clear goal for the current leadership in PRP .
Our operation as a political association of working people since 2004 was a step in introducing and popularising the political idea of forming a party among working - class activists .
For several years we have carried out open propaganda among working people in our grassroots bases about the necessity to build a working - class party as the only vehicle for struggle .
We received a lot of positive responses and enthusiasm from the grassroots bases , which are fed up with the stagnation of today 's politics and the fact that there is no party that they can rely on .
The next step after this propaganda is to broaden our consolidation efforts in order to recruit more people who agree to build the working - class party .
Do you see this future workers ' party as a broad , multi-tendency party or a party around a very defined ideological platform ?
A cadre party or a mass - membership party ?
A working - class party is one which can build and develop an ideological platform for the realisation of socialism .
A variety of tendencies is normal in such a party and in any real left partiy it should be democratically guaranteed such tendencies can exist .
This is especially so in the Indonesian context where the so - called different tendencies do not really mean much difference in practice .
What these tendencies really mean is that there is a deficit in the knowledge and ideology of the working class to cope with the dynamics of change in society .
Every left party which wants to fight against the strong hegemony of the bourgeoisie parties needs to be a mass - membership party .
With broad bases of members such a party can wage the war for hegemony in the many sectors of the oppressed and ensure the spread of socialist influences into their many fields of struggle .
Party cadres should make sure that the new party 's ideological platform is formulated and nurtured openly and with the participation of the masses .
If we are too closed and paranoid with this question we will lag behind the masses .
Where does left unity fit in this plan for a new party ?
We were the first left formation since the fall of Suharto to openly pushed for left unity .
We have always kept in communication with as many left groups in Indonesia as possible , even though most of them do n‚Äôt view left unity as important , and even try to avoid it with so many excuses .
We never gave up our belief that there should be left unity , especially in the struggle for a political party .
But what we have learned is that left groups cannot be reduced only to activists trying to create a party in their own image .
We must exercise sensitivity towards the actual radicalisation in the grassroots .
There are grassroots forces that are learning about the struggle and increasingly identify their political position with socialism and left politics .
There ‚Äôs a need to create as much as possible space for socialist propaganda .
If this can be done , people can fight any backwardness and also fight off the immaturity and irrationalities that may have contributed to earlier left splits , and have made differences in the left seem more intense than they should be .
Open conferences and discussions among left groups can both popularise socialism and at the same time build left unity .
What place do you see for broader anti-neoliberal / anti-imperialist alliances in Indonesian politics today ?
It is very important and we are currently by developing a strategic , broad and multi-sectoral alliance called FOR Indonesia ( Peoples Opposition Front of Indonesia -- Front Oposisi Rakyat Indonesia ) .
The platform of FOR Indonesia is anti-neoliberal / anti-imperialist , with the slogan : Change the regime , change the system .
That slogan itself is an attempt to make the campaign against the neoliberalism / neo- imperalism meet with popular sentiments .
The growing dissatisfaction against corruption and political scandals in the government is widespread among the common people .
People have started questioning the legitimacy of the regime of Indonesia 's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ( SBY ) , and they also do n‚Äôt trust most of the politicians .
The task of any broad anti-neoliberal alliance , such as FOR Indonesia , is to advance the people 's consciousness about the current regime and the capitalist system .
In this early phase of its existence , FOR Indonesia tries to educate people with campaigns for real opposition to social injustices .
FOR Indonesia tries to prove that there are no political parties at present that are really not entangled in the web of scandals and the oppression of the people .
By joining the current public issues , FOR Indonesia has the opportunity to bring together dispersed groups that fight the regime and the system and promote a popular understanding .
People cannot see the problem merely in individual political scandals but need to comprehend them as a consequential effect of a regime that rules the capitalistic system .
The PRP comes out of a rebirth of the Indonesian left after the massacre of the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) and other left organisations by the Suharto dictatorship after 1965 .
But this rebirth took place in the midst of a struggle against the Suharto dictatorship .
Has the Indonesian left faced the challenge of adjusting to post - dictatorship conditions ?
And if so , can you explain your view of this adjustment ?
Does the left need to change its approaches and methods of organisation ?
Every change requires adjustments , so this is not a unique challenge for the Indonesian left .
What is a more serious problem is that the left in Indonesia is acutely suffering from the problem of amateurism .
We continue to fail to exploit the open space of politics after the end of Suharto era .
Sure , there was oppression and coercion here and there against the left , but we failed terribly to respond to it with the capacity of professional revolutionaries .
So while there has been a relative freedom for left literature on the internet and in publications , the left has not optimally organised the power of the marginalised people .
It is a sad fact that after 10 years of Suharto ‚Äôs fall , there is still not one single credible left newspaper with a large audience .
This is a result of a failure to work together among left groups and see what is supposed to be the priority in practical political struggle .
The Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono government has been facing permanent protests since it was inaugurated for a second term last year ?
It is in crisis ?
Do many Indonesians still see it as the most democratic option in the context of the existing parliamentary parties ?
The SBY government is always in crisis because of the corruption of every aspect of political life .
Most Indonesians have no preference between the parliamentary parties .
The evidence of this is in so many electoral results with a high percentage of abstention .
But the crisis of the SBY government will only become a serious matter when extra-parliamentary people 's power struggle manages to accumulate greater strength from people ‚Äôs dissatisfaction through massive demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience .
Do you see electoral politics as an important arena of struggle for the left in Indonesia ?
What are the political challenges facing the left in this area ?
What position did the PRP take in the last general election ?
Did it campaign for a boycott ?
What is your assessment of the experience during the election ?
Electoral politics is important only if you fight against and compete seriously with the bourgeoisie electoral parties .
When the left is weak there ‚Äôs a big danger of demoralisation among your members and it will be harder to differentiate yourself from the opportunistic politicians .
Therefore a campaign for boycott was necessary to protect our members from potential disintegration .
But after the result and the dynamics of 2009 election , we do n‚Äôt think that another electoral abstention will help the left groups in Indonesia .
Now the progressives must try once again to build a broad and popular front that can give us the material base for its transformation into an electoral party .
With the time available before the next election , there is a great task ahead of every progressive movement in Indonesia for the consolidation ‚Äì an open and democratic one ‚Äì of an alternative political party that can be used for electoral purposes .
In the popular mass struggle in Indonesia today , what are the most important sectors and mass organisations , and what is the relationship of the PRP to these mass organisations ?
When we use the term ‚Äú working people ‚Äù we include three major elements : workers , peasants and fisherfolk .
We have put as many cadre as we can in progressive organisations , especially in those three sectors .
The industrial workers now are growing in militancy and class instinct to fight against the bosses and the state that backs them .
We have a strong and close relationship with the biggest alternative trade union Konfederasi Kasbi ( Confederation of Congress Alliance of Trade Unions of Indonesia ) , since most of the leaders in Kasbi are also founders of the PRP .
We have witnessing a massive desire for a working - class party from trade union activists in Kasbi and from other trade unionists as well .
Does the PRP identify with the anti-colonial heritage from the Sukarno era ?
Do you see Sukarno as an important national liberation leader like the Cuba 's revolutionaries see Jose Marti or the Venezuela 's revolutionaries see Simon Bolivar ?
We think in the present time it is relevant to learn and try to understand again the vital meaning of socialism as the driving idea and even the goal of the anti-colonial struggle in Indonesia .
The anti-colonial heritage has come from a lot of sources , not only Sukarno , so with all of our respect to his struggle , we have no plan to mystify the personal cult of him .
What is your opinion of the call for a new socialist international by Hugo Chavez ?
We believe that a significant socialist international as an institution with real political capacity to lead the working - class struggle globally is always a necessity .
In our present situation , maybe it is correct to look for directions and initiatives from Latin America where so many socialist experiments have been able to win the political battle domestically .
We understand very well the power and resources the call of this call by Chavez and so , in spirit and in principle , the PRP supports the call from Chavez .
However , for the realisation of a concrete unification in what might be the Fifth International there still needs to be a lot of preparation in our Asia - Pacific region .
What do you think are the challenges for the 21st century socialist movement ?
What are the important lessons our movement should learn from the experiences of 20th century ?
The most significant challenge is the need to build unity of the working - class struggle and at the same time able to present a significant challenge the hegemony and repression of the bourgeoisie .
People need more inspiration like that which we 've had from the experience of comrades in Latin America .
Working people need to develop the counter - hegemony that was once represented in strong and popular institutions such as communist parties in the past .
We should not romanticise past socialist experiences , but common people still need concrete signs that the socialist movement is the alternative of capitalism .
What we must learn from the past that the urgency to develop the culture of democracy is something that cannot be compromised .
The people of the former USSR and so many others have had to pay the consequences for the failure to develop continuously and dynamically socialist democracy as the competing force against the liberal democracy .
AUSTIN , Tex. ‚Äî
Even as a panel of educators laid out a vision Wednesday for national standards for public schools , the Texas school board was going in a different direction , holding hearings on changes to its social studies curriculum that would portray conservatives in a more positive light , emphasize the role of Christianity in American history and include Republican political philosophies in textbooks .
The hearings are the latest round in a long - running cultural battle on the 15 - member State Board of Education , a battle that could have profound consequences for the rest of the country , since Texas is one of the largest buyers of textbooks .
The board is expected to take a preliminary vote this week on a raft of changes to the state ‚Äôs social studies curriculum proposed by the seven conservative Republicans on the board .
A final vote will come in May .
Conservatives argue that the proposed curriculum , written by a panel of teachers , emphasizes the accomplishments of liberal politicians ‚Äî like the New Deal and the Great Society ‚Äî and gives less importance to efforts by conservatives like President Ronald Reagan to limit the size of government .
Shakespeare ‚Äôs immortal ‚Äú To be , or not to be ‚Äù takes on a whole new meaning ( and medium ) as classical stage and screen actors David Tennant and ( recently - knighted )
Sir Patrick Stewart reprise their roles for a modern - dress , film - for - television adaptation of the Royal Shakespeare Company ‚Äôs ( RSC ) 2008 stage production of Hamlet .
The production will be presented on PBS by the Great Performances series on Wednesday , April 28 , 2010 , at 8 p.m. EST ( check local listings ) .
Immediately following the broadcast , the film will be available online in its entirety here on the Great Performances Web site .
Hamlet aired in the UK on Boxing Day at Christmastime 2009 , and more than 900,000 viewers tuned in for the BBC broadcast .
In an article in The Observer , Britain ‚Äôs Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote : ‚Äú Like many people , I had my love of Shakespeare reawakened by David Tennant ‚Äôs TV portrayal of Hamlet over Christmas . ‚Äù
Best known for his performance in the title role of the popular British TV series Doctor Who since 2005 , Tennant made his debut in October as the host of MASTERPIECE CONTEMPORARY on PBS .
His many other credits include his recent portrayal of Barty Crouch Junior in the big - screen blockbuster Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire .
Tennant has also received numerous awards from the theatre community for his lead roles in several Shakespearean productions and other classic plays .
Veteran stage and screen actor Sir Patrick Stewart reprises his 2009 Laurence Olivier Award - winning role of Claudius in the screen version , which is directed by Gregory Doran , who also returns to reprise his stage direction of the production .
Co-produced by Illuminations Television and the RSC for the BBC , in association with Thirteen for WNET.ORG and NHK , the adaptation recreates the tone and atmosphere of the stage production in a film - style interpretation shot in HD on location at St. Joseph ‚Äôs College in Mill Hill , London .
The production is produced for television by John Wyver and Sebastian Grant .
Great Performances is funded by the Irene Diamond Fund , the National Endowment for the Arts , Vivian Milstein , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , public television viewers , and PBS .
Major support for the telecast is also provided by the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust .
For Great Performances , Bill O‚ÄôDonnell is series producer ; David Horn is executive producer .
The John Titor hoax is an old story largely known on the Internet : alleged ‚Äú time traveler ‚Äù posts crap on the ‚Äò Net , generates a lot of talk among us conspiracy theories lovers ;) and at some point ends up even discussed in kitschy Italian tv program ‚Äú Voyager ‚Äù , known for its cleverly staged and enormously enjoyable disinformation features .
I would like to add my 2 cents here and leave speculations to the readers .

Title : A time traveler ‚Äôs tale : the story of John Titor .
Description : 137 p .
Copyright Claimant : John Titor Foundation , Inc .
Date of Creation : 2001
Interesting that the work was created in 2001 , same year as the last Titor posts , though only obtained registration a couple years later .
So ‚Äì and that was mostly already known ‚Äì Haber is the Foundation , the Foundation owns the copyright on a book ( and thus everything John Titor - related ) and Haber happens to be in Celebration .
BUT , nobody seems to have noticed also that Larry Haber worked for the Disney company in the past .
His public Linked
In profile says :
Director , Business Affairs
Walt Disney World
( Public Company ; DIS ; Entertainment industry )
July 1995 ‚Äî August 1999 ( 4 years 2 months )
Responsible for Business Affairs for all WDW original television programming .
Now .
Walt Disney World is not everything Disney , but the guy has connections .
Could he possibly stage this John Titor thing ( together with a few friends and relatives ) to promote a future Disney feature ?
Might be a stupid question , but not entirely improbable .
Whoever ‚Äú John Titor ‚Äù is , all hints point to a clever case of astroturfing .

Blizzard revealed today thatwill be getting its own fancy pants Collector 's Edition .
They 've also revealed that the Standard Edition will be priced higher than usual .'s Standard Edition will be $ 60 , ten bucks more than standard PC releases .
If you recall , Activision priced the PC version ofsimilarly .
It 's a tactic that wo n't endear them to PC gamers but honestly , it 's not like they 're going to boycott this game over it .
PS3 and Xbox 360 owners have had to shell out $ 60 per game for years now so it was only a matter of time before that price bump spread to the PC market as well .
The Collector 's Edition , meanwhile , is $ 100 and comes with the following extras : is the first installment in a plannedtrilogy .
It comes with a single - player campaign for the Terran faction as well as the full multiplayer component .
The two later releases will add the Zerg and Protoss campaigns .
According to today 's announcement by Blizzard , the release date forwill be revealed in the " coming weeks . "
Box art for the Standard and Collector 's Editions can be found below .
James Altucher of Formula Capital is against going to college .
" Yeah , think about it .
I have two kids - what am I going to do when they 're 18 years old ?
Just hand them $ 200 K for them to go off and have fun for four years ? "
Althucher told TechTicker .
Yeah right !
Some more choice quotes :
" If took that $ 200,000 and put it in something that yields just 5 % a year , believe me , I will more than outperform the supposed spread of - you know , that will generate about $ 2.8 million over the course of 50 year career as opposed to the $ 800,000 more that a college - educated kid supposedly makes . "
" Instead take a fraction of that money - give your kid $ 10,000 or $ 20,000 and let your kid start a business ... 95 % of them will fail , but they 'll certainly get an education - a more valuable education than spending four years blowing off classes and going to parties drinking beer or whatever . "
" Teach your kid how to be motivated - how to sell a product , how to build a network of connections .
That 's going to be much more valuable than you wasting $ 200,000 dollars , flushing it down the toilet . "
Altucher has a point .
But he also went to college , so he does n't have the experience of trying to succeed in a world of college grads ( which he has - as a hedge fund manager and newspaper columnist ) without a degree .
And then he gives an argument that 's harder to swallow :
" Everyone who 's hiring you got a college degree , so it 's a way they perpetuate the scam , " he said .
Come again ?
" The cost of college in the past 30 years has gone up ten fold .
Health care has only gone up six fold .
Inflation has only gone up three fold .
Not only is it a scam - but the college presidents know it is a scam .
That 's why they keep raising tuition greater than inflation or health care costs , " he said " How do you think they get $ 30 , $ 40 billion dollars to invest ? "
Here 's what our own John Carney has to say about college : it 's probably just a huge waste of money right now .
A UW - Milwaukee student was arrested in class .

Det er ikke noe som skjer hver dag .
Jeg kj√∏rte med bilen i ettermiddag og merket at den var ganske nedst√∏vet , sier Tonje Johannessen til Dagbladet .
Hun og dattera opplevde nemlig √• f√• aske fra vulkanutbruddet p√• Island p√• bilen .
- Det var merkelig .
Da jeg kj√∏rte begynte jeg etterhvert √• studere hva det var , s√• gikk jeg ut og tok borti med fingrene .
Jeg merket at det var noe i det som ikke skulle v√¶re der .
Det glitret litt og var litt steinete , forteller hun .
Hun har aldri opplevd noe lignende f√∏r .
Men det har Frank Olsen , som ogs√• fikk vulkansk aske p√• bilen .
- Jeg s√• med en gang hva det var , for jeg har opplevd det en gang f√∏r da jeg ble stoppet p√• vei for se p√• vulkanen i Napoli p√• begynnelsen av 70 - tallet , sier Olsen til Dagbladet .
Han fortalte sin historie til NRK tidligere i dag .
- Det sn√∏dde noe s√• kolossalt i natt , og da jeg gikk ut i morges var hele bilen dekket av aske .
Den s√• ikke ut ! sier Olsen .

Welcome to the FreeBSD System Programming book .
Please note that this is a work in progress and feedback is appreciated !
please note a few things first :
We have written the book in a new format .
I have read many programming books that have covered many different areas .
Personally , I found it hard to follow code with no comments or switching back and forth between text explaining code and the code .
So in this book , after chapter 1 , I have split the code and text into separate pieces .
The source code for each chapter is online and fully downloaded able .
That way if you only want to check out the source code examples you can view them only .
And if you want to understand the concepts you can read the text or even have them side by side .
Please let us know your thoughts on this
The book was ordinally intended to be published in hard copy form .
However , this has changed and the book was converted using txt2html and some quick edits by hand .
Therefore you might find that the HTML formatting is not consistent or hard to follow .
We would like feedback on this .
Please let us know what style would be the easiest to read .
If you would like to participate please contact the authors .
You can view the work online or choose to download the chapter as txt .

The pavement ends 70 miles north of Fairbanks .
From there , it ‚Äôs 414 miles of gravel , ice and blowing snow to Deadhorse , where what ‚Äôs left of the North American continent lies down along the rough peaks of the Arctic ice pack .
It has been called the greatest road trip in the world .
John Taylor has driven it 2,990 times , give or take a few .
FOR THE RECORD :
Alaska ‚Äôs ‚Äò haul road ‚Äô :
An article in Thursday ‚Äôs Section A about the Dalton Highway in Alaska identified a truck driver who regularly drives the highway as John Thomas .
His name is John Taylor .
He ‚Äôs driven it at speed , with his big , 475 - horsepower Kenworth straining the limit .
He ‚Äôs driven it at 5 mph , when the snow was blowing so thick he had to crack open the door to see the edge of the road .
He ‚Äôs driven it sideways , sliding on a slippery stretch of Atigun Pass after encountering a snowplow .
‚Äú Up the road here , you ‚Äôll see where they ‚Äôve got these reflective posts every 50 , 75 feet .
Some of the blizzards , you ca n‚Äôt even find ‚Äò em , ‚Äù said Taylor , 64 , who ‚Äôs earned the distinction of having driven 3 million miles on Alaska ‚Äôs notorious Dalton Highway without an accident .
The highway -- better known as the ‚Äú haul road ‚Äù by those who make their living ferrying unwieldy cargoes of fuel , oil rig equipment , cars , groceries and heavy machinery up to the North Slope oil fields -- has linked Prudhoe Bay with points south since 1974 .
Like everything else in Alaska , it was built really big and really fast when somebody was in a hurry to make money .
All 414 miles were graded and sown with gravel in just 154 days , opening a gold rush trail to America ‚Äôs biggest oil field .
The 800 - mile - long Trans - Alaska Pipeline started construction at the same time , following the highway for the full 486 miles to Fairbanks , and then continuing south to Valdez .
For the first two decades , the haul road was the exclusive province of professional truckers , who gave its distinct stretches names like Beaver Slide and Avalanche Alley .
They coined the name Roller Coaster for the terrifying downhill grade at Mile 75 ( covered at the moment , like the rest of the highway , with a thick layer of ice topped with dry snow ) , that veers immediately into an equally unnerving climb .
‚Äú The first time I drove up here , I ‚Äôd never been up here before .
It was fall time and all foggy .
I got up to the edge of this thing and just stopped and looked down there , and wondered just where this thing went to , ‚Äù Taylor said .
Taylor does n‚Äôt fit the brawny model of the ‚Äú ice road trucker ‚Äù made famous on the History Channel television series .
He wears a neat gray work shirt and an old Adidas baseball cap .
He lives in a 32 - by - 40 - foot log cabin he built himself outside Fairbanks for his wife and five daughters .
His conversation , as the 14 - hour drive commences , inclines toward the ‚Äú yes ‚Äù and ‚Äú no ‚Äù at first , until the road itself starts dredging up tales , a different one for every couple of miles : the massive fire that snaked across the forest and shrouded the highway in smoke and ash ; the trigger - happy miner with a shotgun who closed down the road for two days ; the 100 mph gusts of snow that stranded him 24 miles outside Deadhorse for 18 hours .
He prayed that the snow would n‚Äôt choke the air intakes and leave him to freeze .
On this trip -- clear blue and 12 degrees leaving Fairbanks -- Taylor was carrying a relatively light load of two pickup trucks bound for ConocoPhillips ‚Äô
North Slope facility -- heavy enough to load the drive tires , light enough not to get all squirrelly going up the icy inclines .
At Mile 6 of the Elliott Highway , which feeds into the Dalton , he stopped to load up with $ 1,200 worth of diesel and a breakfast of fried eggs and potatoes at the Hilltop truck stop , the last fuel station anywhere on the road until Mile 175 , at Coldfoot .
Then , he settled into the tedious , up - and - down section of the highway that lies between the pavement ‚Äôs end at Livengood and the Yukon River .
The truck sidled into an easy cruise as an enormous Arctic hare loped down the edge of the road just ahead , and Taylor leaned on the horn .
‚Äú In the evening , you can see lynx along here , ‚Äù he said .
By summer , there will be eagles and moose , foxes and Dall sheep , wolverines and caribou , along with the occasional grizzly bear .
‚Äú Saw a moose in here one time , it was lying there .
The wolves had come in and bit the back of his leg and his hindquarters , and then they went back up in the hills and sat there , waiting for him to bleed out .
The wolves up in here are really big , ‚Äù he said .
Then there was the time he had to wait for a musk ox giving birth in the middle of the road .
‚Äú All of a sudden she starts charging toward the truck , spun around , and out comes a little calf -- she dropped him right there in the road .
I sat there for another 15 minutes .
The little guy would get up and try to walk , fall down , get up again .
As soon as he could walk pretty decently , they wandered back off the road . ‚Äù
The long hours of boredom in fine weather are spent listening to George Jones and ‚Äò 70s pop rock on his iPod , or cassette tape audio books of suspense - thriller authors like John Grisham .
Taylor has no interest in unnecessary innovations like compact discs ( whose inventors obviously never bumped their way up the haul road ) or cellphones ( which go silent past Mile 28 anyway . )
The truck rumbled on , over the wide , still expanse of the frozen Yukon River , and presently , the Roller Coaster loomed up ahead -- a grade Taylor said , that for all its notoriety , is n‚Äôt nearly as bad as the 12 % stretches farther up the road .
He switched on the ‚Äú Jake ‚Äù brake and fed in some retarder on the flywheel for extra braking -- letting the engine ‚Äôs compression and oil pressure slow the truck ‚Äôs progress down the slick slope .
He shifted into 6th overdrive for the throaty climb up the other side .
At Mile 115 came the Arctic Circle , where the short , spindly spruce trees finally begin to peter out and the landscape starts looking like Pluto .
The truck topped a steep slope , and on the other side of a wide plain , the Brooks Range rose in empty white splendor .
The road ahead is the reason his wife wo n‚Äôt make the journey with him .
Atigun Pass rises nearly 4,800 feet , the Continental Divide on the other side of which all rivers flow into the Arctic Ocean .
North of the pass is an equally teeth - clenching grade known as the Ice Cut , a steep , third - gear climb with drop - offs on both sides of the road and , for good measure , a sharp turn at the top .
Two weeks earlier , Taylor had come up the grade in the middle of the night , only to find another trucker stopped part way up with his brakes set .
The guy had n‚Äôt been able to make it up the snowy slope without spinning out .
He tried again while Taylor waited , and again .
No luck .
After the third failed attempt , Taylor pulled around him , dropped his own trailer off at the top of the hill and came back down again to drive the other guy ‚Äôs rig up .
‚Äú By then , the oil and bearings , everything ‚Äôs getting stiff [ with the cold ] .
I tried it , did n‚Äôt make it , so I backed up about a mile and just took off , to where I could get some speed coming up .
I got up there and it started spinning again , so I dropped to third gear and got real light on the throttle , and I ‚Äôm just chewing away and finally got up over the top . ‚Äù
‚Äú I ‚Äôd got up there at 1 a.m. , and finally got over at 4 . ‚Äù
The last stretch to Deadhorse is flat enough , but that , Taylor said , just gives the wind a good place to blow .
‚Äú One time we were coming out of Deadhorse on this stretch , there were like eight of us .
We got 24 miles out and it started to drift .
We had to pull over .
One of the guys , his wife was heading to go to the hospital the next day to have a baby , and he was just , ‚Äò Why do n‚Äôt we just chain up to each other ?
We gotta get out of here . ‚Äô
The other guys were just , ‚Äò Cool it , we ai n‚Äôt gonna get out of here . ‚Äô ‚Äù
They waited 18 hours before state transportation crews shoveled enough snow away to see the outlines of the road .
Just after 10:30 p.m. , he pulled into Deadhorse .
It ‚Äôs 32 below , and a parade of orange sodium - vapor lights cast a creepy glow on the snow and clouds of steam rising from the sprawling industrial site .
Taylor pulled into Carlile Transportation ‚Äôs yard and unhitched the trailer .
He parked the truck and prepared to crawl into the back of the cab for eight hours of sleep .
With two runs a week up to the Slope , he spends a lot of time sleeping in the back of that cab ; sometimes it feels more like home than his cabin , to tell the truth .
‚Äú When I dream , sometimes I dream about driving .
Kind of like I ‚Äôm driving into bad situations , where I ca n‚Äôt get out of .
Why , I do n‚Äôt know .
Like I ‚Äôm driving into a small town , small streets where you should n‚Äôt be , but you ca n‚Äôt get back out of there , because you ‚Äôre too long , and you ‚Äôre too big , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú And then I wake up , and I think , ‚Äò Why in the hell do n‚Äôt you dream about nice - looking ladies , or fishing ?
Why do you gotta dream about a stupid truck ? ‚Äô ‚Äù
Breakfast is in eight hours , all you can eat at the Prudhoe Bay Hotel .
Then the road back south .

WHEN Parliament decided , in 1709 , to create a law that would protect books from piracy , the London - based publishers and booksellers who had been pushing for such protection were overjoyed .
When Queen Anne gave her assent on April 10th the following year ‚Äî 300 years ago this week ‚Äî to ‚Äú An act for the encouragement of learning ‚Äù they were less enthused .
Parliament had given them rights , but it had set a time limit on them : 21 years for books already in print and 14 years for new ones , with an additional 14 years if the author was still alive when the first term ran out .
After that , the material would enter the public domain so that anyone could reproduce it .
The lawmakers intended thus to balance the incentive to create with the interest that society has in free access to knowledge and art .
The Statute of Anne thus helped nurture and channel the spate of inventiveness that Enlightenment society and its successors have since enjoyed .
Over the past 50 years , however , that balance has shifted .
Largely thanks to the entertainment industry 's lawyers and lobbyists , copyright 's scope and duration have vastly increased .
In America , copyright holders get 95 years ' protection as a result of an extension granted in 1998 , derided by critics as the ‚Äú Mickey Mouse Protection Act ‚Äù .
They are now calling for even greater protection , and there have been efforts to introduce similar terms in Europe .
Such arguments should be resisted : it is time to tip the balance back .
Annie get your gun
Lengthy protection , it is argued , increases the incentive to create .
Digital technology seems to strengthen the argument : by making copying easier , it seems to demand greater protection in return .
The idea of extending copyright also has a moral appeal .
Intellectual property can seem very like real property , especially when it is yours , and not some faceless corporation's .
As a result people feel that once they own it ‚Äî especially if they have made it ‚Äî they should go on owning it , much as they would a house that they could pass on to their descendants .
On this reading , protection should be perpetual .
Ratcheting up the time limit on a regular basis becomes a reasonable way of approximating that perpetuity .
The notion that lengthening copyright increases creativity is questionable , however .
Authors and artists do not generally consult the statute books before deciding whether or not to pick up pen or paintbrush .
And overlong copyrights often limit , rather than encourage , a work 's dissemination , impact and influence .
It can be difficult to locate copyright holders to obtain the rights to reuse old material .
As a result , much content ends up in legal limbo ( and in the case of old movies and sound recordings , is left to deteriorate ‚Äî copying them in order to preserve them may constitute an act of infringement ) .
The penalties even for inadvertent infringement are so punishing that creators routinely have to self - censor their work .
Nor does the advent of digital technology strengthen the case for extending the period of protection .
Copyright protection is needed partly to cover the costs of creating and distributing works in physical form .
Digital technology slashes such costs , and thus reduces the argument for protection .
The moral case , although easy to sympathise with , is a way of trying to have one 's cake and eat it .
Copyright was originally the grant of a temporary government - supported monopoly on copying a work , not a property right .
From 1710 onwards , it has involved a deal in which the creator or publisher gives up any natural and perpetual claim in order to have the state protect an artificial and limited one .
So it remains .
The question is how such a deal can be made equitably .
At the moment , the terms of trade favour publishers too much .
A return to the 28 - year copyrights of the Statute of Anne would be in many ways arbitrary , but not unreasonable .
If there is a case for longer terms , they should be on a renewal basis , so that content is not locked up automatically .
The value society places on creativity means that fair use needs to be expanded and inadvertent infringement should be minimally penalised .
None of this should get in the way of the enforcement of copyright , which remains a vital tool in the encouragement of learning .
But tools are not ends in themselves .
There seems to be no end to the scandals buffeting the Roman Catholic church about the abuse of children ; most recently in Germany , where the headmaster a school associated with a choir once run by the pope 's elder brother Georg Ratzinger has been exposed as an abuser .
And there is no doubt that a lot of children were damaged for life by priests , and that this was mostly covered up by the hierarchy until recently .
But was the Catholic church unfairly singled out ?
Are n't all children vulnerable to exploitation , especially when they are poor and unwanted ?
These questions lead into a thicket of horror .
The most detailed statistics on child abuse for the Catholic clergy that I can find come from the John Jay Institute 's report drawn up for the American Catholic bishops ' conference .
From this it emerges that the frequency of child abuse among Catholic priests is not remarkable but its pattern is .
Although there are no figures for the number of abusers in the wider population , there are figure for the number of victims .
These vary wildly : the most pessimistic survey finds that 27 % of American women and 16 % of men had " a history of childhood sexual abuse " ; while the the most optimistic had 12.8 % of women and 4.3 % of men .
Obviously a great deal depends here on the definition of abuse ; also on the definition of " childhood " .
In some of these surveys it runs up to 18 , which is a couple of years above the age of consent in Britain .
The Catholic figures show that between about 4 % of priests and deacons serving in the US between 1950 and 2002 had been accused of sexual abuse of someone under 18 .
In this country , the figure was a 10th of that : 0.4 % But whereas the victims in the general population are overwhelmingly female , the pattern among American Catholic priests was quite different .
Four out of five of their victims were male .
Most were adolescents : two out of five were 14 or over ; 15 % were under 10 .
This is vile , but whether it is more vile than the record of any other profession is not obvious .
The concentration on boys makes the Catholic pattern of abuse stand out ; what makes it so shocking is that parents trusted their children with priests .
They stood in for the parents .
But this is n't all that different from the pattern in the wider world , either , where the vast majority of abuse comes from within families .
The other point that makes the Catholic abuse is that it is nowadays very widely reported .
It may be the best reported crime in the world : that , too tends to skew perceptions .
There are , however , some fragments of figures from the outside world suggesting that not many professions do better .
Last year , it was reported that half of the girls fostered in social democratic Sweden in the 50s and 60s had been abused ; according to Camila Batmanghelidjh 550,000 children are reported to the social services in this country every year .
So why the concentration on Catholic priests and brothers ?
Perhaps I am unduly cynical , but I believe that all institutions attempt to cover up institutional wrongdoing although the Roman Catholic church has had a higher opinion of itself than most , and thus a greater tendency to lie about these things .
Because it is an extremely authoritarian institution at least within the hierarchy , it is also one where there were few checks and balances on the misbehaviour of the powerful .
The scandal has been loudest and most damaging in Ireland , because it came along just at the moment when the church was losing its power over society at large , and where it was no longer able to cover up what had happened , but still willing to try .
Much the same is true in the diocese of Boston which was bankrupted by the scandal .
It does n't seem to be true , though , that this was a problem spread by Irish priests around the world , as some traditionalists have argued .
Certainly , the geographical spread across the US was fairly even , and not concentrated in areas of high Irish settlement and tradition .
But in Ireland the state was happy to hand over the problem of unwanted children to the church .
Certainly the safeguards against paedophilia in the priesthood are now among the tightest in the world .
That wo n't stop a steady trickle of scandals ; but I think that objectively your child is less likely to be abused by a Catholic or Anglican priest in the west today than by the members of almost any other profession .

Japan is well ahead of the rest of the world in mobile phone technology : handsets that can pick up TV channels have been standard for years and in many shops payments can be made by swiping a phone over a sensor .
But the latest craze is ring tones said to be therapeutic .
Across Japan the arrival of spring is bringing out the cherry blossom but it is also making people reach for their handkerchiefs as , at this time of year , hay fever is rife .
A company called the Japan Ringing Tone Laboratory has developed what it claims is a cure .
For relief , sufferers need only wait for a call on their mobile phone .
The sound is supposed to dislodge pollen if the user holds the handset up to their nose .
' Unproven but popular '
Another of the so - called therapeutic ring tones is for those trying to lose weight .
The Japan Ringing Tone Laboratory is led by Matsumi Suzuki , an expert in voiceprint technology of the kind used to authenticate tapes of Osama Bin Laden .

He was behind a device for dog - owners called Bow - lingual which , it is claimed , can interpret the meaning of barking .
But now ring tones are his speciality .
There is a range specially tailored for the needs of people with different star signs , such as one for Taurus , the bull , complete with mooing .
Index , the mobile phone content provider which markets the therapeutic ring tones , admits the technology behind them is perhaps a little unproven but insists the number of downloads suggests they may be working .

Apple has something different up its sleeve : an advertising platform that will deliver personalized ads to the iPhone , iPod Touch and the soon - to - ship iPad , to be announced shortly after consumers first lay hands on the iPad on April 7 .
According to unnamed " executives familiar with the plan " who apparently told Online Media Daily about this , Apple expects this new ad platform to have as significant an impact on its business as its iTunes , iPod , iPhone and iPad launches , and Steve Jobs apparently referred to these mobile ads as the company 's " next big thing . "
The report referred to the new platform as " iAd , " although that may not be the actual name of the initiative .
Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on rumor or speculation .
So , why is Apple getting into advertising , assuming this report is accurate ?
Well , why not ?
Mobile devices , with their extensive knowledge of where you are and what you 're doing , hold great potential for advertisers , ever - eager to put their wares in front of a specific slice of the general population .
Do you suspect that women aged 18 to 30 who are sitting in hair salons on sunny Saturday afternoons would be particularly likely to appreciate your company 's moisturizer ?
Mobile ads are capable of targeting them in ways that print magazines were not , and can even slice demographics with more precision than websites , which generally do n't know that people are sitting in hair salons .
Apple paid approximately $ 300 million for mobile advertising firm Quattro Wireless about three months ago .
This reported April 7 announcement appears to be about re-purposing that technology into something general to serve ads across Apple 's growing line of mobile devices .
Quattro's design elements include videos , photo galleries , wallpaper , ringtones , deep links to products on websites , and the ability to share an ad with friends .
It reports back to advertisers with 15 metrics they can use to track their ads ' effectiveness , in order to tweak them on - the - fly and improve their targeting .
The firm says it can deliver ads based on gender , age , household income , location , time , ethnicity and education , which it says it gets from " non-personally - identifiable information , " the devices ' time and location awareness , and users ' answers to registration questions .
Apple currently bans app developers from including location - aware ads in apps that do not make other significant use of location .
So , it would be against the rules for , say , one of the perennially - popular flatulence simulator apps to deliver an advertisement based on a user 's location .
We assume that it will apply these same rules to its own Quattro - powered ad platform .
The upshot : App developers of all kinds will have a big incentive to include location - aware functionality in their apps , so they 'll be allowed to include more lucrative location - aware ads .
Advertising is changing music into a visual medium .
Next , it could make apps more location - aware , not only because users need to grant an app permission to use their location on an iPhone , but because iTunes ' app store rules dictate that location has to be a feature if it is to be used for ads .
Of course , this wo n't be just about Apple devices .
In the spirit of " anything you can do I can do better , " Google ‚Äì the search - monetizing behemoth that 's making inroads as a smartphone power ‚Äì acquired Quattro - competitor AdMob for $ 750 million in November , reportedly after Apple had expressed interest .
Like Android copied the iPhone , Google AdMob will likely deliver an experience on Google 's mobile platform that 's similar to Apple 's mobile ads , leading to a general rise in free ( ad - supported ) location - aware apps that do n't require payment , but deliver ads based on where you are and what you are doing .

When working with adults , the rule regarding confidentiality is simple : if there is reason to believe that a client is an imminent danger to himself or someone else , this must be reported to the proper authorities .
For minors , the authority in this case is usually the parents as opposed to the police or local hospital .
People under 18 are not granted the same confidentiality as adults apps on samsung handy .
Parents have a legal right to know what goes on behind the therapy door .
That being said , at the onset of therapy I ask parents to essentially waive that right , because if a child or adolescent cannot speak freely without fear than the therapy is not going to progress very far .
I always assure parents that if there is something truly important that they need to know , the information will be given to them :
‚Äú What if he says he hates me windows 8 herunterladen und installieren .
Will you tell me that ? ‚Äù
‚Äú No . ‚Äù
‚Äú But I just could n‚Äôt bear it if he hated me ! ‚Äù
‚Äú I think we can figure out a way for you to bear it .
I do n‚Äôt know if he hates you or not but if he does then maybe therapy will stop him from feeling that way about you . ‚Äù
‚Äú What if he ‚Äôs doing heroin ? ‚Äù
‚Äú I do not allow heroin in my office . ‚Äù
‚Äú No , I mean on the streets with ‚Ä¶with soccer hooligans audiodateien internet herunterladen .

‚Äú Yes I will tell you that .
But please understand that I will tell him all of the rules about confidentiality first because I do not want him to believe that he has been tricked into confessing something . ‚Äù
‚Äú What if he ‚Äôs sad ?
Will you tell me that ? ‚Äù
‚Äú You know he ‚Äôs sad , that ‚Äôs why you brought him here . ‚Äù
‚Äú But what if he ‚Äôs really , really really sad ? ‚Äù

At one point in my career I was working with an adolescent female who was 17 years and 10 months old office 2016 mac herunterladen .
This is an awkward age for therapy because the legal ramifications are still intact for another two months , so if her overly involved parents demanded to know the minutiae of the session I would have been required to give it .
An astute teenager ( such as this one ) would therefore simply wait until her 18th birthday to reveal anything important if she wants to keep her secrets pool billard kostenlosen deutsch .
Sure enough , at approximately 17 years , 11 months , 23 hours and 59 seconds of this young woman ‚Äôs life I got the Drunk Dial on my voicemail :
‚Äú Dr. Rob !

Air Force X - 37B spaceplane arrives in Florida for launch
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : February 25 , 2010
A secretive military spacecraft resembling a small space shuttle orbiter flew to Florida in the belly of a cargo plane this week to undergo final processing for launch on April 19 .

The Air Force confirmed the critical preflight milestone in a response to written questions on Thursday .
The 29 - foot - long , 15 - foot - wide Orbital Test Vehicle arrived in Cape Canaveral , Fla. , on Monday , according to the Air Force .
The OTV spaceplane was built at a Boeing Phantom Works facility in Southern California .
Managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities
Office , the OTV program is shrouded in secrecy , but military officials occasionally release information on the the spaceplane 's progress .
" It is now undergoing spacecraft processing including checkout , fueling , and encapsulating in the 5 - meter fairing of the Atlas 5 [ rocket ] , " an Air Force spokesperson said .
The 11,000 - pound vehicle will launch inside the nose cone of the Atlas 5 rocket .
Liftoff is currently set for 10 p.m. EDT on April 19 .
The reusable spacecraft is more famously known as the X - 37B .
The design is based on the orbital and re-entry demonstrator initially developed by NASA , then handed over to the Pentagon .
The NASA version of the X - 37 featured an equipment bay 7 feet long and 4 feet in diameter for experiments and deployable payloads .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency completed a series of approach and landing tests in 2007 using the White Knight airplane from Scaled Composites as a mothership .
It is easy to track the X - 37 's tumultuous history .
NASA awarded the first X - 37 contract to Boeing in July 1999 , and the agency flew a series of visible atmopsheric tests on a scale model of the spaceplane in 2001 .
The X - 37 began its transformation from a human spaceflight testbed to a military - run project when NASA shifted responsibility to DARPA in September 2004 , a consequence of the space agency 's new focus on lunar exploration .

But specific payloads for the Air Force 's OTV program are n't so clear .
Officials have denied interview requests on the project , and the military only releases information through written responses .
The X - 37B 's mission is to " demonstrate a reliable , reusable , unmanned space test platform for the United States Air Force , " the military fact sheet says .
" Objectives of the OTV program include space experimentation , risk reduction and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies . "
At the end of its mission , the X - 37B will fire its engine and drop from orbit , autonomously navigating through a fiery re-entry on the way to its 15,000 - foot - long primary runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base , Calif .
Edwards Air Force Base is the backup landing site .
The duration of the spaceplane 's first mission is n't being announced .
" The X - 37B has the requirement to be on - orbit up to 270 days , " the Air Force spokesperson said .
" Actual length for the first mission will depend on the meeting the mission objectives , which consists of checkout and performance characteristics of the spacecraft systems . "
When Sony launched its PSP
Go last year the company had high hopes .
The device was supposed to help PlayStation Portable shipments increase by almost a million units for the year and spearhead Sony 's digital download push into the portable gaming market .
But things have n't gone according to plan .
The PSP Go is both smaller and lighter than the original PSP and represents the first major refresh of the portable gaming platform since it was introduced in 2004 .
There are numerous cosmetic changes but the biggest difference is the absence of a slot for software discs .
The PSP
Go relies exclusively on Internet downloads for games and so it makes up an important part of Sony 's strategy to move audio , video and game content sales online .
Gamers have n't been impressed .
In the first week of March in Japan , the latest version of the original PSP sold 60,808 units , according to estimates from Media Create , while the PSP Go shifted just 1,275 units .
Total sales of the PSP
Go so far this year in Japan are 23,455 units versus average weekly sales of 70,342 units for the PSP , according to the data , which is derived from retailer sales systems .
" The hardware and software of PSP did n't sell as much as we expected , " said Nobuyuki Oneda , Sony 's chief financial officer , announcing the cut during Sony 's quarterly earnings news conference in February .
" That 's an issue and it's on our mind . "
Sony had hoped the PSP
Go would help it recover from poor sales earlier in 2009 and put its portable gaming business back on track but that did n't happen .
Instead of shipping 1 million more units during the fiscal year to March as it originally hoped , Sony has ended up slashing its sales forecast from 15 million units to 10 million units .
Oneda cited growing competition in the portable gaming market as one of the factors behind the worse - than - expected sales .
Cell phones such as the iPhone are providing tougher competition in the battle for casual gamers , and rival Nintendo launched its DSi XL in Japan right before the PSP
Go hit shelves .
But they were n't the only issues .
" There was a lot of confusion about the product in the first place , " said Hiroshi Kamide , an analyst with KBC Securities .
He cited a plan by Sony to allow owners of PSP software on discs a way to transfer it to the disc- less PSP Go .
The plan was withdrawn shortly before launch , leaving many would - be buyers unable to play already - purchased content on the new hardware .
" It also does n't look that great , it does n't have the wow form - factor , and it's more expensive , " said Kamide .
At US$ 245 the PSP
Go is a hefty premium over the $ 170 existing PSP , and is n't much cheaper than the PlayStation 3 console , which costs $ 299 .
" If I wanted the PSP Go to be successful , I would probably drop the price quite a bit , " said Kamide .
" The cost is n't much different from the PlayStation 3 .
That 's extortionate for a handheld , it needs to be half that price if anything . "
Sony is n't saying much on what it has planned for the PSP Go but Oneda dropped a couple of hints .
" The software and network contents need to be made more available so they 'll be key , " he said .
There was no word on a price cut but Sony does n't have to look far to see what that might do .
Sony resisted calls to cut the price of the PlayStation 3 for several years but last year introduced a new model with a lower price tag .
As a result sales of the console have been given a boost .

Sony PSPgo : What You Need to Know
Why Do The Press Hate Sony ?
Let 's face it , guys and gals .
The televisual landscape can be pretty bumpy and it seems as though as soon as you find yourself a series that you can tolerate the network yanks it because it 's getting crap ratings .
And why was the show getting crap ratings ?
Because TV viewers are hesitant to invest in anything new because it might wind up getting pre-maturely cancelled .
It 's a vicious circle .
A snake eating its own tail .
With everyone coming off of their respective Winter Olympic highs and ready to sink down into a somber , sulking depression over Jay Leno returning to the tarnished , bastardized Tonight Show this evening , we thought we 'd send some good vibes out your way and list off 5 shows that we think you all might like / love / get a kick out of .
Most of these are smaller - scale shows that would be lucky to pull off a million or two viewer so there is a bit of an agenda hidden in these recommendations .
We 're hoping to spread the word about these kickass series so that they 'll , you know , stick around for a couple more seasons .
So here are one pay - cable show , one network show and three cablers that we think everyone should be tuning in to on a weekly basis .
Breaking Bad
Breaking Bad is one of the most joyfully wretched shows on TV .
Let 's just say that watching cancer - stricken chemistry teacher , Walter White ( Emmy - Award winner Bryan Cranston ) brave the dark and perilous world of New Mexican underworld meth cooking is a " good pain . "
We 're all very happy that showrunner Vince Gilligan makes it a point to include gallows ' humor and macabre laughs every so often to break up the brilliant despair and palpable intrigue .
At the Winter TCA press tour , Cranston 's co-star Aaron Paul , who plays White 's hapless , yet sympathetic apprentice Jesse Pinkman , confided to us that the third season will get even darker than its predecessors .
And after watching the first two new episodes of this year , we can hardly wait for the freight train of tension and torment headed our way .
With an amazing supporting cast , haunted desert landscapes , merciless drug enforcers and a once - noble high - school teacher on the brink of being buried under his own secrets and lies , Breaking Bad offers some of the best and riveting TV that we 've ever seen .
Hell , it was so good that it won the IGN TV Best Series and Best Drama awards for 2009 .
Breaking Bad returns Sunday , March 21st at 10 PM / 9C on AMC .
You can catch up with Season 1 on DVD right now - and Season 2 on DVD and Blu-ray on March 16th .
Archer
" Because that 's how you get ants ! "
Step into the action - packed world of secret ISIS agent Sterling Archer , a self - absorbed prick of an international super - spy with a knack for pissing off everyone he meets .
Do you like your engaging espionage tales littered with subversive humor and profanity ?
Do you get a boner at the thought of your mother 's murder ?
Do you like to verbally eviscerate your elderly dogsbody , Woodhouse ?
Do you forget the name of most everyone in your office or accidentally set your co-workers on fire while testing out new gadgetry ?
Then Archer is the show for you .
For those of you who lapped up the surreal , bats *** humor of Sealab 2021 and Frisky Dingo , then you should know that Archer also comes to us from the wonderfully demented mind of Adam Reed .
Aisha Tyler Chris Parnell , Jessica Walter and Judy Greer round out the stellar supporting voice cast for H. Jon Benjamin 's sickeningly vain , Oedipally - stricken Super Agent .
There are only two more episodes of Archer this season , with the next episode coming up this Thursday , Mach 4th at 10 pm on FX .
But the good news is that Archer has been picked up for a second season .

" iPad hoopla " has passed , according to a survey by electronics shopping site Retrevo , and consumers have lost interest after the product 's unveiling less than two weeks ago .
More than twice as many respondents said they were uninterested after the iPad was announced compared to a week prior .
Of course , there are lies , damned lies , and statistics ‚Äî three times as many said they were confident they would buy one after finding out the product 's details .
Retrevo did similar surveys to gauge interest in Apple 's new portable touchscreen device both before it was announced and after .
The week prior to Apple 's big media event , 26 percent of those surveyed said they knew about the device but were n't interested .
After the announcement , that number jumped to 52 percent .
However , 3 percent said they would buy an iPad sight unseen .
The number that would buy an iPad after Steve Jobs showed it off went up to 9 percent .
Another 21 percent of those surveyed said they were still interested but wanted to know more about the iPad .
Chances are these folks would prefer to try one out before buying , or get the opinion of a trusted friend before making a decision .
Still , that represents a 30 percent interest among Retrevo 's site visitors .
That compares favorably with just 22 percent that knew about the device and were interested before the announcement .
Just 18 percent steadfastly claimed to still know nothing about that iPad and not care one way or the other .
Retrevo also noted that many consumers feel they do n't need an iPad .
Almost half of respondents said before the announcement that they did n't need one , and 61 percent said after the announcement that it was unneeded .
True , a touchscreen multimedia browsing device with a 9.7 " screen may not be for everyone , but almost double ‚Äî 5 percent ‚Äî say they definitely need one after seeing the details .
Another 19 percent are sitting on the fence , while an additional 15 percent need to know more to make up their minds .
A final survey question post - announcement queried consumers about whether they felt the $ 130 upgrade to 3G data was worth it .
59 percent said no , while just 12 percent said yes .
The rest were still undecided .
However , it 's worth noting that most people still are n't aware that the extra $ 130 also includes GPS hardware in addition to the 3G cellular radio , making it additionally useful for navigation .
It 's no surprise to us , however , that consumers overall are less interested in 3G , which comes with additional monthly data charges .
Unless you travel or are away from home often , it may not be worth the additional investment .
The upside is that data plans for the iPad do n't require a contract , so you have the option of only activating data service in months when it is needed most .
Still , there 's seven weeks yet before the WiFi - only version goes on sale , and another month to wait before the 3G models roll out and , frankly , it 's too soon to tell how popular the iPad will be with consumers .
Our feeling is that it will have wide appeal with a variety of users that might have a clunky , old computer ( or none at all ) , do n't use high - tech smartphones , and are interested in a small , simple device for casual computing needs .
A recent spate of sex abuse cases among USA Swimming coaches is drawing comparisons to Catholic Church sex scandals .
And both organizations are using the same excuse ‚Äî they do n't abuse kids any more than other people do .
Advertisement
The swimming scandal , as set forth by Megan Chuchmach and Avni Patel of ABC , is horrific both in its scope and in its details .
Thirty - six coaches have been banned from the USA Swimming organization , which controls amateur competitive swimming in the US and selects the Olympic team , for various forms of sexual misconduct .
One coach , who was sentenced last year , used a hidden camera to tape high school girls as they showered .
Another allegedly impregnated a 14 - year - old .
Most disturbing of all , some coaches were able to evade detection for years , moving from one gig to another with no punishment by law enforcement or USA Swimming .
One coach molested girls for thirty years , sometimes raising suspicion among parents and police , but was still given a clean background screening by the organization in 2008 .
But USA Swimming 's executive director Chuck Wielgus is n't very apologetic .
He says , " We want to have the gold standard and I think we do an awesome job .
I do n't think we 're perfect . "
This is exemplary of the gold standard ?
Really ?
Then he goes on to pass the buck to local swim clubs for checking out coaches .
And of sexual abuse in general , he says :
It 's not nearly as serious in USA Swimming as it might be in the rest of society .
I do n't want to be the one to sit here and say 36 is not too many , one is too many , but this is not just a problem that 's isolated to one sport .

The " but other people are molesting too " argument has been used in reference to Catholic Church sex scandals as well .
Newsweek 's Pat Wingert quotes Marie Fortune of the Faith Trust Institute , who says , " Plenty of other congregations have these problems , for instance , if they have a youth ministry . "
According to Wingert , this is actually true ‚Äî there 's no evidence that there 's more abuse in the Catholic Church than in other denominations , or even that priests abuse more often than other men .
And it is worth remembering this before we make generalizations about Catholics ‚Äî or swim coaches .
Wingert writes ,
Most child abusers have one thing in common , and it's not piety - it 's preexisting relationships with their victims .
That includes priests and ministers and rabbis , of course , but also family members , friends , neighbors , teachers , coaches , scout leaders , youth - group volunteers , and doctors .

Yeah , well , this does n't mean the organizations that deal with kids should get a free pass when their members commit abuse .
It means they need to be extra-vigilant .
Wielgus can claim all he wants that swimming is better than other sports with regard to child molestation , but his wisest statement is this one : " one is too many . "
And rather than throwing up their hands and lamenting how widespread child sexual abuse is , all those who work with kids , and who supervise others who work with kids , need to realize that they bear the responsibility for stopping it .

This came via e-mail from Marshall Auerback :
In her radio show , Dr. Laura Schlesinger ( a popular conservative radio talk show host in the USA ) said that homosexuality is an abomination according to the Bible Leviticus 18:22 , and cannot be condoned under any circumstance .
The following response is an open letter to Dr. Laura , and was attributed to a James M. Kauffman , Ed. D .
_______________________
Dear Dr. Laura :
Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God ‚Äôs Law .
I have learned a great deal from your show , and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can .
When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle , for example , I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination ‚Ä¶ end of
debate .
I do need some advice from you , however , regarding some other elements of God ‚Äôs Laws and how to follow them .
1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves , both male and female , provided they are purchased from neighbouring nations .
A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans , but not Canadians .
Can you clarify ?
Why ca n‚Äôt I own Canadians ?
2 . I would like to sell my daughter into slavery , as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7 .
In this day and age , what do you think would be a fair price for her ?
3 . I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual unseemliness ‚Äì Lev. 15 : 19 - 24 .
The problem is how do I tell ?
I have tried asking , but most women take offence .
4 . When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice , I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord ‚Äì Lev. 1:9 .
The problem is my neighbours .
They claim the odor is not pleasing to them .
Should I smite them ?
5 . I have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath .
Exodus 35:2 . clearly states he should be put to death .
Am I morally obligated to kill him myself , or should I ask the police to do it ?
6 . A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination ‚Äì Lev. 11:10 , it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality .
I do n‚Äôt agree .
Can you settle this ?
Are there ‚Äò degrees ‚Äô of abomination ?
7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight .
I have to admit that I wear reading glasses .
Does my vision have to be 20 / 20 , or is there some wiggle - room here ?
8 . Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed , including the hair around their temples , even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27 .
How should they die ?
9 . I know from Lev. 11:6 - 8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean , but may I still play football if I wear gloves ?
10 .
My uncle has a farm .
He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field , as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread ( cotton / polyester blend ) .
He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot .
Is it really
necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them ?
Lev. 24:10 - 16 .
Could n‚Äôt we just burn them to death at a private family affair , like we do with people who sleep with their in - laws ?
( Lev. 20:14 )
I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters , so I am confident you can help .
Thank you again for reminding us that God ‚Äôs word is eternal and unchanging .

Well , our Mad World discussion blog is in its third week now , and we just could n‚Äôt hold off any longer :
It ‚Äôs time to talk about Axe .
Sure , uncovering the sexism in Axe ad campaigns is somewhat akin to uncovering the yarn at a craft store , but how can we move forward in our gender and advertising symposium without Axe under our belts ?
Instead of debating whether or not these ads are offensive ( because , duh ) I thought we ‚Äôd take a look at an all - star lineup of some of the worst
Axe has had to offer recently , and then put it to a vote .
It ‚Äôs the Offensive Axe Campaign Showdown !
Five ads enter !
One ad leaves !
Which shitty
Axe campaign reigns supreme ?
Contestant # 1 : Manly Shower Gel Man
The message :
If you fail to use Axe Shower Gel , everyone will mistake you for a woman .
Which is the worst thing you could possibly be , because women are awful .
Also , it makes total sense to sexualize woodland creatures by having bikini - clad women scrub you down while wearing animal masks .
Obviously .
Contestant # 2 : The Ball Cleaner
The message : First of all , ball euphemisms are hilarious ( omg we ‚Äôre not just talking about golf balls you guyz ! ) .
Also , if you are a man , the only thing stopping women from grabbing your testicles is the scrubber you use in the shower .
If you ‚Äôre a woman , you pretty much just love balls .
( Is anyone else bummed to see Jaime Pressly in this ad ?
Bogus . )
Contestant # 3 : Smelly Fingers
The message :
You know how guys make other guys smell their fingers after they ‚Äôve had sex with a woman ?
( btw I am not saying all guys do this )
Well women can do that now , too !
We can all get in on this finger - sniffing action !
Women turn into totally disgusting horn dogs when Axe is in the mix !
Contestant # 4 : Dark Temptation
The message :
It ‚Äôs hard to ignore the underlying racism of this spot .
‚Äú Dark Temptation ‚Äù ?
The man ( once he turns from white to , um , chocolate ) is literally devoured by the women chasing him .
Somehow I doubt that when bell hooks wrote ‚Äú Eating the Other ‚Äù she meant it this literally .
Also , this is yet another ad where women are rendered uncontrollably sex-crazed by the scent of Axe .
Contestant # 5 : The Defendant
The message :
Here we see a different angle from our friends at Axe : Slut shaming .
This message goes above and beyond , and the woman here is accused of outrageous , and illegal , sex crimes .
It ‚Äôs OK though , because in Axe court things like ‚Äú assault with a ball gag ‚Äù are fun and sexy !
Closing arguments : OK , so all of these ads have something terrible to offer .
But before we vote on which is the worst , let ‚Äôs take a minute to think about Axe ( just a minute though , or we might all start barfing ) .
Why does
Axe advertise in this way ?
Why has it proven to be ( seemingly ) so successful ?
These ads go beyond sex jokes and deep into racist , misogynist , dangerous territory .
Could
Axe get the attention it does without being so offensive ?
What is about the messages here that registers for so many people ?
Now let ‚Äôs vote !

Angela was a foster parent for eight years and has four daughters .
She has taken many courses to help her better understand children .
There are so many wonderful reasons to do foster care .
To help children in need is probably the greatest of these .
Ever since our daughter moved in with us ( through the foster care system ) , everyone has given me their opinions and experiences with the foster care system .
I have heard everything from , we tried it , and it was not right for our family to I am going to be a foster parent once my children are grown .
Regardless , many people have misconceptions about the foster care system .
To become a foster parent , one needs to ask themselves some basic questions about their family and their expectations , such as are my ideas of foster care realistic .
At our first foster parent class , there were around 24 people in the room ; at the end of the four - week class , there were 12 of us .
Most left after the first day because the teachers were brutally honest about what was indeed involved .
We needed to hear it .
Foster Agency Team
Are You Okay With Working With A Team ?
The Parents :
One of the big misconceptions people have about foster parenting is that you become that child 's parent .
In all honesty , you wo n't have the same influence or rights as the child 's parent .
If you 're of a particular religious background , you may even think you will be able to save them spiritually .
Unfortunately , if the biological parent does not want their child to go to church , then you need to respect that .
Often these children have years of their own beliefs stored up and wo n't immediately warm up to yours just because you open the doors to them .
If they do warm up to your religious beliefs , it may be to please you , not some true conversion .
I point this out because to become a foster parent ; you need to realize that unless they lost parental rights , their biological parents have authority over decisions you make .
If they feel it is not in the best interest of the child , no matter how much you may disagree , you have to respect the child 's biological parent 's decision .
You have become part of the same team as her , no matter how resistant she is to you .
Foster Care Agency :
Not only will the biological parent be there , but you will be monitored at least once a month if not more by various social workers .
They will give you advice , but you also need to make sure that you are open and honest with them .
Many of these children not only have social workers , but they may also have psychologists , as well as a wide variety of therapists for areas they may be developmentally behind in .
Then let 's not forget the biological grandparents , sisters , brothers , uncles , aunts , etc. , which is on top of coaches , doctors , teachers , peers , etc .
And though you are with the child most , you are not the one calling the shots .
Also , you will need to bring these children to visit their parents , bring them to doctor visits , where parents might be there as well , along with a myriad of other times when you will cross paths with their biological parents .
In some rare circumstances , they will keep foster parents and parents separate .
They are just as scared to meet you as you are to meet them .
Make sure they see that you are a warm , caring person .
Unlike other children , though , these teams will invade your privacy .
You will be asked delving questions by the social worker that talks about stresses in your marriage , your past relationships , what you keep in your bathroom cupboard .
They will know everything about you through home studies and periodic visits to the home , plus remember the children may also share information about you .
One of the main areas that they will look into is how you deal with stress .
How Do You Cope with Stress and Anxiety
You need to be honest with yourself in this area , but also social workers .
It may help them place more wisely with you .
As I previously stated , foster parents are not the parents .
They are under scrutiny and are held to higher expectations than a birth parent will be .
If you have a hot temper and scream a lot , this may not be a concern for DHS as far as your biological children go , but this is not acceptable for a child in the foster home .
For one , these children are going to test every boundary .
They are looking for someone to love them and may react in unlovable ways to see if they can trust the love you are trying to give out .
They also have seen much more than most others have .
They also may be very good at manipulating .
Plus , these children are going through a hard time ; they need someone loving and patient to guide them .
They need someone they can talk to , and you , as a foster parent needs to be able to handle what they tell you .
Many times the reasons they are in foster care are ugly .
Some will need help in dealing with drug issues , abuse , neglect , loss , death .
You also need to ask yourself whether you are ready for certain cases .
You must be very honest with yourself .
Do not take a child into your home if you feel like you cannot deal with their circumstance .
The workers hear no a lot .
Do n't be afraid to turn away a child because you may be blessing them with a better - equipped home .
For instance , maybe you were drawn to foster care because you were abused as a child and want to help others who are going through similar situations .
That 's great !
But you may want to ask yourself and be honest , are you completely healed from that abuse .
If the answer is no , you may react in a way that may negatively impact the child 's healing process .
The last thing a child needs to see is someone breaking down to them telling their story .
They need to feel that it 's okay to share this story , and though they can share their story and be saddened by it , they have a stable adult that can handle it .
How Do Others Feel about You Becoming a Fostering Family ?
You are not the only one who needs to be able to handle these situations well .
Even those in your immediate family or friends who are not going to hear the child 's stories , and they SHOULDN'T , will have their opinions .
You need to make sure that those around you are going to be supportive of that child .
If you are surrounded by naysayers , do you think that 's healthy to bring a child into that ?
Although there is a point where you have to decide that it does n't matter what others think , the reaction and opinions of those around you will impact the child you bring in .
Many of these children have undergone tremendous loss and rejection .
If those around you are unsupportive or severely judgmental , or even racist , this only adds another rejection or loss that they will experience .
You will need to decide whether the relationship or doing foster care is more important .
If you have an excellent support group who will love you as well as any child in your home , this will help you and the children in so many ways .
I am fortunate enough to have this , and it has not only been a blessing for my adoptive daughter , but also for my husband and I as we hit new challenges .
How Much Do Foster Parents Get Paid ?
There is a false impression surrounding foster care that you can make money doing this .
Now , yes , foster parents do get paid , but a minimal amount in comparison to what a child needs .
Children are expensive .
For one , if it's an infant , think of the cost of diapers and formula .
Even as a child gets older , they need not only necessities but also experiences like a healthy child that will cost money .
I believe the average child gets less than 15 dollars a day that will go to the foster parent .
There is , in most states , a clothing allowance , but realistically if you receive 100 dollars twice a year as we did , how many clothes does that buy ?
By the time you buy a winter coat , snow pants , boots , and shoes , you have already spent that plus some .
Keep in mind also that what you buy is theirs .
When and if they leave , you 'll be packing those clothes , toys , books .
You are not able to use these same items as a hand - me - down for the next child as you might your own children .
Also , children grow .
My first year with my daughter , she started as a size 4 in three months ; she was a size 5 , three months later , a size 6 , and yes , you have to buy these clothes for them .
Plus , some of the children have moved a lot , and do n't come to you with many clothes or toys that most kids take for granted .
Two kids came into our home with only two outfits , which the state provided and one toy each , which is VERY typical .
In the more severe case of a child who lived in a Meth home , they will lose all their belongings due to the house being a health hazard .
Although most states will give extra money in these circumstances , it wo n't cover everything .
Plus , you have to be able to gently handle the added loss the child will feel , not only losing their parents , their home but all their things because they are not able to bring anything of theirs with them .
Other expenses include a bed , dresser , desk , toy bin , games , toys , school supplies , coats , clothes , movie tickets , plane tickets ( if you go on a trip ) , restaurant meals , etc .
Why Do You Want to Be a Foster Parent
You need to make sure that your expectations are realistic .
For instance , if you want to do it , so you have extra money , you certainly wo n't !
If you 're hoping to build your family this way , although this works , it is risky .
More than fifty percent of the children that come into foster care will go back home to their biological parents .
That is the goal of every child in the foster care system .
They do n't want to give you the child ; they want to rehabilitate their biological parent .
Even in cases that the social worker thinks the child will be placed up for adoption , even then , there are no guarantees .
Are you okay with handling your loss of a child ?
If you intend to change someone 's life , although that is very noble of you , you need to be realistic .
You can hope you can try , but the only person who can change someone 's life is the person themselves .
You can give them the tools and know - how to do it , but chances are you wo n't see the fruits of your labor .
Maybe something you said will stick with them , but once they go back home , it 's hard to know what sticks with them , and what does n't .
So if you are considering becoming foster parents , be real with yourself .
Is this right for you ?
Can you handle the stress , can you afford it , are you really in it for the right reasons .
Then if so , go for it .
It 's rewarding , although in ways you might not expect .

Questions & Answers
Question :
What three things should happen as a foster parent ?
Answer :
To love - love not just the kids , but the parents of the kids .
If you do n't feel you can do that , then at least respect them .
To forgive - forgive any wrongdoing that happened to cause the children to go into care .
That does not mean you trust them , but that you forgive them .
Accept - accept the children as your own .
Accept responsibility for all that foster care entails .
Accept the parents with all their faults .
Accept that you are not perfect either .
Question : I live in CA and my job wo n‚Äôt give me time off for the classes to foster , with intention to adopt .
Are they violating a law of some sort ?
Answer : Unfortunately , I am not a lawyer .
I do know that my husband took vacation time off .
Even when we were placed with children , we used vacation time .
When he could he would take classes at night or weekends .
Keep in mind that foster to adopt is a lot of hard work and you may want to consider whether you have the time available to put the effort in to do this .
The classes are by far the least invasive part of fostering .
You need to take them to their appointments ( counseling , doctor , etc , and they have more than most kids ) , visiting time with parents , and need extra time and energy due to being separated from their natural parents .
You may want to consider all of this before pursuing further .
In other words , if you are unwilling to use vacation time for just the classes , you may need to consider this is not the right route for you .
It 's a huge sacrifice and not an easy one .

Myla , honestly , the fact that that even crossed your mind , tells me that you are ready to do it .
It is hard , but if you feel it is right , then you will learn how to care for her .
Myla on April 04 , 2019 :
I am a foster parent for 8 - 18 year olds but now they have a sibling group that is separated .
A 10 year old and his 2 year old sister .
How do I know if I am ready to take care of a 2 year old .
I 'm nervous and feel like I may do something wrong like put beads in her hair not thinking that she is two and may try to swallow them .

The only way to know if you are eligible is to talk to your local Department of Human Services .
They can direct you to an agency that will be able to tell you the laws for your area .

greeneyedblondie on July 28 , 2015 :
Great post .
It was interesting reading it as someone who would like to get into foster care children someday .
JLClose from OreGONE on May 16 , 2015 :
Thank you .
This is all great , real information .
Much of it I have heard before , but it 's good to go into fostering being fully equipped and knowledgeable .
I have always wanted to foster because I have a huge heart for children and want to help those who are in need of love and care .
I want to wait until my own kids are a little older , but I love to read about other 's experiences and I welcome all and any advice .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on March 23 , 2014 :
Yes , we have had four children through the foster care system , and all went back to the parents .
It was the best .
sara on March 21 , 2014 :
I know 2 kids who were in the fostor care system for reasons but after two yrs the parents got them back
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on December 10 , 2012 :
I think that she should have the state rereview her case .
I 've not had anything like that happen , but if they see a pattern with the kids , and the younger one wants to call her mommy , then I think they may be able to see that they are fit for fostering .
My experiences have been very good , although I say no to a lot of cases , because I do n't think I 'm emotionally , physically , ready to take it on .
She needs to know when to say no , when they call her .
EM on December 09 , 2012 :
I need some advice from individual 's who have been in this situation .
My sister cannot have children , so she and her husband decided to try fostering .
It was bad .
Their first foster children were a brother and sister ( 6 and 8 ) who had been badly abused .
My sister and BIL had not been given any training .
The children 's counselor recommended to the state that they be separated ( being together made their issues worse ) , but the state refused .
The counselor also recommended that the young boy be put into a daily counseling program with an after - school component , and that my sister and her husband should be given special training , because he was so troubled and behaviorally out of control .
The state refused .
A few weeks later , the boy , now 7 , attacked my sister .
He did n't really do any damage , but they decided to call the caseworker again and insist that more intensive counseling be pursued .
The children had been with them for 4 months and they had discussed adopting the children if the boy 's behavior could be stabilized .
Within 48 hours the children were removed - taken from school by a caseworker - and a note was put in my sister and her husband 's file stating that they were unfit to be foster parents .
My understanding is that this same situation happened with the next foster family , but much more quickly ( 6 weeks ) .
Eventually , the children were sent back to a foster home with 13 children .
My sister was devastated and has been dealing with recurring bouts of depression since this happened five years ago .
She will not see a counselor .
I try to help her as much as possible and she has seemed better the last 6 months , until the holiday season started .
Yesterday , the young girl - now 13 - sent my sister a Facebook invite with a note that she wants to call and talk to her " mommy " .
My sister spent half the day crying and does n't know what to do .
I do n't know how to help her .
Help please !
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on May 02 , 2012 :
My heart is so saddened each time I hear those stories .
There are so many stories like that .
Feel free to share more of your stories , I think it 's beneficial to those considering foster parenting to know what they are getting themselves into .
holconrad from Schuylkill County , Pennsylvania on May 01 , 2012 :
Unfortunately many of the children in the system are suffering from some sort of attachment problems .
My middle sons therapist told me that the fact that his birth mother was inconsistent and constantly came into and then left him actually made his attachment problems worse .
My younger sons parents beat him and he " learned " that it hurt to be loved .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on April 23 , 2012 :
I admire your stregnth .
I do n't think I could handle a child with RAD
holconrad from Schuylkill County , Pennsylvania on April 22 , 2012 :
Great article , I have adopted two sons from the foster system .
One is ODD , RAD , the other is ODD , ADHD , RAD , and Aspergers .
They have given me a great deal of both challenges and rewards .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on March 29 , 2012 :
Mohammed thanks for your input .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on March 29 , 2012 :
They like to keep children in contact with healthy relationships they had previous .
Dont beat up yourself with what you choose , most people are not equipped to care fora child with rad .
The only thing I can really say , is I will pray for you .

True story of a premature Birth of a baby and her father by Mohammad Wasim :
This book actually the Documentary of life , tragedy , suspense and romance are in this book .
jersey on March 24 , 2012 :
Hi everyone , I am looking for words of wisdom here .
I currently have my sister 's 7 yr old daughter in my care , thru the Childrens aid Society supervision .
So she is not in the " system " , so we do n't receive funds nor services provided to her or us .
it 's called kin out of care .
I was there for her birth , and just been blessed to be close with her .
I myself was adopted into a foster family at the same age , I went thru some abuse .
Her mother was also adopted and we grew up really close .
So taking in my niece and making sure she had the best chance was my reason , rather then foster care .
Over the past 2 yrs that she has been with us , she has struggled and went thru trauma assessment .
My husband and I have had so many ups ' and downs ' during this time , dealing with the issues she has faced , and the fact that i do everything for her .
Recently he has decided that we cannot go on any longer and I have to decide on what is best for her .
I know I have feelings from my past of insecurities , my biological family did n't nor could n't take me .
I had a bad foster care / adoption experience .
I am doing all that I can to ensure her safety , and that she never goes thru what I have , .
The children 's aid has never done a thing in the past 4 years they have known her , no support or respite for us , even tho , they knew the challenges we were all facing .
she has reactive attachment disorder also .
Her mother was not committed to her 2 weekly visits , and cancelled numerous times .
So I requested access be removed until she can 100 % commit herself .
This child has suffered enough .
I am facing the difficulty of trusting that the CAS will find her a foster care family that will be able to provide her with the love and support she will need , since the CAS has not done a thing for her .
I have no faith .
I have a hard time knowing that I tried , but without the proper tools , my husband and I cannot give her what she needs .
How do I know what is best for her ?
How do I trust me giving her up is the right thing .
My husband see's me getting emotionally exhausted and frazzled by my sister and the personal aspect of all this , and feels I am not suitable to handle this .
He has told me otherwise , we are over but i should care for her on my own , since i am so attentive to her .
What do i do ?
I am heart broken and lost .
if i put her in fostercare for now , maybe one day I can be there for her again .
Would I be able to be involved on a regular basis ?
I have got her into therapy and everything .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on February 19 , 2012 :
I have adopted one child who I have adopted .
It 's a very huge blessing !
FutureDrKate on January 04 , 2012 :
Thanks for the article .
I 'm currently in the process of adopting a friend 's kids from foster care .
I love the books suggestions and the article in general .
Thanks !
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on November 30 , 2011 :
Jess , from my own experience with sexually abused children I would disagree .
Although if you define a five year old touching another child as abuse , that in itself is debatable .
Are they going to abuse as adults , probably not , but they are going to teach the other children things that they should n't know at an early age .
Jess on November 24 , 2011 :
Children who have been sexually assaulted / abused are actually not very likely to sexually abuse other children .
That is an unfortunate myth that has spread due to fear and lack of research in previous times .
All the current research shows that a person who was sexually abused is not any more likely to sexually abuse a child than someone who was never abused .
Just wanted to share and hopefully shed some light on an often misunderstood topic .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on October 10 , 2011 :
Muhammad that is a sad story .
I am so sorry to hear of your heartbreak .
That 's one thing sad about foster care , is that there is always a sad story attached .
It can end up happy , but underneath it began with a sad story .
I am so sorry .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on October 10 , 2011 :
Charlene , I 'm going to be honest with you , we will not allow a sexually abused child in our home , because we already have a child in our home .
They are known to perp on other children , and often it is best not to have them in a home that already has younger children .
That 's just what I heard , and you need to do what your gut tells you .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on October 10 , 2011 :
Christytidbits , thank you for your sharing .
I have not yet had to experience the saying goodbye yet , and I dread the day I do .
But the Lord is in control , and that 's what I try to remind myself .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on October 08 , 2011 :
I agree ournotes2self .
It is so heartbreaking . :)

To become a good human being need love . on August 26 , 2011 :
Foster parents is a noble job .
To treat a strange child as his own child is not a easy job .
I have a great respect such a parents .
I do not know , how far I am right to say my own experience .
I will be thankful , if some one rectify me .
I have a daughter .
At the age of four , I have given her a Foster care parent .
The government department helped me to get the family .
Due to some reason , I could not keep her with me .
In the beginning I was very satisfied with this family .
I could visit her any time .
Suddenly I got a letter from Children care department that , Your daughter can not concentrate in school and she was hanging between you and Foster family .
That 's why , our Children care taking department decided to visit once a week for six hours .
I understand the problem of my daughter .
I picked up once a week for six hours .
After a year , I got again a letter from the office that " You daughter is not satisfied with you .
She asked to visit her in the Foster parent 's house .
I could not understand the reason of playing with me .
I asked my daughter but I was not satisfied with her answer .
She was scare to reply .
I had always dispute and tension with Children Care department .
At last , I came to know that Foster parent want to adopt my daughter .
In another word , Both Children care department and foster parent work together to take away my daughter from me .
It is a long story .
Dispute always created .
Now my daughter is 12 years old .
She totally under control of the Foster parent and do what they like to say her .
I have to say , The Foster parent love her very much .
No doubt .
This is a great consultation for me .
She is my daughter .
I love her very much .
Some time in the absence of Foster parent , She take me in arms and say , I love you Papi .
I always weeping to think of my daughter but know one knows it .
I am very much co-operative but I am sad .
I hope , one day she will come to visit me .
Am I doing good for my daughter ?
This is also a category
of Foster parent .
No feeling of his real Father .
CharleneO on August 22 , 2011 :
thanks for the article , i am considering helping out a friend by fostering her niece , but am worried about how it will impact my children , i have an 8yr old and a 18 month old .
this little girl has been sexually abused and is only 5 , i can handle stress very well , but i'm not sure the rest of my family will be able to cope .
Christystidbits on July 28 , 2011 :
Very nicely written piece .
We are currently foster parents and the child we have was reunited with her mother for a short period of time .
It is absolutely heart breaking to see her go so foster parents really need to consider this .
We intend to adopt this child as soon as the courts are done with all the legalities but there is still nothing in stone to say that it will definitely happen .
Anybody thinking about fostering truly needs to realize that you will grow to love these children quickly and it can rip your heart out when they have to leave .
And as for your comment about making money from fostering , that is definitely not the case .
The cost of keeping a child is much more than what the state compensates you for .
I also agree that patience and the willingness to guide in a non threatening way is essential .
The child 's history can make them fearful , rebellious , and even vengeful at times .
A lot of love and understanding is required which can mean a lot of time so as you stated , people need to be prepared .
Thank you for your story .
It was great .

The thought of a child bouncing from home to home just breaks my heart .
Thanks for the great , and realistic tips !
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on May 26 , 2011 :
Very exciting . :)
You 'll have to share your story !
Mdgjbc on May 25 , 2011 :
Very good script am about to have a foster sister in a few mounts am so exited
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on September 03 , 2010 :
I definitely will look into that book !
Sounds great !!!
It would be an eye opener for me to hear from someone else !
valeria woods on September 03 , 2010 :
I 've written a book on the same subject called Olives for Breakfast a book for prospective foster / adoptive parents .
I was a foster child and a foster parent .
I think my experiences as a foster parent were different since I fostered through Agape Child and Family Services inc. in Memphis .
I would be honored if you would read my book .
20 % of the profits go to Agape .
You can buy my book at Barnes and Nobels .com or amazon .com just type in Olives for Breakfast .
Thanks
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on July 16 , 2010 :
No , I have n't , I will have to look into that !
pbcat from Austin , TX on July 16 , 2010 :
Has anyone read Three Little Words by Ashley Rhodes - Courter ?
She was a foster child and writes eloquently about her life as a foster child .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on May 31 , 2010 :
I think I want to read that book , do you happen to know who it was written by ?
Pamela Dapples from Just Arizona Now on May 29 , 2010 :
Very good article , thank you .
Several years ago , I read the book , Another Place at the Table .
I had thought I wanted to do foster care until I read that book .
It was written by a woman who had had more than 100 foster children .
It was an honest book .
Your article is also an honest look at the problems involved .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on March 25 , 2010 :
Oh , I can't wait to read it .
I 'm sure it will be really informative .
I may reference your hub in my page if applicable !
SamAntone on March 24 , 2010 :
Well , I did it .
Or should I say " doing " it : I 'm writing the story in " fiction format . "
I 've done the first two parts , with two or three more parts still coming .
Actually , the story is all written , and I 'm tweaking it for HubPages readership .
As I reviewed the story , I discovered I made an error :
It was n't six children they had , but seven !
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on March 22 , 2010 :
Yes you should write a hub about it .
I think I would find it really fascinating .
They say every adoption story has it 's own tale .
None are ever the same .
I know I love hearing everyone 's individual story !
SamAntone on March 22 , 2010 :
Nice heads - up , and true :
My cousin fostered a girl , who was greatly abused , then abandoned .
The psychiatrists who evaluated the girl estimated that she would not warm up or open up to them before five months passed .
Because of their love , and the special attention of his youngest daughter , she showed signs of trust in them before the first month was up .
They quickly bonded with her , and wanted to adopt her .
But because they already had six children , it almost did n't happen .
It was a nail - biter ending , like a good movie .
I 'll have to write a hub about it , some day .
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on March 21 , 2010 :
My dad grew up in the foster care system , so I have heard many horror stories as well .
Through honesty and example , my dad tried really hard to show us how we should treat others .
He was n't afraid to share his stories from growing up .
I think it 's sad how so many foster parents go into it with the wrong intent , and I think that 's why they end up being abusive like that .
Words can hurt worse than any physical mark , and I think people often forget .
Physical marks , mostly go away after time , words can stick with you a lifetime .
manic monday from USA on March 20 , 2010 :
You sound like a really good foster parent !
I had the foster mom from hell !
She put me down every chance she got , and I starved myself because she called me fat everyday !
At that time I was 135 pounds , and she weighed about 285 !!!
Lol , I would love to see 135 again !!!
Angela Michelle Schultz ( author ) from United States on March 20 , 2010 :
Thank you very much !
My aunt was very close to me , and she impacted a lot of my life .
I think it 's great to have that influence on your nieces lives like that .
Gloria Siess from Wrightwood , California on March 19 , 2010 :
This is a wonderful , honest article .
I was infertile due to Endometriosis ; I feel the same way about Foster Care that you do .
Since there was sexual abuse in my past , I did not feel comfortable being in a parental role around children ( I have been close to my nieces ; and love them of course ! ) I can nurture children them in a classroom setting , and feel God uses me there .
GREAT hub !
But also big winners are Angus cattle breeders ‚Äì to the chagrin of other breeders - as the massive advertising campaigns print on the brains of the great unwashed that Angus is the superior breed of moo cow .
Chances are the vast majority of fast food customers seeking something ‚Äú a little bit fancy ‚Äù only know the names of two or three breeds anyway and a great deal less about the meat itself .
It ‚Äôs a dangerous thing to criticise any cattle man or woman ‚Äôs breed of choice - you ‚Äôre much safer criticising their religion or even brand of ute ‚Äì so I ‚Äôll play safe and just say that Angus is a very fine breed , as are several others .
The Sydney Royal Easter
Show steer and carcase competition is by no means a definitive indication of beef superiority , but for what it ‚Äôs worth , the Stanhill Trophy this year was taken out by the Limousins with the silver going to Charolais , followed by Shorthorn , Square Meaters ( yes , there is such a breed ) , Poll Hereford , then Angus , Murray Grey , Galloway and Santa Gertrudis .
Properly prepared and slaughtered , they are all very fine eating .
Beef taste testing becomes very subjective , as several other competitions can show .
What ‚Äôs more , the breed of the beast is well down the list of what makes a particularly tasty steak .
What the animal had been eating , its age and condition and how little stress it experienced in the lead up to slaughter all count a great deal more .
And as for what goes into hamburger chain patties , well , despite the advertising , it ‚Äôs not actually the prime cuts of prime beef .
That sticker on the McDonald ‚Äôs ads , ‚Äú Prime Australian Beef ‚Äú , does n‚Äôt seem to be actually defined as anything by Meat and Livestock Australia .
Fountains have been used since history began to add character and ambience to outdoor spaces .
This list looks at ten of the more spectacular or fascinating fountains from around the world .
Be sure to mention your own favorites in the comments .

4 Charybdis Fountain Seaham Hall , Sunderland , UK

Jets form over the statues and start to create a dense mist that gas is shot through to form the fire .
The whole process last about 32 minutes .
2 Castle Square Fountain Swansea , Wales
There is nothing too remarkable about this fountain except during St. David ‚Äôs Day ( Welsh St. Patrick ‚Äôs Day ) when the Castle Square Fountain and the waterfall are dyed a deep red .
This gives way to their fountain being called the blood fountain .
The water stays dyed red from March 1 ( St. David ‚Äôs Day ) until March 9 .
1 Mercury Fountain Barcelona , Spain
Created by Alexander Calder for the Spanish Republican government to memorialize the siege of Almaden .
This was first displayed in Paris in 1937 during the World Exhibition .
Later it was moved to Barcelona .
Not knowing the effects of mercury , it was open to everyone .
Now it can be viewed behind glass so no harm comes to people from the fumes or touching the mercury .
all your problems are over

The White House and Democrats in Congress have begun pushing in earnest for a package of financial reforms .
But will it be enough to stop Wall Street from causing another meltdown ?
To find out what real financial reform needs to look like , Bill Moyers turns to Simon Johnson and James Kwak , the co-authors of 13 BANKERS : THE WALL STREET TAKEOVER AND THE NEXT FINANCIAL MELTDOWN .
The problem , according to Kwak , is that the legislation currently does n't address the central problem of the crisis , that America 's banks have grown ' too big to fail . '
In fact , the problem has gotten worse , with just six banks holding assets in excess of 63 % of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product .
Kwak explains that the crisis actually made the surviving banks more powerful , " I think what 's remarkable is that it used to be maybe eight or nine banks .
But what 's happened over the last two years , as Simon is saying , is that these banks have gotten bigger , because they 've bought each other .
They 've become more powerful .
And they have an even stronger market position in some key markets like credit cards , mortgages , equity underwriting , and derivatives . "
Johnson argues that for reform to work , policy makers and regulators must reject the belief that Wall Street knows what 's its doing , that its interests are always aligned with the nation as a whole , " The idea that we need Wall Street with its current structure ‚Äî and a disproportionate economic power that implies ‚Äî to somehow make this economy work and drive entrepreneurship , that idea is nonsense .
This is why we wrote the book , all right ?
There 's plenty of evidence on this issue .
We go through it .
If you want a faith based economy in this regard , you can disregard the evidence . "
Senator Brown and the ' Volcker Rule '
Johnson and Kwak believe Congress should pass a law capping the size of the banks , to keep them from becoming so large that their failure threatens the world economy .
This approach has been dubbed the ' Volcker Rule , ' after Paul Volcker , the well - respected former Federal Reserve chairman who has pushed hard for its inclusion .
Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio has introduced an amendment to the bill that would do just that , reading in part that , " No bank holding company may possess non-deposit liabilities exceeding 3 percent of the annual gross domestic product of the United States . "
The Six Big Banks
The names of the six banking behemoths are no doubt familiar to most Americans .
The four largest by assets ‚Äî Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo and Citigroup ‚Äî hold 39 percent of American 's deposits .
The six biggest commercial banks by deposit :
Bank of America , $ 817.9 billion
JPMorgan Chase Bank $ 618.1 billion
Wachovia Bank $ 394.2 billion
Wells Fargo Bank $ 325.4 billion
Citibank $ 265.9 billion
U.S. Bank $ 151.9 billion

Transcript from PBS
BILL MOYERS : Welcome to the JOURNAL .
With all due respect , we can only wish those tea party activists who gathered this week were not so single - minded about just who 's responsible for their troubles , real and imagined .
They 're up in arms , so to speak , against big government , especially the Obama administration .
But if they thought this through , they'd be joining forces with other grassroots Americans who will soon be demonstrating in Washington and elsewhere against high finance , taking on Wall Street and the country 's biggest banks .
The original Tea Party , remember , was n't directed just against the British redcoats .
Colonial patriots also took aim at the East India Company .
That was the joint - stock enterprise originally chartered by the first Queen Elizabeth .
Over the years , the government granted them special rights and privileges , which the owners turned into a monopoly over trade , including tea .
It may seem a stretch from tea to credit default swaps , but the principle is the same : when enormous private wealth goes unchecked , regular folks get hurt - badly .
That 's what happened in 2008 when the monied interests led us up the garden path to the great collapse .
Suppose the Tea Party folk had dropped by those Senate hearings this week looking into the failure of Washington Mutual .
That 's the bank that went belly up during the meltdown in September 2008 .
It was the largest such failure in American history .
WaMu , as we were reminded this week , made sub - prime loans that its executives knew were rotten , then packaged them as mortgage securities , and pawned them off on unsuspecting investors .
SEN .
CARL LEVIN : And that was your responsibility to make sure that the securities which went out to the investors were following notice to the investors of everything that they needed to know in order that the information be complete and truthful .
That 's what your testimony was , under oath .
DAVID BECK : It 's a very real possibility that the loans that went out were better quality than Mr. Shaw laid out .
SEN .
CARL LEVIN : And you do n't -
DAVID BECK : A very real possibility .
SEN .
CARL LEVIN : And there 's a very good possibility that they were exactly the quality that he laid out , right ?
Is that right ?
DAVID BECK : That 's right .
SEN .
CARL LEVIN : Okay .
And you do n't know , and apparently you do n't care .
And the trouble is , you should have cared .
BILL MOYERS : Then there 's Lehman Brothers .
During those black September days a year and a half ago , the Feds decided to let Lehman go .
This led to America 's biggest bankruptcy ever .
In an admirable work of journalism this week , the New York Times reported that Lehman secretly controlled a company called Hudson Castle and used it to borrow money as well as to hide bad investments in commercial real estate and sub - prime mortgages .
But the week 's award for sheer gall goes to a Chicago - area hedge fund called Magnetar , named after a kind of neutron star that spews deadly radiation across the galaxies .
Thanks to the teamwork of the investigative reporting website " ProPublica , " NPR's " Planet Money " project and " This American Life , " we learned Magnetar worked with investment banks to create toxic CDO's - collateralized debt obligations - securities backed by sub - prime mortgages the management knew were bad .
And then Magnetar took that knowledge and bet against the very same investments they had recommended to buyers .
Selling short and making a fortune .
And late this week the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the godfather of Wall Street , Goldman Sachs , with fraud in earning a fifteen million dollar fee involving those complex CDO's , a hedge fund , and the housing market .
But , since we know all this , why is it so hard to hold Wall Street accountable ?
Even as we speak the banking industry and corporate America are fighting against financial reform with all the money and influence at their disposal
Their effort is to preserve a system that would enable them to ransack the country once again .
So even if the Tea Party folks saw the light , what can ordinary Americans do ?
That 's the question I want to put to my guests , Simon Johnson and James Kwak .
They have written this new book , 13 BANKERS : THE WALL STREET TAKEOVER AND THE NEXT FINANCIAL MELTDOWN .
It 's a must read - already a best seller -- and it could n't have come at a better time .
This book could change the debate over financial reform by tipping it in favor of the public .
Simon Johnson is a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund .
He now teaches at MIT 's Sloan School of Management and is a Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
James Kwak is studying law at Yale Law School - a career he decided to pursue after working as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company and co-founding the successful software company , Guidewire .
Together James Kwak and Simon Johnson run the indispensable economic website BaselineScenario.com
Welcome to you both .
Let me get to the blunt conclusion you reach in your book .
You say that two years after the devastating financial crisis of '08 our country is still at the mercy of an oligarchy that is bigger , more profitable , and more resistant to regulation than ever .
Correct ?
SIMON JOHNSON : Absolutely correct , Bill .
The big banks became stronger as a result of the bailout .
That may seem extraordinary , but it 's really true .
They 're turning that increased economic clout into more political power .
And they 're using that political power to go out and take the same sort of risks that got us into disaster in September 2008 .
BILL MOYERS : And your definition of oligarchy is ?
SIMON JOHNSON : Oligarchy is just - it 's a very simple , straightforward idea from Aristotle .
It 's political power based on economic power .
And it 's the rise of the banks in economic terms , which we document at length , that it 'd turn into political power .
And they then feed that back into more deregulation , more opportunities to go out and take reckless risks and -- and capture huge amounts of money .
BILL MOYERS : And you say that these this oligarchy consists of six megabanks .
What are the six banks ?
JAMES KWAK : They are Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup , Bank of America , and Wells Fargo .
BILL MOYERS : And you write that they control 60 percent of our gross national product ?
JAMES KWAK : They have assets equivalent to 60 percent of our gross national product .
And to put this in perspective , in the mid-1990s , these six banks or their predecessors , since there have been a lot of mergers , had less than 20 percent .
Their assets were less than 20 percent of the gross national product .
BILL MOYERS : And what 's the threat from an oligarchy of this size and scale ?
SIMON JOHNSON : They can distort the system , Bill .
They can change the rules of the game to favor themselves .
And unfortunately , the way it works in modern finance is when the rules favor you , you go out and you take a lot of risk .
And you blow up from time to time , because it 's not your problem .
When it blows up , it 's the taxpayer and it's the government that has to sort it out .
BILL MOYERS : So , you 're not kidding when you say it 's an oligarchy ?
JAMES KWAK : Exactly .
I think that in particular , we can see how the oligarchy has actually become more powerful in the last since the financial crisis .
If we look at the way they 've behaved in Washington .
For example , they 've been spending more than $ 1 million per day lobbying Congress and fighting financial reform .
I think that 's for some time , the financial sector got its way in Washington through the power of ideology , through the power of persuasion .
And in the last year and a half , we 've seen the gloves come off .
They are fighting as hard as they can to stop reform .
SIMON JOHNSON : I know people react a little negatively when you use this term for the United States .
But it means political power derived from economic power .
That 's what we 're looking at here .
It 's disproportionate , it 's unfair , it is very unproductive , by the way .
Undermines business in this society .
And it 's an oligarchy like we see in other countries .
BILL MOYERS : And you say they continue to hold the global economy hostage ?
JAMES KWAK : Exactly .
Because what 's happened - what we learned in 2008 were certain institutions are so big and so interconnected that if they were to fail , they would cause systemic shocks throughout the economy .
That 's essentially what happened in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed .
And what 's remarkable , and I think what essentially proves the point of our book is that almost two years later , nothing has changed .
Or the only thing that has changed is that these banks have gotten larger , more powerful , both economically and politically .
And they 've been flexing their muscles in Washington for the last year and a half .
So Neal Wolin , the Deputy Treasury Secretary gave a blistering speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in which he said , look , the financial sector has been spending more than one million dollars per day lobbying against the reforms we need to fix the financial system .
Now , Simon and I think those reforms that the Administration has proposed do not go far enough .
But we think they 're certainly better than nothing .
What Wall Street wants is they want nothing .
They want to stop this in its tracks and go back to where we were five years ago .
SIMON JOHNSON : It 's amazing , Bill .
But this is this is politics and this is money .
And you know , there 's a ground game , which is campaign contributions , which are surging in .
I 'm sure on both sides of the aisle .
And there 's also the ideological space .
It 's amazing .
The Chamber of Commerce that claims to represent the broad cross section of American business is siding with six big banks , who favor policies that are directly contrary to the interests of most of the membership of the Chamber of Commerce .
And that 's just not just me saying that .
That 's Neal Wolin .
That 's Treasury .
That 's the White House saying that now .
Calling fortunately , they 've come to the point where they 're willing to call the Chamber of Commerce on that .
But I do n't know if that message is getting through to people .
JAMES KWAK :
You see what the bankers have done is they have taken a basic principle which is more or less true .
Which is that free financial markets do enable money to go to the places where people need it .
But on top of that , they 've erected a system that is indescribably complex .
And gives many opportunities to make money at the expense of their customers , at the expense of their counterparties .
Even at the expense of their own employers .
So , one of the things that has happened has been that Wall Street finance has become so complex and the internal systems of Wall Street banks has become so complex that if you are a smart banker , who is out to maximize your own income , you can find the loopholes in the system and you can exploit them , even if it means taking money from your own -- from your own company
BILL MOYERS : You 've been writing this week on your website -- about this hedge fund in Chicago that 's made a lot of money .
In effect , betting against the American Dream .
What was that ?
JAMES KWAK : Magnetar is a hedge fund which means that other people gave them money to invest .
And their job is to make as much money as possible .
And these were the smart guys in the room .
They saw that the system was broken .
And they found a specific way to exploit it .
And they knew that they could go for example , they could go to Wall Street banks and the banks would collaborate in making these extremely toxic securities .
Because they knew what the bankers incentives were .
They knew that the banker 's incentives were to do the deal , to do the transaction , to get the fees up front .
And they knew that there was nobody watching out for the investors .
There was nobody watching out to make sure that securities they manufactured were actually good securities .
But essentially what they were doing is they wanted to short the housing market .
And they shorted the market in such a way that they actually made the problem worse , because what they did is they encouraged they tried to create these very toxic securities explicitly so that they could then short those securities .
And that 's why in a sense , they were they were shorting the American Dream .
But what the real story of Magnetar , I think , is that they were exploiting a system that was deeply broken .
So , we like to think that the financial system we have in Wall Street are set up so that as people try to make lots of money they are they are indirectly helping the economy by making sure their capital goes where it 's needed most .
What the Magnetar story shows us that this is a casino , where you can make money you can make money exploiting the weaknesses in the casino .
And it has nothing to do with the American Dream .
It has nothing to do with making sure that capital goes to the places where it 's needed most .
I have to say that we owe a great to debt to " ProPublica " and " Planet Money " and " This American Life " for uncovering this story
BILL MOYERS : Public radio's excellent program , " This American Life " , did a terrific broadcast on this subject , based upon the ProPublica investigation that you talked about .
And there 's a song in it that I have to play for the two of you and for my audience .
Take a listen .
UNIDENTIFIED MAN : Step one .
You write a check for 10 million dollars .
Hand the check to a Wall Street bank , and ask them to make us a CDO .
Step two : they create the CDO , using risky stuff , very risky stuff , extremely risky stuff .
Step three : other investors commit hundreds of millions of dollars to the CDO .
Step four : we bet against the CDO , using a credit default swap .
Step five : the housing market crashes .
The CDO 's value goes to zero , our bet pays off and we make hundreds of millions of dollars and before you can say step six , we 're rich !
We 're going to bet against the American Dream , we 're going to be on the winning team , purchase risky debt on a massive scale .
Then place a bet that the debt will fail .
Hundreds of millions for Magnetar , the economy collapsing like a dying star .
No one will know till it's on NPR , and who cares ?
It 's time to hit the town , this sucker could go down .
The housing market 's losing steam .
And all we got to do to make our dreams come true is bet against the American Dream !
BILL MOYERS : You 're smiling , James , but is it really that funny ?
JAMES KWAK : Well for decades , we 've been told that Wall Street and financial innovation were promoting the American Dream .
And what they 've I think what the show and the song have really hit the hit the nail on is that in fact , you can make even more money betting against the American Dream .
And that 's the kind of system we have today .
SIMON JOHNSON : My bumper sticker from this and I hope it does become a bumper sticker is , " Trust me , I 'm a banker . "
I mean , you need to break through there 's a level of progress here , Bill .
Which is when people can laugh about it .
When people can break it down into pieces .
When you 've got the 60 - second version .
And you can hammer that .
And people understand it .
Then you 're starting to fight back .
This is about ideology .
This is about belief .
This is about these guys are smart .
These guys are well paid .
So they must know what they 're doing .
And that 's wrong .
BILL MOYERS : You wrote on your website this week about how JPMorgan Chase lost $ 880 million on one of these kind of whacky obscure deals ?
But the executives still paid themselves millions of dollars in up front fees .
And you conclude that bankers placed a ticking bomb on their own bank balance sheet .
It exploded and personally they still made money .
JAMES KWAK : Exactly .
Because this is an example so , this is from the " ProPublica " investigation of Magnetar .
essentially the bankers at JPMorgan Chase involved in the transaction created a new CDO .
A new collateralized debt obligation .
Which was very , very toxic .
And either they knew at the time that it was toxic , or they should have known , I have no way of knowing .
JPMorgan decided to hold onto most of this toxic product they -- they had built .
A billion dollars worth of toxic product .
And then when the market collapsed , it turned out they lost $ 880 million on that position .
So , if we think about it , there are really two possibilities here .
The bankers involved in the transaction either really thought that this was a good product and a good investment , in which case they 're incompetent .
Or they had - they may have doubts , they may have thought it was toxic , but they knew that the way the internal systems at JPMorgan Chase worked , they could get the fees front , they could get bonuses based on those fees , and leave the bomb for later .
BILL MOYERS : Somebody wrote on your blog this week , " If I were to buy an old house .
Make some cosmetic improvements that mask an underlying rot .
Got my insurance company to write an exorbitant homeowners policy exceeding any leans against the property .
Then burned it down , would n't that be fraud ? "
Did you answer this guy ?
JAMES KWAK : I have n't .
That would
BILL MOYERS : Would you ?
JAMES KWAK : That would be fraud .
BILL MOYERS : That would be fraud .
So , explain to me how you manage to lose $ 880 million on your own company 's money to make a quick buck for yourself and you get away with it ?

The United Nations estimates that approximately 6,500 languages are spoken in the world today .
But a lot of these languages are dying and disappearing fast .
By the end of this century , many linguists estimate that over half of those 6,500 languages will be gone .
The study of dying languages is late in coming , and no one knows for sure how many languages exist that have yet to be heard .
After all , 95 % of the world ‚Äôs languages are spoken by only 5 % of the population .
So how do we find these disappearing languages ?
And how can we try to preserve them ?
Why are languages endangered ?
Over the past fifty years , technology has allowed people to communicate across thousands of miles at the push of a button or a click of the mouse .
These developments have major advantages ‚Äî but have resulted in the disappearance of hundreds of languages .
As international business becomes more globalized , social and economic pressures drive once - isolated communities to assimilate and adopt the popular languages of the region , particularly in Asia and the Pacific .
The influence of the media , as well as standardized language teaching in schools , also contribute to the host of dying languages .
As the older generation passes away , the youth are left without the language skills of their ancestors .
How can we save dying languages ?
As the problem of dying languages becomes increasingly critical , organizations are popping up around the world to preserving disappearing dialects .
The World Oral Literature Project , established in 2009 by Mark Turin of University of Cambridge ‚Äôs Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology , is one such organization dedicated to recording dying languages from Siberia to Bolivia .
The project aims to create a library of audio and video material from communities around the world , documenting their oral traditions and preserving the dying language for future generations .
Team members travel to remote communities and record the local tales , songs , rituals and histories with voice recorders and video cameras .
Back in Cambridge , they receive DVDs from isolated language pockets around the world , from people wanting to tell their stories and share their language .
The materials are not only for posterity ‚Äî the tapes are also useful as teaching materials within the communities themselves , giving local children learning tools they ‚Äôve never had access to before .
Similar projects to record and preserve dying languages include National Geographic ‚Äôs Enduring Voices and the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project .
What is oral literature ?
It might sound like an oxymoron , but oral literature has become the standard term for the traditional cultural material passed down through word of mouth .
Songs , poems , stories , recitations , chants , stories , ritual texts , epics , riddles , music , folk tales , creation myths , proverbs , histories and biographies all contribute to the richness of a culture ‚Äî and help a language develop and thrive .
That makes preserving a language an even more important cause .
In doing so , these organizations are also preserving the history and memory of a culture .
Mike Huckabee , a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , says the effort to allow gays and lesbians to marry is comparable to legalizing incest , polygamy and drug use .
Huckabee also told college journalists last week that gay couples should not be permitted to adopt .
‚Äú Children are not puppies , ‚Äù he said .
Huckabee visited The College of New Jersey in Ewing , N.J. , last Wednesday to speak to the Student Government Association .
He also was interviewed by a campus news magazine , The Perspective , which published an article on Friday .
ADVERTISEMENT
Huckabee told the interviewer that not every group ‚Äôs interests deserve to be accommodated , if their lifestyle is outside of what he called ‚Äú the ideal . ‚Äù
‚Äú That would be like saying , well there ‚Äôs there are a lot of people who like to use drugs so let ‚Äôs go ahead and accommodate those who want to use drugs .
There are some people who believe in incest , so we should accommodate them .
There are people who believe in polygamy , should we accommodate them ? ‚Äù he said , according to a transcript of the interview .
The 2008 presidential hopeful and former Arkansas governor also said that deciding which lifestyles should be accommodated and which ones should not creates a slippery slope .
‚Äú Why do you get to choose that two men are OK but one man and three women are n‚Äôt OK ? ‚Äù he asked .
Huckabee added that his goal is n‚Äôt to tell others how to live , but that the burden of proving that a gay marriage can be successful rests with the activists in favor of changing the law .
ADVERTISEMENT
‚Äú I do n‚Äôt have to prove that marriage is a man and a woman in a relationship for life , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú They have to prove that two men can have an equally definable relationship called marriage , and somehow that that can mean the same thing . ‚Äù
Since the magazine published the interview , Huckabee ‚Äôs remarks have attracted considerable attention on the Web .
In a statement Tuesday , Huckabee said that while he believes what people do in their private lives is their business , ‚Äú I do not believe we should change the traditional definition of marriage . ‚Äù
He also said he thought the college magazine was sensationalizing his ‚Äú well - known and hardly unusual views of same - sex marriage . ‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
In response to a 1992 questionnaire from The Associated Press , Huckabee , then a Senate candidate in Arkansas , spelled out his opposition to homosexuality , saying it was crucial that the country not ‚Äú legitimize immorality . ‚Äù
‚Äú I feel homosexuality is an aberrant , unnatural , and sinful lifestyle , ‚Äù he wrote , in response to a question about gays in the military .
ADVERTISEMENT
He also advocated isolating AIDS patients from the general public , saying it was necessary to confine ‚Äú carriers of this plague . ‚Äù
As governor , Huckabee supported an Arkansas policy that prevented same - sex couples from serving as foster parents .
On gay marriage , he said in an interview , ‚Äú Marriage has historically never meant anything other than a man and a woman .
It has never meant two men , two women , a man and his pet , or a man and a whole herd of pets . ‚Äù

Workers could find themselves out in the cold as councils cut budgets
At least 25,000 council jobs in England will be under threat in the next three to five years , a BBC survey suggests .
The forecast is based on answers from 49 councils with a combined workforce of 256,000 , suggesting cuts of 10 % .
If all councils in England cut staffing by 10 % , 180,000 posts would go , BBC home editor Mark Easton says .
Libraries and nurseries are among those facing cuts .
But PM Gordon Brown said while there was a need for efficiency savings , services need not suffer .
One union has reacted to the survey 's findings by warning of " social disharmony " and conflict between councils and workers .
Restricting council biscuits and street lighting are gestures in what looks certain to be a dark period of rationalisation and savings
Mark Easton
BBC 's home editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full Councils across the UK say jobs and services will have to be cut if , as they expect , funding from central government is reduced .
More than 70 % of councils in England that responded to the survey predicted spending cuts of between 5 % and 20 % .
Roads , libraries , the arts and leisure appear most at risk of cutbacks .
Children 's social services , services for the homeless and planning appear to be safest .
The Local Government Association , which represents English and Welsh local authorities , said town halls had been battling the effects of recession for more than a year .
" Sources of income have dropped sharply at a time when more and more people are turning to councils to help them through tough times , " said chairman Dame Margaret Eaton .
LOCAL SPENDING MAPPED
See the map in detail Find out more about this story on your BBC Local website " Low interest rates mean councils are much less able to rely on their savings , plummeting house and land prices have hit hard and income from leisure centres and a range of other services has fallen . "
She said tough decisions would have to be taken , but " councils will do everything they can " to protect front - line services .
Speaking to BBC Radio Berkshire , Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " We 've given an extra 40 % to local councils in the last 10 years .
" The availability of funding has gone up by 4 % this year .
" I think what we 've done has created the foundation in which local authorities can do the things that they need to do , including front - line policing which I 've been talking about today .
" And they 're able to make efficiency savings in the way they do things , just like central government has had to make savings .
" So I do n't accept these figures .
What I do believe is that local authorities will be in a position to make the efficiency savings that central government will make . "
Many of the councils that responded to the BBC survey were reluctant to forecast job losses .
But eight authorities - Kirklees , Leeds , City of Bradford , Sheffield , Stoke - on - Trent , Nottinghamshire , Lincolnshire and Surrey - said 1,000 or more posts might be lost within five years .
Birmingham City Council , which did not respond to the survey , is planning savings of ¬£ 69 m in the next financial year , which could mean the loss of up to 2,000 jobs .
Shropshire Council has also said it is planning to cut more than 1,000 posts over the coming years .
Tony Travers , of the London School of Economics , said : " Nothing like this has happened for a generation . "

He believed 25,000 job losses in England was a cautious forecast .
Speaking on Today on BBC Radio 4 , Mr Travers said : " For myself I 'd be amazed if it was that low .
I think it 'll be much higher .
It could be as high as 100,000 . "
Dave Prentis , general secretary of the union Unison , said big job losses could cause " social disharmony " in inner cities and conflict between councils and workers .
He said : " The government has spent vast amounts bailing out the banks .
" We always feared that , to offset the cost , they would come for public service jobs .
We will not allow our members to pay the price . "

The more council job cuts the better - I want my council tax reduced and do n't care about cuts in services Keith5485
He insisted there was an alternative if councils dipped into their reserves , people paid " a little more tax " and the government closed tax loopholes .
Mr Prentis said : " Care is already in crisis .
Some councils want to halve the number of care homes , others will follow suit .
We 'll go from crisis to disaster .
Our communities will suffer , vulnerable people will suffer . "
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said : " Councils that use the recession as an excuse to make swingeing and self - defeating cuts to vital services ... will face a backlash from the millions of people who use them every day .
" Focusing on growth to get the country back on track is just as important in local government as it is in Whitehall . "
' Big challenge ' Communities Secretary John Denham told BBC Radio 5 live that councils that were cutting spending in the present financial year could not blame a reduction in government funding .

A Conservative government would bring in a one - year pay freeze across the public sector for everyone earning more than ¬£ 18,000 a year , the shadow communities secretary , Caroline Spelman , told BBC Breakfast .
She estimated that the move could save 100,000 jobs .
Julia Goldsworthy , who speaks on local government for the Liberal Democrats , called on ministers to " come clean " about cuts to council funding .
She said : " Three - quarters of council money comes from government grants .
John Denham 's attempt to wash his hands of blame is outrageous . "
The councils are budgeting for an average 2.5 % increase in revenue spending - covering running costs rather than capital projects - in the year from April .
But that is a sharp drop on the average 5.3 % rise in 2008 / 09 .
In examples of cuts around the country , in Newcastle a homeless hostel says it is having to turn away four out of five people who come asking for a bed because it does not have the funding to look after them all .
Its council grant has been frozen .

A large study from Children 's Hospital Boston and the Boston - based Autism Consortium finds that a genetic test that samples the entire genome , known as chromosomal microarray analysis , has about three times the detection rate for genetic changes related to autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) than standard tests .
Publishing in the April issue of Pediatrics ( and online March 15 ) , the authors urge that CMA become part of the first - line genetic work - up for ASDs .
Expectant parents who have family members with ASDs , as well as families who already have an affected child , often request genetic testing .
However , there is still only limited knowledge about actual causative genes .
The currently recommended tests ( karyotyping to look for chromosomal abnormalities and testing for Fragile X , the single largest known genetic cause of ASDs ) often come up negative .
Chromosomal microarray analysis ( CMA ) is a genome - wide assay that examines the chromosomes for tiny , sub-microscopic deletions or duplications of DNA sequences , known as copy - number variants .
CMA offers about 100 - fold greater resolution than standard karyotyping .
However , since it is new , it is often considered a second - tier test .
Depending on where a person lives , or what insurance they have , CMA may not be covered by health insurance .
" Based on our findings , CMA should be considered as part of the initial clinical diagnostic evaluation of patients with ASDs , " says Bai -Lin Wu , PhD , Director of Children 's DNA Diagnostic Lab in the Department of Laboratory Medicine , which has offered CMA to families since 2006 .
The research team , led by co-senior authors Wu ( heading the Children 's team ) , and David Miller , MD , PhD , of Children 's Division of Genetics and Department of Laboratory Medicine ( heading the Autism Consortium team ) , assessed the diagnostic value of CMA in the largest cohort to date -- 933 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ASD ( by DSM - IV - TR criteria ) who received clinical genetic testing in 2006 , 2007 and 2008 .
Half were Children 's patients who had their samples submitted to the hospital 's DNA Diagnostic Laboratory , and the others were recruited through the Autism Consortium , a research and clinical collaboration of five Boston - area medical centers .
Nearly half of the patients were diagnosed with autistic disorder , nearly half with PDD - NOS ( pervasive developmental disorder -- not otherwise specified ) and about 3 percent with Asperger disorder .
Ages ranged from 13 months to 22 years .

Testing included the two currently used tests ( G - banded karyotype and fragile X ) , as well as CMA .
When the researchers compared the tests ' diagnostic yield , they found :
Karyotyping yielded abnormal results in 2.23 percent of patients
Fragile X testing was abnormal in 0.46 percent
CMA results were judged to be abnormal in 7.3 percent of patients when the entire length of the chromosomes ( the whole genome ) was sampled .
Extrapolating from these results , the researchers estimate that without CMA , genetic diagnosis will be missed in at least 5 percent of ASD cases .
CMA performed best in certain subgroups , such as girls with autistic disorder , and past studies indicate that it also has a higher yield in patients with intellectual disability ( who constituted only 12 percent of this sample ) .
" CMA clearly detects more abnormalities than other genetic tests that have been the standard of care for many years , " says Miller .
" We 're hoping this evidence will convince insurance companies to cover this testing universally . "
In all , roughly 15 percent of people with autism have a known genetic cause .
Establishing a clear genetic diagnosis helps families obtain early intervention and services for autism , and helps parents predict the possibility of having another child with autism .
In addition , by pinpointing bits of chromosomes that are deleted or duplicated , CMA can help researchers zero in on specific causative genes within that stretch of DNA .
They can also begin to classify patients according to the type of deletion or duplication they have , and try to find specific treatment approaches for each sub - type of autism .

" Just in the last two years , a number of studies have revealed the clinical importance of ever smaller chromosome deletions and duplications found with advanced microarray technology , " says Wu .
" These new , highly - efficient tests can help in the evaluation or confirmation of autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disorders , leading to early diagnosis and intervention and a significantly improved developmental outcome . "
Two known chromosome locations -- on chromosome 16 ( 16p11.2 ) and chromosome 15 ( 15q13.2q13.3 ) accounted for 17 percent of abnormal CMA findings .
Both chromosome abnormalities were initially linked with ASDs by Children 's Hospital Boston and collaborators in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of Medical Genetics , respectively , in 2008 .
Children 's now offers specific tests targeting both of these " hot spots . "
However , the researchers note that most copy - number changes were unique or identified in only a small number of patients , so their implications need further study .
Many of them are presumed to be related to ASDs because they involve important genes , cover a large region of the chromosome , or because the child is the first person in that family to have the change .
" Some deletions and duplications are rare and specific to one individual or one family , " says Miller .
" Learning about them is going to be an evolving process .
There wo n't be one single test that finds all genetic changes related to autism , until we completely understand the entire genome . "
The paper 's co-first authors were Autism Consortium members Yiping Shen , PhD , of Children 's Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital , and Kira Dies , ScM , LGC , of the Family Research Network of the Autism Consortium and Children 's Multi-Disciplinary Tuberous Sclerosis Program .
A number of specialists from Children 's Departments of Neurology , Developmental Medicine and Clinical Genetics and physicians from other medical centers in greater Boston were also authors on the study .
The research was supported by the Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation , the Simons Foundation , Autism Speaks and the National Institutes of Health .

Lawmakers opposed to President Barack Obama 's plan for national health care reform are hoping to spur a nationwide " civil disobedience " that can derail Obamacare .
State Rep. Brian Calley , R- Portland ; State Rep. Justin Amash , R - Kentwood ; and State Sen . Wayne Kuipers , R- Holland , have each introduced similar constitutional amendments that seek to trump the national health care bills .
For example , Sen. Kuipers ' bill would prohibit a federal law from compelling any person , employer or health care provider to participate in any health care system .
It also prevents anyone from being penalized for ignoring the federal law .
" Where this is going , I do n't know , " Kuipers said this week .
" You do n't know until the states try to do it . "
According to a 10th Amendment think tank , 26 states have attempted their own versions of Kuipers ' bill .
Arizona has had its version passed by both houses of Congress , and it will be voted on by residents in November .
Virginia also had both houses of Congress pass a similar bill , and it is awaiting the governor 's signature .
Constitutional law experts say state law does not take precedence over federal law .
" This would violate the U.S. Constitution if challenged , " Frank Ravitch , a professor of law at Michigan State University College of Law , wrote in an e-mail .
Kermit Roosevelt , a professor at the University of Penn Law School , wrote in an e-mail that the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution gives federal law power over state law .
" States can not say no to a federal mandate , " Roosevelt wrote .
" Any state law or constitutional provision that conflicts with a federal law is void . "
Michael Boldin , founder of the 10th Amendment Center ‚Äî a public policy think tank in Los Angeles ‚Äî said there are cases where state resistance has stymied federal law .
The REAL ID Act of 2005 is a U.S. federal law that was to impose new security standards for a state 's driver 's licenses .
Many states opposed it with their own state laws , and the act has not been implemented , Boldin said .
" Basically a bunch of people all across the country are saying , ' No .
We are n't going to go along with it , ' and getting state government to back them , " Boldin said .
" They ( federal government ) did n't threaten to take away funding .
They did n't send in armed guards .
They just repeatedly delayed implementation .
In fact , it ( REAL ID ) is null and void .
" The real success in these actions is ' we the people ' saying we are in charge and the federal government is not going to force things down our throat . "
Boldin said medical marijuana could also be a route that the states go in their battle against Obama 's health care plan .
In California and Michigan , the state law is in conflict with the national law on marijuana .
In both states , the federal government can prosecute for medicinal marijuana use even though the state allows it .
" You can have a situation where federal law prohibits something that states permit , " Roosevelt said .
" That means that the state wo n't arrest or prosecute you for it , but the federal government still might .
State law can't protect you from federal law .
But enforcement of marijuana laws is a low priority for the federal government , so effectively you might be safe ‚Äî I think the Obama administration actually had a policy statement about how they were n't going to devote resources to this in California . "
Boldin said that is why it is important for as many states as possible to join the other states if they want to make Obamacare realistically unenforceable .
CS5 : An evolution of the designer ‚Äôs toolbox
After months of hinting and speculation , Adobe has unveiled the latest version of its popular design toolbox , Creative Suite 5 .
Beneath a mountain of new features , the suite also received a comprehensive brand refresh .
We talked with Adobe ‚Äôs brand design team to find out more .
Since its humble , grayscale beginnings on the Macintosh Plus , Adobe Photoshop ‚Äî and more recently , the Adobe Creative Suite ‚Äî has become a vital component in nearly every designer ‚Äôs toolbox , forever changing the way we work .
This year , Photoshop is celebrating its landmark 20th anniversary .
As a longtime user , since at least version 4.0 ( CS5 marks the release of version 12.0 ) , I ‚Äôm always curious to see what the next generation will bring .
Typically , it comes as a mixed blessing ‚Äî new features to improve speed and workflow are always welcome , as long as you take the time to learn them and ( of course ) fork over the upgrade fee .
So what ‚Äôs new ?
A launch video posted by Adobe on Monday unveiled many of the new features and improvements we can expect to see in Creative Suite 5 .
Watching with great anticipation , the Adobe ‚Äò Evangelists ‚Äô guide us through a Tim Burton - esque Land of Oz filled with Photoshop - branded flowers , Wolverine chops , and fancy new 64 - bit native software .
Features like Photoshop CS5 ‚Äôs new Mixer Brush , Content - Aware Fill , and Puppet Warp gave everyone that initial ‚Äò wow ‚Äô feeling .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm salivating , ‚Äù says Greg Geisler of Texas design studio Raytracer who took part in the launch video .
Although , if Photoshop CS5 ‚Äôs Content - Aware Fill performs anything like CS4 ‚Äôs Content - Aware Scale , I would n‚Äôt set my hopes too high .
Photoshop ‚Äôs HDR imaging demonstration also seemed to produce gimmicky results at best .
Beautiful Strokes , Perspective Drawing , and the Shape Builder tool are a nice addition to the new version of Illustrator .
Meanwhile , interactivity is being touted as the hot new feature for InDesign CS5 , giving the traditionally print - focused software the ability to export animated Flash content for web and on - screen presentations .
Along with Flash CS5 ‚Äôs ability to now export iPhone applications ( or not ) , this is clearly one of the most unexpected and controversial features announced .
‚Äú I do n‚Äôt want Flash in InDesign .
I want a fast , working InDesign , ‚Äù complains UK graphic designer Craig Burgess on Twitter .
Likely aimed as a way to easily create future iPad - like content ( such as the Adobe - powered Wired Magazine concept ) , it comes at a time when Flash is struggling to stay relevant among popularity of devices that do not support Flash ‚Äî namely the iPad .
One thing I ‚Äôm excited about is Adobe ‚Äôs BrowserLab , an easy way for web designers to quickly preview webpages on a variety of browsers and platforms through a web interface .
Surely that beats booting up a copy of Windows .
For many of us , however , it was the suite ‚Äôs new look that really stole the show .
Eagle - eyed viewers were quick to pick apart the new branding .
‚Äú What the hell are these CS5 icons supposed to look like ? ‚Äù questioned one designer .
I admit , my first thoughts were not too far off ‚Äî
‚Äú Is it supposed to be a book ? ‚Äù
So , we asked Adobe ‚Äôs desktop brand team to shed some light on the matter .
Evolution of a desktop brand
Since launching in the late 1980s , Adobe ‚Äôs flagship desktop brands ‚Äî Photoshop and Illustrator ‚Äî lived for years without much change .
Version after version , we all knew Illustrator for its digital interpretation of Botticelli ‚Äôs Venus and Photoshop for its iconic framed eyeball ( briefly turning to starfish and feathers , respectively , for CS and CS2 ) .
This all changed in 2005 , however , when Adobe and Macromedia merged into one giant multimedia empire .
Adobe ‚Äôs brand team was faced with a challenge :
How do you merge dozens of product offerings from two different companies into one cohesive system ?
How can Macromedia Flash become Adobe Flash ?
The Adobe Creative Suite / Macromedia Studio mashup solution could n‚Äôt work forever .
Under the lead of in - house designer Ryan Hicks , a new system was born with the release of Creative Suite 3 .
Using color as a primary reference point , the Adobe brand team adopted a minimalistic two - letter mnemonic to create a consistent look across its newly expanded family of products .
With the introduction of the new icons , Flash could finally feel at home sitting next to Photoshop in the dock .
Not everyone was happy when the new look was revealed in 2007 , however .
Initial reaction among users was , to put it kindly , mixed .
idsgn spoke with Shawn Cheris , lead designer of Adobe ‚Äôs desktop brand team , who recalls : ‚Äú When Adobe launched the new branding system with CS3 , people hated it .
I hated it .
But once they had them on their desktop and realized how much more functional they were , people went 100 % the other way .
Now you can buy CS pillows and the like . ‚Äù
Despite the initial reaction , the icons lived on with the release of CS4 ‚Äî swapping the white lettering for translucent black .
With the introduction of CS5 , Adobe wanted to present a distinct shift .
Cheris explains in Adobe ‚Äôs XD blog :
When we began thinking about what we wanted to do for CS5 , the one thing we all agreed on was that we wanted to bring back a sense of joy to the brand work .
Our goal was to move beyond the monolithic expression of of the CS3 and CS4 systems and create a more dynamic language .
We wanted to bring back inspirational and aspirational artistic qualities to the identity system while leveraging the successful patterns we ‚Äôve established with CS3 and CS4 .
Everyone missed the more whimsical imagery that was such a big part of Adobe ‚Äôs heritage and wanted to surprise and inspire our users and give them something new .
Creating a splash
Looking at other large - scale design problems , Adobe ‚Äôs CS5 brand team found particular inspiration in Otl Aicher ‚Äôs systematic approach to iconography for the 1972 Munich Olympics .
Built on an isometric grid system , Aicher ‚Äôs icons were individually unique while maintaining consistency across the entire set .
An ideal solution for a company that sells an ever - growing number of applications .
An isometric grid similar to Aicher ‚Äôs became the foundation of our new visual system .
If nothing else , it guaranteed that we were n‚Äôt going to be working with rectilinear elements anymore .
Using the grid , we started to form shapes that could be used as a template for creating more complex forms .
These shapes became the basis for our new system ‚Äî our kit of parts .
From the grid , the brand team developed a set of building blocks used to create splash screens for the suite .
Blocks were pieced together in sets of five to create a unique shape for each product .
‚Äú After a lot of experimentation , we discovered that five pieces would give the shapes exactly the right amount of complexity .
That this was also the fifth CS release was merely a happy coincidence , ‚Äù explains Cheris in a follow - up blog post .
The final splash screen design returns to the color system we ‚Äôve grown to love since the CS3 redesign , with a small twist .
To help increase visual differentiation between product lines in CS5 , a subtle two - color design has been introduced .
Updating the icon system
The icons ‚Äô folded ‚Äò book - like ‚Äô planes were inspired by the visual language created in the splash screens , using the same metallic sheen and translucency .
We asked Cheris what he thought about the mixed reaction which , in particular , surrounded the icons :
I ‚Äôve been monitoring the mixed reaction with some amusement .
The reaction to the splash screens had been overwhelming and positive , but people are n‚Äôt sure what to make of the icons , which is n‚Äôt atypical ‚Ä¶
We ‚Äôve had them on our desktop for the better part of a year and most of the designers around here have come to appreciate them .
They ‚Äôve got a slight bit of translucency , and when they ‚Äôre all lined up in the dock they look great .
Plus , without the splash screens , they seem a bit odd .
Why 3D ?
Is that a book ?
I think when people see the whole system and live with it , they might think differently .
Seeing how it all fits together , I have to agree it does make more sense .
Not revolutionary , or even much of a jump from previous versions , it is a safe and subtle improvement .
As with CS3 and CS4 , the new icons use the proprietary typeface ‚Äò Clean , ‚Äô designed by Robert Slimbach .
Interestingly , while the typeface first saw usage on the Creative Suite icons , Adobe announced last year it has adopted Clean as its new corporate typeface .
Clean replaces the popular Minion and Myriad typefaces , which were also designed by Slimbach for Adobe ( Myriad co-designed with Carol Twombly ) .
Adobe has no plans to make Clean available for licensing , unlike Myriad which is now the face for countless other companies , from Apple to Walmart .
‚Äú What he produced is as classic as all his other designs , but with an uncharacteristic blend of contemporary touches for on - screen rendering and a more " progressive " feel ‚Ä¶
Most sans - serif families are n‚Äôt really designed for use in extended text , but Robert is a master at text and tuned the face to shine in these conditions .
Text families require a subtle balance of harmony , rhythm and individuality , and Adobe Clean handles these remarkably well . ‚Äù
‚Äî David Lemon , Senior Manager , Type Development at Adobe
Wrapping it up
Adobe turned to San Francisco branding agency Tolleson Design to create the packaging for CS5 .
The company was also responsible for the CS4 packaging , although side - by - side , I never would have guessed :
If anything requires a ‚Äú What the hell ? ‚Äù this is it .
Tolleson had a knock - out with its minimalist CS4 packaging ( left ) , and even with every other CS5 box ( below ) .
But why does the Master Collection ( Adobe ‚Äôs cr√®me de la cr√®me , valued at $ 2,600 USD ) receive the most juvenile design in the bunch ?
We are back in Oz here , with a number 5 made out of ‚Ä¶ pink doll houses ?
It ‚Äôs probably best we just move on to the individual titles .
Much like the isometric splash screens created by Cheris and the brand team at Adobe , the individual titles ( above ) and Premium suites ( below ) fit together like family , while still being unique enough to each hold their own .
In fact , he explains Tolleson used the splash screens as inspiration for their design :
We met with them [ Tolleson Design ] early on and throughout the process , and shared with them what we were doing , particularly with the splash screens .
They took that as a point of inspiration and did some amazing work .
I really love their take on the folding planes / angular language of the splash screens .
We ‚Äôre planning more collaboration for CS6 and will be starting to spitball on that in the next few months .
The branding work for CS5 was conceived and executed by Ryan Hicks ( lead ) , Shawn Cheris , and Dave Nelson at Adobe .
I ‚Äôd like to personally thank the team for taking the time to share their thoughts and imagery .
For more , watch Tolleson Design and the Adobe team talk about the CS5 Experience on Adobe ‚Äôs XD blog INSPIRE , and do n‚Äôt miss Cheris ‚Äô blog posts for a deeper look .
Adobe Creative Suite 5 will be released mid-May , and I ‚Äôll happily replace my dock icons when the time comes .
Leo Paz reports from an anti-war rally in Los Angeles supported by Iraq Veterans Against the War .
by Leo Paz
15 Apr 2010 | Truthout
Seven years on after the second US invasion of Iraq , the Americans continue slaughtering civilians , now in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Recently , the video of the massacre of 12 - 15 Iraqis by an US helicopter gunship in 2007 began making the rounds thanks to WikiLeaks.org .
Episodes like what is shown in that video have been denounced by Iraq Veterans Against the War ( I.V.A.W. ) for years now .
On March 20 , thousands of people marched on the streets of Los Angeles to denounce the criminal U.S. wars around the world .
Among the protesters , many Iraq military vets with I.V.A.W. came out to tell their stories of the carnage of US wars .
Marine Cpl. Cameron Wood , from Minnesota , was part of a tank unit in the invasion in 2003 and in the siege of Fallujah in 2004 .
He talked about how U.S. Army officers gave orders to fire on any Iraqi , opposing the invasion or not .
‚Äú As part of the invasion there would be a lot of times when they would have what they called a free - fire zone when we were told to shoot at anybody that we saw , whether they were shooting at us or not , they were supposed to be considered enemies because apparently they had been told to go inside , ‚Äù Wood said .
Wood explained how the so - called rules of engagement came about .
‚Äú On my second deployment , because a lot of incidents had happened and they were trying to keep things under wraps they were trying to implement what they called rules of engagement , where if you see someone firing at you or what you think is a gun then we engaged them , ‚Äù Wood said .
Corporal
Wood told about firing at buses and cars at checkpoints .
He also spoke of the nightmares soldiers have to live with after shooting on Iraqi civilians .
‚Äú What I experienced was seeing civilians who had been fired upon in vehicles , setting up checkpoints and you see vehicles approaching , and vehicles do n‚Äôt stop and so we ‚Äôd fire on vehicles , we fired on buses , buses full of civilians ‚Ä¶ part of the reason that happened is because you ‚Äôre sending teenagers to go fight in a war , they ‚Äôre scared and they indiscriminately fired their weapons .. so seeing the aftermath of that ‚Ä¶ those are the kind of images you carry with you and haunt you , it ‚Äôs those situations that cause post traumatic stress . ‚Äù
Iraqi casualties of war are not officially counted by the Pentagon .
According to British N.G.O. Iraq Body
Count there have been over 104,000 documented war - related Iraqi deaths .
Since 2003 , over 4,300 soldiers have died in the US war in Iraq .

I ‚Äôm really digging Wonka ‚Äôs new look and commercials .
They take advantage of candy ‚Äôs inventiveness and imaginative ways that kids ( and adults ) look at it .
One of their new candies is Puckerooms Sour Gummy Candy .
They ‚Äôre sour gummies ( unlike the Sluggles , which are sweet gummies ) in mushroom shapes and three different flavors .
The new Wonka ‚Äôs Edible Garden are made with natural ingredients , including fruit juice and no artificial colorings or flavorings .
( But of course they ‚Äôre gummis and are not vegetarian since they use gelatin ... and in this case cochineal color , too . )
There are three flavors and three different shapes ( though the shapes are applied to all the flavors ) :
Cherry - as you can see from the photo , I found a grape & cherry combo , but for the most part the cherry ones were single flavored .
It ‚Äôs a tart cherry with a black cherry darkness beneath but a lingering sour .
It got my glands a‚Äôtinglin‚Äô .
Grape - it ‚Äôs just so fun for me to have grape gummis , I have a hard time focusing on these for the review .
The grape flavor is much like concord grape jam with Pixy Stix poured over it .
( Come on , if you ‚Äôd thought of it as a kid , you would have loved it ! )
Lemon / Orange - I loved the look of these , the orange was always on the top , making the stem lemon .
The flavors were a good blend of citrus zest and of course a sour punch that lasted beyond the grainy coating and permeated the soft gummi .
The lemon and orange were distinct but blended well .
The sourness is n‚Äôt blisteringly strong , in fact , I found them barely more tart than the Sluggles , just more consistently tangy from start to finish .
I like the option of really potent gummis made without artificial flavors & colors , so these are real winners .
I saw them at Target over the weekend for $ 1.59 for a 6.5 ounce bag , so it ‚Äôs not like parents need to compromise here - the kids get a mainstream treat without going to a special store .
( Of course that does n‚Äôt mean adults ca n‚Äôt enjoy them . )
UPDATE 11/2/2010 :
It appears that many folks shared their phallic views with Nestle and they updated both the package and the shapes of the actual candy .
The package is mostly green instead of purple .
The Wonka name is minimized and the name of the candy is more focused on Sour Puckerooms Gummies where it was originally just called Puckerooms with a descriptive logline of sour gummy candy below that .
I do like the typography on the word Puckerooms better on the new version .
The new shapes are such a compromise from the earlier , well defined mushrooms that they ‚Äôre mere shadows of the shapes they once were .
There are really only two shapes , the pointier one is now gone .
There are two slightly different rounded ones with wide round caps and wide bases and then the narrower stemmed one with a wide cap .
On the package they look distinctive .
In real life they ‚Äôre
So , there you go .
Wonka is receptive to your ideas .

Former CIA asset Allawi touted as next Iraqi prime minister
By James Cogan
29 March 2010
The result of the March 7 Iraq election has given the largest bloc of seats in the 325 - member parliament to the Sunni - based and ostensibly secular Iraqiya coalition headed by Iyad Allawi , a former CIA asset and one - time US - installed prime minister .
With just 91 legislators , however , Allawi needs to strike agreements with other factions to obtain the necessary 163 - seat majority .
Frantic negotiations and deal - making are underway .
Nouri al - Maliki , the current prime minister , and his largely Shiite - based State of Law coalition , which won 89 seats and is the second - largest bloc in the parliament , have declared the result illegitimate and are demanding a manual vote recount .
Over the weekend , State of Law representatives nevertheless took part in talks in Iran with leaders of the Shiite fundamentalist Iraqi National Alliance ( INA ) , which won 70 seats .
The INA is dominated by the Sadrist movement loyal to cleric Moqtada al - Sadr and the Iranian - linked Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq ( ISCI ) .
With the support of a handful of other parliamentarians , the two Shiite factions would have a majority and could prevent Allawi coming to power .
The Obama administration has rejected Maliki ‚Äôs accusations , sending a clear signal that it welcomes Allawi ‚Äôs success and wants him as prime minister .
A joint statement by US ambassador Christopher Hill and military commander General Raymond Odierno declared there was ‚Äú no evidence of widespread or serious fraud ‚Äù .
The UN envoy Ad Melkert declared the result was ‚Äú credible ‚Äù and that a recount was ‚Äú difficult because of time ‚Äù .
The governments of Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia publicly congratulated Allawi .
Under conditions in which a US war with Iran is being openly discussed , Washington does not want the next government in Baghdad to once again be dominated by Iraqi Shiite parties that have longstanding relations with the Iranian regime .
Allawi , by contrast , is thoroughly steeped in the hostility of the region ‚Äôs pro-US Arab ruling elites to Iranian influence in the Middle East .
To assemble a parliamentary majority without either of the Shiite factions , Allawi would have to do deals with virtually every other faction .
Small Sunni , ethnic Turkmen and Christian - based parties have 18 seats and are likely to support him .
He would need to make a deal , however , with the Kurdish parties from the autonomous Kurdish Regional Government ( KRG ) in the north .
The Kurdish Alliance of the ruling parties in the KRG won 43 seats .
Two Kurdish oppositional movements , Gorran and the Kurdish Islamic Party , gained 14 seats .
Any agreement between Iraqiya and the Kurdish factions is fraught with difficulties .
During the election , Allawi opposed Kurdish ambitions for greater control over areas of northern Iraq .
Some of his supporters virulently reject the Kurdish demand that the oil - rich province of Kirkuk be incorporated into the KRG .
Iraqiya won half the seats in Kirkuk , overwhelmingly from the votes of the province ‚Äôs ethnic Arab and Turkmen population .
The international media has speculated on the possibility that the Sadrist movement , which won 38 of the INA ‚Äôs 70 seats , could split from ISCI and support Allawi .
Leading Sadrists made statements during the election that their priority was to ensure that Maliki did not become prime minister again .
Talks have reportedly taken place between Allawi and representatives of Moqtada al - Sadr .
While no US figure has openly said so , Washington ‚Äôs preferred outcome would most likely be an agreement between Allawi and Maliki to form a government based on their two coalitions .
Maliki is a Shiite fundamentalist and sympathetic to Iran but as prime minister he loyally served US interests during the bloodiest fighting of the Iraq war from 2006 to 2008 .
He presided over the destruction of Shiite militias in Basra , Amara and Baghdad that continued to resist the US military .
In 2009 , Maliki ‚Äôs Da‚Äôwa Party broke with ISCI and formed State of Law as a Shiite rival to the INA .
He derives his main support from the US - created and trained army , police apparatus and government bureaucracy , which are dependent on the continued US control over Iraq .
His coalition won most of its vote in Baghdad and the Shiite - populated south .
Allawi ‚Äôs base is among the Sunni population and secular Shiites .
Iraqiya won the bulk of its seats in Baghdad and the Sunni-majority provinces of central and western Iraq .
The Sunni elite rallied behind him , despite the fact that as interim prime minister in 2004 , Allawi presided over the US destruction of the Sunni city of Fallujah and the general repression of resistance throughout Sunni- populated areas .
Under the US occupation , the Sunni political establishment that had power under the Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein has been sidelined .
They view Allawi as their instrument to restore their privileges .
A leading Sunni cleric , Sheik Mahmoud al - Sumaidi , bluntly told the British Guardian : ‚Äú This is politics and politics is a dirty art .
The Sunni scholars have forgiven him for Fallujah and we support him being prime minister . ‚Äù
At this stage , Maliki ‚Äôs coalition is publicly stating that it will not make a deal with Allawi .
Behind - the - scenes , however , every effort will be made by the US embassy and military command to pressure the Iraqi factions into making some form of agreement as soon as possible ‚Äî unlike after the December 2005 election when it took close to six months to form a government .
From the standpoint of US imperialism , the next Iraqi government , whether Allawi , Maliki or some other figure heads it , has three primary responsibilities apart from aligning with Washington against Iran .
* It will have to sign a new agreement with the United States by the end of 2011 ‚Äî the date the current Status of Forces Agreement expires ‚Äî to allow the US military indefinite use of air bases that have been constructed at places like Balad , Al Asad and Tallil .
* It must implement laws that sanction the privatisation of Iraq ‚Äôs oil industry and give foreign corporations greater access and control over the country ‚Äôs vast untapped reserves of oil and natural gas .
The current legislation is widely regarded by the energy transnationals as inadequate as it does not allow for the production - sharing agreement model that delivers them the greater profits .
* As the bulk of American troops withdraw over the next 18 months , the Iraqi government will be required to suppress the ongoing opposition among the Iraqi working class and rural poor to poverty , lack of services , the plunder of the country ‚Äôs resources and an ongoing US military presence .
At the same time , the puppet government in Baghdad will have to try and hold the country together .
In the north , the Kurdish elite is growing increasingly bitter over its inability to get control of Kirkuk and the northern oil fields , which was its main motive for supporting the US invasion in 2003 .
Sections of the Shiite establishment linked with the religious parties are deeply hostile to any substantial Sunni influence over the government .
If the Sunni elites are sidelined again , however , they could resume their sponsorship of widespread armed resistance .
Incidents over the past several days underscore the ever - present political , ethnic and sectarian rivalries created by the US occupation .
A bombing on Friday at a market in Baquaba , the main city in the province of Diyala , killed 59 people and wounded 73 .
The home of an Iraqiya - linked leader was bombed on Sunday in the town of Qaim , in Anbar province , leaving five dead and 18 injured .
In Baghdad , a sniper shot dead an Iraqiya supporter .
Even more provocatively , security forces loyal to Maliki arrested four Iraqiya candidates in Diyala province on charges of involvement in ‚Äú terrorism ‚Äù , while the Shiite - dominated Justice and Accountability Commission announced that it will attempt to prevent some elected candidates taking their seats because of past links to Saddam Hussein ‚Äôs Baath Party .
The candidates who were banned as ‚Äú Baathists ‚Äù before the election were overwhelmingly aligned with Iraqiya or other parties based among Sunnis or secular Shiites .

This Chelsea restaurant has gone from brasserie to brassiere .
Chef Daniel Angerer is letting diners at Klee Brasserie munch on cheese made from his wife ‚Äôs breast milk .
‚Äú It tastes like cow ‚Äôs - milk cheese , kind of sweet , ‚Äù he told The Post .
The flavor depends on what the cheese is served with ‚Äî
Angerer recommends a Riesling ‚Äî and ‚Äú what the mother eats , ‚Äù said Angerer , who once bested Bobby Flay on TV‚Äôs ‚Äú Iron Chef . ‚Äù
Breast milk does n‚Äôt curdle well due to its low protein content , so a little moo juice has to be added to round out the texture , Angerer said .
After blogging about his efforts with the human cheese , customers started demanding a sample , he said .
‚Äú The phone was ringing off the hook , ‚Äù the chef said .
‚Äú So I prepared a little canap√© of breast - milk cheese with figs and Hungarian pepper . ‚Äù
The response has been generally positive from those who ‚Äôve tried the cheese , although many customers are too squeamish to attempt it .
‚Äú I think a lot of the criticism has to do with the combination of sex and cheese , but . . . the breast is there to make food , ‚Äù said Lori Mason , the chef ‚Äôs wife .
Since the restaurant began offering customers a taste , Mason has been inundated with creepy queries , she said .
‚Äú Some people who clearly have issues have . . . e-mailed me saying , ‚Äò I was n‚Äôt breast - fed as a child , so can I taste your breast milk ? ‚Äô ‚Äù she said .
Mason politely declines the offer .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm not here to walk people through their psychological problems , ‚Äù she said .
That said , Mason is now prodding her husband to make gelato .
After inquiries from The Post , health bigs said yesterday that even though department codes do not explicitly forbid the practice , they have advised Angerer to refrain from sharing his wife ‚Äôs milk with the world .
‚Äú The restaurant knows that cheese made from breast milk is not for public consumption , whether sold or given away , ‚Äù a spokeswoman for the city Department of Health said .

INTRODUCTION
My last few posts have described a new method for quantifying the average Urban Heat Island ( UHI ) warming effect as a function of population density , using thousands of pairs of temperature measuring stations within 150 km of each other .
The results supported previous work which had shown that UHI warming increases logarithmically with population , with the greatest rate of warming occurring at the lowest population densities as population density increases .
But how does this help us determine whether global warming trends have been spuriously inflated by such effects remaining in the leading surface temperature datasets , like those produced by Phil Jones ( CRU ) and Jim Hansen ( NASA / GISS ) ?
While my quantifying the UHI effect is an interesting exercise , the existence of such an effect spatially ( with distance between stations ) does not necessarily prove that there has been a spurious warming in the thermometer measurements at those stations over time .
The reason why it does n‚Äôt is that , to the extent that the population density of each thermometer site does not change over time , then various levels of UHI contamination at different thermometer sites would probably have little influence on long - term temperature trends .
Urbanized locations would indeed be warmer on average , but ‚Äú global warming ‚Äù would affect them in about the same way as the more rural locations .
This hypothetical situation seems unlikely , though , since population does indeed increase over time .
If we had sufficient truly - rural stations to rely on , we could just throw all the other UHI - contaminated data away .
Unfortunately , there are very few long - term records from thermometers that have not experienced some sort of change in their exposure ‚Ä¶usually the addition of manmade structures and surfaces that lead to spurious warming .
Thus , we are forced to use data from sites with at least some level of UHI contamination .
So the question becomes , how does one adjust for such effects ?
As the provider of the officially - blessed GHCN temperature dataset that both Hansen and Jones depend upon , NOAA has chosen a rather painstaking approach where the long - term temperature records from individual thermometer sites have undergone homogeneity ‚Äú corrections ‚Äù to their data , mainly based upon ( presumably spurious ) abrupt temperature changes over time .
The coming and going of some stations over the years further complicates the construction of temperature records back 100 years or more .
All of these problems ( among others ) have led to a hodgepodge of complex adjustments .
A SIMPLER TECHNIQUE TO LOOK FOR SPURIOUS WARMING
I like simplicity of analysis ‚Äî whenever possible , anyway .
Complexity in data analysis should only be added when it is required to elucidate something that is not obvious from a simpler analysis .
And it turns out that a simple analysis of publicly available raw ( not adjusted ) temperature data from NOAA / NESDIS NOAA / NCDC , combined with high - resolution population density data for those temperature monitoring sites , shows clear evidence of UHI warming contaminating the GHCN data for the United States .
I will restrict the analysis to 1973 and later since ( 1 ) this is the primary period of warming allegedly due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions ; ( 2 ) the period having the largest number of monitoring sites has been since 1973 ; and ( 3 ) a relatively short 37 - year record maximizes the number of continuously operating stations , avoiding the need to handle transitions as older stations stop operating and newer ones are added .
Similar to my previous posts , for each U.S. station I average together four temperature measurements per day ( 00 , 06 , 12 , and 18 UTC ) to get a daily average temperature ( GHCN uses daily max / min data ) .
There must be at least 20 days of such data for a monthly average to be computed .
I then include only those stations having at least 90 % complete monthly data from 1973 through 2009 .
Annual cycles in temperature and anomalies are computed from each station separately .
I then compute multi-station average anomalies in 5 √ó5 deg .
latitude / longitude boxes , and then compare the temperature trends for the represented regions to those in the CRUTem3 ( Phil Jones ‚Äô ) dataset for the same regions .
But to determine whether the CRUTem3 dataset has any spurious trends , I further divide my averages into 4 population density classes : 0 to 25 ; 25 to 100 ; 100 to 400 ; and greater than 400 persons per sq. km .
The population density data is at a nominal 1 km resolution , available for 1990 and 2000 ‚Ä¶ I use the 2000 data .
All of these restrictions then result in thirteen 24 to 26 5 - deg grid boxes over the U.S. having all population classes represented over the 37 - year period of record .
In comparison , the entire U.S. covers about 31 40 grid boxes in the CRUTem3 dataset .
While the following results are therefore for a regional subset ( at least 60 % ) of the U.S. , we will see that the CRUTem3 temperature variations for the entire U.S. do not change substantially when all 31 40 grids are included in the CRUTem3 averaging .
EVIDENCE OF A LARGE SPURIOUS WARMING TREND IN THE U.S. GHCN DATA
The following chart shows yearly area- averaged temperature anomalies from 1973 through 2009 for the 13 24 to 26 5 - deg.
grid squares over the U.S. having all four population classes represented ( as well as a CRUTem3 average temperature measurement ) .
All anomalies have been recomputed relative to the 30 - year period , 1973 - 2002 .
The heavy red line is from the CRUTem3 dataset , and so might be considered one of the ‚Äú official ‚Äù estimates .
The heavy blue curve is the lowest population class .
( The other 3 population classes clutter the figure too much to show , but we will soon see those results in a more useful form . )
Significantly , the warming trend in the lowest population class is only 47 % of the CRUTem3 trend , a factor of two difference .
Also interesting is that in the CRUTem3 data , 1998 and 2006 would be the two warmest years during this period of record .
But in the lowest population class data , the two warmest years are 1987 and 1990 .
When the CRUTem3 data for the whole U.S. are analyzed ( the lighter red line ) the two warmest years are swapped , 2006 is 1st and then 1998 2nd .
From looking at the warmest years in the CRUTem3 data , one gets the impression that each new high - temperature year supersedes the previous one in intensity .
But the low - population stations show just the opposite : the intensity of the warmest years is actually decreasing over time .
To get a better idea of how the calculated warming trend depends upon population density for all 4 classes , the following graph shows ‚Äì just like the spatial UHI effect on temperatures I have previously reported on ‚Äì that the warming trend goes down nonlinearly as population density of the stations decrease .
In fact , extrapolation of these results to zero population density might produce little warming at all !
This is a very significant result .
It suggests the possibility that there has been essentially no warming in the U.S. since the 1970s .
Also , note that the highest population class actually exhibits slightly more warming than that seen in the CRUTem3 dataset .
This provides additional confidence that the effects demonstrated here are real .
Finally , the next graph shows the difference between the lowest population density class results seen in the first graph above .
This provides a better idea of which years contribute to the large difference in warming trends .
Taken together , I believe these results provide powerful and direct evidence that the GHCN data still has a substantial spurious warming component , at least for the period ( since 1973 ) and region ( U.S. ) addressed here .
There is a clear need for new , independent analyses of the global temperature data ‚Ä¶ the raw data , that is .
As I have mentioned before , we need independent groups doing new and independent global temperature analyses ‚Äî not international committees of Nobel laureates passing down opinions on tablets of stone .
But , as always , the analysis presented above is meant more for stimulating thought and discussion , and does not equal a peer - reviewed paper .
Caveat emptor .
Last weekend , I had The Conversation for the 3,897th time ‚Äì and this time , it took place in central London just two roads away from the hospital where I was born .
As usual , it went like this :
Stranger :
Where are you from ?
[ Translation :
You look a bit brown .
Why are you brown ? ]
Me : London .
Stranger :
No , where are you really from ?
[ Translation :
You are clearly telling me untruths .
Brown people do not come from London . ]
Me : London .
Stranger ( exasperated ) : No , where are your parents from ?
[ Translation :
Now you 're just being obtuse . ]
Me : Africa and America .
Stranger ( confused ) : Erm ‚Ä¶ so where are your family from , like , back in the day ?
[ Translation : People who come from Africa and America do not look like you . ]
Me : Iran , India , Africa , America and England .
Stranger ( relieved ) : India and Iran !
Do you ever go back ?
At this point , I have to explain that it 's hard to go back to somewhere you have never been .
I 've lived in London since I was a zygote , have a London accent and do n't speak any languages except English ‚Äì yet just because I 'm cashew - coloured , I 'm often questioned about my heritage .
Over the last five years , I 've been asked : " What 's your caste ? " ( I have n't broken any bones ) ; " Do you go to temple ? " ( only on my way to Embankment ) ; and " Do you need special food ? " ( as though the answer 's going to be : " Yes , St Peter is n't going to let me in if I 've munched on a bit of dead pig / cow / giraffe " ) .
It 's not that I 'm embarrassed about my ethnic background .
I do n't think about it much , though it 's good for jokes ( " I 'm half Iranian , half American ‚Äì so basically , I hate myself " ) .
But some people seem to want me to think about it .
" Why do n't you visit Bombay ? " they enthuse .
" You 'd love it . "
They may be right , but have yet to explain to me why I 'd love it more than Tokyo , or Guatemala , or any of the other places I have n't yet been .
It 's an odd misconception that you should somehow feel connected to a far - flung country because your ancestors lived there centuries ago , even if your entire life has been spent morris dancing in Loughborough .
It 's not that I think the questioners are all differently faced versions of Nick Griffin , either .
I do n't ‚Äì they 're probably just curious ( except perhaps for the bloke who made a constipated noise when I told him my Dad was white ) .
People with a different appearance often seem more interesting than those who look everyday , and questioners are clearly hoping for a more satisfying response than the mundane " Right here " .
When they do n't receive one , they probe .
So my reluctance to enter The Conversation is n't due to shame or to fear of any dubious ulterior motives .
It 's partly down to exasperation at people thinking I 'm less British than them because I 'm brown ; but it 's mainly down to extreme boredom .
The rundown of my convoluted four - continent - spanning genealogy takes ages unless I lie , and I 've started to deliver it in a funereal voice more monotonous than Tiger Woods 's public apology .
Luckily , I 've come up with a solution ( one that could work for anyone in this situation , though you 'll have to write your own version ) .
I 'm going to print out large business cards , and the next time anyone tries to initiate The Conversation and does n't accept " London " as the answer , I shall furnish them with the following :
" Hello !
You may be surprised to learn that I have been asked this question before .
Never fear : you shall have your explanation shortly .
( Would you like to buy a TV by the way ?
I have one for sale ; 24in screen , Samsung , five years old .
Bit flickery , to be honest . )
Right , are you sitting comfortably ?
Armchair ?
Cup of tea ?
Eccles cake ?
Then here goes :
My maternal ancestors are Parsi Zoroastrians ( I 'm not making this up ) and hail from sunny Iran , currently home to uranium obsessives .
Between AD700 and AD1000 the Parsis left Persia , as it was then called ( I do n't know the precise date , they did n't leave a note ) , and travelled to India .
They stayed there for around a thousand years before getting a bit bored again ( are you bored yet ?
I am , but then I 'm quite familiar with this story ) and upping sticks for East Africa in the early 1900s .
My grandad was a builder , though later he imported unfashionable jumpers from Nairobi featuring large pictures of sheep .
They were the bane of my life in the playground , I can tell you .
In 1966 , lured by the fine climate and that lovely Enoch Powell , my mother 's family moved to Britain and have been here ever since .
They speak English and everything .
Sadly I can't say the same for my father 's family , who are all white Americans and live in the States .
He moved here in 1970 and met my mother in London in 1978 , though declined to apply for British citizenship .
Do you know , this means I 'm allowed to vote in US elections even though I 've never been there ?
It sounds glamorous , but in 2008 I ended up voting for Barack Obama by fax in Printax Stationers in Clapham , which was n't very exciting .
So , that 's the answer you were after .
But me ?
I 'm from London . "

Advertisement Legislation to tackle internet piracy , including bans for illegal file - sharers , has been passed by the Lords .
The Digital Economy Bill is now expected to be rushed through the Commons before the general election .
Peers had earlier rejected a bid by ministers to include wide - ranging powers over future online piracy law .
But despite criticism , the government said it was still committed to giving courts the power to block websites which are infringing copyright .
The bill , put forward by Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , has been welcomed by the music industry because it includes plans to suspend the internet accounts of people who persistently download material illegally .
But firms such as British Telecom , Google and Facebook say that would be unfair and illegal file - sharers should be fined instead of cut off .
Earlier this month , peers defeated the government when they rejected a clause giving ministers the power to change laws on online copyright in future without the need for further legislation .
' Unintended consequences '
But their chosen replacement - a measure allowing courts to use injunctions to force internet service providers ( ISPs ) to block certain websites - also prompted criticism from companies , consumer rights campaigners and academics .
They argued it would lead to " blocking based on accusation rather than a court injunction " and could shut down sites like Google and YouTube .
Liberal Democrat media spokesman Lord Clement - Jones , who led the moves for the replacement clause , offered " clarifications and improvements " during the bill 's third reading on Monday evening .
We are calling for massive campaign of citizens to demand that their MPs debate this dangerous bill
Jim Killock
Open Rights Group
He did not , however , put them to the vote .
Instead , junior business minister Lord Young of Norwood Green said the Lib Dem amendment was incompatible with the EU Technical Standards Directive .
He said it would " not be capable of being enforced " and could lead to " unforeseen and unintended consequences " .
But Lord Young told peers : " It is our intention to try to bring forward , as the bill moves to the Commons , a clause that would seek to ultimately achieve the same effect . "
This would include a power for the secretary of state " to bring forward regulations to achieve the desired effect of site blocking " , he added .
And it would allow for " proper consultation and consideration of the evidence for the need and the proportionality of the measure " .
Lord Young said his offer was a " sincere and constructive commitment " and he had " tried to address the genuine concerns that have been expressed " .
Lord Clement - Jones , while warning of " many a slip between cup and lip " , agreed to wait for the government 's amendment .
Amendment wording Jim Killock , executive director of the Open Rights Group , said Lord Mandelson was " preparing to rush through this draconian legislation without democratic debate " .
" We are calling for massive campaign of citizens to demand that their MPs debate this dangerous bill . "
Last week , it emerged that the wording of the Lib Dem amendment was almost identical to a draft written by the BPI , which lobbies on behalf of the British music industry .
The BPI said opposition parties " saw it as a good framework for what they wanted to put down " .
Chief executive Geoff Taylor welcomed the bill 's passing , adding : " It is vital for the future of the UK 's creative sector that the Digital Economy Bill is adopted . "
But Andrew Robinson , from Pirate Party UK , which campaigns on the issue , said : " The public will not respect a law that was quite literally written by the record industry , for the record industry .
" As it stands , the bill is fatally flawed , and fundamentally unjust . "

European discount giant Ryanair is pushing ahead with plans to charge passengers to use the lavatories , news that comes just a day after U.S. low - cost carrier Spirit said it would charge for overhead bin space .
The Daily Mail of London writes " no - frills [ Ryanair ] is working with Boeing to redesign the cabin and develop coin-operated toilets on 168 of its planes .
Not content with charging passengers for use of the facilities , the airline is also looking at reducing the number of toilets on board , leaving just one available cubicle for up to 189 passengers . "
How much will it cost you ?
The airline plans to charge either ÔøΩ 1 or ÔøΩ1 on flights of an hour or less , according to ATW Online .
That works about to between $ 1.30 and $ 1.55 for the privilege of using the toilet .
A Ryanair official tells the Mail the carrier hopes the toilet fee will change customers ' habits .
" By charging for the toilets we are hoping to change passenger behavior so that they use the bathroom before or after the flight , " Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara tells the paper .
" That will enable us to remove two out of three of the toilets and make way for at least six extra seats . "
Meanwhile , Ryanair is making news with other fees , as well .
The carrier announced this week it would hike its checked - bag fees by about 33 % for the peak summer travel period .
Business Traveller magazine writes Ryanair says it 's making the move to " incentivise all of its passengers to travel light during the peak summer months . "
The BBC adds Ryanair said it would urge its passengers to avoid check - in baggage fees by travelling with carry - on bags only . "

The world ‚Äôs deepest drill is currently being prepped to pierce the Earth ‚Äôs enigmatic mantle .
According to PopSci , the Chikyu research vessel ( off the coast of Japan ) is already capable of retrieving samples at depths of approximately 2,890 feet below the seabed .
PopSci ‚Äôs Rena Marie Pacella explained that the Chikyu was the first mission to study subduction zones , an area between tectonic plates which is frequently identified as the origin of numerous earthquakes .
‚Äú Over the next three years , scientists will tack on at least an extra mile of drill and attempt the most ambitious mission ever : piercing the Earth ‚Äôs mantle , ‚Äù wrote Pacella .
‚Äú There , scientists expect to find the same conditions as those in the early Earth ‚Äî and perhaps the same life - forms that thrived then . ‚Äù
Indeed , engineers are slated to add a higher - tensile - strength steel to build the drill string , which will enable deeper ground penetration at temperatures exceeding 500¬∞F .
‚Äú As the drill bit burrows through sediment and rock , a hose in the drill pipes in a synthetic mud to keep the drill cool and the borehole open under the crushing pressures found at those depths .
‚Äú A narrow barrel with a razor - sharp edge ( think of a very big apple corer ) shoots down and pierces the undrilled layer of earth below .
The 31 - foot - long core samples are [ then ] analyzed for their chemical and magnetic properties , ‚Äù added Pacella .
Supervisors at NASA ‚Äôs prestigious Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) illegally harassed and demoted a high - level computer system administrator for expressing support of intelligent design to co-workers , according to a discrimination lawsuit filed in California Superior Court .
The lawsuit was filed by attorneys on behalf of David Coppedge , an information technology specialist and system administrator on JPL ‚Äôs Cassini mission to Saturn , the most ambitious interplanetary exploration ever launched .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a NASA laboratory managed by the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) where robotic planetary spacecraft , such as the Mars Rovers , are built and operated .
Coppedge was a ‚Äú Team Lead ‚Äù Systems Administrator on the Cassini mission until JPL demoted him for allegedly ‚Äú pushing religion ‚Äù by loaning interested co-workers DVDs supportive of intelligent design .
‚Äú For the offense of offering videos to colleagues , Coppedge faced harassment , an investigation cloaked in secrecy , and a virtual gag order on his discussion of intelligent design , ‚Äù said attorney Casey Luskin of Discovery Institute ‚Äôs Center for Science and Culture .
Luskin serves as a consultant to the Coppedge lawsuit .
‚Äú Coppedge was punished even though supervisors admitted never receiving a single complaint regarding his conversations about intelligent design prior to their investigation , and even though other employees were allowed to express diverse ideological opinions , including attacking intelligent design . ‚Äù
Coppedge is suing JPL and Caltech for religious discrimination , harassment and retaliation ; violation of his free speech rights ; and wrongful demotion .
Coppedge is represented by Los Angeles First Amendment attorney William J. Becker , Jr. , of The Becker Law Firm .
‚Äú Intelligent design is not religion , and nothing in the DVDs that Coppedge shared deals with religion , ‚Äù noted Luskin .
‚Äú Even so , it ‚Äôs unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee based on what they deem is religion . ‚Äù
The case is the latest in a string of free - speech controversies surrounding allegations of public and private institutions punishing scientists and other experts for holding controversial views on evolution .
The California Science Center is currently facing two lawsuits similarly alleging attempts to squelch free - speech rights by a group that contracted to screen a film on intelligent design for the public at the Los Angeles facility .
‚Äú Anyone who thinks that today ‚Äôs culture of science allows an open discussion of evolution is sorely mistaken , ‚Äù said Dr. John G. West , associate director of the Center for Science and Culture .
‚Äú When it comes to intelligent design , private and government - run agencies are suppressing free speech . ‚Äù
Il est l'un des " barons " du Parti socialiste .
Maire de Lyon , pr√©sident de la communaut√© urbaine , s√©nateur , membre du bureau national , √† bient√¥t 63 ans G√©rard Collomb pourrait se contenter de ces mandats .
Inquiet des √©checs successifs des socialistes √† l'√©lection pr√©sidentielle , il veut d√©sormais prendre toute sa place dans les d√©bats du PS national .
Martine Aubry a remport√© un beau succ√®s en obtenant mardi l'unanimit√© au conseil national sur le projet √©conomique et social .
Qu'en pensez - vous ?
C'est un compromis , et on ne va pas casser la baraque maintenant .
Le PS veut appara√Ætre rassembl√© , tant mieux .
Mais si on n'a pas rompu avec le capitalisme en 1981 , c'est que les choses sont un peu plus compliqu√©es que l'√©criture des textes .
L'enjeu n'est pas de rassembler tous les m√©contents mais de faire face aux d√©fis du pays , cette esp√®ce de catastrophe √©conomique qui frappe la France et la voit se d√©sindustrialiser .
Nous avons pr√©sent√© avec mes amis sociaux - r√©formistes , notamment Fran√ßois Rebsamen et Manuel Valls , une contribution non soumise au vote qui explique notre v√©ritable pens√©e .
Et signifier ainsi que nous ne sommes pas dans la m√™me logique .
Pour vous , Martine Aubry ne peut incarner un Parti socialiste moderne ?
Elle a de la personnalit√© , de la volont√© , de la pers√©v√©rance .
Elle fait tr√®s bien le job de premi√®re secr√©taire , mais elle est enferm√©e dans ses alliances infernales avec des gens comme Henri Emmanuelli ou Laurent Fabius .
J'ai envie de participer √† une grande aventure , et je ne confierai √† personne d'autre le soin de d√©fendre mes id√©es .
Je suis du centre gauche , pas √† gauche toute !
Je suis issu de la classe ouvri√®re , et je peux vous dire que son r√™ve n'a jamais √©t√© le Grand Soir , mais simplement de progresser .
Le but ultime de la politique , c'est que les gens voient ce qui a chang√© dans leur vie √† la fin du mandat qu'ils vous ont confi√© .
Serez -vous candidat aux primaires socialistes pour l'√©lection pr√©sidentielle de 2012 ?
Si Dominique Strauss - Kahn revient de Washington assez t√¥t , ce que je souhaite , je le soutiendrai .
Sinon , y a -t - il quelqu'un d'autre pour s'opposer √† ce que je consid√®re comme une d√©rive de la direction actuelle - adopter une ligne maximaliste pour gagner l'√©lection , et ensuite √™tre oblig√© , comme en 1983 , d'adopter un cap plus r√©aliste ?
Si ce n'est pas le cas , j'irai .
Vous avez d√©clar√© vouloir " rassembler les r√©formistes du PS " .
N'√™tes - vous pas marginalis√© aujourd ' hui ?
La plupart de nos √©lus aux r√©gionales sont des sociaux - r√©formistes , et les r√©formistes sont majoritaires au PS .
Mais ils sont divis√©s , et , sous la pression ext√©rieure , n'osent pas dire tout haut qu'il faut , comme le disait Jaur√®s , " partir du r√©el pour aller √† l'id√©al " .
Avez -vous rompu tout contact avec S√©gol√®ne Royal , avec laquelle vous √©tiez alli√© lors du congr√®s de Reims en 2008 ?
Elle a un c√¥t√© madone , Eva Peron ou t√©l√©vang√©liste qui n'est pas trop mon trip .
Elle a pris trop de virages en fonction de l'opinion publique , comme sur la taxe carbone , par exemple .
C'est pourtant un horizon n√©cessaire sous une forme ou sous une autre - c'est mon c√¥t√© √©colo - compatible .
A Lyon , vous √™tes alli√© avec les Verts .
Que pensez - vous du d√©bat entre les responsables de ce parti et ceux d'Europe Ecologie ?
A la diff√©rence des Verts , je crois en la capacit√© de l'esprit humain de r√©soudre les probl√®mes par l'innovation .
Avec sa pens√©e lib√©ralo - libertaire , Daniel Cohn - Bendit a une vision non dogmatique d'une soci√©t√© √©volutive , et sa strat√©gie d'alliances me para√Æt plus int√©ressante que les accords d'appareil envisag√©s par Martine Aubry et C√©cile Duflot .

UPDATE : McDonnell apologizes for excluding slavery from proclamation ; group that pushed for Confederate History Month ‚Äò has ties to white supremacists ‚Äô
Following a public outcry , Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell has apologized for saying that he omitted any mention of slavery from his Confederate History Month proclamation because he wanted to focus on issues that were ‚Äú significant ‚Äù to Virginians .
ADVERTISEMENT
√É¬¢√¢‚Äö ¬¨√Ö‚Äú The proclamation issued by this Office designating April as Confederate History Month contained a major omission , ‚Äù McDonnell said in a statement released Wednesday night .
‚Äú The failure to include any reference to slavery was a mistake , and for that I apologize to any fellow Virginian who has been offended or disappointed .
The abomination of slavery divided our nation , deprived people of their God - given inalienable rights , and led to the Civil War . ‚Äù
Lee Hockstader at the Washington Post opines that , with McDonnell ‚Äôs latest statement , ‚Äú there are now two proclamations ‚Äî one that glorifies the Confederacy , the other that wallows in Virginia√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢ ‚Äû ¬¢s historical guilt .
( In addition to being evil , vicious , etc. , slavery , said the governor in proclamation no .
2 , ‚Äòhas left a stain on the soul of this state and nation ‚Äô ) . ‚Äù
Meanwhile , blogger Blue Texan at FireDogLake reports that the group that lobbied McDonnell ‚Äôs office to reinstate Confederate History Month in Virginia has been tied to the white supremacist movement .
A report at the Washington Post notes that the event was brought back by McDonnell at the insistence of the Sons of Confederate Veterans .
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , ‚Äú SCV leaders have long been tied to segregation and white supremacy . ‚Äù
Blue Texan cites a spring , 2010 , SCV newsletter that declares , ‚Äú [ I ] f Barack Obama should be elected President , he would be extremely anti-white and would demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who were seeking jobs or admission to college and graduate schools . ‚Äù

ORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS BELOW
Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell is being accused of historical revisionism after reinstating the state ‚Äôs controversial Confederate History Month and declaring that the event wo n‚Äôt focus on slavery because the issue is not ‚Äú significant ‚Äù enough in Virginia .
‚Äú There were any number of aspects ‚Äù to the Civil War , McDonnell said , explaining why he left slavery out of the proclamation announcing Confederate History Month .
‚Äú Obviously , it involved slavery .
It involved other issues .
But I focused on the ones I thought were most significant for Virginia . ‚Äù
His comments were published at the Washington Post .

The Post reports that both Virginia ‚Äôs black legislative caucus and the local chapter of the NAACP are upset with McDonnell ‚Äôs move .
‚Äú Governor McDonnell ‚Äôs proclamation was offensive and offered a disturbing revision of the Civil War and the brutal era that followed , ‚Äù state delegate Kenneth Cooper Alexander , head of the Legislative Black Caucus , told the Post .
‚Äú Virginia has worked hard to move beyond the very things for which Governor McDonnell seems nostalgic . ‚Äù

The Virginia NAACP plans to hold an emergency meeting this Saturday to discuss ‚Äú a series of problems it has had with McDonnell since he was sworn into office in January , ‚Äù the Post reports .
McDonnell ‚Äôs assertion that slavery does n‚Äôt qualify as ‚Äú significant ‚Äù ‚Äî at least for Virginians ‚Äî has provoked criticism and more than a little correcting of McDonnell ‚Äôs historical facts .
Patrik Jonsson at the Christian Science Monitor and Robert Mackey at the Huffington Post point out that Virginia was at the epicenter of the battle over slavery .
ADVERTISEMENT
‚Äú This is the state that housed the Confederate government in Richmond and where most of the Civil War , the country ‚Äôs bloodiest campaign , was fought , ‚Äù writes Jonsson .
By leaving out slavery , McDonnell ‚Äôs proclamation ‚Äú ignores the 490,865 African - Americans who were slaves in 1860 Virginia , and whose Confederate heritage was the lash , servitude , and a century of virtual slavery after 1865 , ‚Äù writes Mackey .
Mackey suggests that McDonnell should replace Confederate History Month with a ‚Äú Civil War Heritage Month , ‚Äù which should ‚Äú encourage the study of not just Stonewall Jackson or Robert E. Lee , but George Thomas , the tens of thousands of white and black Union volunteers from Virginia , and let it address the plight of the slaves , the problems of the free black population , and the atrocity of post - Reconstruction civil rights violations in Virginia . ‚Äù
Jonsson suggests that McDonnell ‚Äôs plan could backfire politically .
Confederate History Month ‚Äú is bringing back ideas and symbols that many Americans √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì including many Southerners √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì find offensive and divisive .
It could derail efforts to win favor among Democrats , not to mention Southern blacks , and it could drive a cultural wedge into the Republican Party as it looks for ways to win in November , ‚Äù he writes .

Virginia ‚Äôs Confederate History Month debuted under Governor George Allen , a Republican , in 1997 , causing ‚Äú a national uproar , ‚Äù the Post notes .
Allen ‚Äôs proclamation made no mention of slavery , but his successor , Republican James .
S. Gilmore , added language referencing slavery in his own proclamation .
The month - long historic event was then dropped entirely by two subsequent Democratic governors , and had been absent from Virginia for the past eight years .
Clock Rate Versus Core Count On Core i7-980X
Despite the Core i7-980X 's impressive performance and surprisingly high efficiency , we were disappointed that Intel did n't get more aggressive with Turbo Boost , the feature that increases core clock speeds within a given thermal envelope when more performance is needed .
Fortunately , six - core " Gulftown " can overclock like a champ .
The question is whether manually forcing this extra performance causes a big hit in the CPU 's efficiency or not .
And whether inside or beyond Turbo Boost 's limits , is there a speed setting where the Core i7 -980X displays optimal efficiency ?
That 's what we 're here to find out .
A perfect processor offers more than substantial multi-core performance .
The new Core i7-980X delivers copious alacrity in applications that can take advantage of its six cores ( or as many as 12 logical threads with Hyper - Threading enabled ) .
However , this is n‚Äôt the fastest Intel processor when it comes to raw frequency .
Turbo Boost allows the 3.33 GHz Gulftown to reach 3.60 GHz on a single core , but a $ 196 Core i5 - 66 x offers similar speeds ( and as a result , theoretically comparable single - thread performance ) .
The Core i5 - 670 is even faster at 3.73 GHz and can technically overtake Intel ‚Äôs $ 1,000 six - core flagship when it comes to single - threaded workloads .
Of course , there 's some room for debate here , since the Extreme Edition chip 's 12MB L3 cache can be allocated to a single task .
So too can the Core i5's 4MB cache , but there 's quite a bit of difference there .
Nevertheless , in most single - threaded apps , clock rate is what determines performance .
We wanted to make a handful of alterations and squeeze more performance from of the six - core beast .
Ultimately , Gulftown is a 32 nm processor , just like the Clarkdale - based Core i5s , which have shown amazing overclocking capabilities .
Even with six cores , it should be possible to accelerate the i7-980X up to where it easily beats Intel 's other offerings without consuming excessive power .
Platform : Intel DX58SO
Intel ‚Äôs 5000 BIOS version supports the six - core Gulftown processor and offers very granular settings for the number of speed steppings available to various core counts under Turbo Boost .

EXCLUSIVE : Season 2 of HBO ‚Äôs Eastbound & Down is coming together .
The setting for the underrated comedy starring Danny McBride will move from North Carolina to Mexico , with Michael Pena and Ana de la Reguera joining as new regulars .
In the first season finale , former professional baseball pitcher Kenny Powers ( McBride ) quit his physical ed teaching job for an offer to join the Tampa Bay Rays but , after the offer fell through , he dumped his girlfriend and was last seen driving away with a worried look on his face .
In Season 2 , hiding from his problems , Kenny finds himself in Mexico where he joins a local baseball team .
Crash co-star Pena will play Kenny ‚Äôs friend and owner of the baseball team he joins .
De la Reguera will play Kenny ‚Äôs love interest in Mexico .
Because of the new setting , most of the cast members from Season 1 of the show will have little or no presence next season with the exception of Steve Little whose character Stevie Janowski will track Danny down in Mexico .
Casting is underway for the role of Kenny ‚Äôs father .
Production on Season 2 will start next month in Puerto Rico , which will stand in for Mexico .
Mexican - born
De la Reguera co-starred on another project set in Mexico , the 2006 feature Nacho Libre , as well as the recent release Cop Out .
Actor , comedian , author , television presenter , Mac enthusiast and Twitter fan Stephen Fry has used the Apple iTunes Festival to attack copyright holders .
Fry admitted on his popular Twitter feed prior to Sunday night 's event that he was nervous and was n't sure what he planned to talk about .
" All rather unnerving as I have n't the least idea what I 'm going to say . "
However , according to reports after outlining the history of copyright , Fry said the entertainment industry 's pursuit of file - sharers was " doing the wrong thing , " later admitting to using a BitTorrent client to download a US TV show .
The show was an episode of US medical drama House , now heavily promoted on Sky One , starring his former comedy partner Hugh Laurie .
" The last thing I illegally downloaded ‚Ä¶ was the season finale of House . "
Fry did add he'd previously already bought the show legitimately .
Fry also mocked " those preposterous " commercials on DVDs telling audiences " you would n't steal a handbag , " previously spoofed so effectively by Graham Linehan in C4's The It Crowd .
Fry insisted that someone who downloaded an episode of 24 could not be compared to someone who might steal a handbag .
The warnings , now dropped , compare downloading illegal content to a series of crimes including the theft of a handbag , car , television and DVD from a store .
Fry also hit out at those who had taken the Pirate Bay to task , saying the world 's largest bittorrent tracker had been unjustly pursued , and the reputation of its founders smeared by the music industry .
The founders face prison and must pay around 30 million Swedish kronor ( ¬£ 2.4 m ) in damages following an April court ruling .
While Fry was critical of those downloading illegally for profit on an " industrial " scale , he suggested if the price of downloads came down to a " fair " level , most people would be happy to pay .
Later , he used his Twitter feed to clarify his point of view .
" Well , finished my bit .
Hope I 'm not misunderstood .
Such a pity if I get misrepresented as a " help yourself and be a pirate " advocate ... "
Fry was added to a prestigious line - up of established and new musical talent last week , sharing a stage with Mumford & Sons and The Temper Trap .
Oasis , Snow Patrol , Kasabian , Graham Coxon , Bloc Party , Bat For Lashes , The Hoosiers and Simple Minds are amongst 62 bands appearing over 31 nights .
A limited number of tickets are still available here .
A long time Apple fan , Fry has appeared at the flagship Regent Street Apple Store and claims to have owned the second ever Mac sold in the UK .
Each iTunes Festival performance is being recorded and will be available to download on iTunes although Stephen Fry 's performance may remain in the archives .
However , as many in attendance had digital recorders , we suspect and illicit copy could be appearing on a file - sharing site any time now .

The latest target in the battle over fast food is something you should n‚Äôt even put in your mouth .
Convinced that Happy Meals and other food promotions aimed at children could make kids fat as well as happy , county officials in Silicon Valley are poised to outlaw the little toys that often come with high - calorie offerings .
The proposed ban is the latest in a growing string of efforts to change the types of foods aimed at youngsters and the way they are cooked and sold .
Across the nation , cities , states and school boards have taken aim at excessive sugar , salt and certain types of fats .
Believed to be the first of its kind in the nation , the proposal would forbid the inclusion of a toy in any restaurant meal that has more than 485 calories , more than 600 mg of salt or high amounts of sugar or fat .
In the case of McDonald ‚Äôs , the limits would include all of the chain ‚Äôs Happy Meals ‚Äî even those that include apple sticks instead of French fries .

Supporters say the ban would encourage restaurants to offer more - nutritious foods to kids and would make unhealthful items less appealing .
But opponents believe it amounts to government meddling in parental decisions .
The Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors will consider the proposal Tuesday .
Even though it ‚Äôs largely symbolic ‚Äî the proposed ban would apply only to the dozen fast - food restaurants within the jurisdiction of the board ‚Äî the proposal has caused a bit of an uproar on the Internet , where comments on YouTube and other sites say it is another example of the ‚Äú nanny state ‚Äù gone wild .
The California Restaurant Assn. has taken out full - page newspaper advertisements against the proposed ordinance in local newspapers .
One shows a little girl with her hands cuffed behind her back as she holds a stuffed animal .
Another opponent wrote in a YouTube posting , ‚Äú I want to know when the pitchforks and torches and rope is going to come out ....
We need to run these Frankenstein politician monsters the hell out of town ! ‚Äù

Ken Yeager , the Santa Clara County supervisor who is behind the effort , says the toys in kids ‚Äô meals are contributing to America ‚Äôs obesity epidemic by encouraging children to eat unhealthful , fattening foods .
‚Äú People ask why I want to take toys out of the hands of children , ‚Äù said Yeager , who is president of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors .
‚Äú But we now know that 70 % of the kids that are overweight or obese will be overweight or obese as adults .
Why would we want to burden anybody with a lifetime of chronic illness ? ‚Äù
According to a recent congressional report , food companies spent about $ 1.6 billion in 2006 marketing their wares to children .
About $ 360 million was spent on the toys included with kids ‚Äô meals , incentives that restaurant marketers have long viewed as key to bringing in families with children .
‚Äú We went through a phase when my daughter wanted the Happy Meal just to get the toy , ‚Äù said Kristen Dimont , 37 .
The Sunnyvale blogger said that once her child tasted fast food , it took years to coax her back to the healthful variety .
Dimont likes the idea of the ban ‚Äî and thinks the supervisors should consider extending it to the play yards that also attract children to fast - food restaurants .

Rebecca Wolpinsky , 32 , a mother of two , says she ca n‚Äôt stand the toys that are included with fast - food meals for children .
‚Äú The toys are crap , honestly , ‚Äù she said .
‚Äú We end up recycling them or they end up getting left in the car . ‚Äù
But Wolpinsky opposes banning the toys ‚Äî or blaming them for childhood obesity .
‚Äú To say that Burger King or McDonald ‚Äôs is the root cause or that giving toys with children ‚Äôs meals is a root cause is not right , ‚Äù she said .
McDonald ‚Äôs declined to comment on the proposed ban .
But the California Restaurant Assn. has played a major role in the opposition .
Advertisement
If County Supervisor Yeager ‚Äú wants to take away the toys that are making kids fat , take away Xboxes , take away PlayStations , take away flat - screen TVs , ‚Äù said Daniel Conway , spokesman for the industry group .
Yeager knows that even if the board passes his proposal , its effect would be small .
Even so , he says , it ‚Äôs worth it .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre responsible for paying for healthcare in the whole county , ‚Äù Yeager said .
‚Äú We pay close to $ 2 billion annually on healthcare , and the costs have done nothing but rise . ‚Äù
A big part of the increase , he said , is costs related to obesity .
Bob Bernstein , the Kansas City , Mo. , advertising executive who helped dream up the Happy Meal for McDonald ‚Äôs in the 1970s , said the concept was to offer something just for kids .
Advertisement
‚Äú To make a child happy and to not cost Mom any additional money ‚Äî that was the original idea , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú The toy was not the reigning reason for the child to order the Happy Meal . ‚Äù

Fashion photography is a genre of photography devoted to displaying clothing and other fashion items .
Fashion photography is most often conducted for advertisements or fashion magazines such as Vogue , Vanity Fair , or Allure .
Over time , fashion photography has developed its own aesthetic in which the clothes and fashions are enhanced by exotic locations and story lines or could be having great models with different vehicles or animals just to be an eye catching effect .

In your new book , ‚Äú The Vitamin D Solution , ‚Äù you argue that we have become a culture of sun phobes who fear exposure to direct sunlight and slather on too much sunscreen , which you believe has caused a national epidemic of vitamin D deficiency .
Dermatologists have gone so far as to recommend that you should never walk outside without a sunscreen .
The American Academy of Dermatology still has that recommendation that you should never be exposed to one ray of direct sunlight without sun protection .
Why do they say that ?
They are heavily invested , I think , with the cosmetics industry .
The American Academy of Dermatology just had their annual meeting in Miami Beach .
It was huge .
Many of the major cosmetic companies were there , and they were spending thousands of dollars just to be out there and promote their products to the dermatologists .
Why would the anti-sun academy hold its annual meeting in Miami Beach , the sun capital of the East ?
That kind of says it all .
They still seek the sun , just like everyone else .
How long does one need to stay in direct sun to absorb 2,000 I.U. of D , your ideal daily dose ?
You do n‚Äôt absorb it .
You make it .
In the spring , I recommend about 15 to 30 minutes on your arms and legs two to three times a week .
One of the truly galling Republican political maneuvers over the last 10 years is to go from squandering a huge budget surplus , racking up trillions in debt , ballooning the deficit , and leaving the next Democratic administration with an economy in shambles ‚Äî then as soon as the Democrats are in charge refashioning themselves as budget hawks .
You might even think they ‚Äôre setting the Democrats up to fail .
I know , hard to believe .
Why Republicans are n‚Äôt simply laughed off the stage at this point when they try to argue against budget deficits says a lot about Democratic ineptness , media collusion , and short political memories .
But I still find it amazing .
Here ‚Äôs an example of the maneuvering and how ‚Äî as should be abundantly clear by now ‚Äî it ‚Äôs a concerted , well - planned , Republican effort to hamstring Democratic policy objectives :
A former Bush administration flack launches what seems to be a very well - funded not - for - profit dedicated to warning of the perils of excessive government spending , and refuses to divulge who is funding the outfit .
April Fool Apple 's iPad launch could be thrown off course by a last minute objection to the device 's name by a small Irish American civil rights group .
Boston - based F√©ach ar na F√©ilire claims it registered the name 11 years ago for a now - defunct online advice service for Irish Gaelic speaking immigrants in the US .
P√°draig O'S√∫il , national convener of the group , told The Register , via a translator , that the organisation had written to Apple numerous times , but had yet to receive a reply .
Its lawyers were now preparing a filing to freeze the launch of the ground breaking device in an effort to bring Apple to the negotiating table .
" This is just another example of Apple 's arrogance towards the American Irish speaking community , in both America and Ireland , " O'S√∫il said .
The Mac maker had consistently failed to provide Irish language capabilities in its operating system , he claimed , and had never localised its products for Irish and other Gaelic - speaking markets .
" Yet at the same time they 're happy to raid the Irish lexicon for their product names when it suits them .
Look at the Mac - that means son in Irish , you know " he said .
" It 's just one slap in the face after another . "
When pressed for other examples he said he'd get back to us .
O'S√∫il added that the organisation had raised its latest concerns with Apple as soon as it heard about the upcoming launch , but the computing giant had consistently ignored its complaints .
He admitted that Apple 's lack of a response could 've been down to the group 's insistence on writing to Cupertino in Irish .
However , a change in the organisation 's constitution had been necessary before it could engage a firm of bilingual trademark attorneys , Mahone , Butt and Mahone , which was able to take instruction in Irish and issue writs in English .
An Apple spokesperson said , " Saoire le do thoil teachtaireacht tar √©is an ton . " ¬Æ

Not a lot gets written in the general press about foundational issues in mathematics , but this afternoon I found myself talking to a journalist about the subject of certainty in mathematics .
It turned out to be a pretty interesting conversation , so I thought I ‚Äôd write here about a few things that came up .
Mathematics likes to think of itself as a very certainty - based business .
If you ‚Äôve ‚Äú proved something mathematically ‚Äù , then it ‚Äôs supposed to just be true .
No ifs or buts .
Complete certainty .
But in practice that ‚Äôs not quite how it works ‚Äî at least the way mathematics has traditionally been done .
Because in reality a mathematical proof of the kind people publish in papers is something much more social .
It ‚Äôs a vehicle for convincing other humans ‚Äî one ‚Äôs fellow mathematicians ‚Äî that something is true .
There ‚Äôve been a few million mathematical proofs published over the past century or so .
Essentially all of them are written in a kind of human - compatible mixture of mathematical formalism and ordinary natural language .
They ‚Äôre intended for human consumption .
For people to read , and process .
The best of them are n‚Äôt just arguments for some particular theorem .
Instead they ‚Äôre expositions that illuminate some whole mathematical structure .
But inevitably they require effort to read .
It ‚Äôs not just a mechanical matter .
Instead , every reader of every proof has to somehow map what the proof is saying into their particular patterns of thought .
So that they can personally be convinced that the proof is true .
And of course , in practice , proofs written by humans have bugs .
Somewhere between the imprecision of ordinary language , and the difficulty of really thinking through every possible eventuality , it ‚Äôs almost inevitable that any long proof that ‚Äôs been published is n‚Äôt perfect .
And even with an army of people to check it , not every bug will be found .
So how do computers ‚Äî and Mathematica change this picture ?

This week 's Search Engine podcast from TVOntario's Jesse Brown features an interview with the head spokesman for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , brought on to explain why the publicly funded broadcaster has signed on with iCopyright , an American licensing agency that aims to collect a monthly fee from any Canadian business that excerpts CBC media on its blog .
Additionally , the CBC says that it requires anyone who wants to noncommercially excerpt the nation 's public media for discussion , archiving , criticism , etc , must first get written permission from the Corporation ( and be prepared to have permission rescinded at any time ) .
Suffice it to say , the CBC 's spokesman does not cover himself in glory .
He alternately claims that he must deny permission to Canadian bloggers because the CBC does n't want to be inconsistent , then , in the next breath , says that the Corporation gives its media for free to YouTube even though it 's not consistent , because they 're still " feeling their way . "
And he does n't even know that the CBC 's partner is offering a $ 1,000,000 bounty for Canadians who rat each other out for using public media without permission .
If I 'd been in Jesse 's shoes , I would have asked this :
The CBC wants to act like a business instead of a public service entity , right ?
Well , in that case , why do n't you act like a business : we , the taxpaying public , were the angel investors for the CBC for a century or so .
If you want to bring in another investor at this stage ‚Äî a commercial partner to sell licenses for the media we financed ‚Äî why the hell should we accept having our equity diluted down to zero ?
Should n't we continue to get our annuity ‚Äî in the form of free access and use of the media we paid for ‚Äî before you start to deliver value to these late - stage investors ?
Podcast # 36 : The CBC's Antisocial Media
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett 's reputation as a stickler for good business ethics has put the billionaire in an awkward spot because of an investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N .
In Sept 2008 , at the height of the financial crisis , Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.NBRKb.N acquired $ 5 billion of Goldman preferred shares and warrants to purchase an equal amount of common stock .
The investment throws off a fat $ 500 million of dividends a year .
Speaking on CNBC television , Buffett said on March 1 that he would buy the securities again under the same circumstances .
He also praised Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs a very , very strong , well - run business , ‚Äù Buffett said .
‚Äú Goldman Sachs has a very strong market position .
Lloyd Blankfein , you cannot find a better manager . ‚Äù
But that was before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ‚Äôs April 16 lawsuit accusing Goldman of civil fraud .
Goldman officials told U.S. senators on Tuesday they did not mislead clients .
‚Äú Buffett is in a tough spot , ‚Äù said Tim Calkins , a marketing professor at Northwestern University ‚Äôs Kellogg School of Management .
‚Äú If you really feel something was done wrong and your investment reflects your values , then you have to think about reducing it . ‚Äù
Berkshire declined to comment .
At the company ‚Äôs annual meeting in Omaha , Nebraska on May 1 , Buffett will field more than five hours of shareholder questions .
Goldman is all but certain to come up .
‚Äú Buffett is savvy enough to know the environment can change in two seconds and that he need not make sudden , radical decisions , ‚Äù said Eric Dezenhall , a crisis management expert at Dezenhall Resources Ltd in Washington , D.C .
‚Äú I WILL BE RUTHLESS ‚Äù
Even before the SEC lawsuit , Goldman was among the least admired U.S. companies amid a perception its business practices contributed to the financial crisis and that it is tone - deaf to calls for change , and that it pay bankers and traders less .
In a Harris Interactive Inc HPOL.
O poll released on April 5 , Goldman was the 56th most admired of 60 well - known large U.S. companies .
Behind it : Citigroup Inc C.N , Fannie Mae FNM.N , American International Group Inc AIG.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. Ranked first : Berkshire .
" Berkshire Hathaway is a powerhouse because it is associated with some great brands such as Coca - Cola KO.N , Geico and Procter & Gamble PG.N , " Calkins said .
" The question is , does Goldman fit ? "
Buffett has forayed into Wall Street before .
In 1987 , Berkshire bought $ 700 million of convertible preferred stock in Salomon Inc .
Four years later , Buffett became interim chairman to restore order after a Treasury auction bidding scandal .
On September 4 , 1991 , Buffett testified before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce about Salomon .
Excerpts got into a movie created by Buffett ‚Äôs daughter Susie and shown to Berkshire shareholders at each annual meeting .
In part , Buffett said the following : ‚Äú In the end , the spirit about compliance is as important , or more so , than words about compliance .
‚Äú I want the right words and I want the full range of internal controls .
But I also have asked every Salomon employee to be his or her own compliance officer .
‚Äú After they first obey all rules , I then want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any contemplated act appear the next day on the front page of their local paper , to be read by their spouses , children and friends , with the reporting done by an informed and critical reporter .
‚Äú If they follow this test , they need not fear my other message to them :
Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding .
Lose a shred of reputation for the firm and I will be ruthless . ‚Äù

Kettlebells : An Antidote to the Hype
A lot of interest has been generated lately in kettlebells ( the so - called ¬ìiron balls¬î ) , in the fitness media , in online forums and ( to a lesser extent ) in the US press .
A lot of claims have been and are being made as to how effective kettlebells are for fitness , strength , endurance , flexibility in fact , just about everything except getting a date and doing the dishes .
While there is no doubt that kettlebelling can be a reasonable form of exercise if combined with other methods of training , there is also little doubt that most of the claims made about them are exaggerated and they are surrounded by hype and overblown language as few other methods of training are .
No mention is made of the real risks involved to the average person picking up a kettlebell for the first time .
Added to that is the mystique attached to them in the US , because they were supposedly the main training method of the Spetnaz of the former USSR and are therefore somehow perceived as exotic and as a repository of ¬ìhidden¬î or ¬ìsecret¬î techniques .
The novice kettlebeller believes that he or she is getting a shortcut to a fit , strong and aesthetically pleasing body in a fraction of the time available via other methods .
Is this actually the case ?
I propose to have a look at these many claims ( and some of the supposed ¬ìfacts¬î ) in an objective manner and examine their merits or lack thereof .
Please note that I am not going to say ¬ì Kettlebells are rubbish¬î or ¬ì Don¬ít waste your money on them - spend it on something useful , like a silent alarm clock¬î .
What I am going to say that they can have some use in conjunction with other methods of training , but that there are other methods to ¬ìget there ¬î which are safe , rational and which respect the structure of the body .
If you are already using the ¬ìiron balls ¬î and are happy with them , then hold onto them as hard as you can .
Just keep it real for the rest of us , OK ?
Kettlebells are Russian
No , they are not .
In fact , they originated in the Highlands of Scotland .
A popular pastime in the Highlands in winter is the sport of curling .
This was originally played using birch brooms and round stones on frozen lakes and river mouths .
In freezing temperatures , picking up a round stone covered in frost in the midwinter gloom can be a tricky proposition .
Therefore , a cast iron handle was attached to the stones to make then easier to handle .
Highland and Cumberland wrestlers then began using the stones during the spring as a training tool ( one among many ) for the Highland Games .
The handle made it easy to pick up for pressing motions , so why not ?
This is not a reason not to use kettlebells , but more of a hype - busting exercise .
If you want to be an ¬ìauthentic ¬î kettlebeller , then learn to play the bagpipes and wear your kilt with pride .
The USSR is nothing now but a bad memory - and please let¬ís leave it that way .
To evoke a spurious mystique about the unique horror that was the USSR in order to promote what are nothing more than iron balls is , quite frankly , in bad taste .
I wonder what the reaction would be if they were hyped as ¬ì the favourite training tool of Nazi Germany ¬î or ¬ìwhat the Viet Cong used in the tunnels underneath Saigon¬î or ( in the post September 11th era ) ¬ì what Al - Queda used in the caves of Afghanistan¬î ?
Think about this , please .
Kettlebelling was the Primary Training Method of the Spetnaz
Not according to http://www.russianmartialart.com .
I hold Russian military training methods in high regard , but as far as I know , they ( like most military units around the world ) consist primarily of callisthenics and running .
I have only ever heard of one video from Russia which had kettlebelling in it .
It was of villagers in the hinterland doing a folk dance for tourists which involved doing somersaults with a kettlebell in each hand .
The economy of the USSR was not ¬ìat its best ¬î when it came to producing consumer goods .
Could they have been using kettlebells instead of ornate dumbbells because the kettlebells were cheaper and easier for the local blacksmith to make ?
Kettlebells have a Unique Training Effect
Really ?
In the dictionary I use , resistance is resistance .
Here is a quote from George Walsh , a famous British bodybuilder from the late 1930s :
¬ì There is no such thing as a secret exercise which will produce miraculous results .
There are no mysterious appliances which will work wonders for you .
Progressive exercise against resistance - whether furnished by the weight of your own body or by an appliance - and adherence to certain rules of living , will infallibly produce results for every fit man¬î .
Kettlebells do indeed have a training effect , but it is certainly not unique .
In fact , any of the above activities have a training effect - to work your muscles , tone your body , raise your heartbeat , increase your strength , improve your health and appearance and add to the overall quality of your life .
Kettlebells Provide Progressive Resistance
There are plate - loaded kettlebells available which do precisely this .
Plates can be added or subtracted in the same manner as they can be on a dumbbell or barbell .
Progressive Resistance , as everyone interested in strength training knows , is a must .
How else can you gauge how stronger you are getting ?
How else can you avoid overtraining or undertraining ?
No argument from me here .
However , this does not hold true for solid - ball kettlebells .
There are a number of these on the market , which are manufactured by several vendors .
These solid - ball versions can¬ít be incrementally made heavier .
How do you add 1KG to a smooth iron ball ?
Super - strong glue ?
Maybe Mulder and Scully could figure this one out , if they were still together .
The Old - Time Strongmen Used Kettlebells
Some of them certainly did - though for two purposes only .
One was to pose for sculptors .
A large part of their income was generated from posing for sculptors and artists and a kettlebell held in the crook of one arm while wearing a loincloth or figleaf does how the muscles to good effect , you have to admit .
I have seen great photos of Eugen Sandow and Lionel Strongfort holding kettlebells and they look terrific .
However , now you know why there are so many pictures of them holding kettlebells in dramatic poses - earning a living .
The second purpose they used them for was in order to perform fingertip presses .
The spherical shape meant that each finger could grip the ball in an easy manner .
This is a definite advantage of using kettlebells in preference to dumbbells or barbells .
However , this only holds true for solid balls , not plate - loaded ones .
The two best fitness and exercise websites that I know of on the internet today are http://www.sandowplus.co.uk.
and http://www.maxalding.plus.com .
I urge you to do yourself a favour and visit both of them .
They have good biographies of some of the old - timers , plus dozens of their systems of training freely available .
These were the old ¬ìmail order musclemen¬î and include among them some of my own favourites such as Lionel Strongfort , George Walsh , K.Y. Iyer and Maxick .
Please count the number of these old - timers who trained exclusively with a kettlebell .
As I am a nice man , I will save you the trouble and give you the answer : None .
Bear in mind that a lot of these men set weightlifting records nearly a hundred years ago , which are unbeaten to this day , as well as being champion wrestlers , boxers and gymnasts .
( This was in the days before protein shakes , supplements , steppers , gyms filled with machines , sweatbands and all the rest of the modern paraphernalia that we are all constantly told we ¬ìneed¬î ) .
Now , have a look through ANY of the courses on either of those two sites and tell me how many times you see a kettlebell being used or advocated , or how many times you see a kettlebell portrayed as the ultimate fitness tool .
I wish you the best of luck in your search - because you are going to need it .
I believe I have illustrated my point here .
Kettlebells Don¬ít Take Up Much Room
I agree .
They can easily be stored in a corner of your garage and you don¬ít need a huge amount of space to use them .
However , the plate - loaded ones require the storage of the plates in a plate - tree of some sort .
On the other hand , you could say the same thing about barbells and dumbbells .
Kettlebells Have Good Carryover to Martial Arts
As a martial artist myself , I respectfully but emphatically disagree .
The single activity which benefits martial arts the most ( whichever art you ¬íre talking about ) is the art itself .
Practice makes perfect - and nowhere more so than in the dojo or dojang .
No appliance , apparatus or piece of equipment can replicate the experience of being thrown , of applying a wrist - lock , of performing a leg sweep or leglock or of having one applied to you .
Only another martial artist can provide this ( which may be why we train in classes ) .
Similarly , the best way to practice a punch , palm - heel , edge - of - hand , side - kick , footsweep or whatever strike you have in mind is to actually hit something .
It may be a heavy bag , empty air ( as in a kata or pattern ) or a heavily padded opponent .
Only in these ways can you improve your body alignment ( eg. Getting the hip behind the strike , moving off the opponent¬ís centre - line ) , learn to put force into the technique ( whether taking someone down onto a dojo mat or applying a side - kick to a heavy bag ) , learn limb retraction ( an iron ball is not able to grab your wrist or ankle after you grab or strike it ) and countering ( as an iron ball can not hit back ) .
In aikido and aikijutsu in particular , there is a lot of emphasis placed on breaking the opponent¬ís balance and thereby gaining control of his or her body .
To do this , you must have a live opponent to practice on .
Even the very basic mechanics of pushing when being pulled and pulling when being pushed without the ability to predict the outcome are something that no inanimate object can replicate .
Another related point is the area of ¬ìbody awareness¬î .
Simply put , when on the mat , you need to be aware of your own body and to be able to handle your own body .
You need to know where your limbs are , how flexible they are , what positions they are strong in ( and weak in ) , how stable your trunk is and how fast you can move .
The best and most effective way to do this is to do callisthenics .
The best way to become aware of your body in this way is to use it .
This is why , in most dojos and dojangs , you see the warm - up and stretching all being done with bodyweight exercises .
This is sometimes not the case with weapon - related arts such as iaido and kendo .
However , with these , they use the weapon - as it makes sense to do so .
I personally have never been in or heard of a dojo or dojang where the beginning warm - up and stretching was done using iron .
There may well be one or two somewhere who do so , but they are in a tiny minority .
Using heavy iron will not make you ¬ìbody aware¬î in this sense , but rather ¬ìiron aware¬î .
You will be aware of how heavy the iron is , where it is , how far away from you it is and you will be concentrating on the iron , not yourself .
This will make you good at moving heavy iron , but not at martial arts .
Arguing otherwise is like saying that practicing golf will make you a good swimmer .
This is not to say that resistance training in some form is not good for martial arts .
However , there is no substitute for moving your body on the mat .
Kettlebells Work The Body Across a Wide Range of Angles
Again , this is important for martial arts .
A martial artist has to be able to move across a wide range of angles and among many planes of motion .
This is the case whether attacking or defending , striking or throwing , standing up or on the ground .
Kettlebells certainly work the shoulders across a wide range of angles and the wrists and the elbows and the lower back .
They can work these areas of the body really well .
They can really stretch them .
In fact , unless you are really careful and have perfect technique every time you move the bell , they can overextend them .
Several message boards on the internet are replete with stories of people suffering extension - stress injuries from kettlebells , especially in the shoulders , wrists , elbows and lower back .
This may be for a number of reasons
One may be going for too many reps of an exercise too soon .
It is a fact of biology that the body has to get used to any kind of exercise , especially if one is a beginner at exercise or is returning after a number of years ¬í inactivity .
The muscles and ligaments have to adapt .
Your whole body has to adapt , in fact .
If you do too much of anything too fast and too soon , then something will go BANG !
If that happens , then not only will you have to stop exercising for a matter of weeks or months , but you also have a nice new injury to cope with .
This is particularly true if the kind of exercise you are intending to take up is strenuous and / or places severe demands on your strength , speed and / or flexibility .
Another reason may be that the type of exercise may be too complex to perform alone , without the benefit of someone watching your technique .
Kettlebells are particularly notorious in this regard , much more so than other forms of resistance - based exercise .
A fair number of the exercises , for example , are ballistic in nature .
A good example of this is the simple swing .
If done with one hand , it can hyperextend the shoulder joint itself and the muscles surrounding it .
This is the case whether a kettlebell or dumbbell is used .
However , because the centre of gravity of a kettlebell is that further away from the hand than is the case with a dumbbell , the risk is way higher with a kettlebell and the need for perfect technique all the more imperative .
There is much more of a pull on the connective tissues because the iron is flying away from your body at speed .
You can¬ít control it as well because you haven¬ít got the same close grip as you would if using a dumbbell .
Maybe you need your connective tissues stretched to this degree and are happy with the high risk involved ?
If so , I have to ask you why ?
What kind of sport or activity are you participating in that warrants this degree of risk ?
The same can hold true for pressing exercises performed with a kettlebell .
Take the one - hand overhead press .
With a dumbbell , the iron is gripped either side of the hand and the wrist is upright .
With a kettlebell , however , you have to really grip it hard , otherwise , the bell will flop onto the back of your hand .
This will hyperextend the wrist , put undue ( and unnecessary ) strain on the forearm and if done regularly , can over time place the elbow under severe strain .
Also , when pressing , the wrist and forearm will take the bulk of the strain , not the upper arm and shoulder .
The first warning you will have of this is a burning sensation under the elbow .
Your wrist may swell up gradually .
Your lower back may complain in the form of sudden sharp pains n the evenings .
If you keep it up , you may even get a clicking noise in your shoulder , which will definitely warrant medical attention .
If you are wise , you will stop at that point .
¬ì OK ¬î you retort , ¬ìthen I¬íll make sure to grip the hell out of it every time I do a press¬î .
Your resoluteness is commendable .
However , have you always done every repetition of every exercise perfectly ?
I certainly haven¬ít , nor do I know anyone who has .
I¬ím only human - just like you .
Furthermore , do you exercise first thing in the morning ?
Does it take you a few minutes to wake up and be aware ?
Are you able to fully concentrate fully on anything first thing in the morning , or indeed in the evening immediately after a long day¬ís work ?
For your sake , I hope so .
Let¬ís face it , there are many ways in which you can work your body by resistance .
Pitting one muscle against another is one way .
Callisthenic exercises such as the lunge and press - up also use the principle of resistance , as does sparring with a live opponent .
Using dumbbells and barbells is another form of resistance .
Strand pulling is yet another .
A Bullworker is still another .
and there are dozens more , if not hundreds .
As was pointed out earlier , resistance is resistance - simple to understand .
There is nothing mystical or magical about this statement .
When all is said and done , it is so simple as to be axiomatic .
How you train against resistance is largely up to you and is a matter of personal preference more than anything else .
However , why train in a way that hyperextends certain bodyparts and which involves exercises which are so complex and demand perfect form every single rep ?
If you are already a seasoned athlete or martial artists , your connective tissues may allow you to get away with poor technique ( such as letting the bell flop onto the back of your hand ) .
On the other hand , you may not get away with it , even if you have been training for years .
You know your own body best , not me .
Finally , if you are an absolute beginner to exercise or are returning after a number of years ¬í inactivity , then your motto should be ¬ì Safety First ¬î and there are numerous other ways to train with resistance which are much simpler and much safer than kettlebells .
Also , any increases in either repetitions or resistance in any exercise should be gradual and moderate .
Ease into exercise gradually .
Don¬ít let it take over your life .
Your connective tissues are just as important as your muscles - and just as necessary to the smooth functioning of your body .
Use your intelligence here and don¬ít let anyone else do your thinking for you .
Kettlebells exercise the system more efficiently than bodyweight exercises
The truth is that any form of heavy resistance places a far greater workload on the body - simply because the body has more work to do , the heavier the resistance actually is .
Again , just to reiterate , this is so whether the resistance comes in the form of a kettlebell , dumbbell , barbell , a Bullworker , a set of strands or whatever .
However , in the interests of fairness , let¬ís examine this point more closely with a few examples
Can you do a one - legged squat ?
This is where you stand up right , then stick one leg out in front , toes pointing forward and away from your body .
Holding your arms out in front for balance , bend the leg that is on the ground till your rear ( I believe the American expression is ¬ì butt¬î ? ) touches your ankle and then straighten the same leg again .
A tough exercise and no mistake , is n¬ít it ?
If you can do the one - legged squat , how did you first achieve it ?
I did it by holding a pair of dumbbells at arms¬ís length , as the extra resistance on the upper body kept the lower body in balance .
Once I could do them with dumbbells , I tried doing them without and they were much harder to do .
Why ?
Because there was no counterforce effect which helped me to remain upright .
The truth is that one - legged squats are fair harder using your own bodyweight , whereas adding resistance makes them easier .
Can you do a handstand pushup ?
If so , have you tried with a weight tied to your waist or wearing a weighted vest ?
You might think that the added weight makes the handstand pushup much harder to do .
In fact , the additional resistance causes the abdominal muscles to contract forcibly in order to stabilise the trunk of your body .
This takes some work off your shoulders - work that your shoulders would be doing if you had used no resistance .
Again , the added weight makes it easier .
How about endurance ?
Is doing thirty swings with a kettlebell better than doing one hundred pushups ?
One definite advantage is that the swings wouldn¬ít take so long .
One definite disadvantage is that you are exercising for a shorter time .
If you are involved in a sport or activity which requires you to remain active for protracted periods of time , then you should train to be active for protracted periods of time .
You can do this with heavy resistance if you wish , but I hope your joints can take it .
I doubt if mine could - or indeed most people¬ís .
Bodyweight exercises use the weight of your own body - no more and no less .
As a means of training for endurance , they are the sensible choice .
It doesn¬ít even have to be a specific exercise .
Brisk walking is by far the best overall exercise there is .
Swimming is also fantastic , especially for your back , and the buoyancy of the water takes a great load off your joints .
Let¬ís get even more specific : boxing .
Can you imagine the effort required in simply holding your arms up for a three minute round and having to do that twelve times ?
This is quiet apart from having to bob and weave or throwing any punches at all .
Merely holding your arms up for thirty six minutes ( twelve three minute rounds ) takes quite a bit of doing .
The best way to train for this is to use the arms , shoulders , abs and upper back and use them for a similar length of time .
Now , can you see why boxers do so many pushups ?
How about cardiovascular exercise ?
High repetition kettlebell swings are indeed a good cardiovascular exercise .
However , they are in no way superior to other cardiovascular activities .
Take brisk walking .
If you can go outside and walk briskly , you ¬íre getting fresh air and the whole body is getting exercised evenly .
Also , the joints of the upper body in particular get a rest - unlike kettlebell swinging .
Fresh air is in itself a very important component in health .
How about swimming ?
Again , the buoyancy of the water rests the joints and the entire body ( especially the back ) gets a workout .
Also , spending time in the water is a good way to prepare the body against sudden chills or cold draughts .
Finally , swimming in a local pool can be a rewarding social activity .
Let ¬ís put it this way :
Where are you more likely to see a bikini - clad beauty - in a swimming pool or in your own garage ?
If the answer is the latter , then I want a garage like yours .
Kettlebells look great and feel great
I don¬ít know about you , but a pair of solid balls just doesn¬ít ¬ì do it¬î for me .
What is so aesthetically pleasing about a pair of spherical pieces of iron ?
Anyone ?
Please ?
The plate - loaded ones don¬ít look much better , but then again neither do dumbbells or barbells .
However , they are not meant to look ¬ìnice¬î .
They are meant to be used , just like all exercise equipment .
I could say a few more things about how they ¬ìlook¬î , but their appearance is completely irrelevant .
¬ì Are they OK to use ? ¬î is what I am concerned with .
As regards the ¬ìfeel¬î , they definitely feel much different than dumbbells .
A given amount of weight on a kettlebell is much harder to handle than the same weight on a dumbbell .
Why is this ?
Again , there is nothing magical or mysterious about it .
It is a simple matter of leverage .
Because the centre of gravity of the kettlebell is at the end of a handle rather than either side of your hand , the weight itself is further away from the hand .
Because of the added distance , the resistance on the body is actually greater than the weight of the kettlebell alone .
If you want the science , then here it is :
The amount of resistance increases with distance from the lever or fulcrum which is acting against the resistance .
If you don¬ít want the science , then how about a practical demonstration ?
Take a rubber ball .
Hold it close to your chest for two minutes , then put it down .
Then pick it up again and hold it in front of you with your arms outstretched for two minutes .
Difficult , is n¬ít it ?
Why is it so much more difficult ?
After all , the rubber ball weighs the same , doesn¬ít it ?
Yes , but the second time around , it is further away from you .
That is why it is much harder to handle - the extra distance .
This is precisely why the kettlebell ¬ìfeels¬î different .
It doesn¬ít take a genius to figure out that adding a little more weight to a dumbbell will equal the resistance obtained from an equivalent kettlebell .
Again , there is nothing mysterious about this .
There is no magic , no ¬ìsecrets ¬î and no shortcuts , just simple resistance .
You Can¬ít Be Bored Using Kettlebells Because They Are so Versatile
Kettlebells , because of their compact size , are very versatile and lend themselves to all sorts of exercises .
This true - but it is also true of dumbbells and strands .
Any exercise shown using a kettlebell can be done using a dumbbell .
Sure , you can attach rubber bands to a kettlebell and use it in different ways , but exactly the same things can be done with a dumbbell .
However , you can become bored with kettlebells just as easily as with any other apparatus .
The mere fact that you are holding a heavy object in your hand ( or both hands ) limits what you can do .
How can you use a kettlebell in a pushup ?
How many ways can you exercise lying down ( grapplers , judoka and aikidoka , please take note ) with a kettlebell ?
There is an infinite variety of exercises that can be performed using your own bodyweight and , for some exercises and some areas of the body , it is much more appropriate to do just that .
Similarly , strands can exercise the body in all sorts of ways .
Just ask any strandpuller .
In fact , it is possible to exercise all the main areas in the body while seated using strands .
Callisthenics , conversely , need no equipment and can be done anywhere - which is convenient if you travel a lot .
For rehabbing injuries , strands have proven their worth time and time again , as have bodyweight callisthenics .
Kettlebells are nowhere near as versatile .
The intelligent martial artist , sportsperson , or the average person who just wants to get fit should apply some serious thought to this matter .
A combination of different kinds of exercise , after the body has been systematically built up to a reasonable level , is the optimal combination for good results .
Anything else and you are selling yourself short as well as missing out on a whole host of benefits - increased flexibility , increased cardiovascular fitness , more strength , a more toned appearance , clearer skin , fat loss and the ability to perform well in your chosen martial art , sport , hobby or pastime .
Last But Not Least : Kettlebells Will Work For Everyone
Yes , the old classic ¬ì One size fits all ¬î approach ( the same approach , coincidentally , as was used by the erstwhile USSR in its Cold War propaganda ) .
Of course , the truth is that nothing works for everyone .
Some people take well to one thing and some people feel attracted to another thing .
Equally well , the same person¬ís likes and dislikes may change over time .
It is very important that you like and enjoy how you exercise .
If you don¬ít , then you probably wo n't stick at it for very long .
There is nothing wrong at all with changing an exercise routine every now and again - in fact , it can be a positively good thing to do , as the resulting ¬ìmuscle confusion¬î can shock the body into great performance and / or growth .
There is an old Irish saying that ¬ì Variety is the spice of life¬î .
( Actually , I am unsure as to whether this saying is Irish in origin or not , but I am claiming it for Ireland for patriotic reasons , OK ? ) .
On the other hand , I have found a routine of exercises that work well for me and I tend to stick with what works .
In this regard , I have to ask one question : How much do you use your shoulders ?
Are you a swimmer ?
If so , your shoulders must be pretty well worked as they are .
Are you a boxer or striker ?
Then your pushups and bag - punching have already given you rock - hard shoulders .
Are you a wrestler , grappler or judoka ?
Then your shoulders must already be supple and firm from all that mat - work alone .
I could go on and on with different examples , but the point I am making is this :
You already use your shoulders an awful lot if you are engaged in a martial art or a sport .
This is true of most activities , as they involve the use of the arms .
Even runners swing their arms as they run and derive some momentum from this , as well as keeping their body alignment correct .
So why am I saying this ?
Because every kettlebell move which involves using a kettlebell or pair without any other apparatus involves the shoulders to a greater or lesser extent .
There is no way to take the shoulders out of an exercise session which involves the sole use of kettlebells .
Can I mention the real possibility of overuse - related injury ?
Can I mention the need the shoulders have for rest , no less than any other part of the body ?
Conclusion and some food for thought
Kettlebells are definitely not suitable for the beginner at exercise , or for those who are returning to exercise after a protracted period of inactivity .
This is due to the high risk to the wrists , elbows , shoulders and lower back inherent in their use , plus the complexity involved in many of the exercises .
Only those who are already fairly fit and who have trained their connective tissues to withstand repeated shocks of a ballistic nature should even consider using them .
The plate - loaded kettlebell is more sensible in general than the solid ball , as the plate - loaded model allows for gradual incremental loading of increased resistance , though exactly the same benefits can be derived from a pair of plate - loaded dumbbells .
However , the solid balls are good for fingertip presses and some forms of grip training .
Finally , there is nothing mysterious , ¬ìsecret¬î or magical about kettlebells .
Please note that in this article I have not even considered related questions such as the advisability of ballistic exercises in general , the effect on the joints and posture over time of high - repetition overhead lifting per se , and the role of good taste in marketing .
I have also purposefully avoided mentioning cost , as I am not American nor do I live in America .
However , I can say for certain that , in the British Isles at least , a standard set of dumbbells , a beginner barbell set or a set of strands all cost considerably less than one kettlebell .

IRVING , Texas --
Soon after the Dallas Cowboys traded up to draft Dez Bryant , owner / general manager Jerry Jones told the equipment managers to get No. 88 ready .
The Cowboys have assigned Bryant that number , which was worn by Cowboys receiving legends Drew Pearson and Hall of Famer Michael Irvin .
In fact , Bryant No. 88 jerseys were already for sale on the team 's website Friday morning .
" I think that Dez has a chance to make the kind of impact of people that have worn this jersey before , " Jones said during the press conference to introduce the 24th overall pick .
" Personally , I think it has a nice synergy for our fans . "
Pearson wore No. 88 from 1973 to 1983 .
The number was vacant until Irvin wore it from 1988 to 1999 .
Wide receiver Antonio Bryant and tight ends Jackie Harris and Brett Pierce have worn the number briefly since Irvin retired .
Overall , 10 Cowboys players have worn No. 88 .
Bryant , the former Oklahoma State star , said he did n't know much about the history of the number for the Cowboys ' franchise until he was told about it .
He had n't heard of Pearson , who retired five years before Bryant was born .
Jones , who hopes Irvin will become a role model for Bryant , emphasized to his first - round draft pick that No. 88 represented an outstanding work ethic in his mind .
" I know me having a chance to put on No. 88 really means a lot to Mr. Jerry Jones , " Bryant said .
" I feel like I 'm excited to wear it , and I 'm very excited that he thinks I can be a great player and wear that number . "
Pearson saw Bryant play on television a few times during his college career and believes Bryant has the talent to add to the legacy of No. 88 .
He hopes Bryant is humbled and hungry after being suspended for the final 10 games of his college career for lying to NCAA investigators about a meeting with Deion Sanders that otherwise did n't violate any rules .
" I guess in Jerry 's eyes , it says a lot about him -- that he can handle the pressure of wearing the double - 8s , " said Pearson , a member of the 1970s All - Decade team .
" Most of the time , you say , what 's in a number ?
In this case , there 's a lot of history and production .
" For Jerry to anoint him with that number , it indicates that Jerry sees a lot of potential . "
Antonio Bryant brought some attention to the 88 , but for the wrong reason .
He was best known for throwing his No. 88 jersey into the face of then - coach Bill Parcells during an offseason workout .
Dez Bryant hopes to live up to the Cowboys ' lofty expectations .
" Me falling to the Cowboys , that 's the best thing that could ever happen to me , " Bryant said Thursday night .
" I 'm so happy .
I 'm excited .
I 'm ready to go to work . "
Bob Lilly's No. 74 is the only number that has been worn solely by one player in Cowboys history .
The selection of the 6 - foot - 2 , 225 - pound Bryant means the Cowboys will have a top - three receiving corps of Miles Austin , coming off a 2009 Pro Bowl year ; Roy Williams , who has struggled in his two years with the Cowboys ; and veteran Patrick Crayton .
The Cowboys also have young receivers Sam Hurd and Kevin Ogletree .
" If all goes well -- not trying to talk noise -- but if all goes well , we 'll have the best wide receiving corps in the league , " Williams said .
" Dez is a big dude , he can play .
He will help us win some ballgames . "

The unexpected discovery of a new type of genetic variation suggests that natural selection - the force that drives evolution - is both more powerful and more complex than scientists have thought .
" We have discovered that natural selection can act not only on whole organisms and individual genes , but also on gene networks , " says Antonis Rokas , assistant professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University and senior author of the paper reporting the discovery published online on Feb. 17 in the journal Nature .
This finding may help explain how some organisms , including bacterial pathogens , maintain high levels of diversity and adapt rapidly to new stresses .
Working with colleagues at the University of Colorado School of Medicine ( UCSM ) and the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Portugal , Rokas found that a close relative of brewer 's yeast , Saccharomyces kudriavzevii , exists in two very different states : one that can efficiently digest the sugar galactose and one that cannot .
Galactose is a natural sugar found in milk and many fruits and legumes .
The variant found in Portugal that consumes galactose uses a network of six genes to convert the sugar into energy .
What is surprising is the fact that a variant found in Japan that cannot process galactose has nevertheless preserved a non-functional version of the network of galactose genes for millions of years .
" This level of genetic divergence is normal between distantly related species , like human and mouse .
Instead , we find it being maintained within a single species of yeast , " says coauthor Mark Johnston from UCSM .
Normally , natural selection and recombination work jointly within an individual species to actively maintain a single version of the genes that perform critical functions or that give organisms a competitive advantage .
However , this has not happened with the galactose genes in S. kudriavzevii .
When the scientists compared the genomes of the Japanese and Portuguese populations of the yeast , they were surprised to find that the divergence between the galactose genes was a hundred times greater than the divergence between the two genomes as a whole .
This indicates that the two states have co-existed for millions of years , which the scientists conclude is convincing evidence that the two have been actively maintained by natural selection .
There is one type of natural selection , called balancing selection , which actively maintains different versions of an individual gene in a gene pool .
The classic example is sickle cell anemia .
Individuals who inherit the sickle cell variant of the hemoglobin gene from both parents have impaired red blood cells and shortened life expectancy .
However , those who receive a sickle cell gene and a normal hemoglobin gene have an increased resistance to the parasite that carries malaria , giving them an advantage wherever malaria is present .
" All the cases of balancing selection that have been identified so far , like sickle cell anemia , involve a single gene , " says Rokas .
" What is unusual about our case is that we are talking about a network of genes , one that is dispersed throughout the yeast genome . "
A number of scientists are looking for examples of balancing selection , but they are focused on single genes .
Until researchers begin looking for this type of selection in gene networks , it is not be possible to determine whether it is a rarity or a fundamental process .
One place to look for this new form of selection is among pathogens , many of which have lifestyles very similar to that of yeast :
They have very large populations and self - fertilize most of the time , reserving sexual reproduction for periods of high stress .
Selection acts most powerfully in large populations and self - mating makes it easier to maintain alternative states that are difficult to sustain .
Specific candidates are the single - cell parasites that cause malaria and the tropical skin disease leishmaniasis .
" This is exactly the type of life cycle that we expect to allow for the maintenance of this type of complex genetic variation , " says coauthor Chris Todd Hittinger from UCSM .
If this new type of selection is providing a competitive advantage to even one human pathogen , identifying it could prove important .
" We are currently in a war with pathogens and we are loosing the battle .
So every advantage we can get in understanding how pathogens adapt could be significant , " says Rokas .
POLICE have swooped on a furniture store to seize a huge stone willy after it was branded indecent .
Owner Jason Hadlow , who said the action was overzealous , must pay an ¬£ 80 fine to reclaim the unusual garden ornament .
He was fined after the ¬£ 200 hand - carved 4ft sandstone appendage was seen in the window of Simply Dutch at Leeming Bar , near Bedale , North Yorkshire .
The firm , which bills itself as the most interesting store in the North , recently stocked a new range of garden furniture , including the offending willy , which went on prominent display at the end of last month .
Following a complaint from a member of the public , police removed the ornament and fined Mr Hadlow for ‚Äú displaying an item liable to cause harassment , alarm or distress ‚Äù .
Mr Hadlow must pay the fine by Friday to release it from Northallerton police station ‚Äì or face possible court action .
The entrepreneur , who lives in Yarm , near Stockton , is refusing to back down , saying the willy is in keeping with the store ‚Äôs quirky ethos .
He has even started a Free Willy campaign in store and on networking website Facebook .
He said : ‚Äú The world is a crazy place and I am sure the local constabulary has better things to do .
‚Äú It is just another example of overzealous policing and I could not believe they were serious .
‚Äú We might have had one or two complaints , but most customers loved it as they know the type of things we stock .
‚Äú We have had naked stone strippers , Roman and Greekstyle statues and all sorts of other weird pieces of furniture in the window which have n‚Äôt caused such a stir .
‚Äú So I am a little shocked , to say the least , that an ¬£ 80 ransom is being demanded for the phallus ‚Äô return . ‚Äù
A police spokesman said : ‚Äú The owner is displaying a penis in the window to attract publicity .
‚Äú A member of the public complained to police about the statue .
‚Äú He is committing an offence under the Public Order Act 1986 . ‚Äù
Were the police right to seize the statue ?

We are not heavily staffed so we all work very hard .
Everyone pulls their weight .
If you call the brewery , there 's a good chance Deb will answer the phone .
We are a true " mom and pop business . "
She runs the business end of things , that is , marketing ( she literally hand draws and writes ALL of our labels and POS ) , Sales , Lawyers , Wholesalers , Bankers ( she raised 21 million dollars for the new brewery alone .
When I say alone , I mean by herself .
NOBODY ELSE ) .
We are a manufacturing - driven company .
We invest a great deal of effort and money in making the best beer possible .
No neons and nearly zero marketing budget .
Most of my time is spent guiding our brewers , maintenance team , and quality control team .
I am constantly looking , tasting , and thinking about our process .
My job is to make sure our beer tastes good each and every time , is better today than yesterday , that our employees are safe and empowered , and that we use our raw materials , time , and utilities responsibly .
Do you have a favorite New Glarus beer ?
Do you have favorite foods to pair with your beers ?
Nope ... That is like asking me to pick my favorite child !
I love each of my brews for different reasons and in their own right , and I simply cannot pick a favorite .
I am proud of them all .
As far as pairing , I love Totally Naked Lager with Pizza !
How do you get inspired to make new beers ?
I find inspiration in what I see around me .
For example , after drinking white wine in Italy , I came up with our Berliner Weiss .
I also find inspiration from my customers , wholesalers , employees and Deb .
What breweries have been your inspiration ?
What are your favorite non-New Glarus beers ?
Sierra Nevada , Augustiner of Munich , Schneider of Kelheim German , Rodenbach of Belgium , Budvar of the Czech Republic .
Have you had any beers not work out as you expected ?
What is the worst beer you ever brewed ?
I have made beer that was dumped ‚Äî every brewer has ( or should have ) .
Beer is temperamental and sometimes need a little coaxing to behave .
Just as everyone has different tastes in music , each person 's palate responds to different taste experiences in different ways .
That is what I love about my job .
It allows me to experiment with flavors and styles .
But in the end , I can't brew beer to please everyone .
I just brew the best beer I can and hopefully people enjoy it as much as I do .
I made an historical recreation of the original London Style Porter called " Old English Porter " .
One third of customers loved it , one third thought the beer was spoiled , and one third did n't know what to make of it .
I loved it !
What are your plans for the brewery this year ?
Is there any chance we 'll see expansion ( and expanded distribution ? )
We opened our new Hilltop brewery in November of 2007 .
That was a huge project ‚Äî it nearly killed me .
So we do not have any plans for further expansion beyond continuous improvement projects for energy conservation and beer quality .
Absolutely no plans to expand our market .
We want to stay small .
What is the craft beer scene like in Wisconsin ?
Has it changed since you started New Glarus ?
The market has changed greatly over the seventeen years we have been here .
It used to be " Miller Lite " country .
Now the national shippers are waning , especially with the recent implosion of Bud .
As in the rest of the country , young people are looking for beers with character .
People in Wisconsin like to support the local brewers .
The future is bright !

How did a sea lion pup end up on the roof of a four - story Newport Beach apartment building ?
That 's the question officials and residents are asking after the sea lion was found Thursday morning .
Animal rescue workers have dubbed the sea lion Fiddler in honor of the musical , ‚Äú Fiddler on the Roof . ‚Äù
The pup apparently climbed up four flights of external stairs at an apartment triplex near Seashore Drive and 47th Street before a Newport Beach animal control officer caught him on the roof of the building about 6 a.m .
Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan ( CNN ) --
The Kyrgyz president said Thursday he would not resign despite the opposition 's assertion that it had ousted the government following days of bloody civil unrest in the central Asian nation .
President Kurmanbek Bakiev acknowledged that there had been a coup against him but said in a statement that he was not abandoning his duties .
" I am prepared to bear responsibility for the tragic events that have happened if it will be proven by an objective and unbiased recognition without hiding behind the presidential immunity .
I believe I acted in the way that the constitution required , " Bakiev said in his statement , posted on 24.kg , a well - known Kyrgyz Web site .
A wave of protests have left 75 people dead and hundreds injured in fighting between police and protesters , authorities said .
The opposition seized government headquarters and pledged to address citizens ' concerns .
Bishkek , the capital , was relatively calm Thursday .
There were small groups of people chanting near the marble government office , known as the white house .
One report said a crowd was rallying outside the telephone company in the capital , and that demonstrators blocked roads and obstructed traffic , prompting concern from health officials .
As darkness fell , sporadic bursts of machine gun fire and police sirens could be heard .
It was not immediately known why there was shooting , but a major concern of the new interim government officials is widespread looting .
Ismail Isakov , the interim interior minister , said on television he ordered police to shoot people looting shops , businesses and houses of former top officials .
And , officials have urged citizens to band together to stop looters .
In his statement , Bakiev said , the country has endured " loss " as a result of opposition leaders ' " irresponsible actions . "
" Innocent people have died ...
I am shocked by the tragedy and express deep and sincere condolences to the families of those dead .
Today , the attention of the entire world is attracted to the bloody events happening in Kyrgyzstan . "
Bakiev said it was " clear " to the world that there had been a coup in which " our countrymen have paid the price . "

" I am confident that those who are attempting to change the authority in the country should act strictly within the framework of law and according to the existing constitution .
" Realizing my responsibilities as president of the Kyrgyz republic , I am confident the country where the government comes to power through blood can lose its statehood .
I am urging the instigators of the riots to think again .
I am stating that as president I did not abandon my duties and I am not abandoning my duties .
Irresponsible actions of the opposition could only cause more escalation of tensions . "
Roza Otunbayeva , a former foreign minister , said the opposition had taken over the reins of government and driven Bakiev from office .
" We must restore a lot of things that have been wrongly ruled , " said Otunbayeva , who declared herself the country 's interim leader .
Otunbayeva said at a news conference that the former president had fled to the south of the country with his entourage .
" The new government would like to locate him to negotiate the terms of his resignation , " she said , adding that Bakiev is trying to consolidate his supporters to help restore his power .
" We will not let him come back to power , " said Abdygany Erkebayev , a former parliament speaker and opposition figure .
i Reporter describes protests , discusses grievances
Otunbayeva added that the former prime minister had handed a resignation letter , and the interim government was now in control based on the constitution .
She said the new body replaces the president and cabinet ministers .
The interim government is working to restore order across the country .
Ismail Isakov , the interim interior minister , said on television he has given orders to shoot looters .
Opposition leaders have accused Bakiev of consolidating power by keeping key economic and security posts in the hands of relatives or close associates .
The protests began Tuesday in the northern city of Talas .
They were sparked by increases in electric and fuel rates , which had gone up at the first of the year as Bakiev 's government sold public utilities to companies controlled by his friends .
Demonstrations spread to the capital Wednesday after the government arrested opposition leaders in Talas .
Otunbayeva discussed a list of priorities the new government would focus on , including restoring the old utility company .
The government also said it had taken control of television stations and most businesses owned by the former president 's son , including banking and mobile services .

Kyrgyzstan , a former Soviet republic , houses an air base that forms an important link in the supply line for United States and NATO forces in nearby Afghanistan .
The new government denied reports that it was planning to shut down the air base , but said it intends to review the issue .
In Washington , a senior Pentagon official told CNN that the turmoil had interrupted flights into and out of that facility , and it was unclear when those flights would resume .
But the U.S. military has contingency plans to deal with the situation , the official said .
Why Kyrgyzstan is vital to U.S. interests
On Thursday , a senior State Department official said Washington was closing its embassy in Bishkek and may move dependents onto the air base as a safety precaution .
The United States has closed its embassy in Bishkek , a senior State Department official said Thursday , and the country is contemplating moving dependents to the Manas air base for a few days because of concern about the political violence that has engulfed the country .
" We have concerns about the situation on the ground , " U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said at a Thursday briefing .
" We stand with the people of Kyrgyzstan .
We understand that there were specific grievances that resulted in the demonstrations that have produced an opposition that now says that it has effective control of the government . "
Crowley said the United States is not taking sides .
" Our interest here is with the people of Kyrgyzstan and a peaceful resolution of the situation . "
As the protests died down , the interim government said it was monitoring the situation to ensure no more violence .
Otunbayeva is the head of the Social Democratic Party and a member of the parliament .
She was a leader of the protests that brought Bakiev to power in 2005 and served as his foreign minister for about two years before quitting to protest over the appointment of one of the president 's brothers to an ambassadorship , said Mirsulzhan Namazaliev , executive director of the Central Asian Free Market Institute in Bishkek .
On Thursday , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe urged citizens to refrain from violence and to use dialogue to address their concerns .
The group 's special envoy to the country , Zhanybek Karibzhanov , is expected to arrive in Bishkek shortly .
ALLENDALE TOWNSHIP --
Planted smack in the middle of a new housing development targeting Grand Valley State University students stands a tree of a different sort .
The steel palm tree - like structure exists as both an urban sculpture and a functional bicycle rack .
The one installed at the Village at 48 West is the first of many a Grand Rapids design firm hopes to plant .
Design Plus Inc. , has a patent pending on the Bike Petal , a vertical bicycle rack that is manufactured by Porter Corp. , of Holland .
" We wanted something visible , that would be sculptural and appealing to the urban environment , " said Peter Lazdins , principal at Design Plus .
The architecture , landscape and interior design firm created the Bike Petal for employees , and the initial prototype stands in its parking lot , 230 E. Fulton St .
About six of the racks have been made so far , including the one at Village at 48 West and four purchased by GVSU for installation on its Allendale campus .
Headed by Vern Ohlman , the firm is also partnering with a group of local bicycle enthusiasts to try and install several racks -- with available bicycles for community use -- around downtown Grand Rapids next month for the ArtPrize festival .
Initially , the hope was to marry a solar - powered electronic system to the steel frame , allowing anyone to swipe a credit card at an unmanned station and rent a bike for transportation between ArtPrize venues .
However , both time and money are in short supply , and bike - share proponents instead are planning staffed stations during the festival .
Next year , perhaps , for the solar - powered stations , said Jane Lovett , owner of Peaches Bed & Breakfast in Grand Rapids and a member of petalgr .
" We either need to throw a lot of money at it , or we need more time , " said Lovett , who approached Design Plus with the bike share idea after she and her husband used the Velib public bike system in Paris , France .
Petalgr is working to find underwriters or sponsors for the stations , which Design Plus is retailing between $ 4,000 and $ 5,000 depending on quantity .
Bikes for the program also must be found .
Lovett wants to add Grand Rapids to the list of U.S. cities installing bicycle - sharing programs , such as SmartBike DC in Washington , D.C. , B - Cycle in Denver and a proposed program in Philadelphia .
A standalone , fee - based bike share in Grand Rapids would promote the city 's green image while also showcasing the Bike Petal as a unique , West Michigan - produced product .
" If we can keep them around as permanent structures so people have a place to park their bikes in the downtown area after ArtPrize is gone , I think that 'll be appreciated , " Lazdins said .
Permanent installation would require approval by the city 's Automobile Parking Commission .
City Parking Services Director Pamela Ritsema said she is on board with the temporary plan for ArtPrize , which runs Sept. 23 to Oct. 10 .
" We realize that parking is more than about just parking cars , " she said .
" If this is a permanent installation , I think we'd like to have all the details pinned down before the Parking Commission agreed to it . "

Subtitle : How not to waste your time planning for retirement .
Often we are told to ask the question , ‚Äú Will I have enough for retirement ? ‚Äù
On the surface that certainly is a valid question .
However , the younger a person is the more variables exist that make the equation too complicated to properly calculate .
As a thirty - something year old male , I have come to realize that most of my wondering ‚Äú will I have enough for retirement ? ‚Äù has been almost a complete waste of time .
Here are some retirement planning variables I believe we cannot either know or control :
1. Social Security
Right now I chuckle to myself when I read the asterisked segment of my social security statement .
Here is my translation .
‚Äú Hi , Mr. Ford , US Government here .
Just wanted to let you know that the dollar amounts we are writing on this paper mean absolutely nothing .
In fact , we do n‚Äôt anticipate having the necessary funds to pay you the stated amount .
Have a lovely life .
P.S. We are happy to continue receiving your social security payments . ‚Äù
In the future I suspect that giggle with turn into a scowl .
2. Rate of Return
Should you plan to get a 12 % rate of return ?
Is 6 % more accurate ?
Should you split the difference and go with 9 % ?
Regardless of the estimate you use , there is a good chance you are going to be wrong .
Sure , you might save a million dollars , but that still might not be enough .
Your asset allocation will influence you rate of return , but you still cannot know what return you will get .
3. Inflation
How much will $ 1 be worth 30 years from today ?
Will a Big Mac cost $ 15 and a gallon of gasoline $ 25 ?
I do n‚Äôt know .
Do you ?
4. Retirement Age
The first financial advisor I met with at the age of 21 asked me when I wanted to retire .
What an impossible question to answer .
Now more than a decade later I do n‚Äôt think I am any closer to answering that question .
I ‚Äôm not even sure if retirement is the goal of life .
Will I have a job I love ?
Will I hate what I do ?
Will I be healthy ?
Will my wife be working ?
5. Activity During Retirement
When ( could we even say if ) I retire I have no idea if I will be sitting at home reading the daily newspaper and playing croquet or putting on a suit jacket and heading back into the office for another day of work .
If I work part time what I need for retirement will fluctuate greatly .
At this point in my life those questions only result in an ‚Äú I do n‚Äôt know shrug
6 . Our future income
We impact our future income by our conduct , character , and work ethic .
However , I cannot predict today what I will be earning 20 years from now
7 . The end of time
As a Christian I believe the things of this world will not last for infinity .
Much like Jesus , I do not know the day or the hour , but from an earthly perspective at some point there will be a generation who will not even make it to retirement .
How Should You Plan For Retirement ?
Be responsible with your retirement savings .
Plan and predict .
However , do n‚Äôt worry or fret because who of us can add a single hour to our lives by worrying ?
Far too many people spend hours and hours trying to predict these things , but that is extremely difficult to do .
Instead focus on the things you can control .
What can you control ?
We ‚Äôll that ‚Äôs the topic of our post next Monday .
Any other unknown variables you think should be included on this list ?
FLIGHT OF THE SIMPSONS : What Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement might look like on The Simpsons .
Wellington duo Flight of the Conchords are returning to American television with a guest appearance on The Simpsons this year .
It is understood Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie rehearsed lines with Nancy Cartwright , the voice of Bart Simpson , over the phone from Wellington before recording in the United States .
Rumours emerged as far back as 2008 that the duo were up for a coveted guest spot , but Simpsons executive consultant Antonia Coffman said then that there were no plans to have them on the show .
But a source close to the pair said they recorded an episode in January that will air later this year .
They had practised lines over the phone with " Bart " before their studio sessions .
" They apparently said it was very weird . "
Conchords manager Mike Martinovich said he could not make any comment about the appearance .
" I do n't know whether there 's anything I 'm allowed to tell you about that , " he said .
It is not known whether Clement and McKenzie will play themselves in their upcoming episode , but it is likely .
The Simpsons , set in the fictional town of Springfield , is the longest - running sitcom on television .
In earlier seasons , most guest stars voiced fictional characters but as the series grew in popularity it has become more common for stars to portray themselves .
Xena star Lucy Lawless and Jurassic Park actor Sam Neill are the only other Kiwis to guest star on the show in its 21 - year history .
Lawless appeared as herself in Xena costume in The Simpsons ' Halloween special in 1999 .
Neill was the voice of cat burglar " Molloy " in a 1994 episode .
The Simpsons holds the world record for the most guest appearances in an animated television show , but the producers are picky about who gets to " go yellow " .
It has often been said , only partly in jest , that " you have n't really made it in Hollywood till you 've been on The Simpsons " .
British football superstar David Beckham , now living in Los Angeles , was turned down for a guest spot last year .
Executive producer Al Jean said at the time that Beckham was not famous enough .
" I had to phone David Beckham to tell him sorry .
I did n't think he was a big enough star for an American audience . "
McKenzie and Clement spent time with their families in Wellington this month before flying out last weekend to tour in the US .
Earlier this month they performed sellout shows at Wembley Arena in London .
Gender - Debatte bei Piratenpartei : Meuterei der Piratinnen
Die Piraten streiten aktuell √ºber Gender .
Eine Aktivistin startete eine Mailingliste " nur f√ºr Frauen " ‚Äì daf√ºr hagelte es sofort harsche Kritik bis hin zu Parteiausschluss - Forderungen .
Lena Simon meutert .
Die 25 j√§hrige Philosophiestudentin ist Mitglied in der Piratenpartei , und sie hat ein Problem .
" Ich f√ºhle mich als Frau bei den Piraten oft unwohl .
Aber wenn ich das anspreche , rollen die meisten anderen Mitglieder nur mit den Augen - und sagen : ' Wir sind Post - Gender ' . "
Simon rief das Netzwerk der " Piratinnen " ins Leben , meldete eine Homepage an und ver√∂ffentlichte darauf eine Pressemitteilung .
Das Netzwerk wolle " zu einem besseren Verst√§ndnis von Zielen , W√ºnschen und N√∂ten der Frauen in einer von M√§nnern dominierten Piratenpartei " beitragen , hei√üt es darin .
Und weiter : " Die Piratinnen m√∂chten einen Schutzraum bieten , in dem auch die leisen Stimmen unter den Frauen Geh√∂r finden k√∂nnen . "
Die Mitteilung hat sie am vergangenen Samstag ver√∂ffentlicht , an dem die Mitgliederversammlung des Berliner Landesverbandes stattfand .
Seitdem tobt in der Piratenpartei ein verbissen gef√ºhrter Gender - Streit .
Eine von Simon initiierte Mailingliste mit derzeit 40 Mitgliedern ist exklusiv Frauen vorbehalten .
Darin schildern Geschlechtsgenossinnen ihre Probleme .
Eine erz√§hlt , dass Frauengruppen von m√§nnlichen Piraten oft absch√§tzig als " H√§kelgruppen " bezeichnet w√ºrden .
Eine andere berichtet , dass ihre Parteikollegen sie nicht als " potentielle Parteifunktionsaus√ºberin " s√§hen , sondern vor allem als " Sexualpartnerin " .
Eine dritte schreibt : " Die Anti-Gleichberechtigungstendenzen , die mir regelm√§√üig aus den Reihen der M√§nner entgegenschlagen , werden mich unter Umst√§nden zu einem Austritt zwingen . "
Der Berliner Landesvorsitzende Andreas Baum sagt : " Ich sehe nicht , dass wir ein Gender - Problem haben .
Mir pers√∂nlich sind Vorf√§lle von Diskriminierung nicht bekannt . "
Baum will jetzt Kritikerin Simon treffen - und reagieren .
" Nat√ºrlich m√ºssen sich Frauen √§u√üern k√∂nnen , ohne mit Witzen bel√§stigt zu werden .
Und es ist n√∂tig , ihnen Schutzr√§ume und Ansprechpartnerinnen zu verschaffen . "
Den Focus nur auf Frauen zu setzen , lehnt er ab .
Es sei falsch , Gleichberechtigung nur auf Mann und Frau bezogen zu diskutieren und damit Unterschiede zu zementieren , betont auch seine Stellvertreterin , Manuela Schauerhammer .
" Die Piraten m√ºssen generelle Diskriminierung diskutieren - zum Beispiel auch die von Kindern . "
Die Piratenpartei hat bundesweit derzeit 12.000 Mitglieder .
Wie viele davon Frauen sind , wei√ü niemand - auf den Beitrittsformularen fehlt die Angabe zum Geschlecht .
Doch auch wenn j√ºngst Frauen an die Spitze der Landesverb√§nde Nordrhein - Westfalen , Hamburg und Rheinland - Pfalz gew√§hlt wurden , sind Frauen in der internetorientierten Partei massiv unterrepr√§sentiert .
Die Auseinandersetzung √ºber den Piratinnen - Aufruf wird √§u√üerst scharf gef√ºhrt .
Der Thread zur Initiative w√§chst t√§glich , h√§ufig ist der Ton beleidigend .
" Ich bin gegen Schutzr√§ume und andere K√§fige f√ºr weibliche Piraten " , schreibt ein Nutzer .
Ein anderer argumentiert etwas widerspr√ºchlich : " Gegen eine Gruppe , die Genderprobleme innerhalb der Gesellschaft diskutieren will , habe ich nichts .
Sehr wohl aber gegen eine , die welche innerhalb der Piratenpartei diskutieren will - damit unterstellt sie n√§mlich , die PP h√§tte Probleme mit M√§nnlein und Weiblein und ihrer Gleichberechtigung und diskriminiert damit sowohl M√§nner wie Frauen . "
Eine h√§ufig ge√§u√üerte Kritik passt nicht recht zum basisdemokratischen Verst√§ndnis , das die Piratenpartei offiziell vor sich hertr√§gt : Lena Simon und ihre Mitstreiterinnen w√ºrden sich nicht ausreichend von der Partei abgrenzen .
So hat Simon ihre Homepage an das offizielle Piraten - Partei - Wiki gekoppelt .
Einmal wurde die Seite eigenm√§chtig von einem
User gel√∂scht , dann von anderen wieder hergestellt .
Ein anderer
User stellte danach wieder einen L√∂schantrag .
Mit ihrer Initiative hat Simon angesto√üen , was sie als ersten Schritt f√ºr n√∂tig h√§lt : " Eine Bestandsaufnahme dar√ºber , wie sich die Frauen in der Partei f√ºhlen . "
Die Studentin , die sich nicht als " typische Emanze " sieht , hat das Wohl der Partei im Blick : " Die Piraten werden niemals die f√ºnf Prozent H√ºrde schaffen , wenn sie sich dem Gender - Thema weiter so verschlie√üen . "
Simon will aus ihrer Partei austreten , wenn sich langfristig nichts √§ndert .
" In den Diskussionen im Netz fehlt teilweise die Hochachtung vor Menschen .
Wenn User etwa schreiben , dass man sich f√ºr Piraten - Frauengruppen k√ºnftig mit Menstruationsblut anmelden m√ºsse . "

The 1995 Chicago heat wave was one of the most brutal weather events the United States has ever experienced .
On July 13 , the thermostat hit 106 degrees .
Many of the city ‚Äôs poor and elderly residents had no air conditioning ; many of those who did lost power as blackouts swept the city .
Soon , thousands were suffering from dehydration , kidney failure , and respiratory distress .
The hospitals were overloaded ; the city could n‚Äôt cope with the flood of 911 calls .
Over the following days , more than 600 people died from heat - related illnesses , with hundreds of bodies temporarily stored in refrigerated meat trucks because the city morgues were full .
The Chicago disaster was the worst heat wave in recent US memory .
But if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current path , health experts say catastrophic heat waves are likely to become far more common .
Heat - related deaths in Chicago are expected to quadruple by 2050 , up from the current annual average of 182 , according to the US Global Change Research Program , a government study .
Rising temperatures and accompanying atmospheric changes will alter disease patterns and aggravate all manners of medical conditions , from asthma to respiratory diseases to ‚Äî believe it or not ‚Äî kidney stones .
In May 2009 , the medical journal The Lancet and University College London ‚Äôs Institute for Global Health issued a major report concluding that climate change is the ‚Äú biggest global health threat of the 21st century . ‚Äù
All of this means new costs for the US health care system ‚Äî which will almost certainly be passed on to consumers in the form of higher insurance premiums .
What is the insurance industry doing to prepare ?
So far , not much .
In 2008 , the National Association of Insurance Commissioners , the group representing state government regulators of property , health , and life insurers , announced that all such companies would be required to report both the risks and opportunities that climate change poses to their businesses .
Some were eager to get started .
Property insurers , says Joel Ario , chair of NAIC ‚Äôs climate task force , ‚Äú are probably the only people I know who are more worried about climate change than the environmentalists . ‚Äù
But the health insurers have been resistant .
In a survey by NAIC , America ‚Äôs Health Insurance Plans , the industry ‚Äôs powerful lobby group , responded that it ‚Äú has not adopted specific practices to identify climate change - related risks . ‚Äù
It added , ‚Äú While we continue to monitor climate change as it pertains to the global health care situation there is no conclusive information currently available to address the effects of climate change on health care . ‚Äù
The American Council of Life Insurers argued in a letter that ‚Äú knowledge in this area is not sufficiently developed to warrant an immediate , significant , costly , and possibly damaging change to the content and nature of annual statement reporting . ‚Äù
After pushback from the broader insurance industry , NAIC made disclosure voluntary on a state - by - state basis .
( Some states intend to move forward with the mandatory disclosure policies as planned . )
It ‚Äôs true that there are many unanswered questions about exactly how rising temperatures will affect human health .
But there ‚Äôs mounting evidence that the impact will be significant , according to major research efforts from the Environmental Protection Agency , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the World Health Organization , the National Institutes of Health , and the calls climate change ‚Äú an environmental health hazard of unprecedented scale and complexity . ‚Äù
Climate change , it turns out , has a few side effects .
High temperatures make it harder for the body to cool itself , which can cause heat cramps , exhaustion , and stroke ‚Äî a particular concern for people with heart conditions .
Heat also affects air quality , as stagnant air leads to higher smog concentrations , which in turn places stress on those with respiratory conditions like asthma .
Higher levels of carbon dioxide will likely cause pollens to proliferate , while increased humidity will nurture fungal growth ‚Äî two major aggravators of asthma and allergies .
Hotter weather will also lead to the spread of disease .
Mosquitoes carrying diseases like malaria , West Nile virus , and dengue fever will migrate into new areas of the US .
So will ticks bearing Lyme disease .
Water - and food - borne pathogens also thrive in balmier climes .
In some places , winters will be warmer ‚Äî but that creates problems , too .
Increased precipitation is expected to trigger heavier snowfalls and more ice storms , leading to more accidents and falls , says Paul Epstein of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School .
A 2009 report from the US Global Change Research Program found that any decrease in hypothermia - related deaths thanks to warmer winters ‚Äú will be substantially less than the increase in deaths due to summertime heat extremes . ‚Äù
The US health care community is so far behind on the issue of global warming that it ‚Äôs only starting to calculate the cost of these changes .
But what little research exists suggests the bill could be big .
Lyme disease already costs more than $ 2.5 billion a year in medical expenses and lost work time ‚Äî and climate models predict that the area where Lyme- carrying ticks can survive will more than double over the next 70 years .
Any increase in asthma would likewise boost the condition ‚Äôs massive price tag ‚Äî currently $ 18 billion annually .
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that kidney stones could increase by 30 percent or more in some areas of the US , due to dehydration .
That would cost the US health care system more than $ 1 billion per year .
These are just a few of the anticipated health effects ‚Äî accumulated , they could pose a major liability for insurers .
It ‚Äôs a ‚Äú time bomb , ‚Äù says Michael Gresty , managing principal of the sustainability consultancy Altanova , which works with corporate clients to reduce risks in this area .
‚Äú When the industry is not prepared for a sudden shock like this , they either have to dig into their reserves , or they have to increase their premiums to cover the increased costs of providing care . ‚Äù
On the bright side , one underappreciated benefit of tackling climate change is that it could yield major health care savings .
The European Environment Agency has found that the European Union ‚Äôs plans to reduce carbon emissions 20 percent by 2020 would cut health costs by $ 44 billion dollars annually .
No equivalent analysis has been done for the US .
But a study by the Clean Air Task Force found that shuttering dirty coal plants could save more than twice as many lives as seat belts do each year .
Programs to reduce emissions , like providing better public transportation , could also result in indirect health care savings by way of lower obesity rates and fewer respiratory and heart problems .
And a January study from the University of Wisconsin found that the benefits of improved air quality that would come from weaning the country off fossil fuels would likely outweigh the short - term costs .
Some insurance firms are beginning to acknowledge that climate change may affect their businesses .
In a 2008 submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project ‚Äî a voluntary program that helps major businesses assess climate change - related risks ‚Äî Prudential said it had teams examining the implications of increased infectious disease and extreme weather events .
The company is also ‚Äú paying attention more ‚Äù to markets like Mexico , India , and China , where diseases like malaria may spread , says Mary O‚ÄôMalley , chair of Prudential ‚Äôs environmental task force .
But , she says , Prudential is only starting to evaluate the risks and has n‚Äôt made substantial changes to its business model .
Likewise , Aetna concluded in a submission to the disclosure project that global warming may lead to ‚Äú higher health care costs for everyone . ‚Äù
But it , too , is in the early stages of assessing the problem .
Smart insurers , says Gresty , should work to calculate climate - related risks and push for policy changes to reduce those risks .
‚Äú That would be an investment in the future that would be protective of their business , ‚Äù he says .
And given the industry ‚Äôs massive lobbying tab , policymakers might well listen .
Says Harvard ‚Äôs Epstein , ‚Äú Through their own policies as well as national policies , the insurers can have a huge voice . ‚Äù

As we know today , some of the measures taken during the Salem Witch Trials to " prove " ¬ù whether a person was guilty or innocent were ludicrous .
But in case you 'd like to employ some of them for yourself , here are 10 ways to identify a witch , according to those running the Salem Witch Trials .
1. MAKE A WITCH CAKE .
What 's a witch cake , you ask ?
It 's definitely something you do n't want to eat .
You take the urine of the people who are thought to be under the spell of the witch in question , mix it with rye meal , and make a little patty .
Then you feed the patty to a dog .
Because some of the powers the witch used to cast a spell on the afflicted people were in their urine , when the dog eats the cake , it will hurt the witch , and she 'll cry out in agony .
2. WEIGH THEM AGAINST A STACK OF BIBLES .
If the suspected witch is heavier or lighter than the stack of Bibles , then clearly she 's guilty of evil - doing .
If the scales balance out , she 's in the clear .
You can imagine that a perfect balance did n't happen often .
3. CHECK FOR MOLES , BIRTHMARKS , SCARS , OR EXTRA NIPPLES .
These are all Marks of the Devil .
But if you need even more proof , try pricking the Devil 's Mark with a blade .
If it does n't bleed or hurt when it 's pricked , you 've definitely got a witch on your hands .
During the Salem Witch Trials , some unscrupulous witch - hunters actually used knives with retractable blades , so of course when they appeared to puncture the Mark , nothing happened .
4. OBSERVE THEM TALKING TO THEMSELVES .
During the Witch Trials , one accused woman , Sarah Good , was damned partially based on the fact that she was sometimes seen muttering to herself , and sometimes this even happened when she was leaving people 's houses .
Her accusers knew she was casting spells on people , even though Good claimed she was just reciting the commandments or a particular psalm .
Her claims were n't enough to save her , because she was hanged on July 19 , 1692 .
5. ASK THEM TO RECITE THE LORD'S PRAYER .
If they do n't , they 're guilty .
If they do , they 're guilty too .
George Burroughs , the only minister to be executed during the Trials , ran across this problem .
He was standing at the gallows to be executed when he recited the Lord 's Prayer to prove his innocence ‚Äî it was believed that a witch ( or warlock , in this case ) would be unable to utter the holy words .
People were momentarily convinced that the jury had wronged him , until a minister named Cotton Mather told the crowd that the Devil allowed George Burroughs to say that prayer to make it seem as if he was innocent .
Ahhh , of course .
With Satan himself apparently working right through him , Burroughs ' fate was sealed , and he was hanged moments later .
6. ASK A HARD -OF - HEARING ELDERLY WOMAN IF SHE'S GUILTY .
If she does n't respond , she 's definitely a witch .
This happened to 71 - year - old Rebecca Nurse .
She was known to be a very pious woman , and most people in the community were hesitant to accuse her or believe the pointing fingers that were .
In fact , she was found not guilty during her first trial .
But when there were more outbursts from young girls who said they were being tormented by a witch , Nurse was reconsidered .
When another prisoner claimed that " she was one of us " ¬ù during the trial and Nurse failed to respond , she was immediately assumed guilty and hanged .
7. NOTE THE NUMBER OF PETS SHE HAS .
A woman who has pets ‚Äî or even says hello to the neighbor 's cat ‚Äî is surely using that animal as a familiar .
In fact , if a fly or a rat entered a woman 's cell while she was awaiting trial , it was assumed that the witch had used her powers to summon a familiar to do her bidding .
8. TAKE THEIR SARCASTIC COMMENTS SERIOUSLY .
John Willard was the constable in Salem responsible for bring the accused to court .
After bringing in so many people , including those who were known for their church - going ways and elderly woman who barely understood what they were being accused of , Willard began to doubt how real these accusations really were .
In May 1692 , he finally put his foot down and declared that he would no longer take part in any arrests , sarcastically saying , " Hang them all , they 're all witches . " ¬ù
Willard was immediately accused of witchcraft himself , stood trial , was found guilty , and was executed just three months after his sarcastic comment .
9. ASK THEM IF THEY'VE HAD DREAMS ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS .
Sarah Osborne denied all witchcraft accusations that were thrown her way .
Her downfall was when she admitted she had recurring dreams that an Indian would seize her by the hair and drag her out of her house .
Apparently that was enough to convince the village she was likely casting spells on them .
However , Osborne ended up dying while being held captive and never stood trial for her " crimes . " ¬ù
10 . CHECK TO SEE HOW MANY TIMES THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED .
At least a couple of the women tried for witchcraft were married two or more times and were accused of killing their former husbands ( " bewitching " ¬ù them to death ) or evilly seducing them .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Contrary to widespread pundit opinion , Hugo Chavez is not invincible .
The past several months have seen a steady decline in his popularity at home and abroad .
In short , his bid to revolutionize Latin America and the Caribbean , once hailed as inevitable , has faltered ; the balloon of success has seriously deflated .
Since the FMLN ‚Äôs victory with Mauricio Funes in El Salvador ‚Äôs March 2009 presidential election , things have not gone well for the Venezuelan despot ‚Äôs goal to create Bolivarian socialist governments throughout the region .
The win was a fluke , as the ultraleft FMLN ( Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ) recruited popular TV broadcaster Mr. Funes and benefited from hundreds of Cuban activists and millions of Venezuelan dollars .
Since then , center - right or at the least non-Chavista candidates have won elections in five countries , beginning with the victory of Ricardo Martinelli in Panama in May .
Mr. Martinelli , who had received just 5 percent of the vote in a 2004 presidential bid , won 60 percent of the vote , trouncing his leftist rival , who had been supported heavily by Mr. Chavez .
Six months later , two elections on Nov. 29 were particularly noteworthy , the one in Uruguay and the other in Honduras .
In Uruguay , former guerrilla leader Jose Mujica won a runoff to become the country ‚Äôs second leftist president in 150 years , but not of the Chavez variety .
Rather , the avuncular agriculturalist announced he had renounced ‚Äú stupid ideologies , ‚Äù vowed not to quash democratic institutions and declared his affinity with outgoing Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and Brazil ‚Äôs Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
Moreover , Mr. Mujica , who was inaugurated on March 1 in Montevideo , has repeatedly declared his determination to strengthen ties with the United States , a distinctly non-Chavista position .
The same day , Hondurans elected conservative Porfirio Lobo to succeed interim President Roberto Micheletti , selected by the Honduran Congress to complete the term of President Manuel Zelaya , who had been ousted last June by order of Honduras ‚Äô Supreme Court and an overwhelming vote of the country ‚Äôs Congress .
This was perhaps the most humiliating defeat for the dictator from Caracas and his Cuban communist cohorts , as they had led a failed all - out effort , first to return Chavez - wannabe Zelaya to the presidency and then to boycott the election .
Backing from Washington , the Organization of American States and virtually all the region ‚Äôs governments notwithstanding , tiny , impoverished Honduras held firm despite losing its U.S. and European financial lifelines .
Although Venezuelan funds and Cuban organizers flooded the country in an attempt to persuade voters to ignore the election , EU parliamentary observers characterized the election as one of ‚Äú enthusiasm , democracy and transparency . ‚Äù
Then , in January , Chilean conservative candidate Sebastian Pinera won a runoff presidential vote versus former President Eduardo Frei to become the first center - right electoral victor in 52 years .
Mr. Pinera ‚Äôs victory must have been a particularly bitter ideological loss for Mr. Chavez , as Chile ‚Äôs new president , who assumed office March 11 , is a billionaire and reportedly the country ‚Äôs wealthiest individual .
Feb . 7 saw the latest non-Chavez presidential victory , the fifth in a row , when former Costa Rican First Vice President Laura Chinchilla was elected to succeed her political mentor , outgoing President Oscar Arias .
Although a center - leftist , Ms. Chinchilla ran and won on a center - right campaign of security and prosperity and will assume office in May .
Prior to the elections in Panama , Uruguay , Honduras , Chile and Costa Rica , it had seemed Mr. Chavez ‚Äôs momentum was unstoppable .
After all , presidential candidates supported by Venezuela ‚Äôs president had been successful in eight of nine previous head - of - state elections .
In just nine months , however , center - right and simply non-Chavez candidates have won five national elections .
Although this is a very promising trend , there are major hurdles ahead in Brazil , Colombia , Guatemala and Peru .
October elections in Brazil are the single biggest prize , with the winner of Colombia ‚Äôs election in May earning the silver medal .
President Lula da Silva has helped his Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff become the candidate of the Workers ‚Äô Party to oppose Sao Paulo Gov. Jose Serra , who was defeated by Mr. Lula da Silva in the 2002 presidential election .
Ms. Rousseff , a radical leftist , has been campaigning actively and gaining steadily on Mr. Serra , who has not as yet campaigned actively and holds a slim 52 percent to 48 percent advantage over his opponent .
Even though Ms. Rousseff has not openly avowed common cause with Mr. Chavez , the recent proximity of Mr. Lula da Silva with the Venezuelan revolutionary makes the Brazilian campaign a clear test of Chavista appeal in Latin America ‚Äôs largest nation .
Victory will give the winning side important momentum for future contests .
In Colombia , the presidential race is wide open following President Alvaro Uribe ‚Äôs decision not to seek re-election .
For now , the leading candidate is Mr. Uribe ‚Äôs former Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos , credited as the single most important leader in the fight against communist narco - terrorists ; however , the situation is fluid , and there are several well - known and attractive candidates in the field .
Look for a close race , which likely will be settled by a runoff .
At home , Mr. Chavez faces a major test in September ‚Äôs legislative elections .
Despite pitting the government ‚Äôs financial and organizational muscle against a fractious opposition , he should find the going difficult .
Having been humiliated in November 2008 state and local elections despite spending huge sums and doing everything possible to assure victory , Mr. Chavez will do everything in his power to retain his vicelike grip on Venezuela ‚Äôs Congress .
That will not be easy .
Mr. Chavez ‚Äôs approval rating has fallen to 39 percent as unbridled crime , surging inflation and failing water and electricity have turned the long - suffering denizens of Caracas ‚Äô fetid ranchos against their one - time hero .
The public finally is wearying of their ever - speaking , ever - promising president .
Mr. Chavez is down , a position in which he has often found himself over the years , but still not out .
Thus , the question remains :
Although his revolutionary balloon has deflated , will it finally burst ?

We made a few key technology bets when we created Stack Overflow : OpenID Markdown ASP.NET MVC
I covered Markdown , One Year Later in an earlier post , and now I ‚Äôd like to turn my attention to the first item in the list : OpenID .
After spending nearly two years with OpenID as our decentralized , open login mechanism , ‚Ä¶
We made a few key technology bets when we created Stack Overflow :
I covered Markdown , One Year Later in an earlier post , and now I ‚Äôd like to turn my attention to the first item in the list : OpenID .
After spending nearly two years with OpenID as our decentralized , open login mechanism , I have some thoughts based on my experience I ‚Äôd like to share .
First , to understand our position on OpenID , please read Does The World Really Need Yet Another Username and Password .
If you do n‚Äôt have time , I ‚Äôll quote the most relevant paragraph :
I realize that OpenID is far from an ideal solution .
But right now , the one - login - per - website problem is so bad that I am willing to accept these tradeoffs for a partial worse is better solution .
There ‚Äôs absolutely no way I ‚Äôd put my banking credentials behind an OpenID .
But there are also dozens of sites that I do n‚Äôt need anything remotely approaching banking - grade security for , and I use these sites far more often than my bank .
The collective pain of remembering all these logins ‚Äî and the way my email inbox becomes a de-facto collecting point and security gateway for all of them ‚Äî is substantial .
So if we are evangelizing OpenID to some degree , it is because I would rather be part of the solution than yet another brick in the wall of the problem .
Even if it involves a tiny bit of short - term friction .
Be the change you want to see , right ?
In the almost two years since we began using OpenID , that tiny bit of friction has gotten progressively smaller :
Google began fully supporting OpenID .
This was ( and is ) huge .
As you can see from these meta stats , Google is by far our largest OpenID provider at 61 % of all registered accounts .
Microsoft announced OpenID support .
Although there was a beta , and beta live.com OpenIDs were used on our website ‚Äî the current state of their OpenID support is in limbo .
Still , being Microsoft , their official ( though technically nonexistent , and I ‚Äôm sure trapped in strategy tax hell ) support legitimizes OpenID as a standard .
Most client implementations of OpenID have switched from ‚Äú enter your OpenID URL ‚Äù to ‚Äú click the logo of the company that provides your identity ‚Äù .
OpenID was frequently criticized for being too URL - centric when the user identity world is email - centric , so this is a significant usability improvement .
We implemented support for up to two OpenID providers per user .
This flexibility turns out to be important , so you can switch out or change the OpenID identities in your virtual wallet as you see fit .
It ‚Äôs handy to have a backup form of identity ‚Äú on you ‚Äù , just like in real life .
The trend is certainly encouraging .
However , there have also been a few things that happened which illustrate the risks of OpenID , too :
Several lesser providers ( Technorati , Vidoop , Mozilla Weave ) went belly - up , leaving their users stranded with no way to authenticate .
Occasionally OpenID providers will have bugs or service outages ‚Äî even big ones like Yahoo .
Fortunately this is quite rare , but it does happen , and troubleshooting it can be a pain precisely because it ‚Äôs open and decentralized , and there are three parties involved ‚Äî the website , the user , and the OpenID provider .
The OpenID protocol itself can be implemented in unusual or incomplete ways by different providers .
This leads to challenges for us , but fortunately we have an excellent dialog with Andrew Arnott , the primary author of the open source DotNetOpenAuth library we use .
We support the project financially and also try to contribute as many bugfixes as possible , so OpenID can get better for everyone .
There are certainly challenges , and although I am open to alternative login mechanisms , particularly for Stack Exchange , I ‚Äôm still bullish on OpenID .
We have to keep move forward on fixing the login explosion problem , because the status quo sucks .
To that end , we ‚Äôre continuing to refine our implementation .
Although I listed Google supporting OpenID as my # 1 improvement since we began using OpenID , their support also contains a bit of a poison pill ‚Äî Google GMail OpenIDs are specific to the domain you create them on .
In other words , the same GMail OpenID used on stackoverflow.com , serverfault.com , and superuser.com results in three different OpenID URLs being created .
This is completely by design , but I should note that no other OpenID provider to date has done this except Google .
To their credit , they do offer proper named OpenIDs now in the form of Google Profile OpenIDs , but this does nothing to fix the status quo for GMail OpenIDs .
That ‚Äôs a major bummer for site networks like us with multiple domains .
We use the OpenID string as your user ‚Äú fingerprint ‚Äù , so if your ‚Äú fingerprint ‚Äù changes , we ca n‚Äôt tell who you are any more .
It ‚Äôs a frustrating problem , but we think we ‚Äôve finally come up with a fix : we demand email from Google GMail OpenIDs !
If we have an email address from a verified OpenID email provider ( that is , an OpenID from a large email service we trust , like Google or Yahoo ) , then it ‚Äôs guaranteed to be a globally unique string .
We treat this as part of the identifying user token , attached only at login time , that is not editable by the user .
So our cross - site user account matching now works this way :
Match by GUID .
This is something we generate and assign during account association , so it ‚Äôs a perfect fingerprint .
match by OpenID URL .
This works for the vast majority of OpenID providers .
match by OpenID provided email address ‚Ä¶ if you are on our trust whitelist .
This works for those rare OpenID providers ( currently , only Google GMail ) who generate domain - specific identifiers .
This satisfies all known OpenID providers , so we can now potentially associate your accounts , across all of our websites , automatically .
You ‚Äôll still have to log in , of course , but the login itself could trigger account association for every site in the network .
There is one , and only one downside : we must demand email from Google OpenIDs .
Email is not usually required to use our sites , but you ca n‚Äôt log in via Google if you refuse to provide email to us .
You can always switch OpenID providers , of course , but we regretfully must make the email demand mandatory in the case of Google .
Still , given the overwhelming dominance of Google OpenIDs , we think that ‚Äôs a major improvement , and only a minor tradeoff .
Indie band Half Man Half
Biscuit have never been ones to court publicity , having once turned down the opportunity to appear on Channel 4 music show The Tube to watch their beloved football team , Tranmere Rovers .
But now the group , a favourite of the late John Peel , are about to become the focus of an unlikely campaign to save the BBC 's seemingly doomed digital radio station 6 Music .
A group of campaigners is encouraging the station 's small but dedicated band of listeners to propel the band 's song Joy Division Oven Gloves into the charts ‚Äì specifically to No 6 , to reflect the identity of their favourite station .
6
Music fans are being urged to buy the song this week in order to get it into the chart on Sunday 12 April .
The commercial radio top 40 , The Big Top 40 Show , has a top 10 based entirely on iTunes sales figures , allowing listeners to influence chart positions during the course of the Sunday afternoon show .
The Half Man Half Biscuit plan follows a successful internet campaign to make Rage Against the Machine 's Killing in the Name the Christmas No 1 in protest at the monopoly of the festive chart by X Factor contestants .
" We do n't mind if it gets to six or 36 , " said one of the campaign 's co-ordinators , Chris Shade , from Rochester in Kent .
He said it had started out as " a bit of a joke " , but the song ‚Äì from the band 's 2005 album Achtung Bono ‚Äì has now become an unofficial anthem of the station .
" The important thing is that a lot of people are getting very passionate about saving 6 Music , " Shade said .
" I hope it will help make the BBC see sense .
It is too important a station to lose .
With expanding digital radio coverage I think they will attract a much larger audience to the station if only they give it a chance . "
Mark Thompson , the BBC 's director general , sounded the death knell for 6 Music , along with the Asian Network digital station , as part of a wide - ranging review of the corporation 's operations , published last month .
The music station is home to DJs including Lauren Laverne , Shaun Keaveny and Steve Lamacq .
The decision to shut 6 Music was greeted with a howl of protest from listeners , trade unions , the music industry and the station 's own presenters .
A Save BBC 6 Music group on Facebook has nearly 200,000 members , and the BBC has received more than 8,500 complaints about the closure , due at the end of next year .
Geoff Davies , owner of Half Man Half Biscuit 's record label , Probe Plus , said the band 's singer , Nigel Blackwell , was " flattered " by the attention .
" But he 's not one to blow his own trumpet .
I was away when it all started happening .
Joy Division
Oven Gloves is a bit of a throwaway song - they 've done far more epic , interesting songs than this - but it's an easy laugh , the title wins you over , " Davies added .
Davies said 6 Music was a " smashing station " ‚Äì though not quite good as it was ‚Äì and the first national music station to play Half Man Half Biscuit since Peel and Andy Kershaw were on Radio 1 .
" It was a dream come true for us when 6 Music started , " he said .
The band 's previous highest chart placing was with Trumpton Riots , which reached No 27 ( and No 1 in the indie chart ) in 1986 .
Their albums include Back in the DHSS , Voyage to the Bottom of the Road , and CSI : Ambleside .
Tracy Mortar , who organised the Rage Against the Machine campaign with her husband Jon , said : " It 's another way of getting the station talked about .
The important thing is that people respond to the BBC strategy review . "
The " Let 's get Half Man Half Biscuit 's Joy Division Oven Gloves at No 6 ! "
Facebook site had more than 5,000 members today .
" After the BBC 's scandalous announcement that they wish to close 6 Music and the Asian Network , we want to propel Half Man Half Biscuit 's Joy Division Oven Gloves into the dizzying chart position of No 6 , " said the group 's Facebook page .
" We see this great slice of Birkenhead poetry as being a great representation of all that 6 Music is about , a home for new acts and classic music that gets no exposure anywhere else on the radio . "
The QLisp Project Development of a Quantum Computer Programming Language QLisp is a project that creates a formal design and implementation of :
‚Ä¢ A computer language for processing data on machines with non-deterministic ( probabilistic ) and quantum registers ;
‚Ä¢ a software simulator that can execute quantum software programs written in the language ;
‚Ä¢ the design for a hardware ( non-quantum ) parallel processing system that can emulate the machine with quantum registers ; and
‚Ä¢ using approximate polynomial models for certain quantum calculations .

Background
Simulating quantum events on non-quantum hardware is intrinsically difficult ( 1 ) .
A quantum computer can do anything a digital computer can do ( because digital computers are made with quantum atoms ) , but it can do many things in much less time .
Examples are searching for matches in a database , factoring primes , and of course solving the equations of quantum mechanics .
Quantum computation is astonishingly efficient in processor usage and time .
A quantum computer could , for example , solve problems in microseconds that would take classical computers hundreds of thousands of years .
Quantum computers , when they exist in large scale , will be incredibly useful .
A quantum search engine , properly programmed , will be incredibly powerful .
Previous Research in Quantum Programming Languages
Previous research is catalogued and summarized in the full project proposal .
A brief survey can be found online ( 2 ) .
Previous Related Research ‚Äî QLisp
In addition to QLisp , there also exist various quantum markup languages ( QMLs ) .
These include , notably , the QML of the Fraunhofer Institute ( 3 ) .
These , while not implementing general purpose computer languages , at least permit expressing quantum algorithms as a series of quantum gates .
It is a goal of this project that the QLisp compiler should be able to output a QML from a functional description .
That is , QLisp will not only permit the user to specify quantum computations , but it will produce circuit diagrams of the hardware that would implement the program ( 4 ) .
Why QLisp ?
Although we cannot today build large - scale quantum computers , we can build small scale ones .
In five years , at most , we will likely have large - scale quantum computers .
What will we do with them ?
What will they look like , and who will program them ?
No digital computer can accurately simulate a quantum computer , at least not a big one , and not for long .
So why bother to write such a language ?
The answer is the same for quantum computers as for ordinary digital computers .
Alan Turing ( and before him Ada Lovelace ) designed general purpose computer languages long before general purpose computers were actually built , and the design of these languages strongly influenced the way that the hardware was implemented .
Programmers in the 1960s generally traced out the execution of their programs by hand , because computer time was too expensive to waste on debugging loops .
As Professor Sussman at M.I.T .
Is fond of pointing out , the primary benefit of computer languages may not be that we can program computers with them , but that they force us to systematize our understanding of the world to the point where a digital computer can emulate it .
Existing proposals for QPLs are based on imperative language models , which is a paradigm that most physicists avoid .
Quantum calculations must , for example , be time - reversible , and something as simple as assigning a value to some variable can violate this rule , so ordinary imperative languages ( Java or C++ , for example ) tend not to be good languages for expressing the ideas of quantum computing .
Most QPL implementations require a great deal of book - keeping and explicit inverse function calls by the programmer ( in part because of the time - reversible requirement ) , although some provide assistance .
We are developing and implementing QLisp for these reasons :
(1) If you can program something , then you understand it in a very deep and special way .
The best ( and in some cases the only ) way to find out if your understanding is correct , is to run the program and look at the results .
Currently , we do not do this with quantum mechanics , except in very special situations and then with a lot of hand - calculating ( and hand - waving ) .
(2) We believe that practical programmable quantum computers are nearly here .
We want to study what we can do with them , and how we can do it , without actually waiting for Intel to develop the ‚Äú Quantium chip ‚Äù .
(3) We want to implement a language that not only has a firm foundation in quantum theory ( including a well - specified grammar ) but also one that mirrors the way in which physicists and mathematicians think about quantum mechanics .
(4) We want to implement a working model , not just a design toy .
That is , the model should execute reasonable programs in reasonable time and should support a high - speed simulator .
We want results , not just correct form .
(5) We want to use delayed ( lazy ) functional evaluation based on probabilistic calculations .
This is the strategy of putting off evaluation as long as possible ( until a result from one calculation is actually needed by another ) .
This helps reduce the number of quantum states that the system must calculate .
We anticipate that the methods may have application in non-deterministic non-quantum languages as well .
(6) We want to use a large grab - bag of other optimization methods to reduce or approximate actual quantum calculations .
When the system is then used , for example , to output a QLisp ‚Äú wiring diagram ‚Äù , the device will be smaller , which will help design actual and realizable quantum computers .
(7) We want to design and build a language that makes it difficult to program ‚Äú quantum bugs ‚Äù .
Programs that are profoundly quantum - illegal are easy to write in conventional languages for digital computers .
The simple assignment of a variable to a fixed state will probably be a quantum - illegal statement , for example .
Programs that make copies of quantum entangled objects are certainly quantum - illegal .
These types of ‚Äú qbugs ‚Äù can easily be caught by a functional language , but are harder to catch in traditional imperative languages .

A computer language for processing data on machines with non-deterministic ( probabilistic ) and quantum registers ; ‚Ä¢ a software simulator that can execute quantum software programs written in the language ; ‚Ä¢ the design for a hardware ( non-quantum ) parallel processing system that can emulate the machine with quantum registers ; and ‚Ä¢ using approximate polynomial models for certain quantum calculations .
The motivations for designing and building a quantum programming language ( abbreviated as QLisp ) are presented in this summary , together with the aimed results of the project .
The new language ( QLisp ) is an extension of the AI language ‚Äò Common Lisp ‚Äô , and thus is a fully general computing language for digital ( classical ) computers .
Extensions to Common Lisp to add data - types and operators are permitted by the Lisp specification .
Extensions to the macro world that implement quantum physics appear to be permitted by the specifications of the universe itself .

Programs that are profoundly quantum - illegal are easy to write in conventional languages for digital computers .
The simple assignment of a variable to a fixed state will probably be a quantum - illegal statement , for example .
Programs that make copies of quantum entangled objects are certainly quantum - illegal .
These types of ‚Äú qbugs ‚Äù can easily be caught by a functional language , but are harder to catch in traditional imperative languages .

Like this : ( MEASURE ( QBLOCK ( + ( QCOND (( QFN - EQUAL #‚ÄôF1 # ‚Äô F2 ) 0 ) ( T 1 ) ) ( F1 0 ) ) ) ) where the arithmetic operators like ‚Äú + ‚Äù preserve superposed states , QBLOCK is a quantum block marker , QCOND is a quantum conditional , QFN - EQUAL tests whether two quantum operators are equivalent , and the operator ( MEASURE x ) collapses the quantum state of x into a classical state ( ) .
QPLs generally have provided an imperative programming environment that really is not suitable for mathematical manipulation .
That is , it is hard to use them to write programs that manipulate other programs .
In classical computation , the lambda calculus provides an alternative computational model to the Turing machine , and fully equivalent to it .
The lambda calculus was developed especially for the study of logical function theory , and it forms the basis of several computer languages , including Lisp .
We do not propose solely to develop a lambda calculus for quantum mechanics .
That has already been achieved by several researchers , notably A. Tonder ( ) .
This quantum lambda calculus combines the benefits of both quantum circuits and the quantum Turing machine , and describes functions that may be composed and manipulated algebraically , like quantum circuits .
Tonder has also implemented , in Scheme ( a dialect of Lisp ) a part of his quantum lambda calculus .
The calculus has been shown to be Turing equivalent ( ) .
We propose to adopt , with modifications , the quantum lambda calculus of Tonder as the starting point for the formal specification of QLisp .
We chose to use Lisp rather than Scheme primarily because of the richer set of debugging and optimization tools available , and because once one has Lisp , it is easy to write Scheme , but the converse is not true .
Generally , QLisp will look like Lisp .
It will have some important differences , including a set of quantum - complete operators , quantum conditionals , and operators to reduce quantum calculations to real numbers ( i.e. to ‚Äú collapse ‚Äù quantum states ) .
(1) We expect significant advances in quantum error - correction protocols and networking of qbits , and the development of quantum information theory .
(2) We expect to make significant advances in exploring and understanding the relationship between classical probabilistic non-deterministic systems and quantum systems , including the modeling of certain types of classical systems on the quantum simulator .
For example , we want to study the relationship between the gate implementation of quantum mechanical functions ( which does not include conditionals ) and the functional implementation ( which may include conditionals ) .
We know from some deep mathematical results that these two are equivalent , but it is very hard to understand how that can be true .
The philosophical impact of this work will be to develop intuitions about the relationship between different branches of imperative - type conditional statements and superposed states of quantum gates .
This directly impacts on the nature of reality itself and the possibility ( for example ) of free will .
(3) We expect to make , at least in prototype form , a computer language that will actually be useful to program real quantum computers .
(4) We want to make the quantum computing language evaluator ( the simulator ) available on the internet to other researchers .

This is how , for example , gate array logics are often implemented .
QCOND is interesting .
In such a quantum conditional , the computer is , in some sense , taking ‚Äú both ‚Äù paths of the conditional , and provided no measurement occurs within the conditional , quantum states can be preserved .
The issue of what happens when measurements ( or entanglements ) occur within one branch but not the other is one that is difficult and that is not well understood .
It is one of the things we want to understand better .
Also , QBLOCK is formally unnecessary , as quantum blocks can back - propagate through compiler rewrite rules until they encounter ( for example ) a MEASURE operator .

A woman dropped her gym bag on the tracks of a crowded Upper East Side subway station yesterday ‚Äî then made the fatal decision to jump after it as screaming straphangers watched in horror .
The 48 - year - old victim , identified as Rose Mankos , was crushed by a northbound No. 6 train barreling into the 77th Street Station below Lexington Avenue as she tried desperately to claw her way back to the platform .
‚Äú She had one choice to make and seconds to make it , ‚Äù said Alfonso McGruder , 55 , of The Bronx , who witnessed the tragedy .
‚Äú She did n‚Äôt make the one that would have saved her life .
‚Äú She tried to go under the platform because the train was bearing down on her .
Then she tried to climb onto the platform , but she could n‚Äôt do that .
Then she just froze . ‚Äù
Mankos lost her life trying to retrieve a nylon LeSportsac bag filled with exercise clothes , toiletries and her cellphone , sources said .
‚Äú People were yelling at the lady on the tracks when they saw the train coming , ‚Äù said Hakeem Nhl , 53 , a vendor on the opposite platform .
‚Äú People were screaming , ‚Äò Oh , my , God ! Oh , my God ! ‚Äô ‚Äù
Witnesses reported that the train operator sounded his horn eight times and attempted to brake .
‚Äú I think she just went into shock knowing that the train was seconds from hitting her .
It looked like she just gave up , ‚Äù McGruder said .
Mankos died as soon as she was struck at around 3:45 p.m .
‚Äú You could see some woman with her head stuck in between the train [ and the platform ] and her arms sticking out , ‚Äù recalled witness Andrew Pistella , 30 .
‚Äú Some guy was screaming , ‚Äò Is this real ?
Is this real ? ‚Äô
It looked like a mannequin . ‚Äù
It was bedlam on the platform , with children , teenagers and old ladies shrieking hysterically , witnesses said .
‚Äú Who drops their [ bag ] down there , then jumps down there to get it ? ‚Äù Pistella asked .
Onlookers shouted for Mankos to lie down between the tracks or under the platform ‚Äî perhaps thinking of ‚Äú Subway Superman ‚Äù Wesley Autrey , who saved a fallen passenger by climbing atop him in the trough between the tracks as a train rolled over them in 2007 .
‚Äú I felt the thud when the train hit the body , ‚Äù said Glenda Farr , 52 , who was on the train .
‚Äú I did n‚Äôt know it was a body .
I lived upstate .
You ever hit a deer or something ?
It was like that . ‚Äù
A neighbor said Mankos lived alone in her Stuyvesant Town apartment .
NYC Transit spokesman Paul Fleuranges said , ‚Äú The message to our customers is clear :
If you drop something on the tracks , do not attempt to retrieve it .
Alert a transit employee or a police officer . ‚Äù
Meanwhile , cops were investigating a separate incident in which a 50 year - old man was struck and killed by an eastbound No. 3 train at the Utica Avenue station in Brooklyn .

Cost is about 9 / month .
A lot of moving parts !!
A recent short article by Kevin Trenberth and John Fasullo discussed the fact that our satellites that monitor ( 1 ) the total amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth , and ( 2 ) the total infrared ( IR ) energy given off by the Earth , have suggested that these flows of energy in and out of the Earth ‚Äôs climate system have been increasingly out of balance in the last 10 years , with an increase in absorbed energy by as much as 1 Watt per sq. meter .
Even though this 1
Watt per sq. meter is small compared to the average flows of energy ‚Äî which are estimated to be somewhere around 235 to 240 Watts per sq. meter ‚Äî it represents a substantial heating effect .
The problem is that the oceans have not been warming in response to this imbalance .
Trenberth and Fasullo seem to lean toward the possibility that this heat is ‚Äú missing ‚Äù somewhere , maybe temporarily trapped in the deep ocean .
Roger Pielke , Sr. , has voiced his opinion that the heat could not have magically avoided the ocean temperature sensors , both in space and floating around the world ‚Äôs oceans , which monitor ocean surface and upper layer temperatures .
Since I ‚Äôve received a number of requests to give my opinion , I decided I would weigh in on the subject .
While I agree that there is a mystery here , there are a few points and opinions I ‚Äôd like to share .
1 ) THE MISSING ENERGY IS IN THE SOLAR , NOT THE INFRARED
Trenberth and Fasullo do n‚Äôt highlight the fact that the ‚Äú missing ‚Äù energy is not in the infrared , which is where manmade global warming allegedly originates , but in the reflected solar component .
The infrared component has essentially no trend between March 2000 and December 2007 ( the last CERES Earth radiation budget data I have analyzed ) .
This suggests a small decrease in low or mid-level cloud cover , letting more sunlight in .
The fact that the extra energy is not showing up as a temperature increase in the ocean makes me suspect the measurements themselves .
If there is a problem with the Earth radiation budget measurements , then obviously there is no missing energy .
2 ) MAYBE THE DISCREPANCY WAS ACTUALLY BEFORE 2000
Trenberth and Fasullo correctly point out that the absolute accuracy of these radiation budget instruments is not good enough to measure very small radiation imbalances ‚Ä¶ just the CHANGE in that imbalance over time .
Well then maybe it was the period BEFORE 2000 where there was an imbalance , with extra energy being lost by the Earth , but no cooling , and NOW the solar and infrared flows are once again in balance .
Just a thought .
3 ) OCEAN TEMPERATURES ARE MUCH EASIER TO MEASURE THAN THE EARTH‚ÄôS RADIATION BUDGET
Trenberth and Fasullo briefly acknowledge that there might be measurement errors involved here , and I would argue that this is much more likely in the Earth radiation budget measurements than in the ocean temperature measurements .
The amount of solar energy the Earth absorbs is particularly difficult to measure because a monitoring satellite is only a single point in space , whereas the total amount of sunlight being reflected off clouds goes in all different directions .
Because of this complication , many detailed calculations must be made by the dataset developers to estimate the energy flows at all angles , based upon years of accumulated statistics with radiation budget instruments that measure some of the clouds at different angles .
I think the dataset developers are doing the best they can with the available information , but what we are asking the data to reveal to us is a very small signal .
4 ) ‚Äú YOU‚ÄôVE LOST ANOTHER SUBMARINE ‚Äù ?
We have already been dealing with some missing global warming in the last 10 to 30 years , since 95 % of the climate models suggest our carbon dioxide emissions should have caused more global warming than what has been observed ‚Äî and that is due to an infrared effect .
Now , we are told that there is missing SOLAR energy , too ?
This reminds me of the 1990 movie , The Hunt for Red October .
After an entire movie dealing with a missing experimental Soviet submarine , the end of the movie shows the Soviet Ambassador asking the U.S. to help find ‚Ä¶ what !?‚Ä¶ ANOTHER missing submarine ?
It was a funny line .
I ‚Äôm sorry , but at some point we need to ask whether all of this missing warming and energy are missing because they really do not exist .
This is Roger Pielke , Sr. ‚Äôs opinion , and at this point it is mine as well .
Only time will tell .

MOGADISHU , Somalia ‚Äî
At least 14 radio stations here in the capital stopped broadcasting music on Tuesday , heeding an ultimatum by an Islamist insurgent group to stop playing songs or face ‚Äú serious consequences . ‚Äù
The threat left radio stations scrambling to scrub even the briefest suggestion of music from their daily programming .
‚Äú Bam ! Bam ! Bam ! ‚Äù ‚Äî the sound of gunshots that Somalis in Mogadishu have grown accustomed to hearing ‚Äî was played by Radio Shabelle on its news broadcast to replace the music it usually uses to introduce the segment .
Similarly odd sounds ‚Äî like the roar of an engine , a car horn , animal noises and the sound of water flowing ‚Äî were used to introduce programs on some of the other radio stations that stopped playing music .
‚Äú We have replaced the music of the early morning program with the sound of the rooster , replaced the news music with the sound of the firing bullet and the music of the night program with the sound of running horses , ‚Äù said Osman Abdullahi Gure , the director of Radio Shabelle radio and television , one of the most influential stations in Mogadishu .
John Deere ‚Äî not just a brand , but a symbol of American pride and tradition ‚Äî has managed to find its way into various sectors of mainstream culture ( not just John Deere tractors ) .
The symbolic fusion of green and yellow brings no other brand to mind and is one of the most common custom paint schemes of the cycle world .

‚Äú John Deere ‚Äù is arguably the most consistently popular theme for both custom bicycle builders and custom motorcycle creators .
The iconic green and yellow livery says ‚Äú American farm tractor ‚Äù to an even greater extent than golden yellow says ‚Äú bulldozer . ‚Äù
Deere actually has a long history with bicycles ; and their farm equipment stores were a main source of bikes for rural youth in the late 19th century .
Their ‚Äú Deere Leader ‚Äù , ‚Äú Deere Roadster ‚Äù , and ‚Äú Moline Special ‚Äù were so popular that the company realized $ 150,000 in 1895 , just from bicycle sales .
Deere had discontinued bike sales by 1900 , but resumed again during the next ‚Äú bike craze ‚Äù decade - the ‚Äô70s .

Former President George W. Bush gets more blame for the country ‚Äôs economic troubles than his successor or Democrats who control Congress , according to a Harris poll out Wednesday .
Poll : Bush still blamed for economy
Former President George W. Bush gets more blame for the country ‚Äôs economic troubles than his successor or the Democrats who control Congress , according to a Harris poll out Wednesday .
Thirty - one percent of the 2,344 adults surveyed said Bush deserves the most blame for a rough economy , leading the second - place Wall Street by 6 percentage points .
Advertisement
Democrats in Congress were blamed by 16 percent of those polled , while President Barack Obama was blamed by 14 percent .
Republicans in Congress were blamed by 9 percent of respondents , and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was blamed by 4 percent .
A majority of Democrats ‚Äî 53 percent ‚Äî blamed Bush for the economy .
Republicans , meanwhile , blamed Democrats in Congress more than Obama .
‚Äú The memory of President George W. Bush and the state of the economy he left as part of his legacy still sticks in the craw of Americans , ‚Äù wrote pollster Louis Harris in his analysis .
Republicans were also split when asked to identify the most powerful figure in the GOP .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney rated highest with 14 percent , but he was swamped by the 44 percent of respondents who were either ‚Äú not sure ‚Äù or would have picked someone other than the eight Republicans listed .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin finished second among Republicans with 13 percent .
She was trailed by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , former Vice President Dick Cheney , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , House Minority Leader John Boehner and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor .
M - 1 Global President Vadim Finkelchstein told Sherdog.com on Tuesday that it was Strikeforce who was delaying a renegotiation process between the two promotions that would greenlight the return of the world ‚Äôs No. 1 heavyweight , Fedor Emelianenko , to the Strikeforce cage .
Sherdog.com had reported March 9 that both promotions were nearing the closure of a revised co-promotional agreement to hold additional events together in the U.S. , following their inaugural Nov. 7 venture Strikeforce M - 1 Global ‚Äú Fedor vs. Rogers , ‚Äù which aired live on CBS to four million viewers .
M- 1 Global , a promotional and management company based out of Holland and Russia , approached Strikeforce in late December or early January to revise the three - event contract they ‚Äôd signed with the American promotion last August .
Part of that deal included the participation of the nearly unblemished Emelianenko , who has been coveted and courted by every major fight promotion , including the UFC .
However , as of late April , the two parties have appeared to have come to an impasse .
M - 1 ‚Äôs reps insisted Tuesday that any burden in the stalled deal did n‚Äôt lie with them .
‚Äú In the renegotiations , we ‚Äôre not asking for anything new at all that was n‚Äôt already there in our original agreement , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein through the translation of Evgeni Kogan , M - 1 Global ‚Äôs director of operations .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre not looking for anything additional to that .
‚Äú There are certain clauses in that agreement which have n‚Äôt been lived up to , ‚Äù continued Finkelchstein .
‚Äú In one of these clauses was co-promotion , and given that M - 1 spent a significantly larger amount of money on the first show than did Strikeforce , we would like to see something along the lines of a number of M - 1 fighters fighting on the M - 1 Strikeforce show , the main show , the undercard , etc . ‚Äù Finkelchstein said M - 1 fighter participation was one of the terms in the original agreement that was n‚Äôt fulfilled .
Finkelchstein also shot down Internet rumors that M - 1 ‚Äôs newest demands were monetary in nature .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs been written on the Internet that M - 1 is trying to re-negotiate for more money , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein .
‚Äú This is not the case . ‚Ä¶
We ‚Äôre asking for changes to language in the contract in a way , which makes it necessary to adhere to the original agreement .
‚Äù In March , M - 1 Global laid blame for their dissatisfaction with the Nov. 7 event mostly with the media , and not their U.S. partners .
When asked Tuesday if M - 1 Global now believed Strikeforce to be in breach of the co-promotional contract , Finkelchstein again pointed to the lengthy renegotiation period .
‚Äú Again , it is not us who is stretching this process out .
It ‚Äôs the other side ‚Ä¶ , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein .
‚Äú No , we do n‚Äôt , at this point , consider Strikeforce to be in breach of the terms .
‚Ä¶
Certain things were not done that could have been done .
A lot of excuses were made as to why they were n‚Äôt done . ‚Äù Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker declined to comment specifically on M - 1 ‚Äôs remarks , and said that negotiations are ongoing .
Coker said that it is Strikeforce ‚Äôs policy to not negotiate in the media .
‚Äú We look forward to the fight on June 26 with Fedor along with our joint - venture partners , M - 1 , pursuant to our agreement with them , ‚Äù Coker told Sherdog.com through a representative .
Emelianenko , who knocked out Brett Rogers in the second round at Strikeforce M - 1 Global ‚Äôs ‚Äú Fedor vs. Rogers ‚Äù on Nov. 7 outside Chicago , was first said to be making his promotional return against former UFC contender Fabricio Werdum on April 17 in Nashville , Tenn .
But when a new agreement was not reached , Strikeforce ‚Äôs Coker voiced his intentions to reschedule the bout on a yet - to - be- announced card on June 26 at the HP Pavilion on San Jose , Calif .
‚Äú From our point of view , we ‚Äôre waiting for the decision of , primarily , Scott ( Coker ) and Strikeforce , but also that of Showtime , and basically delivering in the relationship , going forward , that which was promised to us in the first place , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein .
Asked to clarify Showtime ‚Äôs involvement , if any , in the renegotiations , Finkelchstein would only say that the cable network , which regularly airs Strikeforce events , had ‚Äú an interest ‚Äù in the talks between the two promotions , and that specifics of the contract could not be discussed due to the nature of the agreement .
Finkelchstein stated that the 33 - year - old Emelianenko would have been able to participate in Strikeforce ‚Äú Nashville ‚Äù last Saturday , and said the June 26 date was possible for the revered heavyweight .
‚Äú Basically , everything ‚Äôs possible .
This ( decision ) does n‚Äôt depend on us at all , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein .
‚Äú The ball is in their court .
Fedor is in good shape .
He ‚Äôs constantly training to keep his form up .
He needs around a month and a half warning before a potential fight and he ‚Äôll be able to fight .
So the 26th of June is not a problem . ‚Äù Finkelchstein said that , at this point , there was no deadline Strikeforce would need to make to ensure Emelianenko is prepared for the June 26 show .
‚Äú Peak - level training begins about five to six weeks out , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein , ‚Äú but that depends on how ( Emelianenko ) has been training ( beforehand ) . ‚Äù Finkelchstein said Emelianenko was anxious to fight again soon .
‚Äú Fedor is frustrated .
He ‚Äôs upset that he has n‚Äôt been given the ability to fight , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein .
‚Äú Again , the ( delay ) to make the fight happen , has n‚Äôt been on us .
It ‚Äôs been on the other side .
Because of their refusal to agree on giving us what was promised in the ( contract ) signed , the fight has n‚Äôt happened . ‚Äù Finkelchstein also addressed persistent rumblings that M - 1 officials have been secretly meeting and negotiating with the UFC for the last two months behind closed doors .
‚Äú Neither myself nor the M - 1 company is in negotiations whatsoever with the UFC , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein .
‚Äú There ‚Äôs nothing going on between us and the UFC , except that ( UFC President ) Dana ( White ‚Äôs ) obvious interest in Fedor from all of the interviews which he ‚Äôs done , is making rather a splash .
Of course , we hear about it in Russia all of the time . ‚Äù Finkelchstein reiterated their goal to come to a swift resolution with Strikeforce .
‚Äú We are continuing negotiations in good faith with Strikeforce , ‚Äù said Finkelchstein .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre not asking for anything other than what we were promised initially . ‚Ä¶
What we want is simply a 50 - 50 ( relationship ) .
We do n‚Äôt want a repeat of the November 7 show , which for all intents and purposes looked like a Strikeforce show .
We want to be 50 - 50 partners .
We want this to be a proper fully fledged co-promotion . ‚Äù

It 's been nearly two decades since compulsory superannuation was introduced , giving rise to the idea that we might have an adequate income in retirement .
In 1992 , the amount employers had to contribute to their workers ' super accounts was set at 3 % of their wages .
By 2002 , that super guarantee had increased to 9 % .
But most experts agree even this wo n't be enough to give most people the retirement they expect .
A long - time advocate of lifting the compulsory levy to 15 % is the former prime minister and architect of Australia 's compulsory superannuation system , Paul Keating .
Has your company every wanted to partner with Google on their Summer of Code ?
( It ‚Äôs not something they share , and I know people have asked . )
Do n‚Äôt answer too quickly .
You might want to check with some contacts in other departments , see if there ever has been interest in tapping the deeper benefits of sponsoring a summer coding event .
Red Hat took a look , which I wrote up in a report in the fall of 2009 , and that ‚Äôs the main reason we are doing Fedora Summer Coding 2010 .
If you work for or with an organization , business , foundation , non-profit , etc. that benefits from a better Fedora Project ‚Ä¶ consider if you have some budget to help fund a student proposal .
Aside from all the potential benefits to the Fedora Project that directly or indirectly benefit you , your company stands to gain more than positive brand image .
You help teach the next generation about how to be involved in FOSS , which teaches them the skills you want them to have when you hire them .
Red
Hat is not the only company who has hired former GSoC students .
We have the next 9 or 10 days to get funding pledges from sponsors for this first round .
If you think there is any chance you or your organization might want to participate at any funding level , please contact me directly and we ‚Äôll go from there .
Even if you ca n‚Äôt make this first round , contact me anyway .
For example , we ‚Äôre discussing scheduling a summer coding for the Southern Hemisphere .
This would make time for new sponsors in this calendar year .

Vatican diplomat : Plunging birthrates are part of economic crisis
April 15 , 2010
Archbishop Celestino Migliore , apostolic nuncio and permanent observer of the Holy See to the United Nations , told a UN commission on April 12 that the world ‚Äôs nations need to confront the problem of plunging birthrates in order to help solve the international financial crisis .
‚Äú As this Commission on Population and Development convenes in the midst of an ongoing economic and financial crisis , we would do well to listen to a growing opinion among economists that demographic trends are part of the problem and cannot be overlooked as an important part of the solution , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú The demographic crisis that in a few decades has brought down annual population growth rates from 7 % to below 1 % in many parts of the world , in tandem with the aging of the population , has resulted in devastating effects for the economy and governance . ‚Äù
‚Äú The correction of the population deficit with constant immigration does not seem to resolve the problems even in the short term , ‚Äù he continued .
‚Äú The same demographic policies that caused population growth rates to plunge to unsustainable levels need to be reviewed and redesigned along with appropriate social policies to encourage births . ‚Äù
Noting that two million women suffer from obstetric fistulae and that 800,000 people die annually from malaria , Archbishop Migliore also called for a greater attention to prenatal and childhood health care .

For the first time , Jay Leno 's average weekly ratings among 18 - 49 - year - old viewers has fallen below Conan O'Brien 's , departing TheWrap.com TV analyst Joe Adalian observed on Thursday .
Adalian noted that Leno averaged only a 1.0 rating and a 5 share last week versus O'Brien 's 1.1/5 average -- despite the fact that CBS was airing repeats of Late Show with David Letterman , which drew a 0.8/3 in the demo .
Moreover , Leno now benefits from a much stronger nightly lead - in -- with shows like Parenthood and The Marriage Ref being aired by the network in the 10 00 p.m. time period -- than O'Brien did when his lead - in was Leno .
" We 're not trying to say that it 's all over , and that Leno is now going to end up lower - rated than Conan , and stupid NBC , look what you did , " Adalian commented .
" But There 've been several reports lately suggeSting that the old , pre-Coco order had been restored to late - night -- and that Jay was once again the dominant king of the daypart .
...
Fact is , it 's still too soon to call the race . "

In the middle of a blog item about credit default swaps , Felix Salmon of Reuters drops the following nugget about Sen. Chris Dodd and the CME Group , which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange .
" Dodd ‚Äôs wife , Jackie Clegg , is a director of the CME , which paid her $ 153,219 in 2009 ; she also owns shares in the company worth about $ 235,000 .
( The CME makes no mention of her husband on its website or in its SEC filings , despite the fact that he ‚Äôs surely a big part of the reason why she has the position . ) "
Why is this notable ?
Because Dodd , as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , is leading a charge to pass legislation from which the CME Group would likely benefit greatly .
The CME Group 's two exchanges in New York and Chicago are among the leading exchanges for derivatives in the world .
Currently , many derivatives are traded over the counter ‚Äì not on any exchange ‚Äì but the legislation recently introduced by Dodd seeks to change that and put more trades onto exchanges like those owned by the CME Group .
This is anticipated to be a boon for the company .
The move to put derivatives on exchanges is something that has widespread support in the House of Representatives and the Obama administration , but what about the connection between Dodd and one of the major beneficiaries of this potential reform ?
Well , it turns out that Dodd 's wife has made a business of being on corporate boards , and last year , before the current financial reform legislation was proposed , the Hartford Courant described how she decides which assignments to take :
‚Äú She 's turned down board seats that pay more but could entangle her in issues her husband works on .
She 's hired an ethics lawyer to screen out corporations that might have business before her husband . ‚Äù
The CME , though , would certainly seem to have business before Dodd .
The CME ‚Äôs code of ethics would also seem to touch upon situations like this :
" Conflicts of interest may also arise when a director , or members of his or her family , or an organization with which he or she is affiliated receives an improper personal benefit as a result of his or her position as a director of CME Group .
Certain situations are so likely to create the appearance of a conflict of interest that they must be avoided . "
Press officers at the CME did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment .
A spokeswoman for Dodd , said , " Jackie Clegg 's work on this Board does not affect Chairman Dodd 's work on the Committee and vice versa . "

On his radio show today , Glenn Beck continued to warp the legacy of the civil rights movement in the United States by claiming that his 9/12 Project and the angry white Tea Party are the next phase of the civil rights movement .
Beck read the civil rights movement commitment card to audience , then said , ‚Äú It looks to me like the next phase of the 9/12 Project . ‚Äù
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Beck said , ‚Äú This is what they had every marcher sign , and I want to put this up on the website and I want you to sign it .
This is the commitment card that they had you sign , ‚Äù then he read the civil rights movement commitment card authored by Martin Luther King which states :
I hereby pledge myself ‚Äî my person and body ‚Äî to the nonviolent movement .
Therefore I will keep the following ten commandments :
1. Meditate daily on the teachings and life of Jesus .
2. Remember always that the non‚Äîviolent movement seeks justice and reconciliation ‚Äî not victory .
3 . Walk and talk in the manner of love , for God is love .
4 . Pray daily to be used by God in order that all men might be free .
5. Sacrifice personal wishes in order that all men might be free .
6 . Observe with both friend and foe the ordinary rules of courtesy .
7 . Seek to perform regular service for others and for the world .
8. Refrain from the violence of fist , tongue , or heart .
9 . Strive to be in good spiritual and bodily health .
10 . Follow the directions of the movement and of the captain on a demonstration .
I sign this pledge , having seriously considered what I do and with the determination and will to persevere .
Name____________________

Besides demonstrations , I could also help the movement by : ( Circle the proper items )
Run errands , Drive my car , Fix food for volunteers , Clerical work , Make phone calls , Answer phones , Mimeograph , Type , Print Signs , Distribute leaflets .
After reading the card , Beck added , ‚Äú It looks to me like the next phase of the 9/12 Project . ‚Äù
This is yet more evidence that Beck is transitioning from media figure to full blown right wing activist .
In Beck ‚Äôs mind he is the white Martin Luther King liberating the repressed white conservatives from an oppressive regime that is taking away their rights and liberties .
However , if you ask Beck or one of his followers exactly what rights they are defending , they will scream something about socialism .
If you follow up by asking what Obama has done that is socialistic , they will then get agitated and bellow something about health care reform .
If you happen to have some free time and are feeling logical , you can point out that health care reform ca n‚Äôt be socialistic because there is no public option .
( This is a good time to ask if they consider food safety inspections to also be socialism , because this is a reform of regulation just like health care reform ) .
Eventually the Beck supporter will get confused by your interjection of reality and call you a socialist , all the while clutching a copy of Beck ‚Äôs latest book .
My point is that Beck is mobilizing a group of angry white people who refuse to admit the real reason why they are so irate .
They are n‚Äôt worried about their rights .
If they were , they should have been protesting during reign of George W. Bush .
The truth is that they hate Barack Obama and they are still mad that they lost the election .
It makes it even worse for them that a black man has taken an office that they had developed a sense of entitlement to .
Beck ‚Äôs twisting of the language of the civil rights movement is a way for the right to justify their racism .
Glenn Beck is more Col. Sanders than Martin Luther King .
His movement has nothing but personal anger behind it .
These people have nothing in common the crusaders of the civil rights movement .
Beck ‚Äôs white angry mob has a level of privilege that those who participated in the civil rights movement can only dream of .
Beck and company are not being persecuted .
They are the angry white mob that wants their power back .
You ‚Äôve finished the script ( or as close as it ‚Äôs going to get ) and it ‚Äôs ready to be filmed .
Or is it ?
How do you actually know what you ‚Äôve written is any good ?
I ‚Äôm not asking if you ‚Äôre a good writer ‚Äì that ‚Äôs a different thing .
Good writers occasionally write bad scripts because ‚Ä¶ well , they just do .
Even geniuses are n‚Äôt geniuses all the time .
Primarily because there ‚Äôs no such thing .
Some writers are merely very , very good .
Usually .
So how do you know your script is good ?
Whose opinion can you trust ?
You ca n‚Äôt trust your own , obviously .
Because if you did n‚Äôt think it was good you would n‚Äôt be handing it over .
Probably .
Unless , of course , it ‚Äôs one of those drafts .
You know , one of the ones where the producer has asked for an extra female role so he can try and sleep with someone .
Or the director has insisted you make the lead character a talking sock because it ‚Äôll look cool .
Or you know this piece of shit is never going to be filmed anyway and just want the money .
A ‚Äò give ‚Äôem what they want ‚Äô draft because you know they do n‚Äôt know they do n‚Äôt want what they think they want until you ‚Äôve given it to them .
But apart from those drafts , you should always be happy with what you ‚Äôve done and you should always think it ‚Äôs good .
Does n‚Äôt mean you ‚Äôre right though .
Let ‚Äôs face it , how many times have you listened to a writer bang on about theme and what certain scenes represent and the motivations of the characters ‚Ä¶ only to read the script and realise in all this depth they ‚Äôve forgotten to include a surface .
Stories should be interesting and coherent first and foremost , deep and subtle is a bonus .
Sometimes we just do n‚Äôt get it .
Who else can you trust ?
Not family or friends , not even if they ‚Äôre writers themselves , because they will lie to spare your feelings .
I do .
I try not to , I write pages and pages slagging people ‚Äôs work off and then follow up with something like ‚Äú Apart from that , it ‚Äôs not bad ! ‚Äù
It is .
It is bad .
I ‚Äôm lying to spare your feelings and , in the process , failing both of us .
The producer ?
It is technically his film , surely you can trust the producer ?
You fucking idiot !
Never , ever trust a producer !
Ever .
I recently heard a director describe a trustworthy producer as ‚Äú someone who would n‚Äôt steal more than 10 % of the budget . ‚Äù
Okay , so producers come in all shapes and smells and they ‚Äôre all differently competent at their jobs .
Focussing on the story is your job , they have different thought processes like :
‚Äú Fuck me !
How much will that cost ! ‚Äù
or
‚Äú Maybe I can buy the location using the budget and then sell it afterwards for a profit ? ‚Äù
or
‚Äú Maybe if I give the lead actress more lines she ‚Äôll sleep with me ? ‚Äù
They do n‚Äôt know good writing , if they did , they ‚Äôd write it themselves .
Plus , producers read a lot of scripts .
A lot .
Think of a number .
Double it .
They read more than that .
Some of them anyway .
A lot of them do n‚Äôt and just pretend they do .
And of all these scripts , every single one of them is an astounding pile of shit .
Bad writing abounds and most scripts are plain fucking awful .
When you hand in a mediocre one it ‚Äôs like someone ‚Äôs shit rainbows into their eyes and pissed honeydew over their tongue .
In the land of the blind , the one - eyed man is King .
In the land of the producer , the retarded dyslexic is still in the top ten percent of writers .
If he can spell his name right he makes the top five percent .
So they have n‚Äôt got a clue ‚Äì they ‚Äôre just grateful if they can read to the end without falling asleep .
Directors ?
You can trust their opinion , right ?
Nope .
Directors tend to think in pretty pictures without stopping to think if the pictures make any fucking sense whatsoever .
If your script has room for some cool camera moves and shit blowing up , they ‚Äôre happy .
Actors .
Come on !
You ‚Äôve got some great actors onboard ‚Äì they must think the script ‚Äôs good , surely ?
Trust the actors ‚Äô opinions .
Or do n‚Äôt .
Actors , unless they ‚Äôre Hollywood A list , are permanently unemployed .
As soon as one shoot finishes , they ‚Äôre desperately looking for the next because coke and hookers cost money .
Even the ones in demand have to face the tidal wave of shitty scripts which wash up on the shore of their self - infatuation .
Again , with so many bad scripts out there they ‚Äôll cling to a mediocre one like a rat to a turd .
If your mediocre script has one decent part in it , one character who ‚Äôs even vaguely different to the roles they normally get offered with at least one good scene , then they ‚Äôll fall over their ego to do it .
Other reasons an actor might say your script is good :
It ‚Äôs a day ‚Äôs work for a few grand .
Why not ?
Beats staying at home with that whore / wimp they married .
It gets them out of the country until that whole pregnant teenager / drug bust / animal felching thing blows over .
They owe someone a favour .
They like the director and want to work with him again .
The producer has a different script and they want to star in that one .
They want to sleep with one of the other stars .
And so on .
Of course , the number one reason an actor might say your script is good is because they ‚Äôre fucking actors .
They lie for a living .
Do not believe a fucking word they say .
Who else is there ?
The crew ?
They do n‚Äôt care .
They get paid the same for a good film as for a bad film ‚Äì the script is inconsequential .
Yes , they ‚Äôd all love to work on something which is awesome so they can tell granny about it , but at the end of the day the only good project is one where everyone gets paid .
What about when the film ‚Äôs finished ?
If all the critics say the film is awesome it must vindicate your script , right ?
Wrong .
Critics judge the film , not the script .
They have n‚Äôt read the script .
When they say the script sucks , they mean the director ‚Äôs interpretation of the script , the actors ‚Äô delivery of the lines and the editor ‚Äôs ability to splice it all together sucks .
Conversely , when someone watches a film and pronounces the script to be great ‚Äì punch them in the balls .
Unless you ‚Äôve read the script , how the fuck do you know ?
And that really is the point ‚Äì you do n‚Äôt know if your script is good .
No one does , not ever .
Because ‚Äò good ‚Äô is a subjective opinion and everyone who reads it has their own agenda and filters the script through their own unique world view .
At the end of the day ( and this ridiculously long post ) ‚Äò Is my script any good ? ‚Äô is the wrong question to ask .
‚Äò Am I happy with it ? ‚Äô is the closest you ‚Äôre ever going to get and really , the only thing which matters .
Apart from ‚Äò Am I getting paid for it ? ‚Äô
Which really comes down to ‚Äò Is the client happy with it ? ‚Äô

In the digital age , many of us are compulsive multi-taskers .
As I type this , I ‚Äôm listening to some gentle music and my laptop has several programs open including Adobe Reader , Word , Firefox and Tweetdeck .
I ‚Äôve always wondered what goes on in my brain as I flit between these multiple tasks , and I now have some answers thanks to a new study by Parisian scientists Sylvain Charron and Etienne Koechlin .
They have found that the part of our brain that controls out motivation to pursue our goals can divide its attention between two tasks .
The left half devotes itself to one task and the right half to the other .
This division of labour allows us to multi-task , but it also puts an upper limit on our abilities .
Koechlin has previously suggested that the frontopolar cortex , an area at the very front of our brains , drives our ability to do more than one thing at a time .
It allows us to simultaneously pursue two different goals , holding one in the ready while we work on the other .
Just behind the frontopolar cortex lies the medial frontal cortex ( MFC ) , an area that ‚Äôs involved in motivation .
It drives our pursuit of multiple goals , according to the rewards we expect from them .
Koechlin wanted to understand how these two areas cope with multi-tasking .
To do that , he used a brain - scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to study the brain activity of 32 volunteers , as they carried out a challenging task .
They saw a steady stream of letters , all from the word ‚Äú tablet ‚Äù .
For every block of three letters , they had to say if the first one was a ‚Äú t ‚Äù and if the other two appeared in the same order that they would in ‚Äú tablet ‚Äù ( e.g. TAB rather than TEB ) .
If the letters were red , they would get a sizeable cash reward but if they were green , the reward would be smaller .
Based on this same set - up , they had to cope with two slightly different tests .
In the ‚Äú branching ‚Äù tests , they had to deal with two separate streams of triplets , a primary one indicated by normal letters and a secondary one indicated by italics .
The primary stream was continuous and the volunteers had to revert back to it every time they finished a secondary triplet .
They had to hold the primary stream in mind so that they could return to it after their interruption .
In the simpler ‚Äú switching ‚Äù tests , they started afresh with every new triplet , so they only had to cope with a single stream of information .
Charron and Koechlin found that in the switching tests , when the volunteers were only faced with a single task , both halves of their MFC were active , particularly the dorsal anterior cingulated cortex ( dACC ) and the presupplementary motor area ( PMA ) .
The more money was at stake , the stronger the activity in these regions .
In the branching tests , both halves of the MFC were also active , but they were split between the two tasks .
The right dACC took control of the secondary task ; when the volunteers could earn more money from these triplets , only the right dACC became more active .
The left half took control of the primary task ; its activity matched the rewards associated with the primary triplets but not the secondary ones .
The frontopolar part of the brain also became active during the branching tests , which fits with its established role in multi-tasking .
However , its attentions were n‚Äôt divided by the two tasks and it only became more active when both the primary and secondary rewards were higher .
This suggests that the frontopolar cortex plays the role of coordinator .
While each half of the MFC encodes the incentives of pursuing each separate goal , the frontopolar cortex encodes the incentives of pursuing both goals together .
It also suggests that we might not be able to cope with more than two tasks at the same time .
Charron and Koechlin tested this with an even more fiendish ‚Äú double branching ‚Äù test , where the two streams of triplets in their original experiment were interrupted by a third stream .
To succeed in this task , they had to retain three separate lanes of information at the same time .
They could n‚Äôt .
When they tried to return to the first stream from the second , or the second from the third , their answers were no better than guesswork .
Despite what some psychologists have suggested , it seems that the human brain is capable of multi-tasking although to a far lesser extent than a computer can .
While my laptop is running several different programs at once with nary a hint of discomfort , Charron and Koechkin ‚Äôs work suggests that my brain ca n‚Äôt handle any more than two tasks at once .

Heavy multimedia users are more easily distracted by irrelevant information //
Males often engage in necking , which has been described as having various functions .
One of these is combat .
Battles can be fatal , but are more often less severe , generally ending when one giraffe surrenders to the other .
The longer the neck , and the heavier the head at the end of the neck , the greater the force a giraffe is able to deliver in a blow .
It has also been observed that males that are successful in necking have greater access to estrous females , so the length of the neck may be a product of sexual selection .
After a necking duel , a giraffe can land a powerful blow with his head ‚Äî occasionally knocking a male opponent to the ground .
These fights rarely last more than a few minutes or end in physical harm .
Fanatic !
I hope you had an amazing and safe weekend .

When type foundry Hoefler & Frere - Jones released its typeface Archer two years ago , it was an instant hit among designers .
Multiple corporate giants quickly swept it up for their redesigns .
Smaller companies followed suit .
Online , Archer became the subject of numerous blogs , with everyone from website designers to scrapbookers granting their approval .
No one seemed to have anything bad to say about the slab serif and its elegant and functional , yet subtly quirky forms .
But Archer 's instant stardom raises questions about its appropriateness .
Can a font with such a defined character properly suit so many purposes ?
Archer was originally commissioned by Martha Stewart Living magazine in 2000 .
Hoefler & Frere - Jones combined elements of two opposing type styles : the plainness of antique serifs and the modernity of geometrics .
Archer uses ball terminals in both the lower and uppercase forms , creating ‚Äú a font that 's friendly without being silly , and attractive without being flashy ‚Ä¶ well - mannered , easy to work with , and inviting to read , ‚Äù according to its designers .
Archer is the ideal typeface for a magazine that serves all who aspire to a do - it - yourself lifestyle of perfection .
When Archer was publicly released in February 2008 , several other companies also rebranded themselves with the slab serif .
Suddenly , you would see the typeface on paraphernalia for financial institution Wells Fargo and its subsidiary Wachovia .
Does Archer 's inherent charm fit with something so rational and serious as a bank ?
In May 2008 , Newsweek hired the prestigious design firm Number 17 to make over the magazine .
But the adoption of Archer for its interior type resulted in some public skepticism of its use .
Andrew Boardman , designer and writer of the blog Deckchairs on the Titanic , echoed common complaints when he wrote that Archer ‚Äú is so over - used and inelegantly styled [ in Newsweek ] that reading the magazine is an exercise in futility . ‚Äù
He became so focused on the slabs and dots of the typeface that it became ‚Äú like reading a garden . ‚Äù
Boardman admitted that Archer is a ‚Äú great display face , but it does n't work for Newsweek . ‚Äù
Newsweek was n't the only journal to pick up the typeface .
In February 2009 , The San Francisco Chronicle also began using Archer for its mastheads .
Giant white titles now pop against various colored rectangles , creating a rainbow of headlines .
Matt Petty , senior art director at the paper , says Archer ‚Äú offered a bit of whimsy to a very formatted redesign . ‚Äù
His design team appreciated both the range of weights and the ‚Äú little rounded surprises ‚Äù that appear in some of the letters .
The Chronicle received similar flack to Newsweek , but to a lesser degree since the main content maintained a traditional serif font .
Now Archer is everywhere .
A simple Google search finds the font being used for a Mexican restaurant , political news blog , church conference catalog , ski resort , file - sharing website , marketing company , charity race poster and digital scrapbook , to name a few of the 234,000 hits .
Need more evidence ?
There 's an entire blog documenting Archer 's omnipresence .
Not all of these implementations are conceptually inappropriate , and most are even aesthetically pleasing .
But what is it about Archer that is so alluring ?
Why now ?
Archer boomed right when the U.S. economy went bust .
With unemployment continuing to soar and businesses declaring bankruptcy , with newspapers and magazines folding and personal savings accounts shrinking , Americans , more than ever , crave trust , comfort , friendliness and other fuzzy feelings .
Companies are responding , and Archer may be part of the solution .
Before adopting Archer , Wells Fargo 's equivalent typeface was Myriad , a sans serif font known for its precision and readability .
Myriad worked fine until culture shifted .
Banks needed bailouts and society needed reassurance ‚Äî Archer to the rescue .
Colorful posters with warm images of families and phrases rendered in Archer now adorn each bank .
Wells Fargo 's brand agency was attracted to Archer 's ‚Äú contemporary personable style ‚Äù that was both ‚Äú down - to - earth and confident , ‚Äù complementing the bank 's brand .
It wants to be associated with Archer 's graceful gestures , secure angles , and playful ball terminals .
With similar logic , Newsweek is n't the boring bearer of bad news , it 's your friendly next - door neighbor .
But not everyone needs a facelift ‚Äî the aforementioned ski resort certainly is n't struggling with a waning perception of trust like so many American banks .
And the typeface is n't exactly free of charge .
The smallest package of font weights costs $ 149 , and it takes $ 399 to buy the whole family .
This brings us to ‚Äú Most Common Reasons for Using Archer , ‚Äù number two : it 's pretty .
The truth is , Archer is an exquisitely designed typeface , and people recognize that .
If you use it , maybe your brand will look well designed too .
But an elegant typeface does n't simply translate to universal functionality .
Perhaps Typographica reviewer David John Earls said it best : ‚Äú Archer succeeds where others falter .
I only hope that in its use out in the wild ‚Ä¶ people give it the same level of thought . ‚Äù

Penguin suit ?
I 'd rather wear an All Blacks shirt !
Some of us just can't help standing out from the crowd .
But few exhibitionists are as startling - or as rare - as this all - black penguin .
The king penguin , described by experts as ' one in a zillion ' , is thought to suffer from melanism , a mutation that turned it black .
Dark :
The black penguin stands out from the crowd and has been hailed as ' astonishing '
The penguin shuffles towards the photographer as a ship lies anchored in Fortuna Bay , South Georgia
It was spotted by wildlife watchers at Fortuna Bay on South Georgia , about 860 miles off the Falklands in the Atlantic .
After being shown the pictures by National Geographic magazine , Dr Allan Baker of the University of Toronto described them as ' astonishing ' .
' I 've never ever seen that before , ' he said .
' It 's a one in a zillion kind of mutation somewhere .
The animal has lost control of its pigmentation patterns .
Presumably it 's some kind of mutation .'
The photograph was taken by Andrew Evans , one of those who spotted the penguin among several thousand of its normal - coloured counterparts .
The penguin takes a solitary walk across the beach in Fortuna Bay
A seal looks warily at the incredibly rare all black penguin
' Observing this black penguin waddle across South Georgia 's black sand beach revealed no different behaviour than that of his fellow penguins , ' he wrote on a National Geographic blog
' In fact , he seemed to mix well .
Regarding feeding and mating behaviour there is no real way to tell , but I do know that we were all fascinated by his presence and wished him the best for the coming winter season . '
Because black penguins are particularly rare there has been very little research into them .
It is estimated that about one in every 250,000 penguins shows evidence of the condition - but few are as completely black as the one pictured here .
Melanism is , however , common in many other species .
According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica , the condition is the darkness in an animal ‚Äôs skin , feathers , or fur is acquired by populations living in an industrial region where the environment is soot - darkened .
It can be gene related .
It does , however , mean that the probability that its members will survive and reproduce is enhance .
The condition evolves over the course of several generations .
But due to being lighter in colour , they become more conspicuous to predators .
March 15 , 2010 ( Atlanta ) --
Lowering blood pressure and blood fat levels to below current guidelines did not bring down higher risks of heart problems for diabetes patients , according to new results from a landmark federal study .
But for individual people with diabetes , the findings brought some good news in that the current standard of care worked better than expected , some doctors say .
Also , for people with diabetes that are at particularly heightened risk of heart problems , aggressive management may still be needed , they point out .
Overall , the findings underscore the need for most people with diabetes to focus on healthy diets and lifestyles as well as to take the medications their doctors recommend to improve heart health , some experts tell WebMD .
The experts are reacting to results from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ( ACCORD ) trial , launched 10 years ago to determine whether aggressively lowering blood sugar , blood pressure , and blood fat would reduce heart attacks and strokes in people with diabetes .
The new results show that lowering systolic blood pressure -- the top number -- to 120 rather than the usual recommended 140 did not lower heart attacks , strokes , or death from cardiovascular causes , reports William Cushman , MD , of the VA Medical Center in Memphis , Tenn .
Similarly , adding the fat - busting drug TriCor to standard cholesterol - lowering drugs called statins did not reduce the odds of heart attacks , strokes , or death from cardiovascular causes , says Henry Ginsberg , MD , of Columbia University in New York City .
TriCor is a fibrate , designed to lower triglycerides while boosting HDL " good " cholesterol .
The studies were presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting and released simultaneously online by The New England Journal of Medicine .
A third part of the research -- about intensive lowering of blood sugar -- was prematurely halted two years ago when it turned out that the approach was associated with an increased , not decreased , risk of death .
BAGHDAD , July 12 ‚Äî Clashes in a southeastern neighborhood here between the American military and Shiite militias on Thursday left at least 16 people dead , including two Reuters journalists who had driven to the area to cover the turbulence , according to an official at the Interior Ministry .
The two Reuters staff members , both of them Iraqis , were killed when troops on an American helicopter shot into the area where the two had just gotten out of their car , said witnesses who spoke to an Agence France - Presse photographer who arrived at the scene shortly after their bodies were taken away .
The Reuters employees were Namir Noor - Eldeen , 22 , a photographer , and Saeed Chmagh , 40 , a driver .
‚Äú When we reached the spot where Namir was killed , the people told us that two journalists had been killed in an air attack an hour earlier , ‚Äù said Ahmad Sahib , the Agence France - Presse photographer , who had been traveling in a car several blocks behind Mr. Noor - Eldeen but was delayed by the chaos in the area .
He said he was in touch with Mr. Noor - Eldeen by cellphone until his colleague was killed .
‚Äú They had arrived , got out of the car and started taking pictures , and people gathered , ‚Äù Mr. Sahib said .
‚Äú It looked like the American helicopters were firing against any gathering in the area , because when I got out of my car and started taking pictures , people gathered and an American helicopter fired a few rounds , but they hit the houses nearby and we ran for cover . ‚Äù

Lee Sustar looks at the background to the rebellion that swept out a Central Asian autocrat with close ties to the U.S. government .
THE MASS revolt that toppled the autocratic president of Kyrgyzstan had its roots in the impoverishment of the mass of the population and growing discontent over repression and human rights violations .
Predictably , many commentators in the U.S. press focused on the implications for the U.S. airbase in the town of Manas , a critical part of the supply chain for the U.S. war in Afghanistan .
Some pundits have pointed the finger at Russia , which was upset over the pro-U.S. tilt of the ousted Kyrgyzstan President Kurmanbek Bakiyev .
But Russian President Dimitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin could n't have been pleased by the sight of demonstrators who defied the police , seized their weapons , and stormed the parliament and the presidential palace .
Anxieties will be greater still in the presidential palaces of the neighboring Central Asian states of Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan , where despots fear a similar mass rebellion .
Thus , a popular revolt in a country of just 5 million people has sent shock waves through the region .
As Russian author and activist Boris Kagarlitsky said in an interview from Moscow :
Opposition demonstrators during a confrontation with riot police in the capital of Bishkek ( Vyacheslav Oseledko | AFP )
This was more of a social uprising then a revolution .
There is a lot of unrest .
But while people are rebelling against the current regime , they have no trust in the opposition , either .
It is a social uprising with very little political perspective .
Sooner or later , one or another group of elites will take over , because there is no other political force capable of doing so .
THE UPRISING comes almost exactly five years after Kyrgyzstan 's 2005 Tulip Revolution ousted Askar Akayev , who had ruled the country since its declaration of independence amid the breakup of the former USSR in 1991 .
The Tulip Revolution followed a split in the ruling class .
Where previous " color " revolutions in the ex-USSR states of Ukraine and Georgia had been largely peaceful -- and heavily influenced by non-governmental organizations with ties to the U.S. -- the Tulip Revolution involved more violent social clashes .
Bakiyev , a former stalwart of the Akayev regime turned oppositionist , took office promising a new era of democracy and social justice .
Once in power , however , Bakiyev soon followed the pattern of other Central Asian strongmen .
He ousted opponents within the elite -- including the head of the new provisional government , Roza Otunbayeva -- and used his political connections to amass personal wealth .
Bakiyev 's reelection in 2009 was widely denounced as fraudulent , and anger mounted over his effort to groom his son to succeed him in office .
The uprising forced Bakiyev to flee the capital city of Bishkek by airplane .
While he has n't officially conceded power -- he 's reportedly holed up somewhere in the country , plotting a comeback -- he has been effectively ousted by a rebellion with much deeper social roots than the Tulip Revolution .
Eyewitness accounts of the uprising make that clear .
Kyrgyz journalist Kumar Bekbolotov described how the rebellion unfolded :
A crowd began to gather around an old bus stop in an industrial area near downtown Bishkek .
Several speakers stepped up , rousing the group of 500 with impromptu remarks about the events unfolding in Talas , a northern region of Kyrgyzstan , where protesters had stormed a local government building and declared popular rule .
As the crowd grew excited , the riot police circled the buses -- wielding batons , shields and , in some cases , angry dogs .
Without warning , they moved on the crowd in a neat rectangular - shaped formation , rounding them up and pushing them toward the buses .
It seemed like a routine police operation .
But this was no ordinary day .
Suddenly , a large group of young protesters , screaming and shouting , tore through the police ranks , raced across the street , grabbed rocks and attacked .
Several policemen lost their batons and helmets in the ensuing melee .
By day 's end , the fracas had drawn crowds of 10,000 to 15,000 , claimed the lives of scores of protesters , toppled a president -- and altered a country 's destiny .
Braving police gunfire that killed at least 75 people and wounded hundreds more , the crowds stormed the presidential palace and parliament on April 7 .
Shops were targeted , too , as poor and hungry people seized the food and goods they could n't afford .
Luke Harding , a reporter for Britain 's Guardian newspaper , wrote that while the opposition claimed to be in charge of a provisional government , the real power was with the people :
Out on the streets ... there were few signs that the new regime was in control of anything .
The police and security forces appeared to be hiding .
Large crowds milled around the Soviet - era , fir - tree - lined boulevards , forming and reforming revolutionary huddles .
Dozens of shops had been looted .
Burned out cars littered the pavements .
The main government building was on fire , with thick , black smoke pouring out of its upper floors .
Hundreds of looters gathered near the White House presidential building .
The shells of trucks and a tractor lay next to destroyed railings .
Youths perched on an armored personnel carrier , seized yesterday from government troops .
By late afternoon , the general prosecutor 's office was gutted , with gangs roaming around inside , smashing windows with broken - off table legs .
Sheets of paper -- followed by a fig plant -- fell from a balcony .
At the parliament building , opposition workers were tossing posters of Bakiyev into the street ...
Much of the frustration directed at the ousted government has stemmed from Bakiyev 's appointment of many of his family members to key government positions .
In particular , his younger son , Maxim , was widely detested .
Inside Maxim Bakiyev 's wrecked and burned mansion , a stream of looters and the merely curious trampled over beds of broken glass .
On the wall , someone had written : " Fuck you . "
Nearby , they had added : " Death to Maxim ! "
A couple of fir trees were still left in the beds .
But the others had all gone , transplanted -- like the rest of Kyrgyzstan - - to a new and uncertain future .
ONE SPARK for the revolt was a big increase in electricity and water prices that would hammer a population already reeling from the economic crisis .
The Kyrgyzstan economy contracted by 1 percent last year , forcing an increasing number to emigrate to Russia in the hope of finding jobs that pay just $ 300 per month .
Remittances from emigrants account for 20 percent of Kyrgyzstan 's Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
The other mainstays of the economy are exports of gold and agricultural products , principally tobacco .
Child labor is widespread , especially on farms .
But the miserable economy is only part of the story .
Political life in Kyrgyzstan had grown intolerable , not just for the elite opposition , but also for journalists , pro-democracy activists and anyone who happened to cross the Bakiyev clan and its hangers - on .
The summary of the U.S. State Department 's report on Kyrgyzstan in its annual survey of human rights makes that clear :
The following human rights problems were reported : restrictions on citizens ' right to change their government ; arbitrary killing , torture and abuse by law enforcement officials ; impunity ; poor prison conditions ; arbitrary arrest and detention ; lack of judicial independence ; pressure on nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) and opposition leaders , including government harassment ; pressure on independent media ; government detention of assembly organizers ; authorities ' failure to protect refugees adequately ; pervasive corruption ; discrimination against women , persons with disabilities , ethnic and religious minorities , and other persons based on sexual orientation or gender identity ; child abuse ; trafficking in persons ; and child labor .
But the actions of the U.S. government speak louder than its words .
In early 2009 , when Bakiyev lined up $ 2.8 billion in loans and aid from Russia and announced the closure of the U.S. airbase in Manas , Washington responded with more money and political support .
Bakiyev not only extended the U.S. lease on the airbase , but recently agreed to allow the U.S. military to establish an " anti-terrorism " training center in southern Kyrgyzstan .
Less than three weeks before Bakiyev 's overthrow , the head of U.S. Central Command , David Petraeus , was in Kyrgyzstan to show U.S. support for the government .
Having already tripled its annual rent for the Manas airbase to $ 60 million per year - - a big sum for a small , poor country -- Petraeus was now prepared to pay $ 5.5 million to the government for the training center , which would formally belong to the Kyrgyzstan military .
Having played off the U.S. against Russia , Bakiyev was confident that it was time to tighten his grip on power .
Less than two weeks before he was overthrown , he stated at a national political gathering , " The world is actively discussing the shortcomings of a model of democracy based on elections and human rights .
There is no certainty that such a model is suitable for all countries and peoples . "
Bakiyev 's tilt back toward the U.S. did n't save him , of course .
And Vladimir Putin's rush to telephone interim government leader Roza Otunbayeva might suggest that the opposition running Kyrgyzstan 's new government is aligned with Moscow in the " Great Game " of imperial rivalry in Central Asia .
The reality , however , is more complicated .
Certainly Russia -- which has an airbase of its own in Kyrgyzstan , about 20 miles away from Manas - - will be keen to influence the new government .
But while Otunbayeva was educated in Moscow and was a diplomat for the old USSR , she also has longstanding ties to the U.S. , having been Kyrgyzstan 's ambassador in Washington .
Thus , one of her first statements as head of the new government was to assure the U.S. that the Manas base would function as usual .
Otunbayeva and her faction of the elite are likely to continue to try and balance between Russia and the U.S .
Boris Kagarlitsky said that the U.S. and Russia would both have to take a wait - and - see approach in Kyrgyzstan , since neither has much leverage .
" Both Moscow and Washington are really interested in Kyrgyzstan , but lack any tools of control at the moment , " he said .
" All they can do is just flirt with specific groups of elites . "
The question now is whether the mass of people who participated in the uprising -- and who suffered a terrible loss of life in the process -- will be satisfied with the new government .
Otunbayeva has pledged to convene a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution and hold elections in six months .
But the people are also in desperate need of jobs and economic security .
And what 's more , they 've showed their power .
As Kagarlitsky pointed out , the uprising in Kyrgyzstan will reverberate across Central Asia .
" This is definitely the beginning of the destabilization of the region , " he said .
" It will have a domino effect in the long term .
In the short term , the Central Asian leaders will tighten the screws , which will lead to more control and more authoritarianism .
The question is how far these regimes will go . "

From IRC
Wiki
Welcome to The IRC Wiki , a collection of Tutorials and Links all related to the IRC technology .
We have just started out with this Wiki .
Make sure you check back , we will have a ton of articles here .
The best way to describe IRC is that it 's a big pub .
The IRC itself would be the pub .
On IRC there are different networks ( IRCnet , Efnet , Undernet , Dalnet , etc. ) , which are then the individual rooms in this pub .
In these rooms , there are a lot of tables , which are similar to the IRC channels , in which the individual users are now sitting .
Apart from the virtuality of the IRC , the difference between the pub and IRC is the fact that the first one has to build a table , and the last one who leaves must take the table with him .
Channels are therefore dynamic and everyone can open one .
Also , the behavior in a channel is to compare with that in a pub .
When you sit down at a table ( / join # channel ) , you greet the people present briefly and follow the conversation .
If you have a question , you just ask everyone at the table .
By the way , it is possible to talk to someone at the table personally ( / msg ) .
The Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) is a computer program that allows you to talk to thousands of people ( simultaneously ) via the Internet .
This communication takes place in lines of text on the computer screen .
The IRC is known by its nickname , and everything you say and do appears under that name .
You can choose this nickname yourself , but it must not be longer than 9 characters and at the same time there must be no other person with the same name on the IRC .
IRC is a resource - demanding service that put serious pressure on even high - end servers .
Hosting Manual has web hosts listed who do provide IRC hosting .
Since thousands of users posting at the same time can be a bad experience , IRC is divided into channels .
These channels are virtual places where you can meet and chat with friends or strangers .
Each channel has a freely selectable name , but usually has to start with a double - crossing ( # ) .
If someone wants to talk about a specific topic or seek contact , they can simply enter an existing channel or create a new IRC channel .
Typical channel names are z .
For example : # berlin or #linux .
Besides these public channels , there are also private channels .
Here you can meet in quiet and secretive ways with friends without stepping into the broad IRC public .
The IRC language is English : the channels are called channels , the nicknames are nicknames and the messages are messages .
Nevertheless , the national peculiarities are maintained , and there are many channels in which only the respective national language is spoken .
The IRC program was developed in 1988 by Jarkko Oikarinen , a Finnish student , and was originally intended only as a communication system for his computer mailbox " OuluBox " .
It then spread via the Internet via Finland , and then the United States of America , becoming a global system .
Choosing a Nickname
How does IRC work ?
In just about every speech at their 2008 convention , Democrats promised voters that a change in the White House would , in Barack Obama 's formulation , restore " our moral standing " in the world .
Replace the unilateralist cowboy at the top with a humbler multilateralist , and the path would finally be cleared to fix vexing international issues such as curbing carbon emissions and dealing with the mullahs in Iran .
Like many of the party faithful 's long - nurtured beliefs , this hope has disintegrated on contact with reality .
" America is losing the free world , " said a January headline in the Financial Times .
While that statement is exaggerated , the sentiment behind it has been gaining traction around the globe , especially in the wake of the climate conference debacle in Copenhagen .
It 's not just that the less confrontational American president has been unable to deliver results .
He can't even get his phone calls returned .
" On the last day of the [ Copenhagen ] talks , the Americans tried to fix up one - to - one meetings between Mr Obama and the leaders of South Africa , Brazil and India ‚Äî but failed each time , " Gideon Rachman wrote in the Financial Times piece .
" The Indians even said that their prime minister , Manmohan Singh , had already left for the airport .
So Mr Obama must have felt something of a chump when he arrived for a last - minute meeting with Wen Jiabao , the Chinese prime minister , only to find him already deep in negotiations with the leaders of none other than Brazil , South Africa and India . "
It was easy for many Democrats to believe , during the nightmare years of " freedom fries , " that George W. Bush alone was to blame for the diplomatic prickliness between , say , Washington and Paris .
But the basic conditions for American foreign policy have more to do with America 's outsized position in the world than with any particular politicians .
Bill Clinton tangled constantly with the French , and now a visibly irritated President Nicolas Sarkozy has gone within a year from vying for Obama 's attentions to taking ( in the words of a competing politician ) an openly " anti-Obama position . "
Obama 's approach was supposed to produce a more cooperative Tehran and Moscow , fewer terrorists in the Muslim world , and vast new initiatives to fight global poverty .
Instead , Iran has murdered dissenters while speeding up its nuclear program , Russia has n't discernibly budged even after the U.S. abandoned its missile shield in the Czech Republic and Poland , a Muslim suicide bomber was stopped at the last minute from blowing up a plane over Detroit on Christmas , and global gatherings have produced even less concrete action than usual .
These developments illustrate a phenomenon that has been playing out across a variety of public policy areas : Progressive Democrats , after being outfoxed by Ronald Reagan , triangulated to the policy margins by Bill Clinton , then routed under the first six years of George W. Bush , are having many of the nostrums they championed during the wilderness years tested in the real world for the first time in decades .
The initial results of this long - delayed peer review have been a shock to the progressive system .
The Copenhagen crackup was a dream killer in more ways than one .
Not only did the breakdown give the lie to the notion that a cranky Texas oilman was the single greatest impediment to international cooperation and enlightened environmental policy ; it laid waste to the argument that yoking the developing world to a " do as we say , not as we did " policy of energy consumption will somehow prove to be an economic and environmental " win-win . "
If that 's true , the leaders of India and China ‚Äî the latter of which has been serially praised for its green - energy initiatives by the likes of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman ‚Äî certainly do n't believe it .
No amount of international do - goodism is going to prevent countries from acting in what they perceive to be their own self - interest .
Obama and the Democrats have been peddling a similar win- win line about the creation of up to 5 million " green jobs " in America , through a combination of cap - and - trade carbon permits , home weatherization , clean coal , higher gas mileage standards , environmental regulation , and various renewable - energy mandates .
The " green jobs " political juggernaut has been credited to Van Jones , who was obliged to resign as Obama 's " Green Czar " last summer after reports surfaced that he 'd signed a petition supporting an investigation of Bush 's involvement in 9/11 .
What 's interesting about Jones ' beautiful - sounding concept is that even its chief supporters admit there 's no evidence the theory is true .
Which is hardly surprising , since most of Obama 's proposed environmental policies involve making energy more expensive while using more tax dollars to subsidize expensive clean energy sources .
As The New Yorker put it in a long , flattering profile of Jones in January 2009 , " the mechanics of creating green jobs ‚Äî or even what jobs should qualify for the title ‚Äî have yet to be worked out . "
The debate over these phantom jobs , against a backdrop of double - digit unemployment , will likely suck up the political oxygen in Washington after the protracted health care debate finally wheezes to a close .
But Americans already have found empty pots at the end of other Democratic rainbows .
The $ 789 billion stimulus package of February 2009 , thanks to a theoretical " multiplier " that would convert federal dollars into more than their worth in job creation , was supposed to ( according to administration economists ) " create or save " 3.5 million jobs and prevent unemployment from reaching as high as 9 percent by the end of 2010 .
Instead , joblessness shot through the 10 percent barrier before the end of 2009 , and the government 's own tracking of the jobs allegedly created or saved has become a laughingstock with its double counting and imaginary ZIP codes .
What about the lobbying scourge that Democrats ( like all good opposition parties ) opposed so vociferously in 2008 ?
Progressive theory holds that regulation of K Street , as opposed to a cutback in overall regulation , is the key to " change the culture of corruption " in Washington , as candidate Obama repeatedly promised to do .
How'd that work out in practice ?
In December Politico reported that " Washington 's influence industry is on track to shatter last year 's record $ 3.3 billion spent to lobby Congress and the rest of the federal government ‚Äî and that 's with a down economy and about 1,500 fewer registered lobbyists in town . "
In the truer - believing regions of the progressive political world , the broad agenda of carbon price hikes , centralized health care , greater regulation , increased taxes , and government - mandated diversity in boardrooms are not just sound and moral policy .
They are inherently popular , if only the usual obstacles to justice and reform can be neutralized or removed .
Back when he was still considered a plausible stand - in for " the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party " ( enough to win 2.7 percent of the presidential vote in 2000 , much of it from progressives disgruntled at New Democrat policies ) , Ralph Nader insisted on a daily basis that his agenda was essentially " majoritarian . "
Such fantasies can serve as a salve when you live on the margins of the policy debate .
And as long as you remain on the sidelines , the underlying proposals tend to go largely unchallenged .
But now that progressive economic thought has its first real foothold in Washington since the 1970s , many long - marginalized ideas are being dusted off for real - world testing , from taxing stock transactions to " getting people out of their cars . "
If we 're lucky , those debates will take place before the ideas are cemented into law .
Better yet , maybe the growing unpopularity of central planning will dissuade the enthusiasts from inflicting their experiments on the rest of us in the first place .

Young Zhang Mengqian , a university student from China , got more than she bargained for when her ‚Äú boyfriend - wanted ‚Äù card caused a stir among her male colleagues .
On March 8 , to celebrate Women ‚Äôs Day , the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China , in Chengdu , gave every girl student a bland piece of paper , and asked each of them to put down their wish and post it on a wishing wall .
Here ‚Äôs what freshman Zhang Mengqian wrote on her card : ‚Äú My name is Zhang Mengqian , a grade one student , and I think I am attractive , but strangely I can‚Äôt find a boyfriend .
However I believe in destiny .
If you have the same wish , please come under my dormitory building and shout for my name in between 12:30 to 12:50 on March 11th , and I will observe you secretly up on the building .
If you ‚Äôre my type , I ‚Äôll come down to meet you .
‚Äù Combine that with a ratio of male and female students of 25:1 , and yo have a real horn - fest on your hands .
Zhang Mengqian message became so popular that on noon of March 11 , over 2,000 male students gathered in front of her dorm building .
Not all of them were brave enough to shout out her name , though , but that ‚Äôs maybe because none of those who did had any luck .
So i hope you learned your lesson Zhang Mengqian , NEVER ask for a boyfrind in a country with over one billion inhabitants .
That ‚Äôs a big ‚Äú no - no ‚Äù !

A gay and lesbian conference in Indonesia has been cancelled by police after Muslims protested .
The event , held by the International Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Trans and Intersex Association ( ILGA ) , was due to take place from today until Monday in Surabaya , East Java ‚Äôs capital .
But police cancelled the event after a group of around 60 Muslims entered the hotel where the conference was to be held to complain .
A statement from ILGA said : ‚Äú Negotiation has been going on between the police , the hotel representatives and the organising committee of the conference .
It was eventually decided to cancel the event .
‚Äú More information on the next steps to be taken will be given in the next days . ‚Äù
Associated Press reports that the conference was cancelled because police feared it could lead to violent protests .
Poedjiati Tan , head of the conference ‚Äôs organising committee , said : ‚Äú We want to convince Indonesian authorities and religious leaders that we only want to talk about social problems related to this minority group .
‚Äú We are seeking direction and a way out of our problems in health , education and issues of discrimination . ‚Äù
Two hundred participants from 16 countries were to join the conference .
Hamas , the Palestinian faction viewed by many in the West as a nest of terrorists and Islamic hard - liners , is battling a curious new epithet : moderate .
Fifteen months after a punishing Israeli offensive failed to dislodge Hamas from power in the Gaza Strip , rival resistance groups and some former supporters say the organization has become too political , too secular and too soft .
‚Äú People in the street say Hamas has changed , ‚Äù said Abu Ahmed , spokesman for the military wing of Islamic Jihad , a Palestinian armed group in Gaza that complained recently that Hamas had arrested four of its militants as they tried to attack Israeli soldiers near the border .
‚Äú They ‚Äôre paying a price for that .
People need to know that Hamas is still committed to the resistance . ‚Äù
As it struggles with tensions between its political and military wings , Hamas faces the classic juggling act of an armed resistance group that suddenly finds itself running a government rather than fighting to overthrow one .
Some see a window for the West to reach out to Hamas moderates .
But as it follows political and military paths at the same time , critics say Hamas is doing neither one particularly well .
To many in the U.S. and Israel , Hamas is hardly moderate .
The group still refuses to recognize Israel ‚Äôs right to exist and vows it will never give up violence as a tool against Israel ‚Äôs occupation .
The U.S. and Israel still label it a terrorist organization for its past use of suicide bombers .
But people in Gaza note that Hamas has n‚Äôt fired rockets at Israel since January 2009 and has pressured other armed groups to follow suit .
In January , Hamas shocked other resistance groups by issuing , for the first time , a written order that said rocket attacks were against the ‚Äú Palestinian national interest ‚Äù and threatening to arrest anyone caught in the act .
Instead of attacking Israel , Palestinian hard - liners said , Hamas has been fighting its own people : Islamic extremists in Gaza , including some disaffected Hamas members who pledge allegiance to Al Qaeda and accuse Hamas of selling out .
So far , the extremist groups , which on the Web accuse Hamas of being infidels and criminals , have been small and easily crushed by Hamas .
But they are blamed for a string of recent bomb attacks in Gaza , some targeting Hamas security members ‚Äô homes , offices and cars .
An early sign of Hamas ‚Äô predicament came in August , when the leader of the so - called Army of God ‚Äôs Helpers declared Gaza an ‚Äú Islamic emirate ‚Äù under his control .
Hamas fighters killed him and about two dozen others in a fiery clash .
This month , a new group announced it would exact revenge for that battle , saying it had organized 200 fighters to confront Hamas .
Jamil Mizher , leadership secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Gaza , said his group opposed the extremists ‚Äô agenda , but said Hamas has only itself to blame for their emergence .
‚Äú Suddenly Hamas moved to a political path , ‚Äù Mizher said .
‚Äú They used to support the resistance .
Now , they fight against the resistance .
So there is some kind of split in their ideas that has created an opening for these kinds of groups . ‚Äù
He said Hamas ‚Äô main concern now appeared to be avoiding another clash with Israel that might threaten its survival .
Israel has said it would hold Hamas , which took over control of Gaza in 2007 , accountable for any rocket attacks , even those by other groups .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs unacceptable and dangerous for Hamas to put new restrictions on our right to oppose the occupation , ‚Äù Mizher said , adding that his group will continue to fire rockets .
‚Äú They are just trying to protect their own heads . ‚Äù
In what many here saw as a Hamas attempt to counter such criticism , Hamas claimed responsibility last month for killing two Israeli soldiers who were ambushed after crossing into Gaza .
But according to Israeli and Islamic Jihad officials , Islamic Jihad conducted the operation and Hamas stayed largely in the background .
Some viewed Hamas ‚Äô execution last week of two suspected Israeli collaborators as an attempt by the group to demonstrate it still has a tight - fisted control over the strip .
At the same time , Hamas has courted officials from the U.S. , Russia and Europe over the last year , seeking a relaxation of Western restrictions on humanitarian aid in Gaza .
Hamas leaders have signaled a willingness to negotiate a long - term truce with Israel .
Robert Pastor , a Carter Center senior advisor who met with Hamas officials in Gaza this year , said the Obama administration and Israel should do more to encourage Hamas ‚Äô political engagement .
‚Äú The real tragedy is that we ‚Äôve had relative peace for the past year and no progress at all on negotiations , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú Hamas is in this halfway world , with one foot in the arena of militancy and violence .
With every day , it becomes harder for them to restrain the acts of violence from the other groups and , eventually , from themselves . ‚Äù
Critics dismiss Hamas ‚Äô political overtures as camouflage , saying the group remains as violent as ever .
The shift into politics reflects pragmatism , not moderation , they say , noting that Hamas still receives financial support and orders from Iran , has reassembled a vast stockpile of rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv and has been accused of torturing and executing its enemies .
Israeli analysts see the recent pause in Hamas attacks as a result of Israel ‚Äôs offensive in Gaza , which killed about 1,400 Palestinians and destroyed thousands of homes .
‚Äú It shows that the deterrence policy is working , ‚Äù said Kobi Marom , a former Israeli army commander who now works as a security consultant .
For their part , Hamas officials insist there has been no shift in strategy .
‚Äú Hamas has n‚Äôt changed , ‚Äù spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said .
‚Äú We are not more moderate .
We ‚Äôve been moderate from the beginning .
But because of the American arrogance , the international community does not hear us correctly . ‚Äù
But on the streets of Gaza , where half the people are unemployed and more than 70 % rely on international aid to survive , there ‚Äôs a growing frustration .
Skeptics say Hamas has little to show for its political overtures .
Israel and Egypt continue to impose tight restrictions on the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza .
Only a fraction of $ 4 billion in pledged international assistance has been distributed because Western governments wo n‚Äôt deal with Hamas until it recognizes Israel and renounces violence .
Many Gazans see little hope of resuming normal lives .
‚Äú If you look at all the suffering and destruction , I do n‚Äôt think Hamas would win an election again , ‚Äù Nidal Abed Rabo , 25 , said .
Two years ago , Rabo ran a cosmetics store .
Now , he sells falafel from a street stand .
‚Äú If you choose to be a government , you have to deal with the international community , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú Hamas ca n‚Äôt do that .
They ca n‚Äôt be fighters and ministers at the same time . ‚Äù

The Relational Database is dead .
It had a long , distinguished life that started in 1970 with Dr. Edgar F. Codd , but it has since seen its day .
Like the sextant , slide rule , and punch card , relational databases are becoming relics of the past as the industry moves towards better , faster , and awesomer .
Setting aside the fact that relational databases are incredibly , mind numbingly slow , they have a much more fundamental problem : they do not model reality .
Take a look at the world around you .
Go ahead , shift your eyes from the screen and survey your surroundings .
Did you see a perfectly rectangular world made up of rows and columns ?
What about schemas ?
And tables ( i.e. the kind without four legs ) ?
Of course not !
The world is n‚Äôt made - up of that stuff , nor is it very easy to model reality with such things .
Depending on what you ‚Äôre looking at , the room you ‚Äôre in has dimensions , contains walls and maybe window coverings .
The furniture in a room is constructed from blueprints / plans using wood and metal , which in turn are cut to size and are made up of even smaller things like molecules .
And those of course break down to atoms , which have sub-atomic particles , and quarks .
The point to take home is that nowhere in this picture is row or a column ; the world just simply does n‚Äôt work like that .
Another inherent problem that relational databases have is that , fundamentally , they ‚Äôre designed for insecure developers .
This whole notion of ‚Äú data integrity ‚Äù is a crutch for the weak that cripples the able - bodied .
I do n‚Äôt need some database telling me what data I can and ca n‚Äôt store : accept the bytes that I give you , and give them back to me when I ask .
I know what they are , I know what they ‚Äôre supposed to be , and I know how to use them , thank you very much .
Databases , Rethought
The latest breed of database ‚Äì post- relational , NoSQL , whatever you want to call them ‚Äì are certainly promising .
They have exciting names like CouchDB and MongoDB , and they work incredibly fast .
Plus , they ‚Äôre built to work hand - in - hand with the single - most fundamentally game - changing technology ever : JavaScript .
Think about and savor that last point for a moment .
Mmmm , JavaScript .
Think about how much code you ‚Äôd not have to write if you could go directly to your database from Client Script .
The other wonderful thing about the next generation of databases is that they ‚Äôre infinitely extensible .
In the relational world , it ‚Äôs just about impossible to change the schema once deployed , so many forward - thinking developers create Entity - Attribute - Value tables to accommodate change .
Non-relational databases , on the other hand , are built around this very principle !
Want to add an attribute to something ?
Just do it in your code !
The database will figure it out .
Looking Even Further
As great as the new breed of database are , they too are fundamentally flawed .
Sure , they ‚Äôre fast , but more like speed - of - sound instead of speed - of - light .
If Moore ‚Äôs Law taught us anything , it ‚Äôs that fast ai n‚Äôt fast enough .
Sure , these new databases can more - than power today ‚Äôs applications , but what about the next generation ?
I ‚Äôm talking paradigm - shifting applications that are so amazingly innovative that our primitive Web 2.0 brains can‚Äôt even imagine them today .
It ‚Äôd be as futile as trying to explain Twitter to someone from 1999 .
To prepare for the future , we need something drastically different .
Something that , like many innovations past , amalgamates the trends , calls them something similar , and then adds a version number to imply that what came before it was old .
This , my friends , is Datastores 2.0 .
Introducing APDB ‚Äì the World ‚Äôs Fastest Database
I ‚Äôm proud to announce that APDB ‚Äì named after yours truly ‚Äì is finally ready for public release .
I could write an entire book on the database engine ( and in fact , I am ) , but I ‚Äôll boil it down to the flagship feature .
APDB utilizes the physical memory locator ( CHS # - Cylinder , Head , Sector ) as data - access keys .
Think about that for a moment .
Relational and post- relational databases have the notion of index look - up , which means that retrieving a piece of data involves a long , arduous process :
Find , on disk , where the appropriate index file is stored
Look for a free block of RAM in which the index file can be loaded
Load the index file into memory
Iterate over each index entry until the desired key matches the index key
When / if found , load the actual data location into memory
Find , on disk , where the actual data is stored using the index locator
Look for a free block of RAM in which the actual data can be loaded
Load the actual data into memory
With APDB , this process is reduced to one step : go to the actual location that matches the index key specified .
No middleman , index files , or other nonsense needed ; just go directly to the data you want .
While some see disadvantages with physical locators , APDB utilizes these as advantages .
Take updating , for example ; by default , APDB allocates a small amount of data at the end of each object ( remember : space is cheap ) .
In the event that more data needs to be added to the object later , the sectors can be ‚Äú chained ‚Äù with ease .
The API for APDB , accessible via JavaScript , COM + , TCP , shared memory , and plenty of other channels , is as simple as can be .
For example :
int Persist ( int disk , int head , int cylinder , object data ) ‚Äì persists any object ( string , int , date , customer record , jpeg , etc ) to the specified location and returns the sector number allocated

‚Äì persists additional data to the specified location , automatically chaining sectors as needed object Retreive ( int disk , int head , int cylinder , int sector ) ‚Äì retrieves an object from the specified location
As you ‚Äôll notice , not only can APDB store any type or size of data , but it can do so in an unlimited way , offering infinitely infinite extensibility .
It can index it however you ‚Äôd want to .
Why ?
Because you ‚Äôre in control of making your own indexes .
With everything based on physical locators , indexing is braindead easy .
Just write a few helper methods ( or use APDB Recipes ) to persist to your index blocks , and you ‚Äôre good to go .
A pattern that I ‚Äôd recommend is to simply use the first head on each disk for your index storage .
It ‚Äôs more than you ‚Äôll ever need .
The APDB Engine & Architecture
When I set out to develop APDB , I knew it ‚Äôd be a challenge .
Performance is paramount , and there ‚Äôs only one language up for the job .
It ‚Äôs certainly not C , as everyone knows it ‚Äôs not exactly clever when it comes to overloading registers to save space .
Assembly was an option , but going directly with machine code allowed for a bit more tighter control with regards to how memory was utilized within the program code of APDB .
Of course , the real challenge with getting APDB running was wrangling control of the hard drive itself .
You see , ever since the introduction of the Logical Block Addressing standard , we software developers have had no control over where something gets stored on a disk .
That ‚Äôs all virtualized and determined by the little microprocessors on the hard drive itself .
Fortunately though , despite the multitude of hard drive brands , there are really only two suppliers who produce microcontrollers , and both of them use firmware .
And not just firmware , but easy - to - disassemble firmware .
It took me all of eight minutes to figure out how to expose the drive controller ‚Äôs physical addressing subroutines by remapping them through the now - obsolete writepath coupling mechanism .
By rewriting the harddrive ‚Äôs firmware , APDB can operate in the most performant mode possible .
Installing APDB
APDB is a stand - alone application / Windows Service , and requires very little to run .
Although the APDB Engine is written in machine code , I used .NET 2.0 for menu stuff , so you ‚Äôll need to have that installed as well .
All you need is a dedicated , IDE hard disk ( 3.5 ‚Äù only , for now ) , preferably one of the following models :
Seagate / Maxtor ‚Äìmodels number starting with ST3 or STM3 and ending with A , ACE , AV , or RK
Toshiba ‚Äì all drives bigger than 140GB
Western Digital ‚Äìmodels number start with WDA , WDE and end with A , B , C , or E
Hitachi / IBM ‚Äì all Deskstar drives up to 1.27TB
After requisitioning your secondary hard drive for use by APDB , the service will be started , and requests to the APDB engine will be fulfilled .

Which death is more troubling ?

I am surprised at the visceral nature of the rejection of the term ‚Äú environmentalist ‚Äù .
I had not realized it had gotten that bad .
I do n‚Äôt think I ‚Äôd want to be one of those if that ‚Äôs how people feel .
It also appears that the new preferred term is ‚Äú conservationist ‚Äù .
But as I said , I do n‚Äôt make those fine distinctions , so I ‚Äôm not sure how that differs from the ‚Äú e- word ‚Äù .
So let me modify my statement , and say that I am a conservamentalist .
I would define that as someone who thinks long and hard about the effect of our actions on the tangled web of life that surrounds us .
I was fishing herring in the Bering Sea one season .
I heard on the radio that the annual killing of the Canadian Arctic fur seals had begun , along with the obligatory protests that seem to be required these days .
We ‚Äôd caught about fifty tonnes of herring that day , killing on the order of a million living beings .
I remember thinking how if some creature has big soft baby eyes , it gets lots of sympathy .
But if a creature is slimy and has cold fish - eyes , its death does n‚Äôt matter .
People hated the seal killers for killing a few dozen creatures , while I killed millions of creatures and was ignored .
If I had to pick one word to describe my position on the ecological webs that surround us , it would be ‚Äú realist ‚Äù .
Life eats life to live .
I am not a man who eats the meat and blames the butcher .
I ‚Äôve worked a good deal as a builder .
I build with wood .
I cut down trees to make room for the building I live in .
I grew up in the forest , my step - daddy was a timber feller , the royalty of the logging fraternity .
I ‚Äôve worked killing trees on an industrial scale .
And I ‚Äôll also fight like crazy to see the logging done right .
with proper roads and proper setbacks , and proper slope limits , and reforestation .
I ‚Äôve seen what bad logging practices look like and do .
So for me , a conservamentalist is someone who has thought hard about and balanced the needs for wood and cleared land , balanced those needs with the way that wood is harvested .
I grew up in the middle of hundreds of square miles of virgin forest .
I have a deep and abiding admiration for that raw wildness .
And yet , I cut down trees .
I just want to see things done carefully and with forethought , see them done properly with respect for the consequences .
I do n‚Äôt elevate some mythical ‚Äú Nature ‚Äù above humans , and I do n‚Äôt forget nature either .
I was a sport salmon fishing guide a couple years ago , on the Kenai River in Alaska , as I described here .
Kenai River king salmon are magnificent beings , fifty pounds or more of powerful , glittering , awe - inspiring fish .
When one of my clients caught a salmon , I always thanked the fish in a loud voice for giving up its life for us .
Life eats life , beings die so that I can live , and I ca n‚Äôt ignore that .
I do n‚Äôt let it keep me from fishing salmon , but I wo n‚Äôt pretend that I am not killing a splendiferous entity .
Some of my clients understood .
Heck , I apologize to trees when I cut them down .
Yeah , I know it looks dumb , a grown man talking to trees .
But it does n‚Äôt stop me from cutting them down by the scores if need be , I ‚Äôm a realist .
Life eats life .
Me , I do n‚Äôt take killing anything lightly , be it redwood or herring or salmon .
Someday , I ‚Äôll be chopped down in the same way .
So I ‚Äôm forming the Conservamentalist Party , our motto will be , ‚Äú Conservamentalists unite !
You have nothing to lose but your minds ‚Äù .
Now , back to the climate ‚Ä¶

A new scientific study warns that sea level could rise much faster than previously expected .
By the year 2100 , global sea level could rise between 75 and 190 centimetres , according to a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The authors , Martin Vermeer of Helsinki University of Technology in Finland and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany , based their analysis on measurements of sea level and temperature taken over the past 130 years .
In those data they identified a strong link between the rate of sea level rise and global temperature .
" Since 1990 sea level has been rising at 3.4 millimetres per year , twice as fast as on average over the 20th Century , " says Stefan Rahmstorf .
Even if that rate just remained steady , this would already lead to 34 centimetres rise in the 21st century .
" But the data show us clearly : the warmer it gets , the faster sea level rises .
If we want to prevent a galloping sea level rise , we should stop global warming as soon as possible , " adds Rahmstorf .
The link between the rate of sea level rise and global temperature was originally proposed by Rahmstorf in an article in the journal Science in 2007 .
The new study refines this idea .
It adds a second term to the equation in order to capture the short - term response of sea level , leading to greater physical realism as well as a much greater precision .
Vermeer and Rahmstorf also added the latest data sets , including satellite measurements up to 2008 and a correction for water storage in man-made reservoirs , which overall lowers global sea level by 3 centimetres .
Their results show that even for a relatively low greenhouse gas emissions scenario with just 2 degrees Celsius warming over the 21st century , sea level is likely to rise by more than one meter .
Their highest scenario , with over 4 degrees Celsius warming over the 21st century , would lead to over 1.4 meters of sea level rise by 2100 .
When the full set of emissions scenarios and estimated uncertainties are considered , waters may rise by anything between 75 centimetres and 1.9 metres by the year 2100 -- consistent with another recent estimate of an upper limit of 2 metres , based on consideration of ice sheet dynamics .
" More noteworthy even than the very high figures for sea level rise is the almost clockwork precision by which , on climatic time scales , temperature drives sea level rise , " says Martin Vermeer .
The results of the study also demonstrate the quality of the existing sea level and temperature time series used , " painstakingly constructed from measurements at stations around the globe for well over a century , " Vermeer notes .
The projected rise is about three times as much as estimated in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 , which did not fully include the effects of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica .
To avoid such a large sea level rise , which would be an existential threat to many large coastal cities as well as a number of small island nations , drastic and rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will be required .
The study finds that delays in emissions reductions will come at a high cost , since early emissions cuts are much more effective in limiting sea level rise than later cuts .
The emissions reductions needed to keep sea level rise below 1 meter will likely be considerably more ambitious than those needed to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius , a policy goal now supported by many nations .

We apologise for these images but they speak more eloquently than any politician of the plight of Zimbabwe 's starving people
For us it is a saddening sight - a magnificent bull elephant struck down in his old age .
But for the starving of Zimbabwe , it was little short of a miracle .
The carcass provided a vital source of food , and hundreds of desperate villagers in the Gonarezhou National Park descended on the dead animal within minutes of its discovery .
Using machetes , axes and knives made from tin cans they set upon the six - ton carcass , which was found deep in scrubland .
Fallen giant :
The corpse of the bull elephant lies undisturbed in deep scrubland in Gonarezhou National Park
The desperate descend : Within minutes , starving villagers arrive at the carcass
Fights broke out as villagers battled to strip chunks of flesh from the animal and drag them away to feed their families .
It took just one hour and 47 minutes for the 13 ft - tall elephant to be reduced to a skeleton .
Every part was used for food , even the trunk and ears .
The bones of the 70 - year - old animal were taken to boil for soup and within 24 hours nothing was left but a blood - stained patch of earth .
The images are undeniably shocking .
But they illustrate the terrible lengths to which Zimbabweans are forced to go just to survive under Robert Mugabe .
Yesterday , the Red Cross warned the situation in the former British colony is ' critical ' with 2.17 million - one in four of the population - requiring urgent food aid .
Battle begins : Soon , the villagers are fighting to get the urgently - needed meat
Audience : People gather on a hill a short distance away to watch village men get to work
Emma Kundishora , of the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society , said : ' In some parts of the country , the food situation is as bad as many of our volunteers and staff have ever seen . '
Conditions are expected to deteriorate further this year following the collapse of agriculture caused by President Mugabe 's violent seizures of thousands of white - owned farms since 2000 .
Erratic rain has also damaged crops of corn .
Harvests could produce just 500,000 - tons this year , less than a third of the amount required to feed the nation .
Photographer David Chancellor said : ' Just after dawn a villager spotted the carcass as he passed on a bicycle .
' It was in the middle of nowhere , but within 15 minutes hundreds of people had arrived from all directions .
Brutally effective : Nothing goes to waste , with the skin , trunk and ears all removed
Starving : Zimbabweans grapple with each other as they set upon the elephant to get meat
Stripped :
After less than two hours , only bones remain .
Even these will later be taken
Desperate : A blood - spattered villager and , right , the spot where the bull elephant lay is completely cleared just 24 hours after it was found
' The women formed a ring around the elephant and the men stood inside , fighting and stabbing each other to get to the meat . '
He added : ' The meat was taken back to homes .
Some was eaten immediately but most was dried on washing lines and stored to eat later .
Sarah Palin signs her book ' Going Rogue ' during a book signing event at a Barnes and Noble book store in Grand Rapids , Michigan , November 18 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Rebecca Cook
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin will come out with a new book that is a ‚Äú celebration of American virtues and strengths , ‚Äù publisher HarperCollins announced on Thursday .
The as - yet untitled book by Palin , widely considered to be weighing a run for U.S. president , will feature selections of readings that have inspired her and portraits of people she admires , the publisher said .
‚Äú She will also draw from her personal experience to amplify these timely ( and timeless ) themes , ‚Äù HarperCollins said in a statement .
Palin ‚Äôs first book , ‚Äú Going Rogue , ‚Äù has sold more than 2.2 million copies , HarperCollins said .
Palin ran unsuccessfully for vice president on the Republican ticket with presidential nominee Sen. John McCain in 2008 .
She was governor of Alaska at the time .
Since then , Palin resigned as governor and has made public appearances before such groups as the conservative ‚Äú Tea Party ‚Äù movement and on NBC television ‚Äôs ‚Äú Tonight Show . ‚Äù
She also has been hired as a commentator on Fox News , where she recently said she was open to a possible White House run in 2012 but had not made up her mind .
The publisher , part of Rupert Murdoch ‚Äôs News Corp empire , did not disclose the amount of Palin ‚Äôs advance for the new book .
Fresh snow this morning gave trackers new hope that Kitchi , the otter missing since March 25 , might still be in the area around the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo .
Tracks possibly belonging to the 20 - pound brown river otter were found near Westmeadow Drive in Colorado Springs near a culvert and the Cheyenne Meadows ‚Äô King Soopers , the zoo said this afternoon .
‚Äú A river otter has the capability of moving within a 10 square mile area in one day , but this gives the zoo an opportunity to now refocus their search , ‚Äù Cheyenne Mountain Zoo said in a statement .
People in the area are being asked to pay attention for the otter , its tracks or any other evidence that might indicate its around .
The zoo has set up an Otter Hotline at 719-648-7348 .
Cell phone phones or other images are especially helpful , according to the zoo .
The zoo stressed that the otter poses no threat to people or their pets , but it does have a taste for fish .
.
So life has been busy , too busy , with money needing to be made and real life interfering with the making of more entries .
We ‚Äôll try to update more regularly , for those few who still care about us * sob* .

GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU , the overworked Greek finance minister , likens the effort to steer Greece away from economic disaster to ‚Äú changing the course of the Titanic . ‚Äù
Until this week it looked as if the country was headed for an iceberg labelled default .
Two austerity packages had failed to convince Greece 's European partners ‚Äî or the financial markets ‚Äî that measures to cut the budget deficit this year from 12.7 % of GDP to 8.7 % would work .
Critics in Brussels said that Greece 's Socialist government was relying too heavily on pledges to cut tax evasion and soak the rich , rather than slash spending , especially on public - sector pay and pensions .
The markets pushed spreads on Greek bonds over their German equivalents to record highs .
Greece 's ten - year bonds were offering mouth - watering yields of some 6 % , twice the German level .
On March 3rd , however , the mood changed .
George Papandreou , the prime minister , at last threw his full weight behind austerity .
His government announced some severe measures : a rise in the top rate of value - added tax , from 19 % to 21 % , higher taxes on fuel , tobacco and alcohol , a freeze on pensions and a 30 % cut in civil servants '
Christmas , Easter and summer bonuses .
This last is equivalent to a cut of one month 's pay for Greece 's 700,000 - strong public - sector workforce .
On March 4th Greece resumed some bond sales .
Mr Papandreou had shrugged off earlier warnings from Brussels ( and Berlin ) that more had to be done .
He changed tack after blunt remarks by Olli Rehn , the new European economics commissioner who visited Athens this week , that extra measures were needed to meet this year 's deficit target .
Mr Papandreou claimed that Greece had now taken enough ‚Äú painful but necessary measures ‚Äù to qualify for support from its European partners , but without specifying what form that might take .
Greece desperately needs ‚Ç¨ 20 billion ( $ 27 billion ) in the next two months to roll over expiring debt .
If it can get it , more than half this year 's borrowing requirement of ‚Ç¨ 53 billion will have been covered and the markets ' pressure will ease , say bankers .
One way forward might be to persuade other euro - area countries to buy Greek bonds , perhaps by providing guarantees for euro - area investors .
‚Äú We want to be able to borrow at the same rates as other euro - zone countries , ‚Äù Mr Papandreou said , perhaps optimistically given Greece 's record of huge budget deficits and deceitful accounting .
On the other hand , as he has also pointed out , Greece cannot afford to go on borrowing indefinitely at 350 basis points over Germany .
The gains from austerity measures could be swallowed up by such a high debt premium .
Imminent visits by Mr Papandreou to Berlin , Paris and Washington , DC , could help to resolve Greece 's debt problem .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , has considered the possibility of Germany providing bilateral help to Greece , though she insists she is not yet ready to talk about aid with Mr Papandreou .
Germans still fret about moral hazard : a bail - out would mean that Greece gets away with years of irresponsible fiscal policy and could set a bad precedent for other euro delinquents .
The German constitutional court ruled two decades ago that the Maastricht treaty was acceptable only if its no bail - out provisions were respected ‚Äî so any bail - out would have to be disguised to avoid legal challenges .
Yet German banks are on the hook for so much Greek ( and other Mediterranean ) debt that some kind of taxpayer support may be unavoidable .
France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , seems readier to help ‚Äî though Greece may come under pressure to buy more expensive French frigates for its navy .
This is not a deal that Mr Papandreou likes , since Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Turkey 's prime minister , has just proposed that the two formerly hostile neighbours should make a joint agreement to cut defence spending .
To strengthen his hand with the rest of the euro zone , Mr Papandreou is threatening to turn to the IMF for a standby loan .
The conditions are unlikely to be much harsher than the latest austerity measures , say Greek officials .
But this could also be too optimistic .
The IMF would probably tell Greece to sack thousands of public - sector workers and cut pensions sharply .
Even so , as one Greek official notes , ‚Äú at least with the fund you can stop worrying about where to get the money to finance the debt . ‚Äù
Greek trade unions are predictably furious over the bonus cuts , which come on top of a 4 % pay cut they have already swallowed .
Strikes will spread ; on March 4th protesters briefly occupied the finance ministry .
Some strikers are unpopular , for example the taxi drivers .
There is more sympathy for pensioners , who face a double blow from a freeze in pensions and the impact of tax rises .
Militant pensioners unexpectedly broke through a police cordon blocking the road to Mr Papandreou 's office as he was announcing the new measures .
They will soon be on the march again , says their union .
‚Äú You can not make ends meet on ‚Ç¨400 a month , ‚Äù declared one retired plumber .
So far Mr Papandreou 's approval ratings have held up , with more than 60 % of Greeks accepting that tougher measures are needed .
Fears loom over the timetable set in Brussels for implementing the new plans .
Greece will shortly complete an overhaul of its tax legislation and come up with proposals to reform state pensions , which now eat up over 11 % of GDP .
A shortage of competent bureaucrats makes it harder to ensure that any new targets are met .
If Greece is to stay on course , Mr Papaconstantinou and his team will have to keep putting in long hours .
In a headline trumpeting the wrong thing , Bloomberg is reporting Unemployment Decreased in Nine U.S. States in January .
The unemployment rate decreased in nine U.S. states in January and climbed in 30 , signaling the thawing of the labor market is not broad - based .
The jobless rate in Michigan showed the biggest drop , falling to 14.3 percent , still the highest in the nation , from 14.5 percent in December , according to figures issued today by the Labor Department in Washington .
New York and New Jersey were among eight states where unemployment decreased by a tenth of a point .
A national unemployment projected to average 9.8 percent this year signals state budgets will be strained by decreases in tax revenue and rising jobless insurance payments .
The loss of 8.4 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007 means the labor market in the world ‚Äôs largest economy will take years to rebound .
‚Äú This is a recovery that ‚Äôs really kind of concentrated , ‚Äù said Steven Cochrane , director of regional economics at Moody ‚Äôs Economy.com in West Chester , Pennsylvania .
‚Äú It still portends weakness in income - tax revenue and sales - tax revenue into fiscal year 2011 . ‚Äù
Unemployment in the Detroit area , home to General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. , dropped to 15.3 percent from 16 percent in December , contributing to the decrease in Michigan ‚Äôs jobless rate .
States showing the most improvement in coming months will probably be those with a large manufacturing base , said Moody ‚Äôs Economy.com ‚Äôs Cochrane .
The need to rebuild inventories and growing exports is propelling a factory rebound that will help some parts of the country over others , he said .
Unemployment in California , Florida , Georgia , North and South Carolina and the District of Columbia climbed to the highest levels since records began in 1976 .
Regional and State Report
Thirty states and the District of Columbia recorded over - the - month unemployment rate increases , 9 states registered rate decreases , and 11 states had no rate change , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today .
Over the year , jobless rates increased in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .
The national unemployment rate fell from 10.0 percent in December to 9.7 percent in January , but was up from 7.7 percent a year earlier .
In January , nonfarm payroll employment increased in 31 states and the District of Columbia , decreased in 18 states , and remained unchanged in 1 state .
The largest over - the - month increase in employment occurred in California ( +32,500 ) , followed by Illinois ( +26,000 ) , New York ( +25,500 ) , Washington ( +18,900 ) , and Minnesota ( +15,600 ) .
State Unemployment ( Seasonally Adjusted )
Michigan again recorded the highest unemployment rate among the states , 14.3 percent in January .
The states with the next highest rates were Nevada , 13.0 percent ; Rhode Island , 12.7 percent ; South Carolina , 12.6 percent ; and California , 12.5 percent .
North Dakota continued to register the lowest jobless rate , 4.2 percent in January , followed by Nebraska and South Dakota , 4.6 and 4.8 percent , respectively .
The rates in California and South Carolina set new series highs , as did the rates in three other states : Florida ( 11.9 percent ) , Georgia ( 10.4 percent ) , and North Carolina ( 11.1 percent ) .
The rate in the District of Columbia ( 12.0 percent ) also set a new series high .
Six states reported statistically significant over - the - month unemployment rate increases in January .
New Mexico experienced the largest of these ( +0.3 percentage point ) , followed by California , Florida , Idaho , and Utah ( +0.2 point each ) and Maryland ( +0.1 point ) .
The remaining 44 states and the District of Columbia registered jobless rates that were not appreciably different from those of a month earlier , though some had changes that were at least as large numerically as the significant changes .
West Virginia and Nevada recorded the largest jobless rate increases from January 2009 ( +3.5 and +3.4 percentage points , respectively ) .
Six other states reported rate increases of 3.0 percentage points or more : Florida , Illinois , and Wyoming ( +3.2 points each ) , Rhode Island ( +3.1 points ) , and Alabama and Michigan ( +3.0 points each ) .
The District of Columbia also registered a large over - the - year unemployment rate increase ( +3.6 percentage points ) .
Thirty - five additional states had smaller , but also statistically significant , rate increases .
The remaining seven states reported jobless rates that were not appreciably different from those of a year earlier .
Unemployment Rates By State
Percentage Change Year Over Year
The International Whaling Commission has proposed allowing whales to be hunted under strict quotas .
The move would bring the world a step closer to the first legal commercial whaling in nearly 25 years .
The proposal , released late Thursday , would allow Japan , Norway and Iceland - which hunt whales under a variety of exceptions to a 1986 moratorium - to catch whales for 10 years but under strict limits set by the IWC that would reduce the overall catch .
Japan 's self - imposed annual quota of 935 Antarctic minke whales , which are not endangered , would be lowered to 400 over the next five years , then reduced to 200 for the next five years .
The country 's current take of 320 sei and minke whales in waters near Japan would be cut to 210 .
The woman , who has not been named , has spoken to French media A French Muslim woman has been fined for wearing a full - face veil while driving a car .
Police in the western city of Nantes said the veil - which showed only her eyes - restricted her vision and could have caused an accident .
The woman 's lawyer says they will appeal against the decision , which he described as a breach of human rights .
The incident follows months of intense debate in France about whether the veils should be banned .
Earlier this week , President Nicolas Sarkozy ordered parliament to debate a law banning women from wearing full - face Islamic veils in public .
' Safety risk '
After stopping the 31 - year - old woman - who has not been named - police asked her to raise her veil to confirm her identity , which she did .
Currently no law forbids the wearing of the niqab
Lawyer Jean - Michel Pollono
They then fined her 22 euros ( $ 29 ; ¬£ 19 ) , saying her clothing posed a " safety risk " .
" This fine is not justified on road safety grounds and constitutes a breach of human and women 's rights , " her lawyer , Jean - Michel Pollono , told AFP news agency .
He said the woman 's field of vision was not obstructed and added that a veil was no different from a motorcycle helmet in terms of hindrance to vision .
He said he had formally complained to the state prosecutor .
" The ball is clearly in the authorities ' court , " he said .
" Currently no law forbids the wearing of the niqab . "
Headscarves
The word hijab comes from the Arabic for veil and is used to describe the headscarves worn by Muslim women .
These scarves come in a myriad of styles and colours .
The type most commonly worn in the West is a square scarf that covers the head and neck but leaves the face clear .
The niqab is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear .
However , it may be worn with a separate eye veil .
It is worn with an accompanying headscarf .
The burka is the most concealing of all Islamic veils .
It covers the entire face and body , leaving just a mesh screen to see through .
The al - amira is a two - piece veil .
It consists of a close fitting cap , usually made from cotton or polyester , and an accompanying tube - like scarf .
The shayla is a long , rectangular scarf popular in the Gulf region .
It is wrapped around the head and tucked or pinned in place at the shoulders .
The khimar is a long , cape - like veil that hangs down to just above the waist .
It covers the hair , neck and shoulders completely , but leaves the face clear .
The chador , worn by many Iranian women when outside the house , is a full - body cloak .
It is often accompanied by a smaller headscarf underneath .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
The incident happened earlier this month , Mr Pollono said .
The woman , who is a French citizen , told French media that her field of vision had been sufficient .
The BBC's David Chazan , in Paris , says that although the fine is small , the case has taken on huge symbolic importance .
President Sarkozy said last year that full - face veils oppressed women and were not welcome in France .
Plans to ban them by law have provoked intense debate about religious freedom in a secular society , as well as the position of Muslims in France .
France has Europe 's largest Muslim minority population , estimated at about five million .
The French interior ministry estimates that only about 1,900 women wear full veils in the country .
There are several types of headscarves and veils for Muslim women - those that cover the face being the niqab and the burka .
In France , the niqab is the version most commonly worn .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Chris Evans will play Steve Rogers , also known as Captain America .
Sources said that not only has the actor accepted Marvel ‚Äôs offer for the big - screen role , but that the deal - making moved so fast it ‚Äôs now all about dotting the i‚Äôs and crossing the t‚Äôs .
Marvel would not comment on the development , and Creative Artists Agency , which represents the actor , declined comment .
Evans was offered the role in Marvel Studios ‚Äô production late last week , but there was some question of whether he would accept .
Factoring in to the choice was the fact that Evans played Johnny Storm , the flame - covered superhero known as the Human Torch in 20th Century Fox ‚Äôs ‚Äú Fantastic Four ‚Äù movies .
Was he ready to play another superhero and take on the trappings that come with such a high - profile part ?
Evans took a few days to think it over , and once he decided he was willing to wield the shield , negotiations moved quickly over the weekend .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Federal Reserve will be required to identify the names of banks that could have collapsed if not for the central bank 's emergency lending , a federal appeals court said Friday .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York ruled that the Fed needs to disclose documents in response to Freedom of Information Act requests by Bloomberg L.P. and other news organizations .
The Federal Reserve is considering its options after the decision .
" We are reviewing the decision and considering our options for reconsideration or appeal , " said Fed spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh .
The Federal Reserve may seek to have the court re-hear their case or consider appealing the decision to the Supreme Court .
The news organizations filed a suit in 2008 seeking to have the central bank publicly release documents containing data about the names of the banks that have participated in its lending programs in the midst of the financial crisis .
Bloomberg also sought information about the amount of funds lent to banks during the financial crisis .
The appeals case comes after the Southern District Court of New York ruled in favor of Bloomberg in August and ordered the Fed to disclose the names of borrowers .
However , the Fed filed for a stay and expedited consideration , which the appeals court granted last year .
Fox News Networks LLC and Dow Jones & Co. made similar public record requests for information about Fed lending , which were rejected .
News Corp. NWS , +1.52 % owns Fox News and MarketWatch , the publisher of this report .
The lawsuit comes as legislation requiring a broad congressional auditing of how the Federal Reserve carries out its monetary policy -- including how much it has lent and will lend to specific banks as part of its bank bailout program -- is under consideration on Capitol Hill .
In December , the House approved a provision as part of sweeping bank reform legislation that would require such an audit .
The measure was introduced by Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , who has been seeking more information about the Fed 's operations for years .
The Fed opposes the lawsuit , arguing it would weaken the bank 's independence and hamper the central bank 's ability to protect the financial system .
Banks would be reticent to borrow from the central bank if they know their names would be released because of the stigma associated with borrowing .
In this talk we follow up from our previous ‚Äú State of Malware : Explosion of the Axis of Evil ‚Äù , where we explored some of the idiosyncrasies of mass - malware vs. the ones in targeted malware .
This time around we decided to try to spot actual code - sharing among a reasonably diverse corpus of recent malware obtained from VirusTotal
Using some of the technology we ‚Äôve developed in zynamics to automatically classify malware we attempted to find relations between malware samples that would indicate that code had been shared , possibly indicating collaborative efforts of malware developers or even giving clues about common authorship .
If you want to hear what it is that we found out , do n‚Äôt hesitate in dropping by our talk Wednesday 16:45 h
See you there !
‚Äú I question all of it , ‚Äù he says of life itself just before he begins trying to save mankind ( for you ) one more goddamned time .
‚Äú You can bet on me , ‚Äù he will tell you , curling up that golden smirk .
But he does reassure for a living , this Walter B. Willis ‚Äì a man who goes by his middle name , and , frankly , can you blame him ?
He has endured exultantly at the forefront of Reliable Everymen who step up to cataclysm at a theater near you ( lately , less cataclysmically in Kevin Smith ‚Äôs comedy caper ‚Äò Cop Out ‚Äô ) .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm kind of a trademark now , ‚Äù he says with belief and disbelief .
And then : ‚Äú If I had ever caught me saying that about myself before , I ‚Äôd go , ‚Äò Shut the fuck up . ‚Äô ‚Äù He is a man who answers his every thought with a second thought , and then a third , ad infinitum ; they stack up fast and frenetic .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm a tangential thinker , ‚Äù he apologizes .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm not sure if I ‚Äôve ever come to any conclusion . ‚Äù
Well , he does , and did ‚Äì if eventually ‚Äì during a long , twisting soul purge one cold afternoon at a Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow .
This day , the youngest of his three colorfully named daughters ‚Äì famously they are Tallulah , 16 ; Scout , 18 ; and Rumer , 21 ‚Äì has been beset by flu , which inflames her father ‚Äôs vigilance .
He takes microbreaks to field sickbed - status texts sent from the nearby home of her mother , Demi Moore , between calls to a doctor friend and to his new bride , Emma Heming .
( Sample news flash : ‚Äú Ohh !
A Tallulah update : ‚Äò Feeling much better .
Temp dropped two degrees , consuming food . ‚Äô
Okay , good , good .
‚Äò Giving her Tylenol , fluids .
Holding off for now on Tama ‚Äì ‚Äò It ‚Äôs T - a - m - i - f - l -u .
I correct people ‚Äôs spelling all the time .
I try not to .
It ‚Äôs a nervous tic . ‚Äù )
And so reels the electric Bruce - brain fast approaching its 55th year of minutiae management ‚Äì ‚Äú I ‚Äôm a compendium of useless information , ‚Äù he demurs , quite unnecessarily .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre just slouching toward wisdom here . ‚Äù
Never mind that his posture is plenty damned erect , thank you .
What new enlightenment awaits a man in the middle of his sixth decade ?
These days I find that I ‚Äôm in a continual process of trying to come to terms with everything that I used to think I knew .
In my 20s I thought I knew exactly how the world worked .
And in my 30s , I had to rethink it .
Forties , same rethink all over again ‚Äì as in , man , was I wronnng .
Now I realize I was never right .
There are things that you have to accept about yourself ‚Äì limitations , old instincts and patterns ‚Äì which is a very , very liberating kind of revelation .
But you ca n‚Äôt teach that or give it to someone .
We all just have to get there .
What are the benefits of owning your mistakes ?
I do n‚Äôt think you learn that much from being right .
Or from catching a break .
I doubt myself on a regular basis .
I now enjoy the language caveat : ‚Äú I ‚Äôll tell you what I think , but I ‚Äôm prepared to be wrong . ‚Äù
And being wrong is such a good icebreaker , too : ‚Äú I was wrong about so many things .
. . . ‚Äù
Philosophically , karma - wise , you can say that your mistakes are part of your path in life or exactly what you ‚Äôre supposed to be doing this time around on Earth .
But I may be wrong .
Where does the concept of fate belong in a man ‚Äôs life ?
Here is why you ca n‚Äôt ever have any regrets or spend time thinking about ‚Äú if onlys ‚Äù :
You ca n‚Äôt pull a thread out of the rug without the weave coming loose somewhere over on the other side .
Then the whole rug falls apart when it ‚Äôs still a work in progress .
Only now can I look back at how I first got hired on ‚Äò Moonlighting ‚Äô and say , ‚Äú Well , if I had n‚Äôt been with that girl and if I had n‚Äôt finished that play , ‚Äù etc. ‚Äì all these things combined to get me out here at just the right moment .
Because it was the last week they were seeing actors after they ‚Äôd already seen 3,000 .
The whole ‚Äú meant to be ‚Äù thing , it ‚Äôs beyond my ‚Äú comprenshun , ‚Äù as we say in South Jersey .
Same deal with love :
What if you did n‚Äôt get on the bus and sit across from that girl who ‚Äôs supposed to be the love of your life ?
What if you get off the bus before she gets on ?
I think you ‚Äôve got to forget about the bus , and just know that you ‚Äôre always on the bus , and we really do n‚Äôt have that much to say about it .
What is the secret to breaking patterns of our own idiotic behavior ?
I ‚Äôm a big fan of the mentality : ‚Äú If a man does n‚Äôt remember his own history , he ‚Äôs destined to repeat it . ‚Äù
Always in wars and in romance , it happens .
And , man , I have repeated myself way too many times not to pay attention .
I finally addressed my history the really hard way .
I just stopped , literally .
I took time off from all relationships and said , ‚Äú There is no way I can fuck it up any more than I have .
There is no way I can really ever count on someone of the opposite sex , or anyone , to make me happy if I ca n‚Äôt make myself happy . ‚Äù
After a man has soured on love , how does he find it again ?
I was past soured .
I turned my back on love .
It ended up being four years .
Now , there was some interaction with other women , but I was straight right away : ‚Äú Even if we get along great , it is not going to become anything .
So just get all your hopes and dreams out of the way and let ‚Äôs just have a good time tonight . ‚Äù
So my stance was to just keep saying no .
But I did know that you ‚Äôre unlikely to find your next wife ‚Äì or any partner ‚Äì in a nightclub or in a bar .
Or doing drugs .
That is a different world .
It ‚Äôs like looking for water in the desert when the ocean is almost in front of you .
Because I never really decided to open myself up ‚Äì and there it was .
I married someone I had already known for three years from working out at the same gym .
That does n‚Äôt happen very often .
Is that Zen ?
Or was it just dumb luck ?
How does a man know when he is in love ?
I can look at how I interact with my kids and say , ‚Äú This is love .
I know what it is .
I got it . ‚Äù I would step in front of a car for them .
I ‚Äôd do it for my wife now .
I ‚Äôd probably still do it for my ex-wife .
I ‚Äôve peeled every layer off and come to the bright core :
It ‚Äôs just a light .
It ‚Äôs when you can put someone else ‚Äôs welfare ahead of yours .
When you say , ‚Äú You eat first , you go first , you do whatever first .
I ‚Äôm good . ‚Äù
It ‚Äôs not a sacrifice .
Last year ‚Äì the year I got married ‚Äì I was with Emma every single day except for one .
Sleeping together and waking up together .
Every day .
If you knew me at all in my past , that ‚Äôs a fucking miracle .
How does a man maintain a relationship with his ex-wife ?
I was getting something out of it .
You ca n‚Äôt spend a decade with someone and raise kids with her and come away unfeeling .
I just put my head down and said , ‚Äú The kids come first .
And we ‚Äôll do whatever it takes and maybe even laugh about it . ‚Äù
You can fall in love again and bring another person into it , and if everybody is okay with it ‚Äì and you ‚Äôre not just faking it ‚Äì we all win .
Mr. K and everybody involved should also get credit for the synthesis of this .
It ‚Äôs not like you ‚Äôre standing there going , ‚Äú I hate this guy , he ‚Äôs a dick , this is so painful , this is so uncomfortable for meeeeeee . ‚Äù
Once you start putting the kids first , it is n‚Äôt uncomfortable .
Bravery is stupid a lot of times , but there ‚Äôs nothing stupid about this particular subject .
When is it acceptable to tell a lie ?
Little babies learn to lie before they can speak ; they ‚Äôll cry or act like they ‚Äôre hurt in order to get what they want .
Gorillas have indicated lying to keep peace among the gorilla family .
You can explain away lying , or not telling the truth , or shading the truth , or putting some spin on the truth , so you do n‚Äôt hurt someone .
But , really , what ‚Äôs the truth ?
It ‚Äôs hard to tell the truth about yourself .
What you can learn to live with is the mark of your character .
What you can tell about yourself that is true without having to make up a cover story is the mark of where you set yourself in the world .
Not that every truth teller wins .
Look at what happened to Jesus .
What is a man ‚Äôs most dependable liquid intoxicant ?
I ‚Äôm a master at this topic from my early bartending years .
The only answer : anything with vodka .
I remember regularly seeing guys who drank brown alcohol ‚Äì the nicest guys ‚Äì become a mess .
Next thing you knew two big guys had their arms and were sending them outside with the warning not to come back for two weeks .
Brown brought on the madness .
I had a long year when I developed a taste for Armagnac .
I would get up in the morning , and my daughter Scout was old enough to know that I was pouring a little Armagnac into my coffee .
I ‚Äôd say [ whispering ] , ‚Äú Just a little medicine in the coffee . ‚Äù
And she ‚Äôd give me a look .
She still quotes me ‚Äì ‚Äú a little medicine in the coffee . . . . ‚Äù
Why do men try to fix things without consulting a manual ?
I am a hands - on guy .
Just today I was fooling around with the air - conditioning at home , doing it myself without a manual .
I descend from a long line of mechanics .
Every one of my uncles had at least one part of a digit on their hands missing , from working on car engines or welding or various things .
My dad almost had the tip of one of his fingers cut off by a lawn mower .
But it was all in the name of solving problems .
No manual for the heating regulator ?
Let me see for myself ‚Äì I can figure this out .
And , while it ‚Äôs hard to say this without sounding patronizing , I think women want to talk through the problem .
That ‚Äôs not a bad thing .
But we just want to fix it fast , so you do n‚Äôt have to worry about it .
No matter what it takes .
I tell ya , if I ever get out of this acting racket , I ‚Äôm going to go be Dr. Phil ‚Äôs competition .
Except I would be the alpha - dog side and tell you how to kill a wolf with your bare hands .
How does a man go about killing a wolf with his bare hands ?
Okay , it may never come up .
You may never need it , but that one time when you ‚Äôre confronted with that big wolf , this is how you do it .
You ‚Äôve got to give the wolf your arm .
You ‚Äôve got to lean into it .
Stick your arm all the way down his throat .
He ca n‚Äôt swallow it because he ‚Äôs gagging on your arm .
You reach in ; you grab a handful of something ‚Äì guts , the back of his throat , whatever you can hold ‚Äì and pull it out .
And try to avoid those claws while you ‚Äôre doing it .
When is a man best suited to become a father ?
I do n‚Äôt think I would have had a clue about what to do with kids in my 20s .
Back then , I did n‚Äôt want to be around kids or anyone else ‚Äôs kids .
I was busy trying to get this career thing going .
I would ‚Äôve been that guy asking , ‚Äú How am I going to pay for this ?
Does it all really end now ? ‚Äù
For women there ‚Äôs a whole different psychology attached .
They start glowing immediately .
When Rumer was born , I was 33 .
The baby was a surprise .
But by that age I was really into it , like : ‚Äú Let ‚Äôs go !
This is great ! ‚Äù I can say this after having three kids and being at four other births : I was right in there ‚Äì delivering them , pulling the babies out , laughing , crying .
Twenty - five people were in the room ‚Äì sanitary hospital conditions set aside for the fact that we wanted to share this with all our friends .
Demi wanted no drugs .
She had the power of 10 men ‚Äì almost snapped off two of my fingers squeezing them so hard .
I went , ‚Äú Go ahead , break them off .
It does n‚Äôt matter . ‚Äù
Which essential lesson must a father pass along to his children ?
You ‚Äôve got to hope that you ‚Äôve sent them into the world with enough information and ammunition to be able to fight for themselves .
You do n‚Äôt want your daddy fighting your battles .
Rumer worked at a Marc Jacobs store while she was figuring out what she wanted to do .
She found out that she had an aptitude for acting , and right away she came back to us and said , ‚Äú I know you could help me , but I want to either fail or make it on my own without ever thinking that you did something for me . ‚Äù
I said , ‚Äú All right , God bless you , that ‚Äôs great . ‚Äù
She abandoned the lifeline .
She did the hard thing first ‚Äì which has always been a sign of character in my book .
What do women know about us that we never know about ourselves ?
Forget ‚Äú about us ‚Äù ‚Äì they know things in general , instinctively .
Women can see through their own guy ‚Äôs shit better than anybody can .
And really quick .
A woman can size up another woman in about 30 seconds .
Just tell her , ‚Äú I like that woman . ‚Äù Slut .
I go , ‚Äú How do you get that ?
Already ? ‚Äù
She ‚Äôs fucking everything that moves .
And they are right all the time .
Dead right .
They are working on a wavelength that men could never get to .
How can a man disarm a woman most effectively ?
I ‚Äôve always gone for laughter .
Not only to disarm , but to try to charm .
Entertain them .
But do n‚Äôt make a big deal about it .
The one that I like the best is to very quietly lean in and say something really goofy to make them burst out laughing so snot comes out of their nose and they are slobbering and going , ‚Äú Oh , my God , I ca n‚Äôt believe you just said that ! ‚Äù
It can throw ‚Äôem off the track of thinking you ‚Äôre predictable ‚Äì at least for a few minutes .
I will reduce myself to utter foolishness to keep my wife laughing .
Here ‚Äôs one just about every guy can pull off :
Take a drink of water when they ‚Äôre not looking , then wait until they ask you a question and just start talking and let water dribble out of your mouth .
Guaranteed to get a laugh .
You ca n‚Äôt go wrong .
How can a man avoid irritating the woman with whom he lives ?
You could say , ‚Äú I did n‚Äôt leave that toilet seat up , must be someone else , ‚Äù but then you ‚Äôve got to tell that lie and you ‚Äôve got to remember your lies .
I volunteer things I do n‚Äôt even have to , like : ‚Äú Here is something I did n‚Äôt tell you , but I just need you to know ‚Äì for two days while you were n‚Äôt here , I reverted to my caveman mind and left the toilet seat up the whole time . ‚Äù
The truth is so easy .
How does fame change a man ?
It ‚Äôs like alcohol .
Whatever you are , it ‚Äôs going to make you more of that .
Being famous , there really is a lot of illusion to it .
It ‚Äôs not the same as being successful .
It ‚Äôs a candy store and you can always choose when you want to get off the ride of your life .
I think I ‚Äôm still on it .
I do n‚Äôt think I ‚Äôve ever got to the point where I go , ‚Äú It ‚Äôs time to really start looking for something else to do . ‚Äù
I ‚Äôm still digging it .
But if I could tend bar during the day and do low - rent theater every night , I ‚Äôd still be really happy .
How does a man benefit from escape in his life ?
I do n‚Äôt think that I can ever say that I made the choice to live in Sun Valley , but it was an idea that I had because Demi and I were becoming really famous and I said , ‚Äú Ya know , what if we go to Idaho and live there for a while ? ‚Äù
We ended up staying for almost 12 years .
And becoming really invested in this little town of Hailey .
Great town .
I ‚Äôd get the dogs and go outside and play in the river and mountains .
And now I ‚Äôve got a place in Turks and Caicos .
It ‚Äôs tough to beat .
I ‚Äôve been a lot of places and that one ‚Äì if there ‚Äôs something else that ‚Äôs calmer , I do n‚Äôt know what it is .
Nobody comes up and hassles me .
They do n‚Äôt ask me for anything .
I ‚Äôm not compelled to be the big prize bull .
What is the best way to take a punch ?
Try to protect your temples ‚Äì because that ‚Äôs a knockout punch .
So is the button , on the chin , so keep it tucked down into the chest .
But mainly just try with every ounce of strength you have not to fight .
It took me a long time to understand that a lot of guys wanted to be the guy who kicked John McClane ‚Äôs ass .
And it ‚Äôs really difficult to explain to someone who has been overserved , ‚Äú No , I ‚Äôm not that guy . ‚Äù
Not that he is n‚Äôt in here somewhere .
What ‚Äôs the best way for a man to handle anger ?
I allow myself a very short window to be angry .
I ‚Äôve been fairly successful in trying to pass that on to my kids .
Tallulah is the latest recipient of that little piece of knowledge .
Here ‚Äôs an example : ‚Äú Okay , I know you ‚Äôre mad right now .
But , by and large , it ‚Äôs a useless emotion .
I ‚Äôll give you about five minutes .
You can be as angry as you want .
Bust up the joint .
Throw things around , but after that you ‚Äôve just got to accept it , move on , and try to learn from it . ‚Äù
That ‚Äôs older - man wisdom .
You do have a shorter fuse when you ‚Äôre younger .
The hardest thing I had to get over was holding grudges .
Now I let them go .
But there are two or three big ones that I set in concrete when I was younger that I do n‚Äôt think will ever go away .
If it ever comes up , I go , ‚Äú Ehhh , I do n‚Äôt think I ‚Äôll ever speak to that person again in this lifetime . ‚Äù
Then I move on .
Because it has no meaning or impact on my life now .
I ‚Äôve gotten past it and I ‚Äôve survived .
How should a man ‚Äôs mortality figure in to his everyday life ?
There is nothing to say about our own mortality except that you can hurry it along a little bit .
You have that option .
You can drink every day of your life .
And take drugs every day of your life .
I ‚Äôd rather smell somebody else smoking weed on the street than smoke weed myself anymore .
Whenever I ‚Äôm in the company of someone who used to do this drug that makes you run off to the bathroom to do it , I ‚Äôm reminded of how often I get up to pee now .
And I go , ‚Äú Oh , my God , I wonder if somebody thinks I ‚Äôm doing blow in there . ‚Äù
Until you have kids , you are not aware of your own mortality .
They are little living calendars , and you know that while time is passing for them , it ‚Äôs passing for you .
I wonder whether science or medicine can get us to 100 in this lifetime .
Because if I can feel as good at 100 as I feel now and still run , still work out , still eat , drink , fuck ‚Äì all the things that I am still capable of doing really well and enjoying ‚Äì then all bets are off .
So just wash your hands three or four times a day , and cough into the crook of your elbow instead of into your hands .
Extending that life span has to start somewhere .
Also , I will do everything in my power not to go under the knife .
That way lies the acceleration of your death .
How does a man remind himself to live in the moment ?
I ‚Äôm glad we ‚Äôre talkin‚Äô about this .
Embrace your death .
Make friends with it .
Know it ‚Äôs out there .
Tickle it under the chin , and just know that it ‚Äôs coming .
And not in a bad or morbid way ‚Äì or an ‚Äú Oh , God , I ‚Äôm going to die someday ‚Äù way ‚Äì but use it as motivation .
Use it as an impetus to get everything you want to do in this lifetime done before you die .
I was raised in a generation that was saving money for a rainy day : ‚Äú Do n‚Äôt do anything too rash while you ‚Äôre young ; save it all for when you ‚Äôre older . ‚Äù
Well , I think it ‚Äôs rainin ‚Äô right now .
I think live it up .

Ranked Systems Detailed Explanation :
1v1 Ranking System
Supreme Commander 2 now supports Ranked 1v1 matches .
Each player starts with a Ranked Rating of 1500 , and each Ranked match increases or decreases your Ranked Rating .
This rating determines your position on the Ranked Leaderboard .
The Matchmaking Menu is accessed from the Main Menu .
Select Multiplayer , and Find Match .
It lets you between choose two different kinds of 1v1 matchmaking : Ranked ( 1v1 ) or Unranked ( 1v1 ) .
The Unranked ( 1v1 ) tab lets you pick your Victory Condition ( Assassination or Supremacy ) , your Faction , and it matches you with a player of a similar skill level on a randomly selected map .
These matches do not count toward any leaderboards .
Ranked ( 1v1 ) only supports the Assassination Victory Condition .
Once you choose your faction , you can click ‚Äú Find Match ‚Äù and you ‚Äôll be matched with someone of a similar skill level .
In Ranked mode , you can adjust the range of potential matches on the ‚Äú Finding Opponent ‚Äù screen .
It defaults to finding an opponent who is within 32 points of your current rating .
It will search for as long as you want to find an opponent within that range , or you can manually adjust the searchable Min and Max Rating of potential opponents by clicking the ‚Äú + ‚Äù and ‚Äú - ‚Äù buttons .
You can cancel the Search at any time and return to the Matchmaking Menu .
Once a match is found , you automatically connect to a 1v1 match with your still - unknown opponent on a randomly picked map .
The current Ranked map list is as follows :
Arctic Refuge
Clarke Training Center
Coalition Shipyard
Mirror Island
Markon Bridge
Fields of Isis
Seraphim VII Site
Challenge Mode System
The biggest new feature for Ranked play is the addition of ‚Äú Challenge Mode . ‚Äù ‚Äú Challenge Mode ‚Äù is enabled on the Matchmaking Menu .
If both players who are looking for a match have the option enabled , they are able to ‚Äú Challenge ‚Äù each other at any point of the match in order to ‚Äú Raise the Stakes . ‚Äù
What ‚Äôs at stake ?
The impact of the match ‚Äôs result on each player ‚Äôs final Rating .
A normal Ranked 1v1 game has a 1X multiplier , meaning it ‚Äôs worth 1 game when calculating your final rating .
The change in the rating is based on the difference between two players ; a player with a high rating will get less of an increase from playing a lower - ranked player , but a low - ranked player can move up quickly by defeating a higher - ranked player .
In ‚Äú Challenge Mode , ‚Äù you ‚Äôre increasing the multiplier so the result will count the same as if you played multiple matches against the same opponent .
In other words , the resulting change in ratings will be greater than it would be for a normal , 1X match .
A ‚Äú Challenge ‚Äù is issued from a button in the scoreboard , which is accessed by pressing F2 during the match .
Players can issue up to 5 challenges per game , and the owner of the Challenge alternates between players .
Either player can initiate a Challenge at any time during a match .
Once the initial challenge is issued , the match pauses and the ‚Äú Challenge Mode ‚Äù menu appears .
For the player receiving the challenge , it tells them what ‚Äôs at stake and gives them 30 seconds to decide whether to accept or decline the challenge .
For the initial Challenge , ‚Äú Decline ‚Äù is auto - selected after 20 seconds .
If a player declines the first challenge , the match will continue as a standard 1 v1 , and neither player can re-issue a challenge .
If a player accepts the challenge , the match continues .
However , the player who accepted the challenge has a new button on their scoreboard : ‚Äú Raise Stakes . ‚Äù
If they click on this button , they will ‚Äú Raise the Stakes ‚Äù on the match and increase the multiplier .
The game pauses again , and the other player gets the Challenge Menu .
At this point , that player ‚Äôs options are to either ‚Äú Accept ‚Äù the newly raised stakes or ‚Äú Forfeit ‚Äù the match with the previously agreed - to multiplier .
In fact , if you do not make this decision within 30 seconds , you will automatically forfeit and the match will end .
In other words , once you ‚Äôre in Challenge Mode , you ca n‚Äôt back out .
After the match is finished , each player gets the standard summary screen with new text that shows each player ‚Äôs Rating at the start of the match and their new Rating after it ‚Äôs been calculated .
A match with a 5X multiplier does n‚Äôt increase your score by five versus a 1X match .
The math used to calculate the final rating accounts for the changes between both players ‚Äô rating each time it ‚Äôs calculated , so the actual increase / decrease in high - stakes games is considerably less than the multiplier .
The system ca n‚Äôt be easily gamed , because matching is random and tied to an individual player ‚Äôs Steam account .
‚Äú Challenge Mode ‚Äù increases competition by potentially increasing the stakes for each match .
A lower ranked player can more quickly move up the Leaderboard , or a high - ranked player can more easily keep their lead ‚Ä¶ or feed their ego .
Bold ( or crazy ) players can try to bluff their way to getting their opponent to forfeit a match , at the risk of tumbling even more positions on the Leaderboard .
It ‚Äôs 100 % voluntary , so players are free to disable the mode on the Matchmaking menu .
The top line from the RBS WorldPay caper reads like a trailer for George Clooney ‚Äôs next Ocean ‚Äôs 11 summer blockbuster :
An elite Euro - Russian cybergang uses the Internet to remotely crack deep inside the network of a giant U.S. debit- and credit - card processor .
The gang swipes and decrypts valuable debit - card account data ; and then sets into motion a globe - spanning , multi-million dollar score .
Moving fast to avoid detection , an army of accomplices carrying blank payment cards embedded with stolen debit account numbers hit up 2,100 ATMS in 280 cities in eight countries ‚Äî in just 12 hours !
Total take : a cool $ 9.4 million .

Why cybercrime is here to stay
In Hollywood , the ring leaders would smugly disband .
Not this time , though .
The bad guys got caught , thanks to unprecedented collaboration of U.S. and Estonian police , whose leaders bridged a geopolitical / cultural chasm to save the day ‚Äî but that ‚Äôs another movie .
What follows is a blow - by - blow account of the RBS World Play caper , √É‚Äö√Ç based on security experts extrapolating details revealed in the 10 Nov2009 indictment of Viktor Pleshchuk , 28 , of St. Petersburg , Russia ; Sergei Tsurikov , 25 , of Tallinn , Estonia ; and Oleg Covelin , 28 , of Chisinau , Moldova , and a co-defendant identified only as ‚Äú Hacker 3 . ‚Äù
They and four others were charged with wire fraud , computer fraud and identity theft , as outlined in this indictment and this √É‚Äö√Ç FBI press release .
The easy part : initial breach
Pleshchuk , T√É ‚Ä¶ √Ç¬°urikov , and Covelin gained ‚Äú unauthorized access ‚Äù into RBS WorldPay , the Atlanta , GA - based payment processing division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group .
But authorities do n‚Äôt spell out precisely how they did this .
They certainly did not piggy back onto RBS ‚Äôs WiFi systems , as hacker Albert Gonzalez did to initially penetrate retailer TJX ‚Äôs internal network to steal 94 million payment card transactions records .
RBS does n‚Äôt use WiFi as a convenience tool that can be hacked by anyone with a cheap antennae , as many giant retail chains do .
According to the indictment , Oleg Covelin , based in Moldova , ‚Äú learned of the vulnerability in the RBS WorldPay computer network ‚Äù and provided that intelligence to Tsurikov in Estonia .
This is the second indictment of Covelin√É‚Äö√Ç in three months .
In September , he was one of five eastern European men indicted in New York on Monday as part of an international ID theft ring , known as Western Express Cybercrime Group .
Covelin and Tsurikov rercruited the Russian hacker Pleshchuk and the mysterious Hacker 3 to figure out how best to exploit the security hole .
They very well may have used a SQL injection attack on one of RBS ‚Äôs public facing Web pages .
This is a tried - and - trued attack vector , used in the infamous Heartland Payments System breach .
Or they could have hacked into security holes in one of RBS ‚Äôs mail servers or Web servers ‚Äî one not current on all of its security patches , says Chris Wysopal , CTO of applications security firm Veracode .
This was the easy part .
‚Äú Breaching a perimeter is pretty well understood , ‚Äù says Wysopal .
Scanning for jackpot servers
Once the intruders got inside RBS ‚Äôs internal network on 04Nov2008 , they immediately began looking for jackpot servers .
This is fairly simple to do , as well .
They probably used Nmap , or some other free port scanning tool , to quickly locate all servers storing Microsoft SQL server data bases .
Locating , accessing and extracting data from SQL databases from inside the ‚Äú soft , chewy center of corporate networks ‚Äù is fairly trivial stuff , says Don Jackson , senior researcher at SecureWorks .
Wysopal surmises that the bad guys took their sweet time culling through harvested data , sorting perhaps millions of credit and debit card account numbers .
This would seem to suggest that RBS ‚Äôs intrusion detection systems failed to send up any red flags as a result of the perimeter breach or the internal SQL database breaches .
Or if it did , RBS ignored them .
At some point , the ring leaders stumbled upon 44 prepaid payroll debit accounts ‚Äî 42 issued by Palm Desert National Bank .
Companies use such accounts to pay their workers .
Each gets a debit card to use to withdraw pay at ATMS ; the company deposits salaries at bi-weekly or monthly intervals .
‚Äú I do n‚Äôt think they were targeting any particular accounts , ‚Äù say Wysopal .
‚Äú These tend to be crimes of opportunity .
They may have been probing all kinds of banking networks , found a way into this one , took a look around at vulnerable systems , found this ATM data , and when down this road . ‚Äù
Finding and cracking ‚Äò PIN blocks ‚Äò
The thieves also needed PINS to make the ATM withdrawals .
Elite cyber gangs know that payment processors typically store account PINS in a separate server called a ‚Äú high security module , ‚Äù or HSM server .
The same port scanning tool , such as Nmap , used to locate SQL databases holding account numbers can be easily tweaked to seek out HSM servers holding PINS , says Wysopal .
‚Äú They knew enough there would be a specialized machine , where the PINS would be stored , ‚Äù says Wysopal .
‚Äú They knew the PINS would be encrypted and that they ‚Äôd have to do some research to learn how it worked , and how to decrypt it . ‚Äù
PIN cracking research is n‚Äôt nearly as commonplace as the knowledge base on spamming , phishing and SQL injection .
But it is out there on the Internet as a white paper , titled The Unbearable Lightness of PIN Cracking , delivered at Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2007 conference attests .
The members of this cyber gang appear to be brilliant at multi-tasking .
While they were working to find and decrypt the needed PINS , they also manipulated the SQL databases holding the account information , raising the limits for ATM withdrawals .
‚Äú It is not clear how the attackers accessed the SQL server , whether it was a command - line on the server itself , another machine , or perhaps through SQL Injection , ‚Äù says Wysopal .
Meanwhile , they also readied 44 counterfeit debit cards ‚Äî each faked card carrying a stolen payroll account number on its magnetic stripe , and organized a global network of ‚Äú cashers ‚Äù to use the 44 cards at 2,100 ATMS in 280 cities in the United States , Russia , Ukraine , Estonia , Italy , Hong Kong , Japan and Canada .
All of this ‚Äì the 44 faked cards with account numbers and PINS and the global network of cashers ‚Äî were in place , tested and ready to go by Nov. 8 .
The gang even prepared coding routines to access RBS ‚Äôs network to monitor the planned withdrawals in real time , and , afterward , destroy data to try to erase their tracks from the system , according to the indictment .
Wave of thievery
The climactic cashout went like clockwork .
For 12 hours , the cashers hit ATM after ATM extracting $ 9.4 million .
And then the operation shut down .
The indictment gives a few snapshots of this global spanning wave of thievery .
Hacker 3 was responsible for managing the networks of 44 cashers .
Each would get to keep 30 % to 50 % of the stolen funds , transferring the balance to Hacker 3 , who was in charge of distributing shares to the other ring leaders .
The withdrawals , as directed by Hacker 3 , followed a strictly coordinated time schedule ; Pleshchuk and Tsurikov monitored the ATM ‚Äôs dishing out cash in real time from inside RBS ‚Äôs network .
Tsurikov also managed a team of four cashers who hit ATMs in his home country , Estonia .
They pulled out $ 289,000 .
Estonian police , working closely with the FBI , arrested the entire band .
Information from the Estonian arrests led to the identification and arrest of a pair of cashers in Hong Kong .
Uri Rivner , Head of New Technologies , Identity Protection & Verification RSA , The Security Division of EMC , says the gang ‚Äôs technical prowess was unremarkable .
‚Äú The technical aspects in this case were not that impressive , ‚Äù says Rivner .
‚Äú But the level of coordination was staggering . ‚Äù
Rivner says Pleshchuk , T√É ‚Ä¶ √Ç¬°urikov , Covelin and Hacker 3 likely spent months on private chat channels and Internet forums plotting and recruiting accomplices .
‚Äú They cloned 44 cards and gave them to an army of cashiers , that went from ATM to ATM in their local cities , ‚Äù says Rivner .
‚Äú So , on average , each cloned card was used in 47 ATMs in six adjacent towns .
Managing time zone issues and coordinating cashers in eight nations ‚Äì all required to hit as many ATMs as possible within 12 hours makes me think of an Al Qaeda like strategy of multiple attacks in a single day . ‚Äù
‚Äú A lot of planning and a very high degree of international cooperation went into this scam . ‚Äù

Israel has officially rejected US President Barack Obama 's demand to suspend all construction in contested east Jerusalem , aides to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said Thursday .
The aides said Netanyahu delivered his government 's position to Obama over the weekend , ahead of the scheduled arrival later Thursday of the US president 's special Mideast envoy , George Mitchell .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because the contact between the two leaders was private .
Washington had put Mitchell 's shuttle diplomacy on hold for more than a month as it awaited a reply from Israel .
The aides to Netanyahu provided no information on whether he had offered any other concessions to the Palestinians in an effort to restart the long - stalled talks .
But it appeared likely Israel tempered its rejection with other confidence - building gestures toward the Palestinians .
Science Minister Bennie Begin said it was " just impossible and unacceptable that people try to impress us that we should limit construction in Jerusalem . " " Jews and Arabs can live throughout the city , " he said .
" This policy will be retained . " US officials said that Netanyahu agreed to nearly a dozen other steps towards renewed negotiations , such as releasing some Palestinian prisoners from jail and removing more roadblocks in the West Bank , according to The Wall Street Journal .
Israel would also expand the responsibilities of the Palestinian security forces , and discuss borders and the status of Jerusalem in detail , said the report .
Netanyahu also reportedly agreed to stop construction in Ramat Shlomo for two years .
Israel and the Palestinians had been set to launch US - mediated negotiations last month when Israel announced plans during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden to build 1,600 homes in a Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem .
The Palestinians claim the city 's eastern sector as capital of a future state .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called the Netanyahu position " very unfortunate " and said he hoped the US " will be able to convince the Israeli government to give peace a chance by halting settlement construction in east Jerusalem and elsewhere .
" Asked if anything short of an east Jerusalem construction freeze would bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table , Erekat said it would depend on what Netanyahu told the Americans .
The government has debated proposals to free some of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails , turn over more West Bank territory to the control of Palestinian security forces and possibly curb Jewish construction in the heart of Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem .
Netanyahu's spokesman , Mark Regev , said Israel was exploring ways to restart talks , but refused to elaborate .
A Palestinian official said Mitchell was expected to meet separately with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday .
Mitchell 's efforts are focused on launching indirect peace talks , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement on Mitchell 's mission from the Americans .
Last week , Obama issued a surprisingly pessimistic assessment of peacemaking prospects , saying the US could n't force its will on Israelis and Palestinians if they were n't interested in making the compromises necessary to end their decades - old conflict .

AstraZeneca has completed a deal to pay $ 520 million to settle federal investigations into marketing practices for its blockbuster schizophrenia drug , Seroquel , the Attorney General , Eric Holder , said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon .
‚Äú AstraZeneca paid kickbacks to doctors as part of an illegal scheme to market drugs for unapproved uses , ‚Äù Kathleen Sebelius , secretary of health and human services , said at the event in Washington .
She said the company promoted drugs for unapproved uses by children , the elderly , veterans and prisoners .
Glenn Engelmann , AstraZeneca ‚Äôs U.S. general counsel , released a statement saying the company denies the allegations but settled the investigation with the payment .
‚Äú It is in the best interest of AstraZeneca to resolve these matters and to move forward with our business of discovering and developing important , life - changing medicines ‚Äî while avoiding the delay , uncertainty , and expense of protracted litigation , ‚Äù Mr. Engelmann said .

I talk a lot about how having a spec is a critical component of software development .
But how do you know that your spec is good , and that it has been developed enough ?
Simply put , how do you distinguish between a good spec and a spec that is lacking ?
This problem had confounded me for a good bit of time , because it ‚Äôs hard to create a rule surrounding spec development .
Since most developers ( myself included ) are also generally bad at developing good specs , it becomes even more difficult to create such a rule .
However , I heard a great adage from someone recently that I thought summed up how developers can see specs nearly perfectly .
If it takes more than 15 minutes to determine what it is that you ‚Äôre building , the spec was n‚Äôt done properly .
Before we get into what I mean , I want to add this caveat : this is a generalization , designed to illustrate rather to inform .
I do n‚Äôt recommend people buy timers and set them to 15 minutes , and at 15:01 send the spec back to the product team .
That ‚Äôs not what the point here is .
The point here is that developers are n‚Äôt usually spec designers , at least not when it comes to the actual development .
When code is being written , the spec should be settled .
There should be some kind of wireframe or description of the functionality required .
This need not be in an abstract requirements document ; it simply needs to be able to communicate effectively to the developer what the person who wrote it wants .
Having a spec that is clear and able to quickly tell a developer what is wanted allows the developer to spend more time on other things that are important , like designing the backend , implementing the functionality , testing and the front - end artwork .
These are the true tasks of developers .
Additionally , having a clear spec from the beginning helps ensure that the finished product will more accurately meet the intentions of those requesting it .
This makes for happy clients , internal or external .
In order to employ this rule , however , there is a caveat : the 15 minute rule applies only to determining what is being asked for .
It does not apply to debate over architecture , design , implementation , artwork , or other aspects relating to implementing the spec .
It relates only to debate over the spec itself .
Also , in cases where the developer is called to assist in developing the spec , obviously the rule does n‚Äôt apply .
Making the spec better is a critical component of making development work .
This rule provides a baseline , and should help produce better specs and ultimately , better products .
Frustrated with your company ‚Äôs development practices ?
You do n't have to be !
No matter what the issues are , they can be fixed .
You can begin to shed light on these issues with my handy checklist .
Plus , I 'll help you with strategies to approach the issues at the organization level and " punch above your weight . "

Still , Mr. Dimon said he would not consider restoring the dividend until he saw sustained improvement in the job market and fewer borrowers in trouble .
He also said regulators must provide more clarity on how much capital banks would be required to hold .
Even as the country emerges from a deep recession , the job market has not yet rebounded .
There are only tentative signs that home prices are near a bottom .
And JPMorgan ‚Äôs problems are not yet over .
The bank set aside about $ 7 billion to cover future losses in its consumer businesses ‚Äî a large sum but about one - third less than in previous quarters .
It has now stockpiled a total of $ 39 billion , or roughly 5.6 percent of loans .
The bank set aside another $ 2.3 billion in litigation reserves as it deals with fierce legal fights over faulty mortgages and a pitched battle with Washington Mutual bondholders over that company ‚Äôs remnants .
The company also booked about $ 1 billion in trading and securities - related gains .
JPMorgan has emerged from the crisis in better shape than most of its peers , which suffered bruising losses or a devastating blow to their reputation or , in many cases , both .
No bank ‚Äî and no bank leader ‚Äî is showing more confidence on Wall Street or in Washington , where JPMorgan is aggressively fighting moves to create a separate consumer protection agency and seeking exemptions from derivatives rules .
Even on Wednesday , Mr. Dimon grew agitated when asked about the ‚Äú bank fee ‚Äù proposed by the Obama administration .
‚Äú Let ‚Äôs not call it a bank fee , and call it what it is ‚Äî a punitive bank tax , ‚Äù he said bluntly .
The investment bank unit posted strong trading revenue after a first - quarter rally in the fixed - income markets .
Profit of $ 2.47 billion was up 54 percent from a year ago , when the bank suffered big losses on loan write - offs .
The investment bank set aside about 35 percent of first - quarter revenue to pay employees , perhaps setting a new lower threshold for the industry .
Chase ‚Äôs consumer businesses , however , are still losing money .
And taking a page from the Citigroup playbook , Mr. Dimon divided his Chase retail banking business into two segments for reporting purposes : its existing operations , which will continue to grow ; and a holding tank to run off its most troubled loans .
So -called " sudden acceleration " is an ugly mix of media frenzy , sophisticated engineering , and complex human - machine interaction .
But recent data on Toyota sudden - acceleration complaints seems to show - - with some qualifiers -- that the bulk of the incidents ending in fatalities have been reported by drivers aged 61 to 80 .
Which leads to a very obvious question : Could it be that human error , not defective design , is at fault here ?
Age clusters ...
This morning , our friends at Jalopnik posted a fascinating chart showing the age distribution of all the drivers in 56 deaths since 1992 that were linked by the Los Angeles Times to Toyota sudden acceleration .
And the chart is pretty revealing :
The highest clusters are the 61 - 70 and 71 - 80 cohorts .
The median age is 60 , and just over half are 60 or older .
That 's against just 16 percent of drivers over 60 across all automotive fatalities .
They helpfully overlaid the average age distribution of deaths in all auto accidents , which peaks for drivers aged 22 - 30 and falls consistently thereafter .
Death rates overall for drivers 61 - 80 are just one - third those of the 20 - somethings .
Toyota 's diagram showing how to properly install floor mats
... with caveats
There are several caveats .
The data does not represent all incidents reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) , because those reports do not specify the complainant 's ( or driver 's ) age .
Moreover , the age distribution of all sudden - acceleration complainants should be mapped against the age distribution of Toyota buyers overall , to ensure it 's not representative .
But we 're pretty confident that the average Toyota purchaser is not between 60 and 80 .
New York Times op-ed
But it 's not just one of those durned auto blogs that suggests age plays a big role .
Two media outlets have recently carried opinion pieces reinforcing the continuing belief among automotive engineers that driver error is largely to blame .
The op - ed page of The New York Times , carried a lengthy article last week by Richard Schmidt , a psychology professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , noting that driver error is almost always at fault in supposed sudden acceleration cases .
Based on his work in the 1986 Audi sudden acceleration case , he writes , " The trouble , unbelievable as it may seem , is that sudden acceleration is very often caused by drivers who press the gas pedal when they intend to press the brake . "

The Audi allegation
Toyota is likely haunted by the spectre of Audi's 1986 trials , when an inflammatory " 60 Minutes " report led to scores of claims of so - called sudden acceleration .
Audi 's crisis management was a textbook case of what not to do -- it clammed up , then it blamed drivers -- but it was ultimately exonerated .
A long NHTSA investigation closed the books by saying the problem was " pedal misapplication , " though it noted that Audi had spaced its pedal very closely together .
By that time , Audi 's sales had plummeted to numbers so low that the company almost pulled out of the U.S .
Audi subsequently installed an automatic shift lock , which prevents the car from being shifted into gear unless the brake pedal is pressed .
Sudden acceleration incidents from standstill have plummeted in cars with shift locks , which Audi licensed to all carmakers .

Psychological misfires
Schmidt notes that drivers 60 to 70 years old had complaints at six times the rate of those 20 to 30 .
Complaints were also more common among those unfamiliar with the car involved , and people of short stature .
All cars involved had automatic transmissions .
How can a driver place a foot on the wrong pedal ?
Schmidt cites " noisy neuromuscular processes , " in which a limb does n't do quite what the brain tells it to , leading a driver 's foot to deviate slightly from its intended path .
Drivers misaligned in their seats raise the risk too .
In the panic following acceleration when the driver expected braking , the immediate response is to press down harder on the " brake " pedal , leading to further acceleration .
Drivers , Schmidt says , " typically do not shut off the ignition , shift to neutral , or apply the parking brake . "
Putting it into perspective
From the right - of - center Independent Journalism Project , Michael Fumento reaches the same conclusions , again citing the Audi precedent .
He also notes the out - of - proportion response to what is , in reality , a very small number of deaths and incidents overall .

Fumento wrote in the Los Angeles Times this week that the 56 deaths the paper cites over 18 years are just a miniscule fraction of the 420,000 total deaths in vehicle accidents during that period .
And he notes that no less a source than Edmunds.com found that Toyota 's sales ranking -- from 2001 to 2010 , it was third in total U.S. car sales -- was far higher than its ranking for number of safety complaints to the NHTSA , where it was 17th .
Villains : trial lawyers , media
While he does n't attempt to explain sudden acceleration much beyond the Audi conclusion , he quotes Leonard Evans , author of a book called Traffic Safety , who notes that in general , " Most crashes occur because drivers do n't leave an adequate safety margin . "
Fumento blames an obsession with mechanical defects over drivers who observe safe following distances .
And he slams " trial lawyers seeking the deepest pockets and a media that know it 's sexier to crusade against corporations than emphasize individual responsibility . "

But back to age
Could the graying of Baby Boomers unwilling to admit they 're aging even be a factor here ?
The earliest Boomers , born in 1945 , are now 65 - - right in that high accident cohort .
TV shows and magazines are full of advice about how to take away the car keys from aging parents with failing driving skills .
In an increasingly suburban United States , cars are a vital necessity , whereas earlier generations could walk or ride buses in central cities .
We 'll leave it to the data to speak loudest .
If investigators find no conclusive mechanical flaws , and the age distribution for so - called sudden acceleration is radically different from that for accidents overall ... then perhaps that disparity is worthy of investigation itself .
We will now take cover from the bombs and shells we expect to rain down from the AARP .

Rielle Hunter seems to be having some regrets about her her GQ spread .
On The View today , Barbara Walters said she had talked to Rielle Hunter this morning .
" She was in tears when she called , " said Walters , " and said that when she saw the pictures in GQ she screamed for two hours .
She said she found the photographs repulsive . "
So Walters says she asked if that was the case why did she pose for them ?
" She said she trusted Mark Seliger , whom she said is a brillant photographer and quote , ' I went with the flow , ' " recounted Walters .
Walters says Hunter " thought that having one of those photos was okay and would be sexy and that there were others that were just beautiful headshots , but that GQ picked photos to hit one note . "
Mark Fiore made a little online history this week by being the first web - only journalist to win a Pulitzer Prize .
His editorial cartoons , though , were rejected from the App Store for violating Apple 's anti-satire provisions .
That 's a dangerous precedent .
UPDATED :
A lot of hay has been made over the App Store 's policies , particularly over apps that are deemed pornographic ( or bikini - ridden ) .
But it looks as though the concerns raised earlier by German magazine Stern are becoming more and more legitimized : Apple 's making judgments on editorial content .

According to Laura McGann at the Nieman Journalism Lab , Fiore received the following email from Apple in late December in response to the submission of his NewsToons app :
Dear Mr. Fiore ,
Thank you for submitting NewsToons to the App Store .
We 've reviewed NewsToons and determined that we cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store because it contains content that ridicules public figures and is in violation of Section 3.3.14 from the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement which states : " Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , sounds , etc. ) that in Apple 's reasonable judgment may be found objectionable , for example , materials that may be considered obscene , pornographic , or defamatory . "
Examples of such content have been attached for your reference .
If you believe that you can make the necessary changes so that NewsToons does not violate the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement , we encourage you to do so and resubmit it for review .
Regards , iPhone Developer Program
So that 's the statement Apple is making : material that " ridicules public figures " is on the same plane as pornographic and obscene apps .

Apple 's walled garden approach to App Store content means they can exclude pretty much whomever they want .
But can and should are obviously entirely different things .
And if they 're sincere about the iPad being the future of media , they 're going to need to accept that satirical ‚Äî even controversial ‚Äî voices are an essential part of the information landscape .
Otherwise , the future might a pretty bleak place .

( CNN ) --
In a long - awaited speech Thursday in Florida , President Obama will boldly go where no president has gone before , laying out an entirely new vision for the U.S. space program .
The firestorm of controversy has already begun
For more than 50 years , presidents have pushed for government rockets to send astronauts to space , the moon and possibly Mars .
But now a new paradigm is being proposed .
The moon program is off the table , and Mars is only a distant possibility .
NASA is essentially getting out of the astronaut business , letting the Russians and private enterprise take over .
The glory days of NASA , some say , are over .
The Obama plan is truly breathtaking , ending an era that lasted from Presidents Kennedy to Bush .
Some specifics :
‚Ä¢ The moon program , called Constellation , is being suspended , and its components and $ 9 billion of research are going down the drain .
The Ares rocket , which recently underwent a successful preliminary test , will be canceled .
The Orion lunar module will be repurposed as an astronaut " lifeboat " tethered to the international space station .
‚Ä¢ The space shuttle program is ending , causing 4,600 workers to lose their jobs .
( This was also in the Bush plan , but that proposal included funding the Ares rocket . )
‚Ä¢ Without a space shuttle , the U.S. will rely temporarily on Russian rockets to send our astronauts into space .
‚Ä¢ Eventually , private enterprise will take over launching our astronauts .
Some critics say that this is all too much , too soon .
Private companies may not be ready to pick up the slack for years to transport astronauts .
Conceivably , any political crisis with the Russians in far - away places , such as the Balkans , might affect our access to outer space .
And we will just have to swallow our pride when the Chinese plant their flag on the moon sometime after 2020 , as they say they will .
Proponents of the plan Obama is expected to describe , however , say that it is long overdue and inevitable .
In these trying financial times , the U.S. cannot sustain an ambitious space program .
Get real , they say .
Let private enterprise take over .
It 's the American way .
But everyone agrees that the wheel is broken and needs to be fixed .
It all boils down to one dirty four - letter word : cost .
During the Cold War , the superpowers gladly opened their treasuries because the space race was a matter of national pride and honor .
Since then , the realities have sunk in .
It costs about $ 10,000 per pound to send anything into near - Earth orbit .
( Think of John Glenn made of solid gold . )
But when you add in life support and safety factors , it costs about $ 65 million to send each astronaut aboard the space shuttle , which in turn costs half a billion dollars per launch .
To go to the moon would cost perhaps 10 times as much .
There are some positive recommendations that Obama should keep in mind as he plots the future of the space program .
‚Ä¢ NASA needs to set concrete goals and deadlines .
In the past , the space shuttle and the international space station were used to justify each other 's existence .
Instead , the space program should hold the feet of the bureaucracies and corporations to the fire .
Having a tangible vision of the future , with a clear destination and mission , will hold planners accountable , give a sharp focus to the objectives of the space program and cut waste .
‚Ä¢ NASA has to abandon its cost - plus model , where it guarantees its contractors a profit beyond the cost .
This model is unsustainable -- the tail wagging the dog .
It 's an open invitation for bureaucracies and corporations to pad their budgets , rather than operate as efficiently as possible .
‚Ä¢ NASA has to inspire competition and innovation .
The Hubble Space Telescope and the robotic missions to the planets have been a shining beacon for research based on goals set by scientists instead of the narrow priorities of bureaucracies and politicians .
‚Ä¢ NASA has to fund risky , out - of - the - box propulsion systems -- besides the expensive chemical rockets that are used now -- to help drive down the cost of space travel .
A lot of a rocket 's fuel goes into lifting itself into orbit , which is a waste .
Ground - based laser and microwave beams , for example , can vaporize water contained in a rocket , which is then shot out the other end , so only the payload goes into space , not the fuel .
As he speaks to aerospace workers , the president should frame this moment as an opportunity to redesign the space program .
The key is to maintain the U.S. as the leader in innovation , ideas and progress , because science is ultimately the engine of prosperity .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michio Kaku .
London , England ( CNN ) --
They are normally transmitters of the disease , but mosquitoes could one day be used to tackle malaria after scientists developed a genetically engineered version of the species that can deliver a vaccine .
Researchers altered the salivary glands of the Anopheles stephensi mosquito , dubbed a " flying vaccinator , " so that it carried the Leishmania vaccine within its saliva .
This mosquito , the main spreaders of human malaria , was shown in tests to transmit this vaccine when it bit its host , in this case laboratory mice , making it a transmitter of the vaccine .
Bites from the insect succeeded in raising antibodies in the mice , indicating successful immunization with the vaccine , according to research published in Insect Molecular Biology , a British scientific journal .
The study , led by Associate Professor Shigeto Yoshida from the Jichi Medical University in Japan , could be used to formulate a new strategy in the global fight against malaria .
" The lack of an effective [ malaria ] vaccine means control of the carrier has become a crucial objective to combating the disease .
Following bites , protective immune responses are induced , just like a conventional vaccination but with no pain and no cost , " said Yoshida .
" What 's more , continuous exposure to bites will maintain high levels of protective immunity , through natural boosting , for a lifetime .
So the insect shifts from being a pest to being beneficial . "
About 60 species of the Anopheles mosquito are vectors of the malaria parasite , which are transmitted to humans when the female feeds on blood .
Every year about 250 million people are infected with malaria and nearly one million die , according to the World Health Organization .
In Africa one in every five childhood deaths is caused by malaria , says the WHO .
However , the researchers admit that there are barriers to using this form of vaccination in the wild , including issues of controlling dosage , " medical safety issues " and the " issues of public acceptance to [ the ] release of transgenic mosquitoes . "
In 1975 , the first digital camera took 23 seconds to record a 100 - line black - and - white photo onto cassette tape .
Today , a Nikon D3s takes photos with 12 million pixels at 1/8000 of a second .
And it can see in the dark .

The conventional wisdom is that the romp - stomp - stomp of progress in digital imaging has proceeded on the mostly one - way track of ballooning pixel counts .
Which was n't always a pointless enterprise .
I mean , 1.3 - megapixel images , like you could take in 1991 , are n't very big .
The Nikon D1 , introduced in 1999 , was the digital camera that " replaced film at forward - looking newspapers . "
It was $ 5,000 and shot 2.7 megapixel images using a CCD sensor , large enough for many print applications .
But still , there was room to grow , and so it did .
Now pretty much every ( non-phone ) camera shoots at least 10 - megapixel pictures , with 14 megapixels common even in baseline point - and - shoots .
Cheap DSLRs from Canon are now scratching 18 MP as standard .
Megapixels were an easy - to - swallow specification to pitch in marketing , and became the way normal people assessed camera quality .
Advertisement
The now - common geek contrarianism is that more megapixels ain't more better .
The new go - to standard for folks who consider themselves savvy is low - light performance .
Arguably , this revamped arms race was kickstarted by the D3 , Nikon 's flagship DSLR that forsook megapixels for ISO .
( Rumor had it that the D3 and D300 led Canon to shitcan their original , middling update to the 5D , pushing full - steam - ahead for a year to bring us the incredible 5D Mark II . )
However it began , " amazing low - light performance " is now a standard bullet point for any camera that costs more than $ 300 ( even if it 's not true ) .
Nikon and Canon 's latest DSLRs have ISO speeds of over 100,000 .
Welcome to the new image war .

How a Camera Sees
Advertisement
The name of the game , as you 've probably gathered by now , is collecting light .
And in fact , the way a digital camera " sees " actually is n't all that different from the way our eyeballs do , at one level .
Light , which is made up of photons , enters through a lens , and hits the image sensor ( that boring looking rectangle above ) which converts it into an electrical signal , sorta like it enters through an eye 's lens and strikes the retina , where it 's also converted into an electrical signal .
If nothing else after this makes sense , keep this in mind :
The more light an image sensor can collect , the better .
When a camera is spec'd at 10 megapixels , it 's not just telling you that its biggest photos will contain about 10 million pixels .
Generally , it 's also telling you the number of photosites , or photodiodes on the image sensor ; confusingly , these are also often referred to as pixels .
Photodiodes are the part of the sensor that 's actually sensitive to light , and if you remember your science , a photodiode converts light ( photons ) into electricity ( electrons ) .
The standard trope for explaining photosites is that they 're tiny buckets left out in a downpour of photons , collecting the light particles as they rain down .
As you might expect , the bigger the photosite , the more photons it can collect at the moment when it 's exposed ( i.e. , when you press the shutter button ) .
Advertisement
Image sensors come in a range of sizes , as you can see in this helpful diagram from Wikipedia .
A bigger sensor , like the full - frame slab used in the Canon 5D or Nikon D3 , has more space for photosites than the thumbnail - sized sensor that fits in little point - and - shoots .
So , if they 're both 12 - megapixels , that is , they both have 12 million photosites , the bigger sensor can obviously collect a lot more light per pixel , since the pixels are bigger .
Advertisement
If you 're grasping for a specification to look for , the distance between photosites is referred to as pixel pitch , which roughly tells you how big the photosite , or pixel , is .
For instance , a Nikon D3 with a 36 mm x 23.9 mm sensor has a pixel pitch of 8.45 microns , while a Canon S90 point - and - shoot with a 7.60 mm x 5.70 mm sensor has a pitch of 2 microns .
To put that in less math-y terms , if you got the same amount of light to hit the image sensors the D3 and the S90 ‚Äî you know , you took the exact same exposure ‚Äî the bigger pixels in the D3 would be able to collect and hold on to more of the light .
When you 're looking for low - light performance , it 's immediately obvious why that 's a good thing .
Advertisement
Catch More Light , Faster , Faster
Advertisement
Okay , so that 's easy enough :
As an axiom , larger photodiodes result in more light sensitivity .
( So with the 1D Mark IV , Canon kept the same photodiode size , but the shrunk the rest of the pixel to fit more of them on the same - size chip as its predecessor ) .
There 's more to an image sensor than simply photosites , though , which is why I called up Dr. Peter B. Catrysse from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University .
The " ideal pixel , " he says , would be flat - just an area that collects light - nearly bare silicon .
But even at a basic level , a silicon photodiode sits below many other structures and layers including a micro lens ( which directs light onto the photodiode ) , a color filter ( necessary , ' cause image sensors are in fact color blind ) and the metal wiring layers inside each pixel .
These structures affect the amount of light that the photodiode " sees . "
So one way manufacturers are improving sensors is by trying to make all of these structures as thin as possible - we 're talking hundreds of nanometers - so more light gets through .
Advertisement
One major way that 's happening , he says , is with back - illuminated sensors , which move the wiring to the back - side of the silicon substrate , as illustrated in this diagram by Sony .
It 's currently still more expensive to make sensors this way , but since more light 's getting through , you can use smaller pixels ( and have more of them ) .
In your basic image sensor construction , there 's an array of microlenses sitting above the photosites to direct light into them .
Previously , you had gaps between the microlenses , which meant you had light falling through that was n't being directed onto the actually light - sensitive parts of the sensor .
Canon and Nikon have created gapless microlenses , so more of the light falling onto the sensor is directed into the diode , and not wasted .
If you must persist with the bucket metaphor , think of it as putting a larger funnel over the bucket , one that can grab more because it has a wider mouth .
Here 's a shot of gapless microlens architecture :
Advertisement
A chief reason to gather as much light as possible is to bring up your signal - to - noise ratio , which is the province of true digital imaging nerds .
Anyways , there are several different sources and kinds of noise .
Worth knowing is " photon shot " or just " shot " noise , which occurs because the stream of photons hitting the image sensor are n't perfectly consistent in their timing ; there 's " read " noise , which is inherent to image sensors ; and " dark current " noise , which is basically stray electrons striking the sensor that are n't generated by visible light ‚Äî they 're often caused by heat .

Taken with a Nikon D3s at ISO 102,400
Back in the day , when people shot photographs on this stuff called film , they actually bought it according to its light sensitivity , expressed as an ISO speed .
( A standard set by the International Organization for Standardization , confusingly aka ISO .
The film speed standard is ISO 5800:1987 . )
With digital cameras , you also can tell your camera how sensitive to light it should be using ISO , which is supposed to be equivalent to the film standard .
Advertisement
The thing is , whether you 're shooting at ISO 100 or ISO 1600 , the same number of photons hit your sensor ‚Äî you 're just boosting the signal from the sensor , and along with it , all the noise that was picked up on the way .
If you 've got more signal to work with ‚Äî like in a camera whose sensor has some fat photon - collecting pixels , you get a higher signal - to - noise ratio when you crank it up , which is one reason a photo taken D3 at ISO 6400 looks way better than one from a teeny point - and - shoot , and why a 1D Mark IV or D3s can even think about shooting at an ISO of over 100,000 , like the photo above .
( Another reason is that a 1D Mark IV - level camera possesses vastly superior image processing , with faster processors that can crunch complex algorithms to help reduce noise . )
Sensor Shake and Bake
There are two kinds of image sensors that most digital cameras use today : CCD ( charge - coupled device ) sensors and CMOS ( complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ) sensors , which are actually a kind of active - pixel sensor , but the way they 're made have become a shorthand name .
" Fundamentally , at least physics - wise , they work exactly the same , " says Dr. Catrysse , so one 's not intrinsically more awesome than the other .
CCD sensors are the more mature imaging technology .
So for a long time , they tended to be better , but now CMOS sensors are taking over , having almost completely crowded them out of cellphones and even high - end DSLRs ( Leica 's M9 is an exception ) .
Dr. Catrysse suspects CCD sensors will be around for some time , but perhaps more likely in scientific and niche applications where high - level integration , speed and power usage are less of an issue as compared to mainstream mobile applications .
Advertisement
A " CMOS sensor " is one that 's made using the CMOS process , the way you make all kinds of integrated circuits ‚Äî you know , stuff like CPUs , GPUs and RAM ‚Äî so they 're actually cheaper to make than CCD sensors .
( The cheap - to - make aspect is why they 've been the sensor of choice in cameraphones , and conversely , DSLRs with huge chips . )
And , unlike a CCD sensor , which has to move all of the electrons off of the chip to run them through an analog - to - digital converter , with a CMOS sensor , all of that happens on the same integrated chip .
So they 're faster , and they use less power .
Something to think about as well : Because they 're made pretty much the same way as any other semiconductor , CMOS sensors progress along with advances in semiconductor manufacturing .
Smaller transistors allow for more circuits in a pixel and the potential to remove more noise at the source , says Dr. Catrysse , bringing us closer to fundamental physical limits , like photon noise , and performance that was once the prerogative of CCD sensors .
And then we 're talking about using small features in advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology for controlling light at the nanoscale .
The Point
We 've reached , in many ways , a point of megapixel fatigue :
They 're not as valuable , or even as buzzy as they used to be .
Not many of us print billboard - sized images .
But the technology continues to progress ‚Äî more refined sensors , smarter image processors , sharper glass ‚Äî and the camera industry needs something to sell us every year .
Advertisement
But that 's not entirely a bad thing .
Our friend and badass war photographer Teru Kuwayama says that while " increasing megapixel counts are mostly just a pain in the ass , unless you happen to be in the hard drive or memory card business , skyrocketing ISOs on the other hand , are a quantum leap , opening up a time - space dimension that did n't exist for previous generations of photographers .
I 'd happily trade half the megapixels for twice the light sensitivity . "
Better images , not just bigger images .
That 's the promise of this massive shift .
The clouds to this silver lining are that by next year , ISO speeds will likely be the headline , easy - to - digest spec for consumers .
And like any other spec , just because the ISO ratings go higher does n't mean low - light performance will be better .
Remember , " more " is n't more better .

A lioness with three cubs was stabbed to death yesterday in Africa ; it was a retaliatory killing for the killing of two goats by a lioness .
In accordance with tradition , a hunting party of morans ( warriors ) left to kill the lioness they thought responsible for the killings .
They stabbed her through the heart and head with two spears and killed her .
Then they cut off her feet , ears , and tail and buried her collar .
The fate of her cubs rests on the remaining pride members and Lomunyak , the mighty male .
Since Narika ‚Äôs death , Lomunyak has been heard roaring through the day , calling to his lost pride member .
Lion Guardians , a local conservation group that tries to protect African lions in Kenya ‚Äôs Massailand , was trying to help keep the lioness alive by any means necessary but unfortunately in this case could not stop the hunters from killing her .
The Lion Guardians play a vital role in this area because they help reduce conflict between humans and lions by educating communities , assisting herders , improving livestock enclosures and so on .
Since the start of the project , Guardians have actively prevented over 20 hunting parties from killing lions .

The only way out of the mess we 're in is through innovation , the creation of small businesses and good old hard work .
Did you ever think you would see an America in which most people see no problem with unemployment around 10 % ; 0 % interest rates for more than a year ( even though the economy allegedly grew more than 5 % last quarter ) ; $ 150 trillion of government liabilities coming due in the next 20 years ; rising taxes ; taxpayer - guaranteed bank and Wall Street profits ; the government takeover of a major corporation like General Motors ; excessive government control of multiple industries ; and a Treasury market dependent on the sale of trillions of dollars of new bonds every year , with the Chinese government and our own Federal Reserve as the critical buyers ?
The list goes on .
I do n't recognize this country .
It does seem like all those people who warned that a lack of basic math skills would kill us one day were right .
People in this country cannot do basic math .
If they could , there would be riots in the streets .
I guess everyone is too busy watching
Jersey Shore
and
American Idol
.
Even a simple thing like the unemployment rate shows our ignorance .
The Congressional Budget Office uses a 5 % unemployment rate in its estimate of future growth and liabilities , but the chance of 5 % unemployment any time in the next 10 years is almost zero .
We need to either have millions of people of working age die or have about 400,000 jobs added per month for several years in a row .
We never even got close to that during the best job market of our lifetime , which was in the late 1990s , and we never even got more than 200,000 jobs per month for the entire decade that just ended .
That was with record low interest rates .
Just to keep the unemployment rate where it is we need 150,000 jobs added per month --
every
month .
It 's doubtful we can even keep that up for years , especially with either much higher interest rates or much higher commodity prices and inflation .
One way or another you have to pay for money .
Either you pay with higher rates , or with a cheaper currency and higher inflation .
Except our economy is 67 % consumption , so any export - oriented job gains from a cheaper currency will be wiped out by the lack of purchasing power of consumers .
How does this add up to anything but disaster ?
All we need is Emperor Nero and his fiddle right now .
Another area that makes no sense is how we 're dealing with small businesses .
Allegedly , we all want to create private sector jobs .
However , the government is doing everything possible with tax increases , regulation and lack of funding to hurt small businesses .
Health care reform is a huge tax on small businesses .
In addition , the legislation levies a 3.8 % tax on people with higher incomes , many of whom are successful small business owners who could otherwise use that money to hire new workers and expand their businesses .
New proposals in Sen. Christopher Dodd's ( D. , Conn . ) financial bill would make it much harder for investors to fund start - up businesses .
Why the government would want to do this is totally beyond my understanding .
There 's also the $ 30 billion for small business funding that has been promised for more than a year by the federal government but is still locked in bureaucratic red tape .
Small Business Administration lending has been cut back dramatically , even as trillions of dollars have been handed to the big banks with no questions asked .
If we want to create jobs , why are these things happening ?
But enough negativity , which of course is considered un -American .
What is the good news ?
Well , the good news is that if you work for the federal government or a big bank , or you 're a Wall Street speculator , or you 're already a multimillionaire , you are doing well .
Not good enough ?
OK , if you 're not in one of those categories , you have a few choices of how to make it in this economy .
One , you can try to join one of those groups .
Two , you can try to marry into one of those groups .
Three , you can try to immigrate into a country with a more vibrant economy , such as the People 's Republic of China .
If that last one sounds bizarre , I feel your pain .
But it 's true .
Fortunately , there is one more option .
You can innovate .
What 's that ?
It 's good old - fashioned capitalism .
Create something new that people need or want .
Even in this stagnant and mismanaged economy , some brave Americans are still innovating and creating wealth and jobs .
This is particularly true in the software industry , which I believe is the greatest hope we have for our economy .
Even though venture funding is down , angel investing is down and small business lending is down , there are still 600,000 businesses starting every year .
Many of the most promising new companies are in technology , and especially in software .

What do they need from the government and the taxpayer ?
Nothing , except to be left alone and not destroyed with taxes and regulations .
Entrepreneurs , especially in software , regularly self - fund their businesses and raise money from friends and family .
This is how 99 % of businesses are funded in the U.S. -- not through sitting around waiting for a handout or a sweetheart deal from the government via lobbying and political connections .
It 's no accident that the only time in our recent history during which middle - class people improved their standard of living was during the technology boom of the late 1990's , which was centered around software and the Internet .
People only remember the bubble of 1999 and 2000 , which was actually caused by policy errors at the Federal Reserve .
However , that period from 1995 to 2000 was the best job market in this country since the post - World War II boom .
Technology creates good , high - paying jobs .
It also raises living standards for consumers by creating new products and services and more efficient ways of delivering existing products and services .
For investors , maybe a suggestion is to take some of your capital that is sitting in an account earning nothing and , instead of speculating on Wall Street , or trying to hide in bonds , or betting on another real estate bubble , make a small bet on a brighter future for this country by investing in a private technology company or other small business .
Your investment wo n't be guaranteed , but one thing I know is that any time somebody tells me a return is guaranteed I hold onto my wallet .
In real life outside the privileged world of Wall Street and the federal government , there is no upside without downside and risk .
That is capitalism .

Everyone knows that transit is so morally superior to driving that we are n‚Äôt supposed to ask about how much it costs .
Pay no attention to the fact that the next light - rail line Portland wants to build will cost nearly $ 3 billion ; planners do n‚Äôt mention the cost in their presentation of the proposal .
Nor are we supposed to ask whether anyone is actually riding transit .
When Portland ‚Äôs last light - rail line , which cost $ 1.5 billion , opened a few years ago , transit ridership declined .
But that ‚Äôs no reason to question the next line .
Now we have some new questions are we are n‚Äôt supposed to ask .
A bill signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday has exempted transit projects from detailed environmental review , meaning we no longer get to find out that the rail project that ‚Äôs supposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will actually increase them .

The Swan ‚Äôs Song of Galileo ‚Äôs Myth
Atila Sinke Guimar√£es
It became common in innumerable revolutionary milieus to criticize the Holy Inquisition , and by extension the Catholic Church , for the condemnation of Galileo .
The progressivists endorse such critiques , and repeat the catchphrase ‚Äì the obscurant Church condemned science .
They are quick to add that such condemnation would prove that the Magisterium of the Church is not infallible ( 1 ) .
Then , the progressivists assume another consequence : Galileo was condemned for applying scientific data to the exegesis of Holy Scripture .
Since this condemnation was supposedly unjust , it would be valid to use scientific data either to alter the interpretation of Scripture , or even to demonstrate that it is wrong .
These arguments are sophistic , taking advantage of the confused boundaries among science , philosophy , and theology that existed at the beginning of the 17th century .
Such confusion can be verified not only in the texts of Galileo , but also in the sentence of his condemnation ( 1633 ) .
Galileo extrapolated scientific data and made conclusions in the fields of philosophy and theology , allegedly supposing both to be in the realm of science .
The judges of the Inquisition made a parallel confusion when they condemned the scientific theories of the scholar , thinking that they were condemning the unsuitable philosophical and theological extrapolations of Galileo .
That is , both sides based their conclusions on a fundamental imprecision of terms as we understand them today .
That imprecision is what fed the myth that the Church condemned science .
All the ensuing attacks against the Inquisition and the Catholic Church have been made without taking this basic confusion into consideration .
Such confusion was pointed out by Fr. Mario Vigano , SJ , a scholar in History , who supports E. Berti , another Italian historian , when he dealt with the relations between science and faith .
Vigano wrote : ‚Äú Berti ‚Äôs point is that the problem of the relation between science and faith cannot be resolved by analyzing exclusively the two terms in question .
The problem must be considered from a perspective that is neither that of faith nor of science , but rather that of philosophy . ‚Ä¶.
For Galileo and the theologians of his time , this problem did not exist because there was no distinction between science and philosophy ‚Äù ( 2 ) .

2. Mario Vigano , ‚Äú Galileo ieri e oggi , ‚Äù La Civilta Cattolica , September 1984 , p. 388 .
It is indispensable , therefore , to know precisely what each party intended in that discussion .
Let me analyze the historic data in order to set straight the confused situation .
Was the Church against science in the 17th century ?
There is no direct evidence that the Inquisition had the intention to attack science as such when it made the condemnation of Galileo .
Several facts can be listed to support this position :
St. Robert Bellarmine warned Galileo not to issue dogmatic statements on theology ‚Ä¢
The Inquisition had various advisers , several of them from the Roman College of Jesuit scholars , which had a division on Mathematics specialized in scientific matters .
This College had maintained cordial relations with Galileo for a considerable time , and warmly welcomed him during his visit to Rome in 1611 .
‚Ä¢ Important scientists such as Frs. Clavio , Scheiner , and Grassi were members of the famed College .
‚Ä¢ St. Robert Bellarmine acknowledged the seriousness of the Roman College by consulting several times to know the scientific value of Galileo ‚Äôs theories .
‚Ä¢ In response to one of St. Bellarmine ‚Äôs questions , Fr. Clavio affirmed that the proofs of Galileo ‚Äú were more probability than established fact ‚Äù ( 3 ) .
‚Ä¢ One of the arguments that failed to convince the scholars was his argument that the tides were moved by the moon , a theory based on considerations that were ‚Äú merely qualitative and not quantitative , ‚Äù making it an ‚Äú inadequate ‚Äù argument ( 4 ) .
The initial favorable position of the Roman College to Galileo , the seriousness of its scholars , the confidence St. Robert Bellarmine placed in their opinion , and its specialized department of science do not present a picture of an institution opposed to the advancement of science , as presented by the revolutionary and progressivist myth .
Pope Urban VIII - initially favorable to Galileo Moreover , Pope Urban VIII was linked to Galileo by a personal friendship .
Soon after he was raised to the Pontifical Throne , Urban VIII highly praised Galileo ‚Äôs book Il Saggiatore and gave it an imprimatur ( 5 ) .
In that work Galileo sustained a polemic with Fr. Grassi from the Roman College regarding three comets that appeared in 1417 ( 6 ) .
Once again , it reinforces the idea that the Church was an impartial party in the scientific debate of that time .

6. Ibid . Galileo ‚Äôs obsession with changing Philosophy
In 1616 the Holy Inquisition issued its first condemnation of Galileo ‚Äôs hypothesis of heliocentrism , which added new data to Copernicus ‚Äô theory ( 7 ) .
The advisors of the Inquisition did not base their judgment , however , on the scientific data Galileo presented , much less did they condemn Copernicus .
They declared that the propositions presented were ‚Äú stultified and absurd regarding philosophy ‚Äù ( 8 ) .
In fact , Galileo , went beyond the field of science , claiming that his discoveries meant ‚Äú the funeral or , better , the final judgment for pseudo - philosophy ‚Äù ( 9 ) .
That is , he was not just stating a hypothesis and offering scientific arguments ; he imagined himself abolishing the Aristotelian - Thomist philosophy in force at the time .
In a letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Lorraine , Galileo obstinately insisted that he wanted to speak not as a mathematician , but rather with an absolute sense , as a philosopher .
Otherwise , he asserted , science would be missing its principal aim ( 10 ) .
He acknowledged , therefore , that what he was proposing went beyond the scientific realm and impinged directly upon that of philosophy .
In the Dialogo ( shown above ) , Galileo ridiculed Thomist philosophy Pope Urban VIII only broke his good relations with Galileo when the latter wrote the book Dialogo , or Massimi Sistemi , in which he tried to ridicule the Aristotelian - Thomist philosophy in dealing with the systems of Ptolemy and Copernicus .
Only then , in 1633 , did the Pope deliver him to be judged by the Holy Inquisition for the second time ( 11 ) .
He was judged and politely obliged to abjure his errors .
Galileo himself acknowledged that he was treated indulgently by the Inquisition throughout the affair .
The condemnation prescribed prison , but it was not put in practice .
He passed the year 1633 with the Archbishop of Sienna .
Afterward , he was allowed to live in the beautiful villa Arcetri , near Florence , where he soon recovered entire liberty .
He was never prevented from pursuing his studies and investigations in science ( 12 ) .
If Galileo had not left the field of science , therefore , and entered the realm of philosophy , most probably he would have continued to enjoy the favor of Pope Urban VIII and avoided problems in advancing his scientific discoveries .
Fr. Mario Vigano confirms this : ‚Äú If he would have realized that the object of science is restricted to mathematics and the laws of nature , he would have had no difficulty in following the counsels of Bellarmine and the Academy of Lincei , as well as the injunctions proposed by Urban VIII in his writing of Dialogo .
With this , he would have avoided so many troubles ‚Äù ( 13 ) .
The condemnation of the Holy Inquisition , therefore , should not be seen as a prohibition of the Church regarding science , but rather , philosophy .
If the condemnatory decree did not mention philosophy explicitly , this was because at that time the distinction between both matters was not entirely defined .
The intention of the condemnation , however , seems quite clear .

The theological pretensions of Galileo
But Galileo did not limit himself to attacking Aristotelian - Thomist philosophy .
Leaving the terrain of science , he went further and entered the realm of theology as well .
To harmonize them with the Copernican theory , he proposed to modify the traditional interpretation of various texts of Scripture that mentioned the movements of the sun and earth .
Further , he proposed that Scripture sustained errors .
Galileo enjoyed comfort and almost full freedom after his condemnation Galileo was warned to avoid such interpretations by his fellow scientist Cesi , who wrote him and reported his conversation with Cardinal Maffeo Barberini .
Via Cesi , the Cardinal counseled caution , advising Galileo not to delve beyond questions of a purely mathematical nature , because ‚Äú it is up to the theologians to explain Scriptures . ‚Äù
After transmitting this wise counsel , Cesi himself warned Galileo that he was endangering matters of Faith by defending such novelties ( 14 ) .
Cardinal Dini , an eminent theologian consulted by Galileo , told him : ‚Äú Despite the fact that the theory of Copernicus is ‚Äò plausible , ‚Äô it has not yet been proven . .‚Ä¶
He merely presented his theory as a mathematical hypothesis .
At any rate , it is prudent not to throw yourself into theological quarrels regarding the denial of the texts of Scripture ‚Äù ( 15 ) .
Galileo had a friend , the Carmelite Fr. Paolo Antonio Foscarini , who defended analogous positions .
In 1615 St. Robert Bellarmine wrote a letter to this priest , and indirectly to Galileo , in which he offered his possible support for the scientific theories in question should they be adequately demonstrated .
At the same time , however , he expressed his concern about the theological consequences included in the question .
He wrote : ‚Äú I say to you that it seems to me that Your Reverence would act prudently to content yourselves with speaking ex suppositione [ hypothetically ] and not in an absolute manner , as I have always believed Copernicus spoke .
For to say that you suppose the earth moves and the sun stands , all the appearances are saved better than eccentricities and reversals .
This does not present any danger and is proper for mathematicians .
But to want to affirm that the sun really is fixed in the center of the heavens and only revolves around itself ‚Ä¶. is a very dangerous thing , not only by irritating all the philosophers and scholastic theologians , but also by injuring our holy Faith and accusing Holy Scriptures to be false ‚Ä¶.
‚Äú But I tell you that if there were a true demonstration that the sun was the center of the universe .... that the sun did not travel around the earth but the earth circled the sun , then it would be necessary to proceed with great caution in explaining the passages of Scripture that appear contrary .
And we would rather have to say that we did not understand them than to say that something was false which has been established . ‚Äù ( 16 ) .
One can see that Galileo , even though warned by a Pope , a Saint , a Cardinal and various eminent scholars , persisted in assuming the role of reforming exegesis .
With this extremely arrogant attitude , he in effect provoked the condemnation of his theological pretensions .
Instead of a serious scholar and precise scientist , Galileo presented himself as a rebel theologian applying the method of the free - examination that Luther had fabricated some 50 years before .
Actually , he quite deserved the condemnation he received .

A just condemnation recognized by many
The Holy Inquisition , therefore , acted correctly in condemning Galileo .
That action was consistent with its mission of guarding the integrity of the Catholic Faith .
It was justly defending the Catholic Theology and Philosophy attacked by Galileo Galilei .
In a speech delivered in Parma , Italy , March 15 , 1990 , even Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger endorsed the opinion of philosopher P. Feyerabend against Galileo .
Ratzinger stated : ‚Äú At the time of Galileo the Church remained much more faithful to reason than Galileo himself .
The process against Galileo was reasonable and just ‚Äù ( 17 ) .
Italian author and journalist Vittorio Messori was also critical of Galileo : ‚Äú Galileo was not condemned for the things he said , but for the way he said them .
He made statements with a sectarian intolerance , like a ‚Äò missionary ‚Äô of a new gospel ‚Ä¶.
Since he did not have objective evidence for what he said , the things he said in his private letters to those men [ of the Roman College ] made him suspect of dogmatism supporting the new religion of science .
One who would not immediately accept the entire Copernican system was ‚Äò an imbecile with his head in the clouds , ‚Äô ‚Äò a stain upon mankind , ‚Äô ‚Äò a child who never grew up , ‚Äô and so on .
At depth the certainty of being infallible seemed to belong more to him than to the religious authority ‚Äù ( 18 ) .
Galileo at the process of the Inquistition Prof. Nicola Cabibbo , ex-president of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics summarized the case : ‚Äú Galileo was not condemned for his scientific theses , but because he wanted to formulate theology ‚Äù ( 19 ) .
Therefore , there is no reason to say that the Inquisition and the Church erred when they condemned Galileo .
There is even less reason to say that such condemnation demonstrates the Church is not infallible .
Also , the hasty consequence that the door should open to a scientific interpretation of Scripture is not conclusive .
Science lacks the competence to interpret Sacred Scripture ; if it were otherwise , we would end by denying all the revealed mysteries , which are far beyond the capacity of physical and experimental sciences to explain .
To introduce scientific criticism in questions of Faith would be to reduce them to human stature , which is the same as denying them .

The Conciliar Church endorsed the revolutionary myths about Galileo
Notwithstanding this status quaestionis [ state of the question ] , Gaudium et spes , the Pastoral Constitution of Vatican Council II , ‚Äú deplored ‚Äù the condemnation issued by the Inquisition against Galileo , in this way giving a powerful support to the revolutionary myths .
The following paragraph is considered a mention to Galileo ‚Äôs condemnation : ‚Äú The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led , as it were , by the hand of God , the conserver of all things , who made them what they are .
We cannot but deplore certain attitudes , not unknown among Christians , deriving from a shortsighted view of the legitimate autonomy of science ; they have occasioned conflict and controversy and have misled many into opposing faith and science ‚Äù ( GS n. 36 b )
In one of the few footnotes of the 16 conciliar documents , Gaudium et spes recommends to the reader the then recently published work Vita e opera di Galileo Galilei [ Life and Works of Galileo ] by Pio Paschini ( 2 vols. , Editrice Vaticana , 1964 ) .
It was the way the Bishops found to say that the non-specific quoted text should be understood as referring to Galileo .
John Paul
II took the same path of reinforcing the revolutionary myth about Galileo when he criticized the attitude of the Church regarding the scientist on several occasions .
First , he issued a vague critique on November 10 , 1979 in the speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in which he established the commission to study Galileo ‚Äôs case .
Addressing the international scientific community , he stated : ‚Äú I desire that theologians , scientists , and historians , in a spirit of open collaboration , profoundly examine the case of Galileo and honestly recognized the errors of any party , and extinguish those suspicions that impede a fruitful concord between science and faith , between the Church and the world ‚Äù ( 20 ) .
Second , on September 22 , 1989 , when visiting the city of Pisa , he issued an indirect acerbic critique of the past condemnation of the Church : ‚Äú Galileo , an example for all , and also for the Church ‚Äù ( 21 ) .
Third , during that same visit , he put aside the indirect allusions , and directly and rudely condemned the behavior of the Church .
He said : ‚Äú Galileo Galilei , whose scientific work was in its beginning improvidently attacked , today is recognized by all as an essential step in the methodology of research , and generally as an essential step along the road of knowledge about the world of nature ‚Äù ( 22 ) .
This statement , considered ‚Äú definitive ‚Äù by the Vatican spokesman ( 23 ) , raised the enthusiastic applause of revolutionaries and progressivists , and the chagrin of those charged with the impartial study .
In fact , Cardinal Paul Poupard , head of the commission of studies on the condemnation of Galileo , admitted : ‚Äú I do n‚Äôt know if the commission still exists ‚Ä¶. I believe that the task is over ‚Äù ( 24 ) .

The swan ‚Äôs song of the myth
Despite the haste of John Paul II who ‚Äú definitively ‚Äù judged on the topic before the end of the scientific study , Cardinal Poupard presented the final results of the research on October 31 , 1992 .
Under such powerful papal pressure , it is not surprising that Poupard tried as much as possible to tailor the commission ‚Äôs conclusions to fit the previous partial judgment of JPII .
The Cardinal stressed the ‚Äú relative character ‚Äù of the condemnation of Galileo and touched superficially on the essential points of the issue .
He affirmed : ‚Äú The philosophical and theological qualifications , abusively attributed to the new theories regarding the centrality of the sun and the mobility of earth , were the consequence of a period of transition in the realm of the knowledge of astronomy , and an exegetical confusion regarding cosmology ‚Äù ( 25 ) .
Card .
Poupard tailored the conclusions of the commission to please JPII - Inside the Vatican , March 1996
He concluded that those who condemned Galileo had committed a ‚Äú subjective error of judgment . ‚Äù
He ended his statement with words that revealed he was working under pressure : ‚Äú We need to recognize these errors as Your Holiness asked ‚Äù ( 26 ) .
Actually this judgment is incomplete : it is partially right and partially wrong .
It has been generally admitted in scholarly milieus that both parties in the controversy had gone beyond the realm of science .
For Poupard to say that the Catholic party had been imprecise ( ‚Äú abusive ‚Äù ) seems a banality just to please JPII .
I do not note in his words , however , an impartial concern to explain the intention of both sides in order to clarify who was guilty and who was innocent .
Above all , the Poupard ‚Äôs conclusion failed to address the core of the problem .
In a certain way the issue at the heart of the problem was dealt with by John Paul II .
At the same plenary meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Science , he read a speech in which he admitted he was no longer able to sustain the ‚Äú definitive ‚Äù judgment he had pronounced in Parma .
He was obliged to recognize that there was a general confusion regarding science and philosophy in the 17th century .
He said : ‚Äú Like the majority of his adversaries , Galileo did not make a distinction between what is the scientific focus of the natural phenomena and the philosophical considerations about nature that generally follows it ‚Äù ( 27 ) .
Although his speech was entirely favorable to Galileo and against the past decision of the Church , John Paul II had to acknowledge this fundamental error of Galileo .
Doing this , in my opinion , he shattered the very myth of which he had been the chief supporter .
Actually , if one admits that Galileo as well as the members of the Inquisition were confusing the terms science and philosophy , any serious student of History can understand that Galileo went beyond his competence by pretending to decide what should or should n‚Äôt be accepted in philosophy ‚Äì as well as in theology .
Then , to see that he deserved correction and condemnation is not a long step to take .
The apologies for Galileo made by John Paul II contrast with the conclusions of the most credible scholars
What obliged John Paul II to make such a reversal on his former pronouncements ?
In my opinion , it is probable that serious scholars on the Galileo study commission closed the question .
As we have seen in this article , it is almost impossible to deny the historic reality that Galileo was not condemned for his science .
So , John Paul II faced a dilemma : either his partiality in the case would be publicly exposed or he had to recognize the essence of the problem .
After that , the myth was as good as dead .
It is still being spread by progressivists and other revolutionaries , but it lost its credence in the scholarly sphere .
Today the weapons to extirpate the Galileo myth are available to any Catholic who wants to clarify the issue in his various circles ..
The speech of JPII was planned to be a solemn glorification of Galileo by a Pope .
It maintained all the appearances of doing exactly that , but , in reality , it killed the myth .
It was the swan ‚Äôs song of the myth .
Notwithstanding , the media trumpeted a triumph for Galileo by emphasizing the progressivist criticisms of JPII and Poupard about the Inquisition .
In this respect , Italian philosopher Emmanuelle Severino shrewdly remarked upon the contradictory position of the Church : ‚Äú By making a mea culpa about Galileo , the Church attributes to science an absolute value at exactly the moment when science is recognizing that , in fact , it does not have truths that are absolute and undisputable ‚Äù ( 28 ) .
A final irony that reveals another failure of the progressivists .

Verizon 's FiOS has provided a much - wanted ( or much - needed , some would argue ) sliver of competition in markets that were previously offered just one or two ISP options , and the wicked fast speeds available through the fiber - based service were just one big stream of cherries - on - top .
We 've personally noticed that the company has slowed down the rate at which it blasts out releases trumpeting new FiOS and FiOS TV markets , and now we know why : an Associated Press report notes that the operator has canned all public plans about expanding its FTTH home network , though it will continue to build - out where it had previously announced service ( Washington , D.C. , New York City and Philadelphia , namely ) .
Of course , Verizon never stated that it would be making FiOS a nationwide service , but after hitting at least some sections of 18 states , we had high hopes that it would keep on keepin ' on .
Unfortunately , it looks like you 'll be forced to move to FiOS - heavy Massachusetts , or simply gaze endlessly from your apartment window knowing that you 'll never feel the warm glow of a FiOS wire .

Django has everything you need to do server - side validation , but it ‚Äôs also a good idea to do client - side validation .
Here ‚Äôs how you can integrate the jQuery Validation plugin with your Django Forms .
j Query Validation Rules
j Query validation works by assigning validation rules to each element in your form .
These rules can be assigned a couple different ways :
Class Rules Metadata Rules Rules Object
Django Form Class Rules
The simplest validation rules , such as required , can be assigned as classes on your form elements .
To do this in Django , you can specify custom widget attributes .
from django import forms from django. forms import widgets class MyForm ( forms .
Form ) : title = forms .
CharField ( required =True , widget =widgets .
TextInput ( attrs={ ' class ' : ' required ' } ) )
In Django 1.2 , there ‚Äôs support for a required css class , but you can still use the technique above to specify other validation rules .
Django Form Metadata Rules
For validation methods that require arguments , such minlength and maxlength , you can create metadata in the class attribute .
You ‚Äôll have to include the jQuery metadata plugin for this style of rules .
from django import forms from django. forms import widgets class MyForm ( forms .
Form ) : title = forms .
CharField ( required =True , minlength=2 , maxlength=100 , widget =widgets .
TextInput ( attrs={ ' class ' : ' { required : true , minlength : 2 , maxlength :100} ' } ) )
j Query Validate Rules Object
If your validation requirements are more complex , or you do n‚Äôt want to use the metadata plugin or class based rules , you can create a rules object to pass as an option to the validate method .
This object can be generated in your template like so :
< script type =" text / javascript " >
FORM_RULES = { '{ { form.title.name }} ' : ' required ' } ; $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' form ' ) .validate ( { rules : FORM_RULES } ) ; } ) ; </ script >
The reason I suggest generating the rules object in your template is to avoid hardcoding the field name in your javascript .
A rules object can also be used in conjunction with class and metadata rules , so you could have some rules assigned in individual element classes or metadata , and other rules in your rules object .
Error Messages
If you want to keep the client - side validation error messages consistent with Django ‚Äôs validation error messages , you ‚Äôll need to copy Django ‚Äôs error messages and specify them in the metadata or in a messages object .
Metadata Messages
Messages must be specified per-field , and per-rule .
Here ‚Äôs an example where I specify the minlength message for the title field .
from django import forms from django. forms import widgets class MyForm ( forms .
Form ) : title = forms .
CharField ( minlength=2 , widget=widgets .
TextInput ( attrs={ ' class ' : '{ minlength : 2 , messages : {minlength :" Ensure this value has at least 2 characters " }} ' } ) )
Messages Object
Messages can also be specified in javascript object , like so :
< script type =" text / javascript " >
FORM_RULES = { '{ { form.title.name }} ' : ' required ' } ; FORM_MESSAGES = { '{ { form.title.name }} ' : ' This field is required ' } ; $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' form ' ) .validate ( { rules : FORM_RULES , messages : FORM_MESSAGES } ) ; } ) ; </ script >
Just like with validation rules , messages in element metadata can be used in conjunction with a global messages object .
Note : if an element has a title attribute , then the title will be used as the default error message , unless you specify ignoreTitle : false in the jQuery validate options .
Error Labels vs Errorlist
Django ‚Äôs default error output is an error list , while the default for jQuery Validation errors is a label with class = " error " .
So in order to unify your validation errors , there ‚Äôs 2 options :
make jQuery Validation output an error list output error labels instead of an error list in the template
Personally , I prefer the simple error labels produced by jQuery validation .
To make Django generate those instead of an error list , you can do the following in your templates :
{{ field }} { % if field .
errors %} {# NOTE : must use id_NAME for jquery .
validation to overwrite error label #} < label class= ' error ' for= ' id_{{ field .
name }} ' generated =" true " >{{ field.errors|join : " . " }}</label > { % endif %}
You could also create your own error_class for outputting the error labels , but then you ‚Äôd lose the ability to specify the for attribute .
If you want to try to make jQuery validation produce an error list , that ‚Äôs a bit harder .
You can specify a combination of jQuery validation options and get a list , but there ‚Äôs not an obvious way to get the errorlist class on the ul .
$ ( ' form ' ) . validate ( { errorElement : ' li ' , wrapper : 'ul ' } ) ;
Other options you can look into are errorLabelContainer , errorContainer , and a highlight function .
Final Recommendations
I find it ‚Äôs easiest to specify class and metadata rules in custom widget attributes 90 % of the time , and use a rules object only when absolutely necessary .
For example , if I want to require only the first elements in a formset , but not the rest , then I may use a rules object in addition to class and metadata rules .
For error messages , I generally use a field template like the above example that I include for each field :
{ % with form . title as field % }{ % include " field.html " % }{ % endwith %}
Or if the form is really simple , I do
{ % for field in form % }{ % include " field.html " %}{ % endfor %}

Philip K. Dick " was constantly asking the questions of " What is reality ? " and " What is human ? " in his writing .
These themes are found in most all of his books .
Both of these questions he could never fully answer .
But , in his hundred or so short stories and around fifty novels he continually probes these questions and tries to answer them in some form .
In all of Dick 's attempts to answer these questions he seems to have become detached from the world . " ( Future Boy , 1999 ) .
In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? , part of Dick 's exploration of humanity and what it is to be human is through an examination of the way humans as a group or society create and subsequently reinforce their own realities .
Dick 's critical satire of the humanity of Western civilisation occurs through the transposition of ' real ' cultural phenomena into the science fictional world of Androids .
This displacement of certain ideas and actions that humans have believed in and enacted from a real to imaginary society exposes their fundamental ' inhumanity ' through their facilitated deconstruction .
The essential hypocrisy and inclination for ' evil ' in human society through the construction of a false reality is therefore one of the primary issues in this incredibly multi-layered yet concise piece of sci-fi .
Dick 's fascination with the idea of reality stemmed from his own mystic experiences and psychiatric problems ( Future Boy , 1999 ) .
During his life he struggled with his own perceptions of what was real , and because of this had many encounters with psychiatrists and psychoanalysts , both in and out of ' rehabilitation centres ' .
References to schizophrenia recur throughout the novel , and although Dick himself did not seem to suffer from it , he used it as a prime example of the instability of reality .
" What about the world of a schizophrenic ?
Maybe it's as real as our world " ( Dick , quoted by Future Boy , 1999 ) .
Dick believed that it is more correct to talk about realities in the plural rather than the singular ( Future Boy , 1999 ) .
The psychiatric and scientific medical fields and their discourses that influence the defining of the normal , the sane , and the singular ' real ' are discussed through Deckard and his use of the Voight - Kampff empathy test on android subjects .
I will discuss how Deckard uses this test to reinforce the ' reality ' of the society in which he lives , and how this is akin to the way scientists such as eugenicists and psychiatrists have used their own tests on patients to reinforce our social reality that they have defined and thus created .
As we read the novel , we are , at first , inclined to believe what Deckard 's thoughts tell us in terms of what is right and wrong in his society .
We know that he is a bounty hunter who gets paid to ' retire ' andys , man -made replicants of humans .
Rick Deckard is employed by some sort of police force , and since what he does is legal , even essential to keeping the world ' safe ' , it is easy for the reader to assume it is ethical as well .
Deckard has no problem with what he does so neither does the reader .
It is not until we read between the lines of Deckard 's prejudices that we begin to understand the true inhumanity of his actions and the society in which they are enacted .
In the opening scene of the book , Deckard 's own wife calls him " a murderer hired by the cops " ( p. 7 ) .
The truth of this accusation is slowly exposed as we learn more about the andys and why they are classified as non-human .
The classification of the androids as non-human holds many echoes of the Nazi decrees against the human rights of Jews in the era of the Third Reich , and the historical American disregard for the rights of black slaves before the American Civil War .
The basis for the determination of humanity is the Voight - Kampff scale that Deckard uses , or the Boneli Reflex - Arc Test used by Phil Resch .
The German and Italian names of these tests perhaps allude to the fascist regimes of Hitler ( Mein Kampf perhaps ? ) and Mussolini , and the crimes against humanity which both these dictators perpetrated less than thirty years before Dick was writing this novel .
The enslavement and murder of androids is justified on an arbitrary reckoning of what constitutes human , just as American slaves and European Jews were classified as subhuman because of the emphasis of difference based on such trivialities as skin colour or ethnic heritage , as were emphasised by medical scientists of the times .
The idea that the androids are not human because they are artificially created through feats of genetic engineering , and because they are both biologically and empathically distinguishable from ' real ' people seems reasonable at first .
It is only when the specifics of the Voight - Kampff and Boneli tests are discussed do we realise the essential irrelevance of their results to determining ' humanness ' .
In fact , the test is a startling indicator of how little difference , both biologically and empathically , there actually is between ' humans ' and ' androids ' .
The Voight - Kampff test measures involuntary eye and capillary dilation induced by a blush response to a series of ' moral dilemmas ' posed by the investigator .
There are two factors that make the test 's results irrelevant .
The first failing of the Voight - Kampff test is that often it is not measuring whether or not subjects respond correctly to the questions , but how quickly they do so .
When Deckard catches Rachel with his final comment that his briefcase was babyhide , she has a strong moral or emotional response as the " two dial indicators gyrate frantically .
But only after a pause .
The reaction had come too late .
He knew the reaction period down to a fraction of a second , the correct reaction period ; there should have been none . " ( p. 48 ) .
This delayed reaction time of nerves is also what is tested by the Boneli Reflex - Arc Test .
As Resch explains , " The reflex - arc response taking place in the upper ganglia of the spinal column requires several microseconds more in the humanoid robot than in the human nervous system ... We try it a number of times , of course .
Elapsed time varies in both the andy and the human .
But by the time ten reactions have been measured , we believe we have a reliable clue . " ( p. 92-93 ) .
Not getting the correct reaction time gives them a clue as to how to interpret their test results .
On top of this uncertainty is the irrelevance of this reaction time anything other than proving that there is a microsecond of difference between the nerve response of a human and an android .
Is this a sound basis on which to classify an andy as inhuman ?
It seems that the tests really reinforce the essential sameness of the androids while the testers are desperately searching for some slight difference in physiology and direction of empathy on which they can base their discrimination .
The second flaw of the Voight - Kampff test is its reliance on the idea of a concrete moral standard .
" ' What is the basis of your Voight - Kampff test , Mr. Deckard ? ' "
Resch asked him .
" ' Empathic response .
In a variety of social situations .
Mostly having to do with animals . ' " ( p. 92 ) .
Since in reality there has not been a dramatic loss of animal life from the planet , these questions regarding animals pose no ethical dilemma for the reader .
The statement " you are given a calfskin wallet on your birthday " ( p. 40 - 41 ) would elicit a ' normal ' response of ' I 'd thank them and put it in my pocket ' from almost all of the readers of the novel .
Yet within Dick 's world , any response other than extreme shock and horror , such as Rachel Rosen 's response of " I would n't accept it ... Also I 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police " ( p. 41 ) , would indicate sociopathic and ' inhuman ' qualities .
Thus the cultural definition of ' normal ' is exposed to be an arbitrary creation of social values at that given time in those given circumstances .
Considering that the androids are forcibly kept socially separate from the humans in their defined roles as slaves , it is not surprising that they do not have exactly the same values as humans .
In fact , in relation to the social values of the reader , the androids who have empathy for each other , compared to the humans who have more empathy for animals ( or at least they seem to value them more ) than for the androids , seem more ' human ' to us than cold and rather unempathetic characters such as Deckard and Resch .
This exposure of Deckard and his psychological testing as a ridiculous basis for determining ' humanness ' is pretty much a satirical parody of psychoanalysts and their techniques for determining the ' abnormals ' in our society .
This link with the psychiatric medicalisation of the normal is further emphasised by Deckard 's conversation with Bryant regarding the history of the Voight - Kampff scale , and by many of Rachel 's responses while taking the test .
Deckard and Bryant 's discussion of Lurie Kampff , who modified Voight 's scale to make the Voight - Kampff Altered Scale , and who wrote an article entitled " Role - taking Blockage in the Undeteriorated Schizophrenic " ( p. 33 ) is deliberately portrayed as a psychiatrist in the mould of the likes of late nineteenth - century sexual psychologists such as Havelock Ellis or Richard von Krafft - Ebing , both of whom were instrumental in laying down the foundation from which Sigmund Freud developed his theories , and Wilhelm Reich , a Marxist sexologist who worked with Freud before disagreeing with him and branching off on his own ( Weeks , p. 2 - 3 ) .
Not surprisingly , the " Leningrad psychiatrists " ( p. 33 ) also disagreed with Kampff in his certainty regarding his altered scale .
The similarity in names and methods of building psychiatric models from earlier ones , as well as conflicting ideas of the ' professionals ' , are distinct reminders of early the major twentieth - century sexual psychoanalysts .
The curious similarity between the name of the Voight - Kampff test , Krafft - Ebing 's name , and Hitler 's manifesto , Mein Kampf , seems to link the three in a manner that suggest they are all interrelated ; that it was the psychologists who enabled this dangerous creation of identities classified as socially undesireable , which the Nazi regime then used to justify their extermination of Jews , homosexuals , and other ' undesireables ' , just as Deckard and his contemporaries use the ' empathy ' test to justify the androids as being ' different ' in a dangerous way .
Dick gives us a clue at the sexologists of our own society 's construction of the dang erous ' abnormal ' when Deckard slips in a statement regarding a picture of a naked woman which seems to be totally irrelevant to empathic response .
" ' Is this testing whether I 'm an android , ' Rachel asked tartly , ' or whether I 'm homosexual ? ' " ( p. 41 ) .
This is also perhaps
Dick 's comment on the McCarthy era in the US and its persecution of gays through their psychiatric categorisation as mentally ill in the 1950s .
In addition , Rachel 's response to Deckard 's psychoanalytical statement " You have a little boy and he shows you his butterfly collection , including his killing jar " ( p. 41 ) , that she would " take him to the doctor " ( p. 41 ) emphasises the extent to which certain behaviour in our society has been categorised as deviant and in need of medical intervention , and how the definition of deviant is a culturally specific construction .
Dick 's portrayal of Deckard , and more so Resch , as the true sickos is explicit .
When Deckard sits and appreciates Luba 's aria before he tries to murder her , stories of Nazis who made Jews perform for them the night before they were gassed are conjured up .
Resch 's recommendation for Deckard to go to bed with a female android and then kill her ( his " grainy , hardened smile remained " ( p. 111 ) ) is a gross reminder of the cold - blooded atrocities of which humans and humanity are capable .
Dick seems to believe that the atrocities in the real world , to which he alludes , such as slavery , misogyny , nuclear war , and Nazism , are justified through an enforced alteration of reality by the means of false definitions and a lack of empathy for other human beings .
The fact that Deckard cannot kill Rachel after he sleeps with her shows some sort of empathy for her that he cannot overcome ( his true humanness ) , yet he is unable to see out of the ' reality ' in which he has existed for so long in which androids are a dangerous threat to the ' true humans ' .
It is Deckard and Resch , the supposed defenders of humanity who are in fact the ones who are destroying it , and this is largely done with the help of the false psychiatric tools that they use to confirm their version of reality .
The behaviour of the bounty hunters is contrasted by that of the androids .
The androids ' appreciation for the fine music of Mozart , the representation of a schizophrenic in the art of Munsch , and literature of the pre-apocalyptic world are indicators of their true humanity .
Dick himself was passionate about music and he was very knowledgable about classical recordings ( L√∂fgren , 1998 ) .
As well , the androids display an sense of community and an appreciation for the well being of others that is seen no where else in the book .
This ability for empathy may easily be overlooked by readers as they get caught up in Dick 's fantasy world .
The horror that the reader feels along with Isidore when the androids cut the legs off the spider is a quite an amazing indication of how well Dick has created his world , and how deeply the reader gets sucked into it .
Considering how easily most of us kill insects in our world , the horror of the reader to the spider scene becomes slightly amusing as a certain level of hypocrisy and willingness to judge is revealed in the reader herself .
Perhaps Dick was playing with his readers ' minds , getting them to believe what Deckard did regarding the androids without realising that it is foolish to believe what you are told with out questioning and examining its fundamental truth .
The point is that the name you call something does n't change the reality of what it is .
" The basic tool of manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words .
If you can control the meaning of words , you can control the people who must use the words . "
( Dick , as quoted by Future Boy , 1999 ) .
Calling an android a machine can still not remove its humanness , only others ' perception of its humanness , just as labelling someone a psychopath or schizophrenic can serve to remove their essential humanity in the eyes of society .
This reading of Dick's Androids does not interpret his ideas regarding the psychiatric discourse that has arisen since end of the last century to be at all favourable .
The creation of the ' other ' , or in this novel , the android , has led to unprecedented human atrocities as seen in the slave trade and the Second World War .
Dick 's implication of the psycho-medical field in the social facilitation of the dehumanisation of the ' other ' through their methods of ' proving ' essential inhuman differences in them is damning in the least .
From his own experiences with psychiatrists , and his own struggles with the concept of reality , Dick is perhaps making an argument that sometimes the doctors are perhaps more sick than the patients .
Through his deconstruction of the bounty hunters as inhumanely prejudiced members of a fascist society , Dick is also deconstructing the society that contrasts it : ours .
What is good in Androids is perhaps what is bad in our world , such as our propensity for extreme lack of empathy for and destruction of animals and other races and religions , or our ease at creating an ' other ' to persecute .
We must recognise the hypocrisy and inhumanity in Deckard 's society , but that recognition must then be turned upon our own to see that our is no better , and perhaps is worse in many ways .

I have never played Madden online - I think it 's weird .
But from friends who have , lots of people will quit in the middle of a game if they are down even on TD - that would piss me off and probably turn me off .
Second , you have these annoying assclowns that talk gangster bullshit that is really hard to tolerate - and also the reason I rarely use my headset in MW:2 .
I think Madden , like MW: 2 , is very susceptible to the gangsta assclow demographic .
It 's sad .
Gangsta assclowns should only be filtered to only play each other because they do enjoy that , but I , as a non - gansta , non-assclown , can't f'ing stand it .
I am not making this about race either .
The majority of these assclowns are probably 12 year old white kids with shitty parents and one too many 50 Cent albums .

The investment bank 's cult of self - interest is on trial against the whole idea of civilisation ‚Äì the collective decision by all of us not to screw each other over even if we can
So Goldman Sachs , the world 's greatest and smuggest investment bank , has been sued for fraud by the American Securities and Exchange Commission .
Legally , the case hangs on a technicality .
Morally , however , the Goldman Sachs case may turn into a final referendum on the greed - is - good ethos that conquered America sometime in the 80s ‚Äì and in the years since has aped other horrifying American trends such as boybands and reality shows in spreading across the western world like a venereal disease .
When Britain and other countries were engulfed in the flood of defaults and derivative losses that emerged from the collapse of the American housing bubble two years ago , few people understood that the crash had its roots in the lunatic greed - centered objectivist religion , fostered back in the 50s and 60s by ponderous emigre novelist Ayn Rand .
While , outside of America , Russian - born Rand is probably best known for being the unfunniest person western civilisation has seen since maybe Goebbels or Jack the Ripper ( 63 out of 100 colobus monkeys recently forced to read Atlas Shrugged in a laboratory setting died of boredom - induced aneurysms ) , in America Rand is upheld as an intellectual giant of limitless wisdom .
Here in the States , her ideas are roundly worshipped even by people who 've never read her books oreven heard of her .
The rightwing " Tea Party " movement is just one example of an entire demographic that has been inspired to mass protest by Rand without even knowing it .
Last summer I wrote a brutally negative article about Goldman Sachs for Rolling Stone magazine ( I called the bank a " great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " ) that unexpectedly sparked a heated national debate .
On one side of the debate were people like me , who believed that Goldman is little better than a criminal enterprise that earns its billions by bilking the market , the government , and even its own clients in a bewildering variety of complex financial scams .
On the other side of the debate were the people who argued Goldman was n't guilty of anything except being " too smart " and really , really good at making money .
This side of the argument was based almost entirely on the Randian belief system , under which the leaders of Goldman Sachs appear not as the cheap swindlers they look like to me , but idealised heroes , the saviours of society .
In the Randian ethos , called objectivism , the only real morality is self - interest , and society is divided into groups who are efficiently self - interested ( ie , the rich ) and the " parasites " and " moochers " who wish to take their earnings through taxes , which are an unjust use of force in Randian politics .
Rand believed government had virtually no natural role in society .
She conceded that police were necessary , but was such a fervent believer in laissez - faire capitalism she refused to accept any need for economic regulation ‚Äì which is a fancy way of saying we only need law enforcement for unsophisticated criminals .
Rand 's fingerprints are all over the recent Goldman story .
The case in question involves a hedge fund financier , John Paulson , who went to Goldman with the idea of a synthetic derivative package pegged to risky American mortgages , for use in betting against the mortgage market .
Paulson would short the package , called Abacus , and Goldman would then sell the deal to suckers who would be told it was a good bet for a long investment .
The SEC 's contention is that Goldman committed a crime ‚Äì a " failure to disclose " ‚Äì when they failed to tell the suckers about the role played by the vulture betting against them on the other side of the deal .
Now , the instruments in question in this deal ‚Äì collateralised debt obligations and credit default swaps ‚Äì fall into the category of derivatives , which are virtually unregulated in the US thanks in large part to the effort of gremlinish former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , who as a young man was close to Rand and remained a staunch Randian his whole life .
In the late 90s , Greenspan lobbied hard for the passage of a law that came to be called the Commodity Futures Modernisation
Act of 2000 , a monster of a bill that among other things deregulated the sort of interest - rate swaps Goldman used in its now - infamous dealings with Greece .
Both the Paulson deal and the Greece deal were examples of Goldman making millions by bending over their own business partners .
In the Paulson deal the suckers were European banks such as ABN - Amro and IKB , which were never told that the stuff Goldman was cheerfully selling to them was , in effect , designed to implode ; in the Greece deal , Goldman hilariously used exotic swaps to help the country mask its financial problems , then turned right around and bet against the country by shorting Greece 's debt .
Now here 's the really weird thing .
Confronted with the evidence of public outrage over these deals , the leaders of Goldman will often appear to be genuinely confused , scratching their heads and staring quizzically into the camera like they do n't know what you 're upset about .
It 's not an act .
There have been a lot of greedy financiers and banks in history , but what makes Goldman stand out is its truly bizarre cultist / religious belief in the rightness of what it does .
The point was driven home in England last year , when Goldman 's international adviser , sounding exactly like a character in Atlas Shrugged , told an audience at St Paul 's Cathedral that " The injunction of Jesus to love others as ourselves is an endorsement of self - interest " .
A few weeks later , Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein told the Times that he was doing " God 's work " .
Even if he stands to make a buck at it , even your average used - car salesman wo n't sell some working father a car with wobbly brakes , then buy life insurance policies on that customer and his kids .
But this is done almost as a matter of routine in the financial services industry , where the attitude after the inevitable pileup would be that that family was dumb for getting into the car in the first place .
Caveat emptor , dude !
People have to understand this Randian mindset is now ingrained in the American character .
You have to live here to see it .
There 's a hatred toward " moochers " and " parasites " ‚Äì the Tea Party movement , which is mainly a bunch of pissed off suburban white people whining about minorities consuming social services , describes the battle as being between " water - carriers " and " water - drinkers " .
And regulation of any kind is deeply resisted , even after a disaster as sweeping as the 2008 crash .
This debate is going to be crystallised in the Goldman case .
Much of America is going to reflexively insist that Goldman 's only crime was being smarter and better at making money than IKB and ABN - Amro , and that the intrusive , meddling government ( in the American narrative , always the bad guy ! ) should get off Goldman 's Armani - clad back .
Another side is going to argue that Goldman winning this case would be a rebuke to the whole idea of civilisation ‚Äì which , after all , is really just a collective decision by all of us not to screw each other over even when we can .
It 's an important moment in the history of modern global capitalism : whether or not to move forward into a world of greed without limits .
D own the path north into Christie Pits Park , you stumble upon a little gnome 's house .
It has wooden sides , a shingled , peaked roof , a little chimney and a window shuttered in black metal and locked tight with a padlock .
It 's a community bake oven .
It was built 10 years ago by park staff and volunteers .
The staff did the building ; the volunteers brought the architectural drawings , construction supplies and refreshments .
It was an ideal collaboration ‚Äì community fundraising and spirit , city land and sweat .
A win for everyone .
That spirit is captured by the words on the commemorative plaque that celebrates the parks worker who built the oven .
It reads : " This bake oven is dedicated in loving memory of Luis Antonio Andrade . "
Two summers ago , some parents watching their kids at the playground nearby noticed the little house .
They looked at the plaque .
They looked at the padlock .
A great idea struck them : community pizza nights .
How could that not go off like wildfire ?
Just think ‚Äì fresh pizzas under the trees with your neighbours after a long week of work .
Moms , dads , kids all lounging on picnic blankets .
Beautiful .
Who needs a cottage ?
It did go off beautifully .
The volunteer group Friends of Christie Pits Park stretched out the dough every week , slathered on the tomato sauce and sprinkled the pies with mozzarella they 'd brought .
A city recreation staff member worked the oven .
Some nights they baked as many as 80 pizzas .
Everyone was happy .
The city paid for a staff worker , true .
But how can you quantify what was achieved by having up to 100 people sitting in the park together every Friday night ‚Äì the reduced crime , the cigarette butts and empty pop cans removed , the sense of neighbourhood pride and park ownership .
" We 've become a community , " says Monica Gupta , a mother of two and the chair of Friends of Christie Pits .
" It shows what passion we have for our community .
We want to keep it going . "
Why would n't they keep it going ?
Well , they 've fallen prey to a recent crackdown by the city on irregular recreation programming .
That means that if they want to keep running pizza nights , they will have to get a permit every Friday and pay city recreation staff to work the oven , Gupta says .
That will be expensive .
A permit alone costs almost $ 100 , she says .
And rec staff ?
" We can't afford it .
We are all just volunteers . "
This is a repeated refrain I 've heard this week .
Three weeks before the ninth annual " Icycle " event at Dufferin Grove rink ‚Äì which features 50 people on bikes racing across the ice before a crowd of 200 ‚Äì earlier this month , organizer Derek Chadbourne was told it was no longer considered part of the recreation programming and he'd need a permit and insurance .
Same thing for the family skate day at the Wallace Emerson rink .
And the Women of Winter Outdoor Shinny Tournament , which has been considered the showcase event for women 's pickup hockey in the city for five years now .
( In the end , the city waived the fees , organizer Deirdre Norman said , but told her she would need to pay next year . )
" When you add fees to volunteer events , you effectively end them , " says Norman .
" Why would you discourage things that cost the city nothing and bring so much to the community and facilities that are underused ?
We do this for the love of our community . "
That 's a very good question .
The response is vague .
Malcolm Bromley , the city 's director of recreation , said his aim was to build more programs , not destroy existing ones .
But he also said programs need to be regularized .
He did n't think the Christie Pits pizza nights were delisted from the city 's recreation program .
I 'm still waiting for him to get back to me .
The evidence shows the easy days of collaboration between people who work in the parks and people who use and love them are over and that ‚Äì if not this summer , then next ‚Äì the Christie Pits community pizza nights are doomed .
That padlock will rarely come off .
The irony , of course , is that the city never owned the Christie Pits bake oven .
Further down on that plaque , right after that parks worker 's name , is a single line .
It reads : " Created with love for all to enjoy . "

Regulator warns that number range reserved for radiopagers is being used in new premium rate ripoff
Had a " missed call " recently from an 076 number ?
It was n't - it was actually part of a new scam , warns PhonePayPlus , the premium phone number regulator .
A number of people have already fallen victim to the scam , judging by the whocallsme site , which aims to offer reverse lookups to landlines for calls apparently coming from non-geographical numbers .
The tale told by bacon98 at the site is quite typical : " No idea why I 've called this number twice but it 's not a normal mobile number as I 've been charged 42.6 p + vat per call & I do n't know whose number it is !!! "
The structure of the scam is simple enough : the scammers buy up a range of numbers through a network operator , then use automated systems to make " ghost calls " to a huge range of numbers , never completing the call .
You get a " call missed " message , call it back , and the network operator charges you the cost of the call - which , because it 's ostensibly to a radiopager , costs very much more than a landline or even mobile call .
Under the contract , which it thinks is legitimate ( after all , perhaps someone set up a company which needed to call lots of radiopagers in a hurry ) , the network operator then passes a large cut of the proceeds on to the scammers - who soon after disappear with the loot .
Then they pop up again a few weeks or months later running a similar scam .
PhonePayPlus , formerly known as Icstis , which regulates the ¬£ 1bn premium call industry in the UK , warned today that it will take " swift action against the misuse of 076 numbers " .
Which would seem to be swift action against any use of 076 numbers to leave missed calls .
Radiopagers , of course , ca n't make calls .
As PhonePayPlus explains , those numbers , reserved for radiopaging services , are not allowed to be used to provide a controlled premium rate service and generate revenue .
But , it says ,
" Unfortunately , there is evidence that 076 numbers are being used for the same kind of " missed call " scams that have previously operated on the 070 number range . "
Colour us unsurprised : premium rate number scammers are unrelenting in their efforts to whirl up and down the phone number stack in search of niches they can exploit for profit .
PhonepayPlus says that it " successfully tackled 070 scams through prompt and effective enforcement action , reducing the number of complaints by 69 % in the last quarter " and that it " will take a similarly robust approach to any scams operating on 076 numbers and will fulfil its duty to regulate any service that operates , or appears to operate , as a controlled premium rate service , regardless of whether the numbers involved are designated as premium rate in the Ofcom Numbering Plan . "
Of course , as with all premium - rate number scams , questions have to be asked too about the network operators that provide the numbers to the scammers .
If PhonePayPlus finds them in breach of practice , it can fine and / or ban them ( and frequently has ) .
Paul Whiteing , chief executive of PhonepayPlus , said : " we will consider using our Emergency Procedure to shut down any service that is operating a " missed call " scam , pending a full investigation .
We will have no tolerance for 076 scams that harm both consumers and damage the industry . "
So is there an 076 number in your " missed calls " list ?
And did you call it back ?
MEXICO CITY -
The pre-dawn discovery of two bodies cut into pieces and shoved into two black bags brought a tragic end Monday to a search for two missing police officers in the southern state of Guerrero .
Law enforcement officials say the bagged body parts were found at 3:15 a.m. ( 5:15 a.m. EDT ; 0915 GMT ) outside police headquarters in Guerrero 's capital city , Chilpancingo .
One of the victims was a regional commander , the other a state police officer .
Notes written on yellow cards were attached to the bags , but police refused to disclose what they said .
Drug cartel killers frequently attach messages to bodies .
In the nearby resort of Acapulco , police later found another two mutilated bodies and a threatening message outside the house of the city 's former deputy traffic police chief .
The victims were identified as the former deputy chief 's nephews , the Guerrero state Public Safety Department said in a statement .
Police also found a message threatening supporters of the Beltran Leyva cartel , it said .
Police officers have been targets , and are sometimes complicit , in drug - related killings , which have claimed 17,900 lives since President Felipe Calderon stepped up the drug war in December 2006 .
On Sunday , Rodrigo Medina , governor of the northern state of Nuevo Leon , announced that he was firing 81 state police officers suspected of corruption .
Also in Nuevo Leon on Sunday , the police chief of the city of Santa Catarina narrowly avoided being killed by gunmen believed to be connected to drug traffickers .
The assailants attacked a convoy of vehicles carrying Police Chief Rene Castillo Sanchez and other authorities shortly after the arrest of several suspected drug dealers .
One of Sanchez 's bodyguards was killed and three people in the convoy were wounded , said a police spokeswoman who , under department rules , was not authorized to give her name .
The Mexican military set up a checkpoint between Acapulco and the city 's airport Sunday evening after a man was killed in a shootout between gunmen riding in separate vehicles .
The gunbattle followed the deaths of five men who pulled guns on each other during an early morning fight that began as an argument at a wedding Saturday night .
Structured Procrastination
Author practices jumping rope with seaweed while work awaits .
`` . . . anyone can do any amount of work , provided it is n't the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment . " -- Robert Benchley , in Chips off the Old Benchley , 1949
I have been intending to write this essay for months .
Why am I finally doing it ?
Because I finally found some uncommitted time ?
Wrong .
I have papers to grade , textbook orders to fill out , an NSF proposal to referee , dissertation drafts to read .
I am working on this essay as a way of not doing all of those things .
This is the essence of what I call structured procrastination , an amazing strategy I have discovered that converts procrastinators into effective human beings , respected and admired for all that they can accomplish and the good use they make of time .
All procrastinators put off things they have to do .
Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you .
The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing .
Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing ; they do marginally useful things , like gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around to it .
Why does the procrastinator do these things ?
Because they are a way of not doing something more important .
If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils , no force on earth could get him do it .
However , the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult , timely and important tasks , as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important .
Structured procrastination means shaping the structure of the tasks one has to do in a way that exploits this fact .
The list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered by importance .
Tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top .
But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down on the list .
Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher up on the list .
With this sort of appropriate task structure , the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen .
Indeed , the procrastinator can even acquire , as I have , a reputation for getting a lot done .
The most perfect situation for structured procrastination that I ever had was when my wife and I served as Resident Fellows in Soto House , a Stanford dormitory .
In the evening , faced with papers to grade , lectures to prepare , committee work to be done , I would leave our cottage next to the dorm and go over to the lounge and play ping - pong with the residents , or talk over things with them in their rooms , or just sit there and read the paper .
I got a reputation for being a terrific Resident Fellow , and one of the rare profs on campus who spent time with undergraduates and got to know them .
What a set up : play ping pong as a way of not doing more important things , and get a reputation as Mr. Chips .
Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack .
They try to minimize their commitments , assuming that if they have only a few things to do , they will quit procrastinating and get them done .
But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation .
The few tasks on his list will be by definition the most important , and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing .
This is a way to become a couch potato , not an effective human being .
At this point you may be asking , " How about the important tasks at the top of the list , that one never does ? "
Admittedly , there is a potential problem here .
The trick is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list .
The ideal sorts of things have two characteristics , First , they seem to have clear deadlines ( but really do n't ) .
Second , they seem awfully important ( but really are n't ) .
Luckily , life abounds with such tasks .
In universities the vast majority of tasks fall into this category , and I 'm sure the same is true for most other large institutions .
Take for example the item right at the top of my list right now .
This is finishing an essay for a volume in the philosophy of language .
It was supposed to be done eleven months ago .
I have accomplished an enormous number of important things as a way of not working on it .
A couple of months ago , bothered by guilt , I wrote a letter to the editor saying how sorry I was to be so late and expressing my good intentions to get to work .
Writing the letter was , of course , a way of not working on the article .
It turned out that I really was n't much further behind schedule than anyone else .
And how important is this article anyway ?
Not so important that at some point something that seems more important wo n't come along .
Then I 'll get to work on it .
Another example is book order forms .
I write this in June .
In October , I will teach a class on Epistemology .
The book order forms are already overdue at the book store .
It is easy to take this as an important task with a pressing deadline ( for you non-procrastinators , I will observe that deadlines really start to press a week or two after they pass . )
I get almost daily reminders from the department secretary , students sometimes ask me what we will be reading , and the unfilled order form sits right in the middle of my desk , right under the wrapping from the sandwich I ate last Wednesday .
This task is near the top of my list ; it bothers me , and motivates me to do other useful but superficially less important things .
But in fact , the book store is plenty busy with forms already filed by non-procrastinators .
I can get mine in mid-Summer and things will be fine .
I just need to order popular well - known books from efficient publishers .
I will accept some other , apparently more important , task sometime between now and , say , August 1st .
Then my psyche will feel comfortable about filling out the order forms as a way of not doing this new task .
The observant reader may feel at this point that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self - deception , since one is in effect constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself .
Exactly .
One needs to be able to recognize and commit oneself to tasks with inflated importance and unreal deadlines , while making oneself feel that they are important and urgent .
This is not a problem , because virtually all procrastinators have excellent self - deceptive skills also .
And what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the bad effects of another ?
Last October , oral arguments began in front of the Supreme Court in the case of Salazar v. Buono .
Today , the decision was announced and it was a disappointing one .
I wrote about this before , and I ‚Äôll paraphrase a part of what I wrote then .
Then , we ‚Äôll get to what happened today .
The background :
In the 1930s , the Veterans of Foreign Wars put up a cross in the Mojave National Preserve in California as a war memorial .
No other religious group is allowed to put up symbols in the area .
Ten years ago , a former employee of the National Park Service , Frank Buono , sued , saying this was a violation of the establishment clause .
In the intervening decade , Congress and the courts have engaged in a legal tug of war .
Congress passed measures forbidding removal of the cross , designating it as a national memorial and , finally , ordering the land under the cross to be transferred to private hands .
Federal courts in California have insisted that the cross may not be displayed .
Supporters of church / state separation were on the side of Mr. Buono .
If he won the case , then it could lead to removals of other religious symbols on public property .
The New York Times supported Mr. Buono as well :
On the merits , the appeals court was right that the cross must come down .
By allowing a Christian cross , and not symbols of other faiths , on federal land , the government was favoring one religion over others .
Also , Congress has designated the cross as a national memorial , which means that it continues to have official government endorsement . ‚Ä¶
It also sends a message that state and church are intertwined .
A single cross does not , by itself , mean America has an established religion , but if the Supreme Court stops caring that the government is promoting a particular religion , we will be down the path toward having one .
During the Supreme Court hearing , Justice Antonin Scalia expressed the absurd notion that the cross is not a symbol of Christianity .
Seriously .
Check out a portion of his exchange ( PDF ) with ACLU attorney Peter Eliasberg :
MR. ELIASBERG : ‚Ä¶ I think it would be very odd indeed for the VFW to feel that it was free to take down the cross and put up , for example , a statues of a soldier which would honor all of the people who fought for America in World War I , not just Christians , and say :
Well , we were free to do that because even though there ‚Äôs the sign that says , this cross is designated to honor all the ‚Äî JUSTICE SCALIA :
The cross does n‚Äôt honor non-Christians who fought in the war ?
Is that ‚Äî is that ‚Äî MR .
ELIASBERG : I believe that ‚Äôs actually correct .
JUSTICE SCALIA :
Where does it say that ?
MR. ELIASBERG : It does n‚Äôt say that , but a cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins , and I believe that ‚Äôs why the Jewish war veterans ‚Äî JUSTICE SCALIA :
It ‚Äôs erected as a war memorial .
I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead .
It ‚Äôs the ‚Äî the cross is the ‚Äî is the most common symbol of ‚Äî of ‚Äî of the resting place of the dead , and it does n‚Äôt seem to me ‚Äî what would you have them erect ?
A cross ‚Äî some conglomerate of a cross , a Star of David , and you know , a Moslem half moon and star ?
MR .
ELIASBERG : Well , Justice Scalia , if I may go to your first point .
The cross is the most common symbol of the resting place of Christians .
I have been in Jewish cemeteries .
There is never a cross on a tombstone of a Jew .
( Laughter . ) MR .
ELIASBERG : So it is the most common symbol to honor Christians .
JUSTICE SCALIA : I do n‚Äôt think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead .
I think that ‚Äôs an outrageous conclusion .
MR .
ELIASBERG : Well , my ‚Äî the point of my ‚Äî point here is to say that there is a reason the Jewish war veterans came in and said we do n‚Äôt feel honored by this cross .
This cross ca n‚Äôt honor us because it is a religious symbol of another religion .
‚Ä¶
So what was the result of all this ?
Today , the Supreme Court decided against Mr. Buono ( PDF ) .
It was a 5 - 4 vote with Justice Anthony Kennedy siding with the court ‚Äôs religious conservatives .
‚Äú A Latin cross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs , ‚Äù Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in a plurality opinion joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. ‚Äú It evokes thousands of small crosses in foreign fields marking the graves of Americans who fell in battles , battles whose tragedies would be compounded if the fallen are forgotten . ‚Äù
Church / state separation advocates are not happy about this , with good reason .
Here ‚Äôs Rev. Barry W. Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State :
‚Äú I ‚Äôm very disappointed , ‚Äù said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn , Americans United [ for Separation of Church and State ] executive director .
‚Äú The court majority was clearly determined to find any bogus reason to keep this religious symbol in a public park . ‚Äù
Added Lynn , ‚Äú It ‚Äôs alarming that the high court continues to undermine the separation of church and state .
Nothing good can come from this trend . ‚Äù ‚Ä¶
‚Äú This decision lets Congress bypass the Constitution and devise a convoluted scheme to keep a cross on display in a federal park , ‚Äù Lynn remarked .
‚Äú That ‚Äôs bad law and bad public policy .
‚Äú The court majority seems to think the cross is not always a Christian symbol , ‚Äù Lynn continued .
‚Äú I think all Americans know better than that . ‚Äù
‚Ä¶
The American Humanist Association agreed :
‚Äú Predictably , five conservative justices on the Supreme Court today saw no evil in letting a Christian cross represent all Americans , notwithstanding the fact that the cross is the preeminent symbol of but one religion ‚Äî Christianity , ‚Äù said Bob Ritter , the legal coordinator of the Appignani Humanist Legal Center , legal arm of the AHA .
‚Äú If this is not ‚Äò an establishment of religion ‚Äô I do n‚Äôt know what is . ‚Äù ‚Ä¶
‚Äú It ‚Äôs clear the government was willing to do anything it took in order to keep the cross in the middle of federal land , ‚Äù said Roy Speckhardt , executive director of the American Humanist Association .
‚Äú And now we ‚Äôll almost certainly see such shady tactics put to use again . ‚Äù
‚Ä¶
Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy , president of the Interfaith Alliance , sees a downside in this ruling for Christians :
‚Äú Our public parks are a sanctuary for people of all faiths and belief systems as well as none .
These government - owned - and - run public places should not be used to endorse any one religion .
Two sad ironies stand out here .
First , for Christians to celebrate this decision requires a will to allow the government to reject the distinct religious value the cross has traditionally held in Christianity .
Second , those who have fallen in battle for our country often have done so protecting the rights that are the defining characteristics of our democracy and , specifically , our First Amendment .
Central to this are our religious liberties ‚Äî the ones jeopardized in this ruling by the Supreme Court . ‚Äù
It ‚Äôs a bad decision with bad implications when it comes to setting a precedent .
It also underscores the need to at least maintain the current political makeup of the Supreme Court through President Obama ‚Äòs next appointment .
Things are prickly enough as is .
It would be awful for the religious conservatives to gain any more of a foothold in this court .
On Tuesday , April 6 , the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted in favor of a resolution observing Mondays as Vegetarian Day , which encourages local restaurants , grocery stores , and schools to offer a greater variety of meat - free options .
The landmark resolution makes San Francisco , Calif. , the first US city to officially pass a motion promoting a plant - based diet and reducing consumption of meat one day per week .
City Supervisor Sophie Maxwell , a vegetarian , presented the resolution on behalf of local activists , and the board voted unanimously to pass it .
The resolution states that making more meat - free alternatives available will not only improve the health of Bay Area residents , but it will also help save the planet .
The initiative began as a grassroots campaign led by the San Francisco Vegetarian Society ( SFVS ) and animal - rights group In Defense of Animals ( IDA ) .
For SFVS President Dixie Mahy , the historic decision by the city council marks the beginning of a much bigger vegetarian revolution .
‚Äú I would have never believed more than 52 years ago when I was struggling to be a vegetarian that someday I would see the Board of Supervisors pass a Veg Day resolution .
I have been promoting a vegetarian and vegan diet diligently through the SFVS for 41 of its 42 years and I have to say this is definitely a milestone , ‚Äù says Mahy .
In an effort to see that the heart of the resolution is carried out , SFVS will be doling out vegan recipe suggestions and dietary information to restaurants and schools citywide .
In addition to its work in San Francisco , the group will also be working with vegetarian activists and organizations in Oakland , Calif. , and beyond to help strategize Vegetarian Day plans for other city councils .
‚Äú I am hoping other groups will be encouraged to use it as a template to adopt a similar resolution in their cities , ‚Äù says Mahy .
While San Francisco leads the way with its citywide resolution , several other cities across the country are setting plant - based precedents in their communities and school cafeterias .
In April 2009 , Takoma Park , MD , declared a proclamation designating April 24 to 30 as Takoma Park Veg Week to inspire locals to eat more vegetarian - friendly meals .
Last October , Baltimore City Public Schools in Baltimore , MD , banished meat from its Monday lunch menus .
The change affected more than 80,000 students and made the district the first school system in America to adopt Meat - Free Mondays .
School officials report that the program has made Mondays the most popular lunch day of the week , and that preparing vegetarian meals benefits its budget , as cruelty - free cooking costs 20 cents less per meal than using meat .
In February , Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer presented a report to the New York City Department of Education urging its members to implement a similar program in the city ‚Äôs public schools .
The push to eliminate meat one day per week is rapidly picking up pace in America , but the movement first got its start across the pond .
In May 2009 , Ghent , Belgium , became the first city in the world to declare a weekly Veggie Day to curb rising obesity rates and reduce its impact on global warming , and in June , musician and longtime vegetarian Sir Paul McCartney picked up the cause in the UK .
Soon after , Israel announced that it would also be jumping on the meat - free bandwagon , making it the first country to officially adopt vegetarianism one day per week .
In March 2010 , Israel ‚Äôs Tel Aviv University joined other international colleges such as Oxford , Columbia , and the University of California , Los Angeles , by bringing Meat - Free Mondays to its campus .
Over the years , I have read dozens of books by eminent scientists , climatologists and meteorologists , that exposed the lies that support the greatest fraud ever perpetrated in the modern era , ‚Äú global warming . ‚Äù
I have always wanted to read one that anyone could understand without having sufficient knowledge of the rather complex science involved .
I finally found that book and , would you believe it , the author is a friend !
Every month I put aside time to talk with Brian Sussman , a former award - winning television meteorologist turned conservative talk show host on KSFO , San Francisco .
Like myself , Brian has long known that ‚Äú global warming ‚Äù is a bunch of horse hockey and , bless him , after the November 2009 revelations contained in several thousand leaked emails among the handful of perpetrators supplying the phony data to support ‚Äú global warming ‚Äù , Brian sat down and wrote ‚Äú Climategate ‚Äù , published by WND Books and the best $ 24.95 you will ever spend because it is the best book on the topic I have ever read .
Its official publication date is Earth Day , April 22 .
To put it plainly , Brian got it right and he does so on every page as he walks the reader through what is often a complex topic .
He does this by drawing on more than twenty years as a meteorologist and science reporter .
In 2001 , he shocked San Francisco viewers with a career change to become a conservative talk radio host .
What all the ‚Äú global warming ‚Äù fear - mongering is about is not climate science because ‚Äú global warming ‚Äù has nothing to do with climate and everything to do with a political agenda conjured up by Karl Marx and set in motion by Lenin and Stalin .
Brian initially takes the reader through the history of communism - socialism in order to put the environmental agenda in context .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs all a lie .
The earth is not warming , and climate always changes ‚Äî and they know it . ‚Äù
‚Äú Global warming is the grandest of all tyrannical schemes ‚Äù , says Brian and he has the credentials and knowledge to back it up .
The first chapter of ‚Äú Climategate ‚Äù is worth the price of the book , but it just keeps getting better after that as he identifies the key players in a succession of environmental hoaxes that include , for example , the banning of DDT .
Without this chemical miracle , an estimated 96 million people have needlessly died from malaria since 1973 .
The most difficult thing to comprehend about the environmental movement is its fundamental hatred of mankind .
Environmentalism is a spawn of communism .
The book will help you make the connection between the millions who died under the regimes that embraced it and the tsunami of lies that maintains environmentalism to this day .
It is no accident that Earth Day , April 22 , is also the birth date of Vladimir Lenin , the Marxist who led the Russian revolution that led to the establishment of communism in 1917 .
The Soviet Union , a nation Ronald Reagan called ‚Äú the evil empire ‚Äù , finally collapsed in 1991 from its inherent oppression and inability to produce real jobs , real goods , and a life free of an all - powerful state .
‚Äú Earth Day , ‚Äù writes Brian , ‚Äú has never been a celebration of God ‚Äôs wonderful creation ; instead it ‚Äôs always been an assault on man . ‚Äù
That is why the central message of environmentalism is that man is a ‚Äú cancer ‚Äù on the earth and responsible for climate change .
That is why its leading advocates want to reduce the earth ‚Äôs population by any means possible .
Neither mankind , nor the bogyman of carbon dioxide has anything to do with climate change .
Right now the Obama administration ‚Äôs Environmental Protection Agency is moving to regulate CO2 as ‚Äú a pollutant ‚Äù and it has the authority under the Clean Air Act as the result of one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in modern times .
Regulating CO2 would make about the same sense as regulating oxygen on the grounds that it produces rust or that it is a component of fire .
Regulating Co2 is crazy !
‚Äú Climategate ‚Äù is the best book to date about this massive fraud , those who have lined their pockets advancing it , and the political agenda behind it ; masterminded out of the bowels of the United Nations .
Order it !
Read it !
You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free !

Firefox 3.6 is out , Chrome 's stable version got a big upgrade , and Opera 10.5 is inching toward release .
It 's a great time for us to break out the timer , process manager , and code tracker for some up - to - date browser speed tests .

These tests are now out of date .
As usual , you can see our most recent batch of speed tests at lifehacker.com / browserspeedtests .
This go - round , we did things just slightly different from our last batch of browser tests .

We 're still timing the human experience of clicking to start a browser and waiting for it to reach a ( locally saved ) home page , both " cold " ( right after boot - up ) and " warm " ( after running at least once already ) , and having it load nine tabs at once , using a millisecond , keyboard - activated timer app from Rob Keir .
To test JavaScript speeds and , new to these tests , DOM and CSS querying , we 're using Mozilla 's Dromaeo online suite , which loads offline and implements both Apple 's SunSpider and Google 's V8 tests , along with others .
To measure memory use , we 're using Windows 7 's process manager , except in the case of Chrome , which has its own system .
The tests are , as ever , performed on my trusty ThinkPad T61 p , running a 2.0 GHz Intel Centrino Duo processor and sporting 2 GB of RAM , and currently running Windows 7 .
Advertisement
What 's new this go - round is , as mentioned , the inclusion of Dromaeo 's DOM / CSS tests , as the use of jQuery and other JavaScript - based code will be increasingly important as HTML5 starts changing the web game .
We also ran a little side test involving extensions , as many readers ( and , truth be told , editors here ) have noted that Firefox runs tight on memory when it 's brand new , but it 's long - term extension use that seems to slow things down .
So we loaded up Firefox 3.6 , and both the " stable " and " development " versions of Chrome , with extensions found on both browsers :
Advertisement
Are these extensions exactly the same between Firefox and Chrome ?
Not really .
Are they generally providing the same functionality ?
We hope so .
Either way , we wanted to see what a fan of these five fairly popular extensions would experience , in terms of memory use , across all three browsers ( for Windows ) that have a robust extension platform .

On to the tests !
Update : Originally this post referred to Opera 's 10.5 release as a beta , but it 's actually still a pre-alpha release .
We 've updated the text ; our apologies for the confusion .

Click any of the images below for a clearer and wider look at the results .
Boot - up and warm loading ; Winner : Opera !
Opera 10.01 and 10.5 Pre -Alpha are so close together in cold and warm starts , you could write off the difference to the speed of your testing editor 's finger on the timer button .
Close behind is Chrome 's stable and development versions , similarly close in standing .
Firefox 3.6 was surprisingly just a tad slower than 3.5 in starting up , at least from first boot - up , and Safari remains a fairly slow starter .

Tab Loading ; Winner : Chrome ( Stable ) !
We were more than a little surprised at this result , so we triple - checked that we 'd cleaned out Chrome 's cache , cookies , and browsing data to ensure it was n't getting a head start on loading each browser 's home page , plus Gizmodo , Lifehacker , Hulu , and the Google home page .
But the numbers bore out the new Chrome release 's prowess on the " Open all in bookmarks " function , which bodes well for its individual tab loading :

JavaScript ; Winner : Opera 10.5 Pre -Alpha ! ( Somehow )
Browser developers have told us before that JavaScript engine coders can , intentionally or subconsciously , write their frameworks " to the test , " giving them an artificial advantage when placed against the competition in certain tests .
And pure runs per second is , as Mozilla 's Mike Beltzner put it , like a horsepower rating on a car ‚Äî it does n't tell the whole story of its performance .
Advertisement
Still , to look at Opera 10.5 in the Dromaeo aggregate results , you 'd think that either Opera has developers who have learned not to sleep , or that something funny is going on .
Still , we have to call them the winner , with Chrome 's development channel , stable release , and Safari 4 picking up the remaining winner 's circle slots .
Advertisement
DOM / CSS ; Winner : Chrome ( Dev ) !
Google 's browser mostly walks away with this one .
Safari puts in a strong showing , and Firefox pushes past Opera .
Advertisement
Memory use , no extensions ; Winner : Firefox 3.6 !
For all the emphasis Firefox put on its themes , security , and plugin management for the 3.6 release , they could have mentioned that it 's even more efficient with memory , at least soon after start - up , than the already impressive 3.5 releases .
Opera 10.01 and Safari 4 are n't far behind , Opera 10.5 shows a pretty hefty jump in tab holding , and if you 're using Chrome with multiple tabs , you 'd better have a pretty modern system .
Advertisement
Memory use with extensions ; Winner : Firefox 3.6 !
You know what we learned about Chrome in these tests ?
That there 's a price to pay for its walled garden model of security .
It seems like each extension is individually contained in a tab - like shell , meaning that if your extension crashes , it wo n't bring down your whole browser .
Even if it does , your tab contents and writing are preserved .
That said , to have those extensions loaded , with or without tabs open , makes a pretty big difference in memory use .
Extensions make a difference in Firefox , too , but much more incrementally :

The scores
As we first implemented in our last tests , we took the numeric score placement of each browser in each category and ranked them from 7 , as best in category , to 1 , as worst .
We totaled those numbers up , and present them here as a total out of 35 .
If a browser had a 35 , it would be best in every category : startup , page loading , code handling , and memory use .
We did n't include the extension memory test , because it 's not a fair fight between all the browsers .
Advertisement
Scores ( out of 35 possible )
Google Chrome 4.0.302.3 ( dev ) : 25
Google Chrome 4.0.249.78 ( stable ) : 24
Firefox 3.6 : 20
Firefox 3.5.4 : 21
Opera 10.5 Pre -Alpha : 25
Opera 10.01 : 15
Safari 4.0.4 : 19
What did we learn ?
If you 're using Opera 10.01 , you have almost no reason not to upgrade .
If you 're using Chrome , the Stable channel is pretty much a wash with the development version , barring any new features that make their way first to the dev channel ( which , granted , some certainly will ) .
Firefox 3.6 seems more of an upgrade in features than core components , and Safari , well , does n't it have a really neat launch page ?

AT BOTTOM : California survey shows legalization winning out 56 - 42 percent
As with many instances in politics , actuality can often be obscured behind the wrong frame : ask a question just the right way and results can be wildly tilted , one way or another .
Take the case of an Associated Press / CNBC poll released on April 20 , 2010 , detailing Americans ‚Äô opinions on legalizing marijuana .
The poll was widely reported as declaring that 55 percent in the U.S. are opposed to ending prohibition .
ADVERTISEMENT
Make no mistake , ‚Äú oppose ‚Äù is exactly what 55 percent of the people said when asked : ‚Äú Do you favor , oppose or neither favor nor oppose the complete legalization of the use of marijuana for any purpose ? ‚Äù
However , a more nuanced probing of the issue , carried out by the polling firm but almost entirely unmentioned in the media on April 20th , found that when stacked next to alcohol , often a more debilitating and addictive substance , statistical support for drug law reforms skyrocketed .
Appearing on page four of the 22 - page document , poll workers asked respondents whether or not the U.S. should treat marijuana and alcohol similarly .
While 43 percent wanted rules more strict than those applied to alcohol , 44 percent wanted the two handled equally .
Another 12 percent wanted less strict rules for pot over alcohol .
‚Äú‚Ä¶ [ Meaning ] that a full 56 percent support the policy change ‚Äî perhaps the highest number ever recorded in favor of legalization , ‚Äù Huffington Post ‚Äôs Ryan Grim noted .
The AP ‚Äôs own report completely failed to mention the key data , which would appear to contradict their lead angle .
Instead , the news wire handed the story ‚Äôs sole alcohol reference to the California Narcotics Officers Association , which suggested marijuana legalization is unpopular due to problems caused by alcohol and prescription drugs .
ADVERTISEMENT
‚Äú Given that reality , we do n‚Äôt need to add another mind - altering substance that compromises people ‚Äôs five senses , ‚Äù a spokesman reportedly said .
The lobby ‚Äôs spokesman did not explain in the report how taxation and regulation would ‚Äú add ‚Äù a substance , considering marijuana is already the nation ‚Äôs most valuable cash crop , generating an estimated $ 35.8 billion annually : more than corn and wheat combined .
Over at CNBC , reporter Trish Regan actually mentioned the figure showing record support for legalization , but it was buried at the bottom of her report .

However , Regan did cite another figure the AP did not : the high degree of degradation in support for the persistent claim that marijuana is a ‚Äú gateway drug . ‚Äù
She noted that pollsters found 39 percent still believe the suggestion , ‚Äú though nearly half the country believes marijuana has no effect on whether people will use more serious drugs . ‚Äù
Even RAW STORY carried the AP ‚Äôs angle , calling the 55 percent ‚Äú opposed ‚Äù to legalization in the April 20 poll a likely ‚Äú buzzkill ‚Äù on the counter - culture holiday which saw millions of Americans participate in public consumption of the plant .

Other recent national polls on marijuana legalization show an accelerating trend toward ending prohibition , with up to 53 percent in favor of legalization according to a December Angus Reid poll .
Figures out of Gallup just two months earlier showed their highest recorded support for legalization as well , at 44 percent in favor .
According to Gallup ‚Äôs data , support for legalization grew eight percent , from 36 to 44 , between 2006 and 2009 : the fastest rate since the U.S. government commissioned the war on drugs .
In California , where activists succeeded in securing a spot for legalization on the state ‚Äôs 2010 ballot , the national trend appears even further accelerated .
According to an April SurveyUSA sampling , if the election took place today the measure would pass 56 to 42 .
Support for legalization was highest among the 18 - 34 demographic , with 74 percent in favor .

Majorities of whites , blacks and Asians sampled for the poll also agreed with legalization , the group found .
While 60 percent of the state ‚Äôs conservatives oppose the move , a shocking 39 percent are in favor , joined by strong majorities of liberals and moderates .
The figures also fingered the Bay - area as the region with the state ‚Äôs highest concentration of green - leaning voters .
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) has expressed her opposition to the initiative , citing the law enforcement lobby ‚Äôs allegation that taxing the state ‚Äôs large population of cannabis consumers and enforcing regulations on their favored product would endanger public safety .
Proponents of the ballot initiative have dismissed the objection as political posturing .

And More Steal Something From Work Day Coverage ‚Ä¶
STEAL SOMETHING FROM WORK DAY has made it to the other side of the world , in more ways than one .
For example , the in - house magazine of the Seventh - Day Adventist Church of Australia and New Zealand promotes it in the ‚Äú Trends ‚Äù section of their April issue to 45,000 devout readers around the Pacific rim .
Alongside less sympathetic STEAL SOMETHING FROM WORK DAY coverage , the UK ‚Äôs Dissident Island radio ran an interview with one representative on their April 2 show [ starts at minute 53 ] .
Meanwhile , warnings are now circulating for business owners to beware this April 15 , and corporations focusing on ‚Äú human resources ‚Äù are also paying attention .
Finally , the STEAL SOMETHING FROM WORK DAY Facebook Site is more and more active .
Beyond Stealing from Work
In the final analysis , stealing from our workplaces is not a rebellion against the status quo , but simply another aspect of it .
It implies a profound discontent with our conditions , yes , and perhaps a rejection of the ethics of capitalism ; but as long as the consequences of that discontent remain individualized and secretive , they will never propel us into a different world .
Stealing from work is what we do instead of changing our lives ‚Äî it treats the symptoms , not the condition .
Perhaps it even serves our bosses ‚Äô interests ‚Äî it gives us a pressure valve to blow off steam , and enables us to survive to work another day without a wage increase .
Perhaps they figure the costs of it into their business plans because they know our stealing is an inevitable side effect of exploitation ‚Äî though not one guaranteed to bring exploitation to an end .
On the other hand , the notion that stealing from our employers is not relevant to labor struggle enforces a dichotomy between ‚Äú legitimate ‚Äù workplace organizing on the one hand and individual acts of resistance , revenge , and survival on the other .
So long as this separation exists , conventional workplace organizing will always be essentially toothless : it will prioritize bureaucracy over initiative , representation over autonomy , appeasement over confrontation , legitimacy in the bosses ‚Äô eyes over effectiveness in changing our lives .
What would it look like to go about labor organizing in the same way we go about stealing from our workplaces ?
First , it would mean focusing on means of resistance that meet our individual needs , starting from what individual workers can do themselves with the support of their comrades .
It would mean dispensing with strategies that do n‚Äôt provide immediate material or emotional benefit to those who utilize them .
It would establish togetherness through the process of attempting to seize back the environments we work and live in , rather than building up organizations on the premise of an always - deferred future struggle .
A workforce that organized in this way would be impossible to co-opt or dupe .
No boss could threaten it with anything , for its power would derive directly from its own actions , not from compromises that give the bosses hostages or give prominent organizers incentives not to fight .
It would be a boss ‚Äôs worst nightmare ‚Äî and a union official ‚Äôs , too .
We might also ask what would it look like to go about stealing from work as if it were a way to try to change the world , rather than simply survive in it .
So long as we solve our problems individually , we can only confront them individually as well .
Stealing in secret keeps class struggle a private affair ‚Äî the question is how to make it into a public project that gathers momentum .
This shifts the focus from What to How .
A small item stolen with the knowledge and support of one ‚Äôs coworkers is more significant than a huge heist carried out in secret .
Stolen goods shared in such a way that they build workers ‚Äô collective power are worth more than a high - dollar embezzlement that only benefits one employee , the same way a raise or promotion does .
Remember the story of the hardware store employee who embezzled enough money to get a college degree , only to find himself back behind the cash register afterwards !
When it was too late , he wished he ‚Äôd done something with the money to create a community that could fight against the world of cash registers and college degrees .
Even as he broke the laws of his society , he had still accepted its basic values , investing in status that could only advance him on the bosses ‚Äô terms .
Better we invest ourselves in breaking its values as well as its laws !
Practically everyone steals from work , even if many people wo n‚Äôt admit it , even if some people would like to reserve the privilege of doing so for themselves .
Let ‚Äôs draw this practice out of the shadows in which it takes place , so all the world has to engage with it and its implications in the full light of day .
Perhaps workplace theft could be an Achilles heel for capitalism after all : not because it alone is sufficient to abolish wage labor and class society , but because it is the sort of open secret that must remain suppressed to preserve the illusion that everybody believes in and benefits from the present system .
So if you find yourself coveting items in your place of employment , do n‚Äôt just steal something from work ‚Äî think about how you could steal everything from it , yourself and your coworkers above all .
Stealing from work one thing at a time will take forever , literally ‚Äî it would be more efficient to just steal the whole world back from work at once .
That ‚Äôs a daunting project , one we could only take on together ‚Äî but it ‚Äôs one we can begin right now .
Next April 15 , we wo n‚Äôt just pocket a few items ‚Äî we ‚Äôll show up at our workplaces with helmets and torches .
Stealing something from work is not enough when work is stealing everything from us .

Since dons ‚Äô two posts , I have seen many people on the haskell - cafe mailing - list and the haskell - related IRC channels asking how they could get GHC HEAD and the LLVM - related stuff , build them and all .
There are a lot of this information on the ghc trac but I have been told it would be nice to have a comprehensive guide with all the necessary steps and information .
Getting , patching and building LLVM
It is as simple as executing the following commands :
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm
$ cd llvm
$ patch - p0 - i ~/llvm- ghc.patch
$ ./ configure ‚Äìenable - optimized # probably also want to set ‚Äìprefix
$ make
$ make install
where the given llvm - ghc.patch file can be downloaded here : http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~davidt/downloads/llvm-ghc.patch.
Getting GHC HEAD and Patching it to add the LLVM backend
First , get the latest archive matching that pattern : ghc-HEAD -AAAA-MM-JJ-ghc-corelibs-testsuite.tar.{gz or bz2} at http://darcs.haskell.org/, the latest currently being ghc - HEAD - 2009-10-23-ghc-corelibs-testsuite.tar.gz .
It ships GHC with all its dependencies , also including a testsuite .
Put the archive file in ( on my computer ) / home / alp / haskell / .
Uncompress it with for example :
$ tar xzf ghc - HEAD - 2009-10-23-ghc-corelibs-testsuite.tar.gz
You should get a / home / alp / haskell / ghc / directory .
Now we have to fetch the latest patches applied to GHC since the archive you downloaded got published on darcs .haskell.org .
To do this , simply do :
$ chmod +x ./darcs-all
$ ./darcs - all pull -a
( the former may not be necessary though )
It can take some time , there may be a lot of patches to fetch and apply , do n‚Äôt worry .
If you are not interested in having the LLVM backend , you can stop reading that section and go straight to the next one .
Once done with that , you have to download the patch to add the support to the LLVM backend to GHC .
Just download the following file : http://www.cse.uns√©w.edu.au/~davidt/downloads/ghc-llvmbackend-full.gz
( it actually just is a darcs patch , not an archive or anything else ‚Äî you may want to rename it with a . patch extension ) , put it in ghc ‚Äôs directory ( /home/alp/haskell / ghc / here ) and apply the patch :
$ darcs apply ghc - llvmbackend - full.
patch
( or .gz )
You just have one more patch to apply ( is n‚Äôt life about applying patches ? ) , written by Don Stewart , to be able to pass LLVM options to GHC without conflicting with other options .
You can get it at http://www.galois.com/~dons/add-new-llvm-code-generator-to-ghc_.dpatch.
Just move it to your ghc directory and darcs apply it , like you just did for the previous patch .
( note : this step might not be necessary if the previous patch or the ghc repository contain it )
Ok , we are almost done !
Now create a file named ‚Äú build.mk ‚Äù in ( on my computer ) / home/alp/haskell/ghc/mk / , and put the following content in that file :
GhcWithLlvmCodeGen = YES
GhcEnableTablesNextToCode = NO
The first , obviously , enables LLVM code generation in GHC .
The second disables a feature currently being in conflict between the LLVM and the C code generators , if I remember correctly .
Now , let ‚Äôs build GHC , hooray !
Building and using the patched GHC non-intrusively
Once all the patches are fetched and applied , you just have to do :
$ sh boot
$ ./configure
$ make
Now , have a cup of coffee , read newspapers , try to solve P vs NP , whatever .
It takes some time .
Once done with ‚Äò make ‚Äô , there should be many binaries in ( on my computer ) / home/alp/haskell/ghc/inplace/bin/.
The ghc binary is called ghc - stage2
To check that the LLVM backend is enabled , as explained on Don ‚Äôs post , just do the following ( in the your ghc / inplace / bin / directory ) :
$ ghc - stage2 ‚Äìinfo
and verify that it gives you ( ‚Äú Have llvm code generator ‚Äù , ‚Äù YES ‚Äù ) .
To make use of them properly without installing your brand new GHC HEAD system - wide , here is one possibility ; add the following to your ~/. bashrc ( or whatever you use , it ‚Äôs just about defining variables ) :
GHC613 = /home/alp/haskell/ghc/inplace/bin
GHC613BIN=$GHC613/ghc-stage2
GHC613PKG=$GHC613/ghc-pkg
And now , when you will want to install libraries via cabal for your new GHC , just execute commands close to the following ( to install say the vector package ) :
$ cabal install vector ‚Äìwith - compiler=$ GHC613BIN ‚Äìwith-hc-pkg=$GHC613PKG
And it will build and install the vector package using GHC HEAD and its library directories ( in ~/.ghc / ) .
Moreover , if you want to build packages with the llvm backend , just ask cabal gently :
$ cabal install vector ‚Äìwith - compiler=$ GHC613BIN ‚Äìwith-hc-pkg=$GHC613PKG
‚Äìghc- options= - fllvm
You can even chain options this way , passing for example - optlo - 03 .
For more informations on that , check Don ‚Äôs posts :
But be careful , - fvia - C and - fllvm are n‚Äôt much friends , you may sometimes have to either edit the .cabal file of the package you want to install and removing - fvia - C from there , or via the ‚Äìflags option of cabal install .
For more informations , cabal help install .

I hope this post will be of help and that it will lead some of you to contribute to GHC !
It appears that many an Oscar party in the New York area might be ruined tonight .
ABC pulled its programming from Cablevision early Sunday morning after the two companies failed to come to an agreement over licensing fees .
It appears that many an Oscar party in the New York area might be ruined tonight .
ABC pulled its programming from Cablevision early Sunday morning after the two companies failed to come to an agreement over licensing fees .
" We regret to inform you that ABC 's parent company has decided to pull WABC - 7 off Cablevision , even though we pay them more than $ 200 million dollars a year for their group of networks , " Cablevision said in an e-mail to customers .
" Cablevision has once again betrayed its subscribers by losing ABC7 , the most popular station in the tri-state area , " ABC said on a Web site dedicated to the dispute , SaveABC7.com .
" This follows two years of negotiations , during which we worked diligently , up to the final moments , to reach an agreement . "
Earlier this month , that it would remove its programming from Cablevision on March 7 if Cablevision did not increase the amount it pays the network in licensing fees .
ABC argued that Cablevision charges its customers for access to ABC content but does not give ABC any of that money .
Cablevision contends that it already pays
Disney more than $ 200 million per year and that Disney now wants an extra $ 40 million for the same content .
The two sides were unable to come to an agreement by the deadline , and ABC went dark just for Cablevision customers just after midnight .
" Cablevision pocketed almost $ 8 billion last year , and now customers are n't getting what they pay for -- again .
It 's time for [ Cablevision chief executive ] Jim Dolan and the Dolan Family Dynasty to finally step up , be fair , and do what 's right for our viewers , " Rebecca Campbell , president and general manager of ABC - 7 , said in a statement .
" In light of these economic times we do not feel it 's appropriate for ABC to hold our viewers hostage in pursuit of undeserved millions , " Cablevision said .
Cablevision urged its customers to e-mail ABC about the situation at cablevision.com / abc .
The company said it is " working hard to get WABC - 7 back on the air , " but recommended customers buy digital antennas or watch ABC on Hulu and ABC.com in the interim .
ABC was in a less forgiving mood .
" Cablevision betrays their customers again ! " reads the company 's Web site .
" You have choices .
SWITCH NOW . "
ABC included links to Verizon FiOS , DirecTV , and AT&T U-verse as alternatives to Cablevision .
Many of Cablevision 's 3.3 million customers , however , live in the New York metropolitan area .
While AT&T's U - verse is available in Connecticut and 21 other states , it is not available yet in New York or New Jersey .
Verizon , meanwhile , continues its buildout of FiOS throughout the country , but FiOS availability in all five boroughts of New York City , for example , is .
DirecTV is a satellite provider .
This is not the first time cable channels have gone dark on Cablevision .
Scripps Networks Interactive from Cablevision on New Year 's Day over a similar licensing dispute .
Viewers lost the channels for three weeks until the two sides .
Time Warner Cable customers almost lost Fox on New Year 's Eve , too , but a last - minute extension and round - the - clock negotiations .
Scripps also continues to negotiate with Time Warner over fees , but its content remains on the provider 's lineup .
ABC and Cablevision were unable to reach a deal that would allow ABC to remain on the air while negotiations continued .
Angry customers took to Twitter to vent their frustration .
In the New York area , the terms Cablevision , ABC , and FiOS were already trending at 8:30 am , most of them upset about the possibility of missing Sunday night 's Academy Awards telecast .
" I might camp out in the electronics section of Walmart to watch the Oscars , " one person tweeted .
" Why do content providers treat #cablevision like their whipping boy ?
We need a good sharks v jets street fight to settle this , " commented another .
Washington also got involved .
Sen .
John Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on communications , technology , and the Internet , said in a statement that it is not his place to pick sides , but he is bothered that " consumers are collateral damage in a fight between two companies . "
" I strongly urge these two companies to sit down and find a way for the signal to be restored today and negotiate in good faith , " Kerry said .
" If a true impasse is reached , then I urge the parties to seek the assistance of the FCC to resolve it or enter into arbitration . "
" This is the latest example of consumers getting caught in the middle because the high stakes incentives created in these negotiations are not working for the average customer who just expects their programming to be there when they want it , " Kerry concluded .
The American Cable Association , which represents small cable providers , said the issue highlights the need to reform retransmission consent ¬ñ the policy that allows TV stations to negotiate with cable providers over fees .
" ACA urges the Federal Communications Commission to heed the calls of members of Congress and take every action now to restore the ABC signal while the parties continue to engage in good faith negotiations , and then to focus on addressing the underlying problems with the broadcast carriage rules and regulations in order to avoid these problems from happening in the future , " the group said in a statement .
UPDATE : Campbell said ABC sent Cablevision a new proposal around 2:30 pm Eastern time and is " awaiting their response . "
" If Cablevision is serious about doing right by their customers and returning ABC7 and its programming to them , then they need to act now .
The ball is in their court , " she said .
The FCC is also keeping tabs on the situation .
" The FCC is in contact with representatives of both companies and is monitoring the situation closely .
Consumers should not suffer due to the inability of these two companies to successfully negotiate a deal , " William Lake , chief of the FCC 's media bureau , said in a statement .
" We urge both parties to quickly reach a resolution for the benefit of viewers . "
UPDATE 2 : Cablevision said it will accept binding arbitration , which would return ABC to Cablevision customers while the two sides negotiate .
ABC has not yet responded , but when Time Warner Cable tried binding arbitration with Fox back in December , on the grounds that it often " looks to the past , not to the future , " Fox said .
UPDATE 3 : ABC .
John Babcock enlisted to fight but never saw active combat
The last Canadian veteran of World War I has died at the age of 109 .
John Babcock enlisted at the age of 15 after lying about his age .
He trained in Canada and England but the war ended before he reached the French frontline .
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Mr Babcock was Canada 's last living link to the Great War .
At least three other people who served with the forces in World War I are known to still be alive - an American , a British - born Australian and a Briton .
The Canadian prime minister , paying tribute to the 650,000 Canadian men and women who served during WW1 , said : " Today they are all gone .
" Canada mourns the passing of the generation that asserted our independence on the world stage and established our international reputation as an unwavering champion of freedom , democracy , human rights and the rule of law , " Mr Harper said .
I wanted to go to France because I was just a tin soldier
John Babcock
Speaking in 2007
Who are the last WWI veterans ?
John Babcock was born on July 23 , 1900 on a farm in Ontario .
In February 1916 , at the age of 15 , he signed up and the medical examiner recorded his " apparent age " as 18 , which meant he was allowed to train .
Despite being under the legal age to fight , which was 19 , he persisted in his attempts to get to the front line .
He lied about his age again , and sailed to Britain with the Royal Canadian Regiment .
There , conscripts under the legal age of 19 formed the Young Soldiers ' Battalion to train until they were eligible to fight .
But he never saw action as the armistice was signed six months before he reached his 19th birthday .
" I wanted to go to France because I was just a tin soldier , " Mr Babcock said in an interview with the Canadian Press in July 2007 .
Second attempt
In October 1918 , after a brawl between Canadian soldiers and British Army veterans in Wales over a dancehall incident , Mr Babcock was sentenced to 14 days house arrest , the Canadian Press reported .
Before the fortnight was over , the armistice had been signed and he was on his way home .
He moved to the US in the 1920s , serving in the United States Army between 1921 and 1924 before becoming an electrician .
He died in Spokane , Washington , where he had lived since 1932 , according to a statement from Mr Harper .
Mr Babcock tried to enlist in the US military again in 1941 but failed when it was discovered he had never become a US citizen .
He was naturalised as a US citizen in 1946 .

Condoms in ' extra small ' for boys age 12 set for Britain 's shelves soon
Extra small condoms for boys as young as 12 could soon be on our shelves .
The Hotshot condoms are going on sale in Switzerland after research found that not enough 12 to 14 - year - old boys were having protected sex .
The condoms are likely to end up on sale in Britain , said their manufacturer Lamprecht AG .
Campaign : Extra small Hotshot condoms are being produced in Switzerland for boys as young as 12 ( file picture )
A spokesman said the UK would be ‚Äò top priority ‚Äô if the company expanded abroad , considering it had the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe .
Nysse Norballe said : ‚Äò At the moment we are only producing the Hotshot in Switzerland .
‚Äò But the UK is certainly a very attractive market since there is a very high rate of underage conception . ‚Äô
A standard condom has a diameter of 52 mm in comparison with the Hotshot ‚Äôs 45 mm .
Both are the same length ‚Äì 190 mm .
According to a study of 13 to 20 - year - olds , a quarter said that a standard condom was too large .
Hilary Pannack , of teenage pregnancy charity Straight Talking Peer Education , said : ‚Äò We know young people are having sex and if this is what it takes to protect them , we need to go along with it . ‚Äô
Foreword : please note that the code available here is only for demonstration purposes .
If you want to be serious , you 'll have to make it more robust and integrate it with other code .
Also , the description is by no means a definitive reference on the subject , but rather the result of my experimentation .
Please report any bug or error you find in the code or otherwise in this article .

Update 18/07/2010 :
Thanks to this post , I 've learned that recent versions of iproute2 can ( finally ) create tun / tap devices , although the functionality is ( still ? ) blissfully undocumented .
Thus , installing tunctl ( UML utilities ) or OpenVPN just to be able to create tun devices is no longer needed .
The following is with iproute2 - 2.6.34 :
# ip tuntap help Usage : ip tuntap { add | del } [ dev PHYS_DEV ] [ mode { tun | tap } ] [ user USER ] [ group GROUP ] [ one_queue ] [ pi ] [ vnet_hdr ]
Where : USER := { STRING | NUMBER } GROUP := { STRING | NUMBER }
Tun / tap interfaces are a feature offered by Linux ( and probably by other UNIX - like operating systems ) that can do userspace networking , that is , allow userspace programs to see raw network traffic ( at the ethernet or IP level ) and do whatever they like with it .
This document attempts to explain how tun / tap interfaces work under Linux , with some sample code to demonstrate their usage .
How it works
Tun / tap interfaces are software - only interfaces , meaning that they exist only in the kernel and , unlike regular network interfaces , they have no physical hardware component ( and so there 's no physical " wire " connected to them ) .
You can think of a tun / tap interface as a regular network interface that , when the kernel decides that the moment has come to send data " on the wire " , instead sends data to some userspace program that is attached to the interface ( using a specific procedure , see below ) .
When the program attaches to the tun / tap interface , it gets a special file descriptor , reading from which gives it the data that the interface is sending out .
In a similar fashion , the program can write to this special descriptor , and the data ( which must be properly formatted , as we 'll see ) will appear as input to the tun / tap interface .
To the kernel , it would look like the tun / tap interface is receiving data " from the wire " .
The difference between a tap interface and a tun interface is that a tap interface outputs ( and must be given ) full ethernet frames , while a tun interface outputs ( and must be given ) raw IP packets ( and no ethernet headers are added by the kernel ) .
Whether an interface functions like a tun interface or like a tap interface is specified with a flag when the interface is created .
The interface can be transient , meaning that it 's created , used and destroyed by the same program ; when the program terminates , even if it does n't explicitly destroy the interface , the interfaces ceases to exist .
Another option ( the one I prefer ) is to make the interface persistent ; in this case , it is created using a dedicated utility ( like tunctl or openvpn -- mktun ) , and then normal programs can attach to it ; when they do so , they must connect using the same type ( tun or tap ) used to originally create the interface , otherwise they will not be able to attach .
We 'll see how that is done in the code .
Once a tun / tap interface is in place , it can be used just like any other interface , meaning that IP addresses can be assigned , its traffic can be analyzed , firewall rules can be created , routes pointing to it can be established , etc .
With this knowledge , let 's try to see how we can use a tun / tap interface and what can be done with it .
Creating the interface
The code to create a brand new interface and to ( re ) attach to a persistent interface is essentially the same ; the difference is that the former must be run by root ( well , more precisely , by a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability ) , while the latter can be run by an ordinary user if certain conditions are met .
Let 's start with the creation of a new interface .
First , whatever you do , the device / dev / net / tun must be opened read / write .
That device is also called the clone device , because it 's used as a starting point for the creation of any tun / tap virtual interface .
The operation ( as with any open ( ) call ) returns a file descriptor .
But that 's not enough to start using it to communicate with the interface .
The next step in creating the interface is issuing a special ioctl ( ) system call , whose arguments are the descriptor obtained in the previous step , the TUNSETIFF constant , and a pointer to a data structure containing the parameters describing the virtual interface ( basically , its name and the desired operating mode - tun or tap ) .
As a variation , the name of the virtual interface can be left unspecified , in which case the kernel will pick a name by trying to allocate the " next " device of that kind ( for example , if tap2 already exists , the kernel will try to allocate tap3 , and so on ) .
All of this must be done by root ( or by a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability - I wo n't repeat that again ; assume it applies everywhere I say " must be run by root " ) .
If the ioctl ( ) succeeds , the virtual interface is created and the file descriptor we had is now associated to it , and can be used to communicate .
At this point , two things can happen .
The program can start using the interface right away ( probably configuring it with at least an IP address before ) , and , when it 's done , terminate and destroy the interface .
The other option is to issue a couple of other special ioctl ( ) calls to make the interface persistent , and terminate leaving it in place for other programs to attach to it .
This is what programs like tunctl or openvpn -- mktun do , for example .
These programs usually can also optionally set the ownership of the virtual interface to a non -root user and / or group , so programs running as non-root but with the appropriate privileges can attach to the interface later .
We 'll come back to this below .
The basic code used to create a virtual interface is shown in the file Documentation / networking / tuntap.
txt in the kernel source tree .
Modifying it a bit , we can write a barebone function that creates a virtual interface :
#include < linux / if.h > # include < linux / if_tun.h > int tun_alloc ( char * dev , int flags ) { struct ifreq ifr ; int fd , err ; char * clonedev = " / dev/net/tun " ; /* Arguments taken by the function : * * char * dev : the name of an interface ( or ' \0 ' ) .
MUST have enough * space to hold the interface name if ' \0 ' is passed * int flags : interface flags ( eg , IFF_TUN etc. ) */ /* open the clone device */ if ( ( fd = open ( clonedev , O_RDWR ) ) < 0 ) { return fd ; } /* preparation of the struct ifr , of type " struct ifreq " */ memset ( &ifr , 0 , sizeof ( ifr ) ) ; ifr.ifr_flags = flags ; /* IFF_TUN or IFF_TAP , plus maybe IFF_NO_PI */ if ( * dev ) { /* if a device name was specified , put it in the structure ; otherwise , * the kernel will try to allocate the " next " device of the * specified type */ strncpy ( ifr.ifr_name , dev , IFNAMSIZ ) ; } /* try to create the device */ if ( ( err = ioctl ( fd , TUNSETIFF , ( void *) &ifr ) ) < 0 ) { close ( fd ) ; return err ; } /* if the operation was successful , write back the name of the * interface to the variable " dev " , so the caller can know * it .
Note that the caller MUST reserve space in * dev ( see calling * code below ) */ strcpy ( dev , ifr.ifr_name ) ; /* this is the special file descriptor that the caller will use to talk * with the virtual interface */ return fd ; }
The tun_alloc ( ) function takes two parameters :
char * dev contains the name of an interface ( for example , tap0 , tun2 , etc. ) .
Any name can be used , though it 's probably better to choose a name that suggests which kind of interface it is .
In practice , names like tunX or tapX are usually used .
If * dev is ' \0 ' , the kernel will try to create the " first " available interface of the requested type ( eg , tap0 , but if that already exists , tap1 , and so on ) .
contains the name of an interface ( for example , tap0 , tun2 , etc. ) .
Any name can be used , though it 's probably better to choose a name that suggests which kind of interface it is .
In practice , names like tunX or tapX are usually used .
If is , the kernel will try to create the " first " available interface of the requested type ( eg , tap0 , but if that already exists , tap1 , and so on ) .
int flags contains the flags that tell the kernel which kind of interface we want ( tun or tap ) .
Basically , it can either take the value IFF_TUN to indicate a TUN device ( no ethernet headers in the packets ) , or IFF_TAP to indicate a TAP device ( with ethernet headers in packets ) .
Additionally , another flag IFF_NO_PI can be ORed with the base value .
IFF_NO_PI tells the kernel to not provide packet information .
The purpose of IFF_NO_PI is to tell the kernel that packets will be " pure " IP packets , with no added bytes .
Otherwise ( if IFF_NO_PI is unset ) , 4 extra bytes are added to the beginning of the packet ( 2 flag bytes and 2 protocol bytes ) .
IFF_NO_PI need not match between interface creation and reconnection time .
Also note that when capturing traffic on the interface with Wireshark , those 4 bytes are never shown .
A program can thus use the following code to create a device :
char tun_name [ IFNAMSIZ ] ; char tap_name [ IFNAMSIZ ] ; char * a_name ; ... strcpy ( tun_name , " tun1 " ) ; tunfd = tun_alloc ( tun_name , IFF_TUN ) ; /* tun interface */ strcpy ( tap_name , " tap44 " ) ; tapfd = tun_alloc ( tap_name , IFF_TAP ) ; /* tap interface */ a_name = malloc( IFNAMSIZ ) ; a_name [ 0 ] =' \0 ' ; tapfd = tun_alloc ( a_name , IFF_TAP ) ; /* let the kernel pick a name */
At this point , as said before , the program can either use the interface as is for its purposes , or it can set it persistent ( and optionally assign ownership to a specific user / group ) .
If it does the former , there 's not much more to be said .
But if it does the latter , here 's what happens .
Two additional ioctl( ) s are available , which are usually used together .
The first syscall can set ( or remove ) the persistent status on the interface .
The second allows assigning ownership of the interface to a regular ( non-root ) user .
Both features are implemented in the programs tunctl ( part of UML utilities ) and openvpn -- mktun ( and probably others ) .
Let 's examine the tunctl code since it 's simpler , keeping in mind that it only creates tap interfaces , as those are what user mode linux uses ( code slightly edited and simplified for clarity ) :
... /* " delete " is set if the user wants to delete ( ie , make nonpersistent ) an existing interface ; otherwise , the user is creating a new interface */ if ( delete ) { /* remove persistent status */ if( ioctl ( tap_fd , TUNSETPERSIST , 0 ) < 0 ) { perror ( " disabling TUNSETPERSIST " ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } printf ( " Set ' %s ' nonpersistent
" , ifr.ifr_name ) ; } else { /* emulate behaviour prior to TUNSETGROUP */ if ( owner == - 1 && group == - 1 ) { owner = geteuid ( ) ; } if ( owner != - 1 ) { if ( ioctl ( tap_fd , TUNSETOWNER , owner ) < 0 ) { perror ( " TUNSETOWNER " ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } } if ( group != - 1 ) { if( ioctl ( tap_fd , TUNSETGROUP , group ) < 0 ) { perror ( " TUNSETGROUP " ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } } if( ioctl ( tap_fd , TUNSETPERSIST , 1 ) < 0 ) { perror ( " enabling TUNSETPERSIST " ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } if ( brief ) printf ( " %s
" , ifr.ifr_name ) ; else { printf ( " Set ' %s ' persistent and owned by " , ifr.ifr_name ) ; if ( owner != - 1 ) printf ( " uid %d " , owner ) ; if ( group != - 1 ) printf ( " gid %d " , group ) ; printf ( "
" ) ; } } ...
These additional ioctl( ) s must still be run by root .
But what we have now is a persistent interface owned by a specific user , so processes running as that user can successfully attach to it .
As said , it turns out that the code to ( re ) attach to an existing tun / tap interface is the same as the code used to create it ; in other words , tun_alloc ( ) can again be used .
When doing so , for it to be successful three things must happen :
The interface must exist already and be owned by the same user that is attempting to connect ( and probably be persistent )
the user must have read / write permissions on / dev/net / tun
The flags provided must match those used to create the interface ( eg if it was created with IFF_TUN then the same flag must be used when reattaching )
This is possible because the kernel allows the TUNSETIFF ioctl ( ) to succeed if the user issuing it specifies the name of an already existing interface and he is the owner of the interface .
In this case , no new interface has to be created , so a regular user can successfully perform the operation .
So this is an attempt to explain what happens when ioctl( TUNSETIFF ) is called , and how the kernel differentiates between the request for the allocation of a new interface and the request to connect to an existing interface :
If a non-existent or no interface name is specified , that means the user is requesting the allocation of a new interface .
The kernel thus creates an interface using the given name ( or picking the next available name if an empty name was given ) .
This works only if done by root .
If the name of an existing interface is specified , that means the user wants to connect to a previously allocated interface .
This can be done by a normal user , provided that : the user has appropriate rights on the clone device AND is the owner of the interface ( set at creation time ) , AND the specified mode ( tun or tap ) matches the mode set at creation time .
You can have a look at the code that implements the above steps in the file drivers / net / tun.c in the kernel source ; the important functions are tun_attach ( ) , tun_net_init ( ) , tun_set_iff ( ) , tun_chr_ioctl ( ) ; this last function also implements the various ioctl( ) s available , including TUNSETIFF , TUNSETPERSIST , TUNSETOWNER , TUNSETGROUP and others .
In any case , no non-root user is allowed to configure the interface ( ie , assign an IP address and bring it up ) , but this is true of any regular interface too .
The usual methods ( suid binary wrapper , sudo , etc. ) can be used if a non -root user needs to do some operation that requires root privileges .
This is a possible usage scenario ( one I use all the time ) :
The virtual interfaces are created , made persistent , assigned to an user , and configured by root ( for example , by initscripts at boot time , using tunctl or equivalent )
or equivalent )
The regular users can then attach and detach as many times as they wish from virtual interfaces that they own .
The virtual interfaces are destroyed by root , for example by scripts run at shutdown time , perhaps using tunctl -d or equivalent
Let 's try it
After this lengthy but necessary introduction , it 's time to do some work with it .
So , since this is a normal interface , we can use it as we would another regular interface .
For our purposes , there is no difference between tun and tap interfaces ; it 's the program that creates or attaches to it that must know its type and accordingly expect or write data .
Let 's create a persistent interface and assign it an IP address :
# openvpn -- mktun -- dev tun2 Fri Mar 26 10:29:29 2010 TUN / TAP device tun2 opened Fri Mar 26 10:29:29 2010 Persist state set to : ON # ip link set tun2 up # ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev tun2
Let 's fire up a network analyzer and look at the traffic :
# tshark - i tun2 Running as user " root " and group " root " .
This could be dangerous .
Capturing on tun2 #
On another console # ping 10.0.0.1 PING 10.0.0.1 ( 10.0.0.1 ) 56 ( 84 ) bytes of data .
64 bytes from 10.0.0.1 : icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.115 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.0.1 : icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.105 ms ...
Looking at the output of tshark , we see ... nothing .
There is no traffic going through the interface .
This is correct : since we 're pinging the interface 's IP address , the operating system correctly decides that no packet needs to be sent " on the wire " , and the kernel itself is replying to these pings .
If you think about it , it 's exactly what would happen if you pinged another interface 's IP address ( for example eth0 ) : no packets would be sent out .
This might sound obvious , but could be a source of confusion at first ( it was for me ) .
Knowing that the assignment of a / 24 IP address to an interface creates a connected route for the whole range through the interface , let 's modify our experiment and force the kernel to actually send something out of the tun interface ( NOTE : the following works only with kernels < 2.6.36 ; later kernels behave differently , as explained in the comments ) :
# ping 10.0.0.2 PING 10.0.0.2 ( 10.0.0.2 ) 56 ( 84 ) bytes of data .
From 10.0.0.1 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable From 10.0.0.1 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable ... # on the tshark console ...
0.000000 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 ICMP Echo ( ping ) request 0.999374 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 ICMP Echo ( ping ) request 1.999055 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 ICMP Echo ( ping ) request ...
Now we 're finally seeing something .
The kernel sees that the address does not belong to a local interface , and a route for 10.0.0.0 / 24 exists through the tun2 interface .
So it duly sends the packets out tun2 .
Note the different behavior here between tun and tap interfaces : with a tun interface , the kernel sends out the IP packet ( raw , no other headers are present - try analyzing it with tshark or wireshark ) , while with a tap interface , being ethernet , the kernel would try to ARP for the target IP address :
# pinging 10.0.0.2 now , but through tap2 ( tap ) # ping 10.0.0.2 PING 10.0.0.2 ( 10.0.0.2 ) 56 ( 84 ) bytes of data .
# on the tshark console ...
0.111858 82:03:d4:07:62:b6 ->
Broadcast ARP
Who has 10.0.0.2 ?
Tell 10.0.0.1 1.111539 82:03:d4:07:62:b6 ->
Broadcast ARP
Who has 10.0.0.2 ?
Tell 10.0.0.1 ...
Furthermore , with a tap interface the traffic will be composed by full ethernet frames ( again , you can check with the network analyzer ) .
Note that the MAC address for a tap interface is autogenerated by the kernel at interface creation time , but can be changed using the SIOCSIFHWADDR ioctl ( ) ( look again in drivers / net / tun.c , function tun_chr_ioctl ( ) ) .
Finally , being an ethernet interface , the MTU is set to 1500 :
# ip link show dev tap2 7 : tap2 : mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN qlen 500 link / ether 82:03:d4:07:62:b6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
Of course , so far no program is attached to the interface , so all these outgoing packets are just lost .
So let 's do a step ahead and write a simple program that attaches to the interface and reads packets sent out by the kernel .
A simple program
We 're going to write a program that attaches to a tun interface and reads packets that the kernel sends out that interface .
Remember that you can run the program as a normal user if the interface is persistent , provided that you have the necessary permissions on the clone device / dev / net / tun , you are the owner of the interface , and select the right mode ( tun or tap ) for the interface .
The program is actually a skeleton , or rather the start of a skeleton , since we 'll only demonstrate how to read from the device , and only explain what the program can do once it gets the data .
We assume that the tun_alloc ( ) function we defined earlier is available to the program .
Here is the code :
... /* tunclient.c */ char tun_name [ IFNAMSIZ ] ; /* Connect to the device */ strcpy ( tun_name , " tun77 " ) ; tun_fd = tun_alloc ( tun_name , IFF_TUN | IFF_NO_PI ) ; /* tun interface */ if ( tun_fd < 0 ) { perror ( " Allocating interface " ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } /*
Now read data coming from the kernel */ while ( 1 ) { /*
Note that " buffer " should be at least the MTU size of the interface , eg 1500 bytes */ nread = read ( tun_fd , buffer , sizeof ( buffer ) ) ; if ( nread < 0 ) { perror ( " Reading from interface " ) ; close ( tun_fd ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } /*
Do whatever with the data */ printf ( " Read %d bytes from device %s
" , nread , tun_name ) ; } ...
If you configure tun77 as having IP address 10.0.0.1/24 and then run the above program while trying to ping 10.0.0.2 ( or any address in 10.0.0.0 / 24 other than 10.0.0.1 , for that matter ) , you 'll read data from the device :
# openvpn -- mktun -- dev tun77 -- user waldner Fri Mar 26 10:48:12 2010 TUN / TAP device tun77 opened Fri Mar 26 10:48:12 2010
Persist state set to : ON # ip link set tun77 up # ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev tun77 # ping 10.0.0.2 ... # on another console $ ./ tunclient Read 84 bytes from device tun77 Read 84 bytes from device tun77 ...
If you do the math , you 'll see where these 84 byetes come from : 20 are for the IP header , 8 for the ICMP header , and 56 are the payload of the ICMP echo message as you can see when you run the ping command :
$ ping 10.0.0.2 PING 10.0.0.2 ( 10.0.0.2 ) 56 ( 84 ) bytes of data .
...
Try experimenting with the above program sending various traffic types through the interface ( also try using tap ) , and verify that the size of the data you 're reading is correct for the interface type .
Each read ( ) returns a full packet ( or frame if using tap mode ) ; similarly , if we were to write , we would have to write an entire IP packet ( or ethernet frame in tap mode ) for each write ( ) .
Now what can we do with this data ?
Well , we could for example emulate the behavior of the target of the traffic we 're reading ; again , to keep things simple , let 's stick with the ping example .
We could analyze the received packet , extract the information needed to reply from the IP header , ICMP header and payload , build an IP packet containing an appropriate ICMP echo reply message , and send it back ( ie , write it into the descriptor associated with the tun / tap device ) .
This way the originator of the ping will actually receive an answer .
Of course you 're not limited to ping , so you can implement all kinds of network protocols .
In general , this implies parsing the received packet , and act accordingly .
If using tap , to correctly build reply frames you would probably need to implement ARP in your code .
All of this is exactly what User Mode Linux does : it attaches a modified Linux kernel running in userspace to a tap interface that exist on the host , and communicates with the host through that .
Of course , being a full Linux kernel , it does implement TCP / IP and ethernet .
Newer virtualization platforms like libvirt use tap interfaces extensively to communicate with guests that support them like qemu / kvm ; the interfaces have usually names like vnet0 , vnet1 etc. and last only as long as the guest they connect to is running , so they 're not persistent , but you can see them if you run ip link show and / or brctl show while guests are running .
In the same way , you can attach with your own code to the interface and practice network programming and / or ethernet and TCP / IP stack implementation .
To get started , you can look at ( you guessed it ) drivers / net / tun.c , functions tun_get_user ( ) and tun_put_user ( ) to see how the tun driver does that on the kernel side ( beware that barely scratches the surface of the complete network packet management in the kernel , which is very complex ) .
Tunnels
But there 's another thing we can do with tun / tap interfaces .
We can create tunnels .
We do n't need to reimplement TCP / IP ; instead , we can write a program to just relay the raw data back and forth to a remote host running the same program , which does the same thing in a specular way .
Let 's suppose that our program above , in addition to attaching to the tun / tap interface , also establishes a network connection to a remote host , where a similar program ( connected to a local tun / tap interface as well ) is running in server mode .
( Actually the two programs are the same , who is the server and who is the client is decided with a command line switch ) .
Once the two programs are running , traffic can flow in either direction , since the main body of the code will be doing the same thing at both sites .
The network connection here is implemented using TCP , but any other mean can be used ( ie UDP , or even ICMP ! ) .
You can download the full program source code here : simpletun .
Here is the main loop of the program , where the actual work of moving data back and forth between the tun / tap interface and the network tunnel is performed .
For clearness , debug statements have been removed ( you can find the full version in the source tarball ) .
... /* net_fd is the network file descriptor ( to the peer ) , tap_fd is the descriptor connected to the tun / tap interface */ /* use select ( ) to handle two descriptors at once */ maxfd = ( tap_fd > net_fd ) ?
tap_fd : net_fd ; while ( 1 ) { int ret ; fd_set rd_set ; FD_ZERO ( &rd_set ) ; FD_SET ( tap_fd , &rd_set ) ; FD_SET ( net_fd , &rd_set ) ; ret = select ( maxfd + 1 , &rd_set , NULL , NULL , NULL ) ; if ( ret < 0 && errno == EINTR ) { continue ; } if ( ret < 0 ) { perror ( " select ( ) " ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } if ( FD_ISSET ( tap_fd , &rd_set ) ) { /* data from tun / tap : just read it and write it to the network */ nread = cread ( tap_fd , buffer , BUFSIZE ) ; /* write length + packet */ plength = htons ( nread ) ; nwrite = cwrite ( net_fd , ( char *) &plength , sizeof ( plength ) ) ; nwrite = cwrite ( net_fd , buffer , nread ) ; } if ( FD_ISSET ( net_fd , &rd_set ) ) { /* data from the network : read it , and write it to the tun / tap interface .
*
We need to read the length first , and then the packet */ /* Read length */ nread = read_n ( net_fd , ( char *) &plength , sizeof ( plength ) ) ; /* read packet */ nread = read_n ( net_fd , buffer , ntohs ( plength ) ) ; /* now buffer [ ] contains a full packet or frame , write it into the tun / tap interface */ nwrite = cwrite ( tap_fd , buffer , nread ) ; } } ...
( for the details of the read_n ( ) and cwrite ( ) functions , refer to the source ; what they do should be obvious .
Yes , the above code is not 100 % correct with regard to select ( ) , and makes some naive assumptions like expecting that read_n ( ) and cwrite ( ) do not block .
As I said , the code is for demonstration purposes only )
Here is the main logic of the above code :
The program uses select ( ) to keep both descriptors under control at the same time ; if data comes in from either descriptor , it 's written out to the other .
to keep both descriptors under control at the same time ; if data comes in from either descriptor , it 's written out to the other .
Since the program usese TCP , the receiver will see a single stream of data , which makes recognizing packet boundaries difficult .
So when a packet or frame is written to the network , its length is prepended ( 2 bytes ) to the actual packet .
When data comes in from the tap_fd descriptor , a single read reads a full packet or frame ; thus this can directly be written to the network , with its length prepended .
Since that length number is a short int , thus longer than one byte , written in " raw " binary format , ntohs ( ) / htons ( ) are used to interoperate between machines with different endianness .
are used to interoperate between machines with different endianness .
When data comes in from the network , thanks to the aforementioned trick , we can know how long the next packet is going to be by reading the two - bytes length that precedes it in the stream .
When we 've read the packet , we write it to the tun / tap interface descriptor , where it will be received by the kernel as coming " from the wire " .
So what can you do with such a program ?
Well , you can create a tunnel !
First , create and confgure the necessary tun / tap interfaces on the hosts at both ends of the tunnel , including assigning them an IP address .
For this example , I 'll assume two tun interfaces : tun11 , 192.168.0.1/24 on the local computer , and tun3 , 192.168.0.2/24 on the remote computer .
simpletun connects the hosts using TCP port 55555 by default ( you can change that using the - p command line switch ) .
The remote host will run simpletun in server mode , and the local host will run in client mode .
So here we go ( the remote server is at 10.2.3.4 ) :

Welcome to remote ! [ remote ] $
When a tunnel like the above is set up , all that can be seen from the outside is just a connection ( TCP in this case ) between the two peer simpletuns .
The " real " data ( ie , that exchanged by the high level applications - ping or ssh in the above example ) is never exposed directly on the wire ( although it IS sent in cleartext , see below ) .
If you enable IP forwarding on a host that is running simpletun , and create the necessary routes on the other host , you can reach remote networks through the tunnel .
Also note that if the virtual interfaces involved are of the tap kind , it is possible to transparently bridge two geographically distant ethernet LANs , so that the devices think that they are all on the same layer 2 network .
To do this , it 's necessary to bridge , on the gateways ( ie , the hosts that run simpletun or another tunneling software that uses tap interfaces ) , the local LAN interface and the virtual tap interface together .
This way , frames received from the LAN are also sent to the tap interface ( because of the bridge ) , where the tunneling application reads them and send them to the remote peer ; there , another bridge will ensure that frames so received are forwarded to the remote LAN .
The same thing will happen in the opposite direction .
Since we are passing ethernet frames between the two LANs , the two LANs are effectively bridged together .
This means that you can have 10 machines in London ( for instance ) and 50 in Berlin , and you can create a 60 - computer ethernet network using addresses from the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet ( or any subnet address you want , as long as it can accommodate at least 60 host addresses ) .
However , do NOT use simpletun if you want to set up something like that !
Extensions and improvements
simpletun is very simple and simplistic , and can be extended in a number of ways .
First of all , new ways of connecting to the peer can be added .
For example , UDP connectivity could be implemented , or , if you 're brave , ICMP ( perhaps also over IPv6 ) .
Second , data is currently passed in cleartext over the network connection .
But when the data is in the program 's buffer it could be changed somehow before being transmitted , for example it could be encrypted ( and similarly decrypted at the other end ) .
However , for the purpose of this tutorial , the limited version of the program should already give you an idea of how tunnelling using tun / tap works .
While simpletun is a simple demonstration , this is the way many popular programs that use tun / tap interfaces work , like OpenVPN , vtun , or Openssh 's VPN feature .
Finally , it 's worth noting that if the tunnel connection is over TCP , we can have a situation where we 're running the so - called " tcp over tcp " ; for more information see " Why tcp over tcp is a bad idea " .
Note that applications like OpenVPN use UDP by default for this very reason , and using TCP is well - known for reducing performance ( although in some cases it 's the only option ) .

They finally get a big fight that everyone wants to see , the fighters agree to all of the material issues in principle , and then it falls apart over some minor issue . "
Dana
White was among those that mocked the sport of boxing for failing to promote such a huge fight .
He who lives in a glass house should not throw stones .
Most fans and experts agree that Anderson Silva and Georges St. Pierre are the top two pound for pound fighters in the sport of mixed martial arts .
Over the last three years , both have amasssed resumes that nobody else in the sport can even approach .
Despite the fact that the UFC has never announced or promoted a fight between the two , both men are repeatedly forced to answer questions about when they will fight one another .
In the past week , the one issue supposedly preventing this fight was happening was resolved : Anderson Silva conceded on the issue of weight by repeatedly voicing his willingness to take on St. Pierre at 170 pounds .
St. Pierre stated he would take the fight at that weight .
Here 's the big difference between these two situations : Dana
White has the power to make this fight happen .
Every major issue is now agreed upon .
All he has to do is sign off on the fight , put on a " UFC : Primetime " series and let the money roll in .
Fans will be so galvanized against Silva as a result of this charade that they 'll pay in droves to see a fan favorite like St. Pierre try to end his streak .
Egos got in the way of Mayweather - Pacquiao ; Dana
White is currently all that is standing in the way of St. Pierre - Silva .
Even though a fight between Anderson Silva and Georges St. Pierre has not been announced , fans have loudly chanted for it all the way from Montreal to Abu Dhabi .
Let me restate this , so that the importance of this point is not lost : fans all the way in the Middle East were chanting for Georges St. Pierre vs. Anderson Silva .
We 're often told that Brock Lesnar vs. Fedor Emelianenko is the biggest dream fight possible , and that a fight between the two would shatter all buyrate records .
Despite the supposed groundswell of support for such a fight , we 've never heard either man 's name chanted at the other during one of their fights , and this is in spite of a concerted effort to do such a thing at UFC 100 .
We 've heard it happen twice to Anderson Silva .
Here 's a thought : what if the supposed support for Fedor - Lesnar is just hardcore media support , and actual UFC fans have voiced their " dream fight " preference loud and clear ?
The fans have made it clear again and again that they want to see Georges St. Pierre fight Anderson Silva .
They 've made it clear at autograph signings , they 've made it clear at Q and A's , and now they 've made it clear during Anderson Silva 's fights .
Is anybody listening ?
Zuffa brass ought to think about what brought the UFC to the dance .
A large part of it was creating the perception that the UFC responds to the fans , and delivers the fights they clamor for .
If Zuffa decides to " punish " Anderson Silva with a meaningless fight and put St. Pierre against someone like Paul Daley , then I will have no sympathy for the company when its top stars continue to fight down to the level of their competition .
After the disaster of a main event at UFC 112 , Dana
White promised to make it up to the fans .
I 'd suggest doing it by giving them what they are clearly asking for .
Finally , I 'd like to address a persistent ( and ridiculous ) argument against this fight .
Some people think St. Pierre will lose , so the fight ought not happen .
Newsflash : BJ Penn just lost to Frankie Edgar of all people .
Champions eventually lose one way or another , and it can either be in dramatic fashion in the context of a mega fight , or it can be in a dull fight that almost nobody remembers three days after it happened .
The fact that one of these dominant champions might lose is not an argument against doing this fight .
It 's an argument in favor of continuing to book mismatches that result in pedestrian and disappointing performances .
I called for this fight shortly after UFC 100 , and predicted that if we did n't get it we 'd end up seeing a series of boring , uninspiring title fights from both men in 2010 .
So far , it 's way worse than I could have anticipated if I was asked to draw up a worst case scenario .
If the UFC really has the gall to book St. Pierre - Koscheck 2 and Silva - Belfort , they deserve the boring fights that are surely on their way .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The Senate voted Tuesday to pass a $ 10 billion measure to extend benefits for unemployed workers and fund road projects after Sen. Jim Bunning agreed to end his filibuster .
The 78 - 19 vote on the 30 - day extension known as H.R. 4691 came minutes after the Kentucky Republican made a final plea on the floor of the Senate for his colleagues not to borrow the money .
" We can't do everything we 'd like to do , " Bunning said .
" We do n't have the money . "
President Obama praised the effort after signing the bill late Tuesday .
" The bill passed tonight by the Senate will extend access to health care benefits for workers who have lost their jobs , help small businesses get loans so they can grow and hire , and extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of Americans who are looking for work , " Obama said .
" I 'm grateful to the members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle who worked to end this roadblock to relief for America 's working families , " the statement said .
The original short - term extension of unemployment benefits needed unanimous consent to pass because Democrats have labeled it an emergency spending measure .
Bunning rejected the motion for unanimous consent .
Unemployed iReporter ' furious ' with Bunning , Kyl
The 78 - year - old former professional baseball player had proposed an amendment to pay for the measure by closing a tax loophole used by the paper industry , but the amendment was stricken Tuesday night when a motion to waive a budget point of order against it failed on a vote of 43 - 53 .
That meant the Bunning amendment did not get a direct up - or - down vote .
Afterward , Bunning issued a statement deriding the move as " a procedural gimmick . "
Bunning , who is retiring at the end of this year , said he did n't oppose extending the programs -- he just did n't want to add to the deficit .
Democrats argued that , because it is an emergency measure , the bill should not be subject to new rules requiring that legislation not expand the deficit -- the pay - go rules .
As a result of the Senate 's delayed action , many jobless people were not able to apply for federal unemployment benefits or the COBRA health insurance subsidy as of Monday .
Bunning 's action created a political firestorm .
On Tuesday morning , he pushed on the Senate floor for a measure that would have paid the $ 10 billion tab out of the Democrats ' previously passed $ 862 billion stimulus bill .
He also dared Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to hold a vote to cut off debate on the measure .
The Nevada Democrat rejected Bunning 's motions .
" You have made your point ... [ but ] the majority of the Senate disagrees with you , " Reid told Bunning .
The need to extend unemployment benefits is " an emergency .
...
Our economy is suffering .
[ There are ] long lines of people out of work . "
Reid called Bunning 's legislative maneuvering " terribly inappropriate . "
i Reporter : Shame on you , Sen. Bunning
Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins sided with the Democratic leader , saying Bunning 's views " do not represent the majority of the Republican caucus . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner , however , defended Bunning .
" He 's got a legitimate argument that he 's making , " said the Ohio Republican .
" The Democrats just passed this legislation " requiring bills not to increase the deficit and not even " a week after the president signed [ it ] into law they want to exempt the first bill that comes across the Senate floor . "
Federal unemployment benefits kick in after the basic state - funded 26 weeks of coverage expire .
During the downturn , Congress has approved up to an additional 73 weeks , which it funds .
These federal benefit weeks are divided into tiers , and the jobless must apply each time they move into a new tier .
Had the Senate not acted , the jobless would have stopped getting checks once they ran out of their state benefits or current tier of federal benefits .
That could have been devastating to many of the more than 1 million people who would have been affected this month and nearly 5 million by June , according to the National Unemployment Law Project .
Several other programs were also affected by the legislative spat , including federal flood insurance , satellite TV licensing , and small business loans .
The bill also provides a short - term extension of the Highway Trust Fund , which pays for transportation projects nationwide .

If you ‚Äôre wondering whether it ‚Äôs a good idea to paint your kitchen red , you can test it with Colorjive .
It just takes a few clicks .
You do n‚Äôt even have to pick up a brush .
You can paint virtually with Colorjive .
They have got thousands of colors for you to choose from .
They have a basic account that is absolutely free .
With a free account , you can upload a single photo , paint three objects in that photo and save three different versions .
As they have got thousands of colors , enough to satisfy even the most demanding color ‚Äú gourmet . ‚Äù
However , not every color can be produced in paint .
If you do n‚Äôt see your color , it may be because of the limitations of paint manufacturing .
There are also some paint colors that do n‚Äôt display properly on computer monitors .
Colorjive is not owned or operated by any paint brand .
This means that they are not tied to one specific brand and can offer you the widest possible range of colors .
Now , the question arise that how do you order your colors in a paint store ?
Do n‚Äôt worry at all !
You can use the color codes .
The color code appears when you hover over a color swatch .
Write it down and take it to your local paint store to get it mixed .
Each code is brand - specific , so pick colors from the brand you want to use ( if you have a preference ) .
Most paint mixing machines can produce colors from more than one brand .
The current version includes only a US ( English ) language version and US paint brands .
If you ‚Äôd like to see a Colorjive version for your own country , they are open to get your feedback .
The technology behind Colorjive is based on the idea that color involves three participants : light , surface and an observer .
The quality of the light is mostly ignored and the observer is n‚Äôt even taken into consideration .
Most color - matching software only takes the surface into account , using an RGB calculation .
It ignores the quality of the light , and the way an observer perceives the color .
The paint bucket was developed in cooperation with the University of Amsterdam .
Some of the technology was originally designed to help robots recognize objects such as windows or walls .
NSW Premier Kristina has not denied the NSW government could face a bill of about $ 500 million for the dumped Sydney CBD metro project , after compensation claims by construction companies .
Ms Keneally did not comment directly on the figure when asked on Friday about a report that the government was facing $ 200 million claims from builders , on top of the $ 300 million it had already spent on the project .
‚Äò‚Äò We understand there is a cost to the decision we made , ‚Äô‚Äô she told reporters .
‚Äò‚Äò We said on the day we made this decision we would compensate landowners and those bidders involved .
‚Äò‚Äò We will go through a thorough and proper process which will involve Treasury , transport and independent auditors to go through it as quickly as possible . ‚Äô‚Äô
On a desk in the centre of the room , a battered Nokia phone rings .
It is known as the " HAT phone " , and the call signals only one thing : a suspected murder has occurred .
It is a Friday afternoon and the Sutton murder squad ‚Äì one of 24 homicide teams in the Metropolitan Police ‚Äì is on call .
The squad gathers in their incident room , a large open - plan office with mugshots and crime scene pictures on the walls and witness statements littering the desks .
The initial information is that a man has been found face down on his bed with a wound on his head .
Nearby is a blood - stained mop and bucket .
The Homicide Assessment Team ( HAT ) ‚Äì three detectives whose job it is to attend murder scenes first ‚Äì are dispatched to the sheltered housing complex in Brockley , south London .
Hours later their boss , Detective Inspector Chris Le Pere , follows .
Stepping inside the run-down building he walks through a narrow corridor , pausing only briefly to nod hello to two PCs standing guard outside a door .
On the other side of the door lies the body of Alan Bradley slumped across his bed .
After a cursory greeting to the uniformed officers , DI Le Pere steps into the accommodation 's dining room : a small space dominated by a large dining table and armchairs that have seen better days .
For the next few hours the dining room will become the MIT9 briefing room inside which Le Pere and his three homicide detectives will discuss the case with two borough detectives and their DI .
What they discover will determine which of the teams takes the job .
If it appears to be a murder the homicide team will investigate .
If not , the borough detectives will keep it .
" Right , what do we know ? " asks Le Pere .
He is told that Alan Bradley , a 55 - year - old alcoholic who suffered from schizophrenia , was found face - down on his bed by a member of staff at 1.40 pm that day .
The mop and bucket is in the kitchen of the three - bedroom flat with blood on the handle .
" He has a deep wound above his eye , " DS Kate Wilson says .
Bradley 's two flatmates ‚Äì James and David ‚Äì are in custody .
They are being treated as witnesses , but one of their stories does n't seem to add up .
In his initial interview , James said that Bradley had fallen over the night before and cut his head .
But he has neglected to tell officers some details which they already know ‚Äì namely that he had an argument with the victim shortly before he died ‚Äì and it has aroused their suspicions .
Also his suggestion that the cut happened the night before is weakened by the fact that the wound is very deep , but there is no blood around the building .
It is looking like a murder case and James appears to be the main suspect .
DI Le Pere is anxious that everything is done properly .
" Have we done house - to - house enquiries ? " he asks .
" Yes , boss .
Nothing much came of that , " a voice answers .
" Has anyone spoken to the family ?
Have we searched the rooms for a potential weapon ?
Have we seized the CCTV ?
Do our witnesses have mobile phones ?
Have we seized them ?
Has someone spoken to the sniffer dog people ?
How are we going to secure the scene over the weekend ? "
If the man has been murdered Le Pere 's team will investigate .
It could take them hours , days or weeks to solve .
Sometimes a perpetrator is never caught .
" There is nothing worse than an unsolved murder , " DI Le Pere says .
" You never like to think that anyone is clever enough to get away with it .
That is not an ego thing , but you would like to think that an experienced murder team would be able to find the shreds of evidence we need to charge someone . "
The MIT9 team has 30 detectives who each work different shifts .
But on an on - call week they will all be required to leave their beds and work through the night should a murder occur .
It 's for that reason that DI Le Pere keeps a camp bed under his desk .
" There have been occasions where , on a big job , I 've found myself finishing at 6 am and if I 'm due back on at 8 am there 's no point going home .
But I 've done my fair share of nights , " he adds .
" It 's a young man 's game so I leave it to the others now . "
One of those is Detective Constable Danny Chatfield .
A former journalist , he decided to join the force in July 2003 after being inspired by an Old Bailey case he covered in his previous life as a reporter for Central News Agency .
" It sounds really sad , " he says .
" But I genuinely did get a calling .
I was covering the case of an immigrant who had been murdered .
The bloke had no family and not many friends and the only people who cared about his death were the detectives sent to investigate it .
They got justice for him when no - one else was bothered and it really inspired me . "
Court reporter Chatfield soon became Constable Chatfield .
After serving two years in uniform he passed his detective 's exam and joined CID in 2005 and transferred to Homicide in May last year .
He has been with MIT9 for nine months and as one of the newer members of the team he is still getting used to the social havoc that is the night shift .
" Before I came to the murder squad I had been with my girlfriend for 11 years , " he explains .
" Within a few months of coming here the relationship had finished .
I can't blame that solely on the job , but it does play havoc with your social life .
" When you are on call you certainly do not make any plans because you could get a call at any time .
You can't have a drink either so it 's probably the healthiest week I do .
I suppose it 's a shame it 's only every eight weeks .
" You ca n't complain though .
As a police officer I think working murder is the elite .
It is hard work to get chosen for this so while it might sound bad at times I would n't swap it . "
Back in the briefing room one of the detectives gets a phone call .
The voice on the other end tells him that James has now clarified his story and included the fact that the pair had had an argument .
The spotlight of suspicion on James dims further when the crime scene investigator says that the congealed blood around the wound above Bradley 's eye indicates the injury could well have happened the night before .
Why there is no blood on the floor remains a mystery although a bloodstained rag on a radiator suggests the victim had attempted to treat himself .
It is looking like an accidental death but when the briefing finishes one of the borough detectives is keen to uncover the perpetrator of another murder .
" Who killed Archie ? " she asks .
" I 've missed EastEnders . "
While the case of Archie Mitchell is one that has obviously gripped this particular detective , do the real cases keep the detectives awake at night , wondering who the killer is ?
" No , " says DI Le Pere .
" This job can be tragic at times .
But you need to be able to switch off .
I have a family .
When I go home I do n't want to talk about work .
Not only is it unprofessional , but they do n't want to hear about it .
" My wife might know I am dealing with a certain shooting or stabbing , but she will not ask about the ins and outs and I wo n't talk about them .
I 'm happy with that because the last thing I want to do when I go home to my family is talk about murders over dinner . "
It is nearly 11 pm as DI Le Pere leaves to go home .
The Alan Bradley job is the closest his team came to a murder in their week on call ‚Äì a rarity in a city which averages more than two murders a week and has just three teams on call at any one time .
Yet it is treated like a murder right up until the moment a coroner says otherwise two days later .
As well as the various degrees of murders the team has to investigate ‚Äì from category C domestics to Cat A whodunnits ‚Äì Le Pere 's team , like all other homicide squads in the capital , also have to attend any suspicious death , just in case it turns out to be murder .
But , he explains : " Murder investigation is feast and famine .
It could be absolutely mad , where you do n't sleep for the first 48 to 96 hours in a big case and the intensity can last for weeks until you charge someone .
But then it goes back to eight - hour days where people will be waiting for the next job .
" It 's a strange one because while we always have work to be getting on with , we are employed to solve murders and so we like it when we get a new job because that is what we excel at .
That 's not to say we sit around hoping people will die .
I would never wish for anyone to be killed and every murder is a tragedy , but sadly in a city as big as London , there are always going to be murders and you are always going to need people to solve them ‚Äì that 's where we come in . "
The MIT9 team : Experience counts in big cases
Between them , the detectives of MIT9 have a wealth of experience in big murder cases .
It was they who investigated the murder of Sally Anne Bowman , the 18 - year - old who was murdered , raped and robbed outside her home in Croydon in 2005 .
Mark Dixie , a pub chef , was convicted of her murder in 2008 .
The squad 's Detective Chief Inspector Nick Scola investigated the murder of Nisha Patel - Nasri , a Metropolitan Police special constable who was murdered by her husband Fadi Nasri in May 2006 .
Nasri was convicted in 2008 .
And Detective Sergeant Eric Sword worked on the case of the television presenter Jill Dando .
Barry George was imprisoned for her murder but was subsequently freed on appeal .
The case remains open .
The team also secured the conviction of Mario Celaire in 2009 , who , following the abolition of the double jeopardy rule , became the first person in Britain to be convicted of a crime for which he was previously found not guilty .

Everyone ‚Äôs favorite quitter , Sarah Palin was on FNC ‚Äôs Hannity tonight where she called the centuries old deem and pass legislative technique .
Palin said , ‚Äú The process that Pelosi is pushing right now is unconstitutional . ‚Äù
She then lied and said this bill would not have been passed by both houses of Congress .
The problem is that the bill will , in fact , be identical .
Once again , Palin mangled the Constitution , and the legislative process .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Palin called the deem and pass process made up , and said , ‚Äú This is scary place for America to be right now , Sean .
Everything that our leaders in D.C. are doing right now with this Obamacare this government takeover of healthcare goes against the will of the people .
We ‚Äôve learned through America ‚Äôs history that the government that governs least governs best , and that all political power is inherent in the people .
Government originates just from the will of the people .
It ‚Äôs implemented according to the will of the people ‚Ä¶
The process that Pelosi is pushing right now is unconstitutional .
This bill will not have been passed by both houses in Congress , and that ‚Äôs unconstitutional .
It ‚Äôs cut and dry .
It ‚Äôs white and black .
It ‚Äôs quite clear to most Americans that this is n‚Äôt right , and not only again does it go against the will of the people , but it goes against our own constitution .
What ?
Is the Constitution not worth the paper the paper it is written on then ? ‚Äù
Poor Sarah , she is so far in over her head on this one , that all she could do is repeat the talking points .
The problem is that FNC ‚Äôs Carl Cameron admitted yesterday that deeming has been around for centuries .
There is nothing unconstitutional about it .
In fact when Republicans were in power from 1995 - 2006 they used deeming to pass up to 42 % of their rules , so according to Sarah ‚Äôs logic , her own party is a serial violator of the Constitution .
Hannity and Palin do n‚Äôt seem to understand that the bill that will be deemed is not the one that the president is going to sign .
It is a legislative technique that will be used so that the House can move forward in the debate .
The bill that will deemed is the Senate bill , so that in fact both bills will match and will have been passed by both congressional bodies .
This maneuver is as old as the hills , so the right wing outrage is a complete fabrication .
Where was Palin ‚Äôs outrage when the Republicans use deeming to pass a toothless ethics and lobbying bill in 2006 ?
Come to think of it , ethical behavior has always been a foreign concept to Palin , anyway .
It is mind blogging that anyone would want a politically retarded individual such as Sarah Palin to be president .
If it was n‚Äôt for talking points , Palin would have nothing to say at all .
She brought her populist rage to the table tonight on Fox , except that facts did not match her claims , but Palin has never let the facts get in the way of her television time , so keep on talking Sarah , you are playing the female fool that Rupert Murdoch is paying you so handsomely to be to perfection .
A few days ago , I took a look at a Crooks and Liars post that suggested CNN was ‚Äú pimping ‚Äù the Great American ‚Äú Tea Party Express PR and Propaganda Tour . ‚Äù
While I agreed with much of the post , I did n‚Äôt think CNN ‚Äôs motivation was to promote the Tea Party tour , but rather , to be in the right place at the right time when something juicy happens .
As it turns out , reporting by conservative Newsbusters seems to confirm elements of liberal Crooks and Liars ‚Äò thesis , or at the very least , that CNN is trying to have it both ways .
Let ‚Äôs all sing ‚Äú Kumbaya ‚Äù for a minute .
Update : Newsbusters removed the key email from its post .
Screenshot after the jump .
Newsbusters credits CNN for what it considers to be ‚Äú one of the first to offer fair coverage of the Tea Party movement outside of Fox News , ‚Äù while bringing up the infamous Susan Roesgen report from a Tea Party last year .
At the same time , they wonder why CNN is pushing the story so hard to conservative blogs , illustrating this with emails from CNN ‚Äôs PR department .
This one was reportedly sent to Michelle Malkin :
‚Äú Hi there , I thought this might be an interesting post for you - a behind - the - scenes piece about the Tea Party and how the stereotypes do n‚Äôt tell the full story .
Let me know if you need anything else ! ‚Äù
There ‚Äôs nothing all that sinister here .
This kind of email is pretty standard PR promotion .
However , this next email , sent to Brent Bozell of Newsbusters parent Media Research Center , sets up a decidedly non-neutral , us - vs. - them dynamic betweeen CNN and ‚Äú the left : ‚Äù
‚Äú Clearly our critics from the left do n‚Äôt think we should be covering the Tea Party movement in the way we are and clearly CNN thinks it ‚Äôs a legitimate and important story .
If anyone from Newsbusters is interested in this angle ‚Äì let me know . ‚Äù
This sort of email might be perfectly fine coming from Fox News or MSNBC , but it flies in the face of CNN ‚Äôs self - appointed role as the last bastion of non-partisan journalism .
Update : Reading the comments , I noted that Newsbusters removed the key email to Brent Bozell from its post .
Luckily , I saved the page .
Here is a screengrab of the passage in question , as it appeared when this story was published .
I will try to find out why it was removed .
Have a tip we should know ?

Google ‚Äôs Bill Weihl expresses his opinion , ‚Äú We see a chance to make a difference in the field of renewable energy and energy information that can help bring the world to a lower carbon and more efficient economy . ‚Äù
Google is known for its Internet search engine .
Now they want to make inroads into green technology too .
They declared in 2007 that they want to invest in clean and green technology and want to do research of their own in the field of alternative energy .
Now Google ‚Äôs engineers are putting their effort and energy into solar technology .
We all know that solar power is clean and green fuel .
But the cost of solar panels prevents us from utilizing solar energy extensively .
Now Google Inc. is trying to come up with its own solar panel with a reduced cost of 25 % .
They are developing a new mirror technology for cheaper solar power .
Weihl confirms , ‚Äú Typically what we ‚Äôre seeing is $ 2.50 to $ 4 a watt ( for ) capital cost .
So a 250 megawatt installation would be $ 600 million to a $ 1 billion .
It ‚Äôs a lot of money . ‚Äù
That amounts to 12 to 18 cents a kilowatt / hour .
They are using solar energy to heat up a substance that produces steam .
This steam will turn the wheels of turbines .
Mirrors will start the whole process by directing the sun ‚Äôs rays on the substance to heat it up .
Bill Weihl reaffirms his company ‚Äôs commitment , ‚Äú We ‚Äôve been looking at very unusual materials for the mirrors both for the reflective surface as well as the substrate that the mirror is mounted on . ‚Äù
Weihl said Google is trying to reduce the cost of making heliostats , the fields of mirrors that have to track the sun , by at least a factor of two , ‚Äú ideally a factor of three or four . ‚Äù
Google is trying to develop a feasible technology in a couple of months to show internally .
They are also opting for the accelerated testing so that they can find out the impact of decades of wear and tear on the new mirrors while they are installed in desert .
Bill Weihl confirms , ‚Äú We ‚Äôre not there yet .
I ‚Äôm very hopeful we will have mirrors that are cheaper than what companies in the space are using ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù
Google is also going for another technology ‚Äî gas turbines ‚Äî that would derive energy from solar power rather than natural gas .
This will help Google office to reduce their electricity bill further .
Weihl shares his enthusiasm for future power generation , ‚Äú In two to three years we could be demonstrating a significant scale pilot system that would generate a lot of power and would be clearly mass manufacturable at a cost that would give us a levelized cost of electricity that would be in the 5 cents or sub 5 cents a kilowatt hour range . ‚Äù
Google is aiming to make the alternative form of energy cheaper than the energy generated from coal .
Earlier Google was investing in other green companies .
But later on they decided to develop their own clean and green technology .
They discovered that most of the companies lack innovative ideas to replace dependence on fossil fuels .
That ‚Äôs why they are actively involved in coming up with their own new green technology .
First , Google people have put their own house in order .
Goggle ‚Äôs data centers make sure that 300 million web searches take place smoothly .
But these searches translate into huge costs as they devour mammoth amount of electricity .
Google put his team of intellectuals to come up with more efficient and less power consuming designs .
This step reduced the servers ‚Äô consumption of energy by half .
Google ‚Äôs Mountain View , California , headquarters installed solar panels producing 1.6 MW of solar energy .
Their carefully selected carbon offsets , has helped the company become carbon - neutral .
According to Weihl the side effects are quite pleasant , ‚Äú In the process we ‚Äôre saving ourselves a lot of money by making ourselves more efficient . ‚Äù

Examples of the LDS e-mails and death threats flooding Jackson 's inbox after the jump .
" As expected I did manage to piss off several thousand Mormons .
Success !
However , I got nine death threats .
Success ?
I have to admit , while the pissed - off - bigots was to be expected , I was caught off guard by the Glen - Beck - style death threats , " Jackson wrote in an e-mail interview yesterday .
After my post went up , MormonBoyz got quite a bit of exposure as various other LGBT blogs linked up to TBP and the porn site itself .
Once the site started getting a lot of traffic , it was noticed by LDS members .
Death Threats
Here 's a couple examples of the death threats being sent to Jackson :
" Paul .
I support free speech in the USA , but you are clearly sick .
I imagine God would be pleased if I killed the creator of MBz . "
Because God loves nothing better than murder , right ?
Is n't that in the Ten Commandants ?
" Thou Shalt Not Kill Anyone But Web Designers "
" You 're despicable .
Take down the site unless you want to die . "
Short , succinct , and sufficiently aggressive , this e-mail really sums up the death threats Jackson shared with me .
The most amazing part was how many of the e-mailers started their missives with a personalized salutation .
" Dear Paul , " or " Paul , " the majority wrote ; it upped the creepiness portion dramatically .
Seeing how many of them also cited their religious beliefs as a reason to kill someone was also striking .
Religious Right Outrage
A couple of the e-mails penned by upset Mormons :
MormonBoyz CAN'T be what you claim it to be .
I ca n't IMAGINE any full time missionaries taking part in that while serving .
Missionaries are emissaries the Lord , and representatives of the one and only true and living church .
If you are still a member in good standing , you would know that !
Be prepared for a memo needs to be sent out to all the missions and mission presidents warning them about your site .
That 's all it would take to identify the Elders on your site and have them excommunicated and sent home dishonorably .
Either way , MormonBoyz is the despicable brainchild of a faggot whose priesthood and marriage are a sham !
I am sorry , but I very much dislike the fact that your website shows that which it does .
Yes , I did go to the homepage to see what everyone was upset about , and I understand their views .
I got such a feeling of wrongness well up inside me that it burned my chest and took away my breath .
Temple garments are sacred , you know that .
Ca n't you feel the love of Christ when a believer spews words like " despicable " and " faggot " at you ?
It reminds me of the old bumpersticker that said , " Dear Christ , Please save me from your followers . "
The Huffington Post recently ( March 18 ) sunk to a new low by publishing an attack on u201CRon Paul and the Tea Parties : States ‚Äô Rights and the 17th Amendmentu201D by one Leonard Zeskind , a u201 Cformeru201D Stalinist rabble - rouser .
According to Laird Wilcox , author of The Watchdogs , a book about contemporary political movements , Zeskind began his communistic career of agitprop in the ‚Äô70s as a u201 C front manu201D for the u201CSojourner Truth Organizationu201D whose stated objective was u201 Cto motivate the working classes to make a revolution .
u201D
The Organization quoted its role model , Josef Stalin , who insisted on the need for u201 Ciron disciplineu201D in agitating for a communist revolution in America .
According to Wilcox , Zeskind has written favorably about u201 Cthe value of a grass roots school of communismu201D that would teach people how to u201 Cdestroy the marketplace .
u201D
He wrote this in a journal called u201CUrgent Tasks , u201D a phrase popularized by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin .
The Kansas City City Magazine once called Zeskind u201 Celusive , paranoid , near hysterical .u201D
His forte , according to the Wilcox Collection , appears to be u201 Critual defamationu201D of his perceived political opponents , i.e. , u201 Cto call people names in the hope of defaming , discrediting , stigmatizing or neutralizing them .

An example of the Zeskind / Huffington u201 Critual defamationu201D strategy is his statements in The Huffington Post that : 1 ) Someone writing for an obscure publication called u201CThe American Free Pressu201D noted recently that u201 Cthe Tea Parties were actually born during the presidential campaign of Rep. Ron Paul of Texasu201D ; 2 ) Several decades ago , someone who wrote in u201CThe American Free Pressu201D was revealed to be a Holocaust Denier ; 3 ) Therefore , the Tea Parties ( and Ron Paul ‚Äôs supporters ) must be hotbeds of Holocaust Denial .
Zeskind works himself into a hysterical frenzy over the fact that the u201CTea Party Movementu201D has been talking about repealing the Seventeenth Amendment , which he says would be the equivalent of denying women the right to vote , or abolishing the constitutional principle of equal justice under the law .
I ‚Äôm not making this up .
He really is that hysterical .
And he calls Ron Paul an u201 Cextremistu201D !
Apparently , Ariana Huffington believes Zeskind is a qualified expert on constitutionalism .
Why are the Huffingtonians upset about mere talk of repealing the Seventeenth Amendment ?
Because the Amendment , which mandated the popular election of U.S. Senators ( as opposed to the original system of appointment by state legislators ) allows a small cabal of wealthy and influential people to dominate governmental decision - making .
Getting elected to the U.S. Senate requires the raising of millions of dollars for television advertising and other elements of modern campaigning , so that senators have long been in the pockets of their major donors from all over the country , and the world , as opposed to the folks back home .
Zeskind says this system is u201 Cdemocratic , u201D but in reality it is the opposite .
Reverting back to the original system that was created by the founders would allow the u201 Criff - raffu201D known as the citizens of the sovereign states to exert more influence over their own government .
Historically , this system was an important brake on the growth of the central government .
This is why the Lunatic Left is increasingly hysterical over the talk about repealing the Seventeenth Amendment as well as nullification , and especially secession .

The Rationale for State Legislators To Appoint U.S. Senators
Professor Ralph Rossum of Claremont McKenna College explains the rationale for the original system of appointing U.S. Senators in his book , Federalism , the Supreme Court , and the Seventeenth Amendment .
The founding fathers intended that state legislatures would appoint senators and then instruct them on how to vote in Congress .
This was to safeguard against the corruption of senators by special interests .
u201CThe ability of state legislatures to instruct senators was mentioned frequently during the Constitutional Convention and the state ratifying conventions and was always assumed to exist , u201D writes Rossum .
At the New York ratifying convention John Jay , co-author of The Federalist Papers , said u201CThe Senate is to be composed of men appointed by the state legislatures ‚Ä¶ .
I presume they will also instruct them , that there will be a constant correspondence between the senators and the state executives .
u201D
At the Massachusetts ratifying convention Fisher Ames referred to U.S. senators as u201 Cambassadors of the states .
u201D James Madison wrote in Federalist # 45 that because of this system the U.S. Senate u201 Cwould be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States , or the prerogatives of their governments .
u201D
This was an important element of the whole system of states ‚Äô rights or federalism that was created by the founders ( not by John C. Calhoun , as Zeskind and myriad neocons falsely claim ) .
As Madison wrote in Federalist # 62 , the system gave u201 Cto state governments such an agency in the formation of the federal government as must secure the authority of the former .
u201D
It helped establish the fact that the citizens of the states were sovereign and the masters , not the servants , of their own government .
Hamiltonu2019s Curse : ... Thomas DiLorenzo Best Price : $ 1.35 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
The legislative appointment of U.S. senators was responsible for the most famous declarations of the states ‚Äô rights philosophy of the founders , the nullification philosophy as expressed in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolves of 1798 , authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison respectively ( not by Calhoun , as Zeskind and others falsely claim ) .
These Resolves were used as part of the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures ‚Äô instructions to their senators to vote to repeal the odious Sedition Act , which effectively prohibited free political speech .
The origins of nullification do not lie in attempts to protect slavery or Jim Crow laws , as Zeskind once again falsely claims .
Jim Crow laws existed throughout the Northern states for many decades before they were imposed on the South by the Republican Party ‚Äôs military occupation authorities during Reconstruction .

Senator Peleg Sprague of Maine resigned in 1835 after opposing his state legislatures ‚Äô instructions to oppose the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States .
When the U.S. Senate censured President Andrew Jackson for having vetoed the rechartering of the Bank , seven U.S. Senators resigned rather than carry out their state legislatures ‚Äô instructions to vote to have Jackson ‚Äôs censure expunged .
One of them was Senator John Tyler of Virginia , who would become President of the United States in 1841 .

In other words , the original system of state legislative appointment of U.S. Senators did exactly what it was designed to do : limit the tyrannical proclivities of the central government .
As Professor Todd Zywicki of George Mason University Law School has written , u201 Cthe Senate played an active role in preserving the sovereignty and independent sphere of action of state governmentsu201D in the pre-Seventeenth Amendment era prior to 1913 .
u201 CRather than delegating lawmaking authority to Washington , state legislators insisted on keeping authority close to home ‚Ä¶ .
As a result , the long - term size of the federal government remained fairly stable and relatively small during the pre-Seventeenth - Amendment erau201D ( emphasis added ) .
( See Todd J. Zywicki , u201CBeyond the Shell and Husk of History : The History of the Seventeenth Amendment and its Implications for Current Reform Proposals , u201D Cleveland State Law Review , vol. 45 , 1997 ) .
You know the Lunatic Left is whistling past the graveyard when they resort to the u201 Cmight - makes - rightu201D argument against nullification and repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment .
Echoing the views expressed by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia several weeks ago , Zeskind concludes his paranoid tirade by saying that the u201 Cvision of state sovereignty and secession were settled by the Civil War ‚Ä¶ .u201D
But nothing is ever u201Csettledu201D permanently in politics , no matter how many citizens the U.S. government might murder ( some 350,000 in the case of the u201CCivil Waru201D ) in order to prove itself u201 Cright.u201D

PM Jose Socrates had appealed to MPs to back the same - sex marriage law
Portugal 's parliament has passed a law to legalise same - sex marriage , but rejected proposals to allow homosexual couples to adopt .
The bill was approved with the support of the governing Socialist Party and other parties further to the left .
Prime Minister Jose Socrates opened the debate with an appeal to back the law , saying it would put right an injustice that had caused unnecessary pain .
The law has been fiercely opposed by conservatives in the Catholic country .
Rightist parties had sought a national referendum on the issue following a petition that collected more than 90,000 signatures , but their proposal was rejected .
Friday 's debate was at times heated , says the BBC's Alison Roberts in Lisbon , with Socialists attacking as discriminatory a counter - proposal from the centre - right Social Democrats for a new so - called civil union for same - sex couples .
The bill will now be reviewed in committee before coming back for a final vote in parliament .
If the law is ratified by President Anibal Cavaco Silva , it could come into effect in April - just a month before a visit to Portugal by Pope Benedict XVI , a staunch opponent of gay marriage .
The ratification would make Portugal the sixth country in Europe to allow same - sex marriages after Belgium , the Netherlands , Spain , Sweden and Norway .
Many other countries have introduced civil partnerships , which give lesbian and gay couples some of the rights of married heterosexuals .

Stormy Daniels and her team may not have come to a conclusion about her Senate candidacy over the past few months , but she 's managed to be a thorn in the side of Louisiana Republicans nonetheless .
Since the former porn star 's ballyhooed announcement Tuesday that she 's discovered her inner Republican , thanks to the RNC's Voyeur scandal , one GOP - er told POLITICO that some long - standing members of his party have begun to wonder why , if she 's serious , Daniels did n't proclaim her rightward tilt on her frequently updated Twitter account .
( Her Twitter account , by the way , includes gems like " Haha !
Keep hating on me from your mommy 's basement you pathetic ____ .
Your jealousy has made my day !
Woohoo ! "
And : " Hurry up Pizza Hut !!!
I know ... I know ... this is how pornos start ... but seriously , I just want my ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ' pizza ... LOL . " )
At the time of the announcement , it appeared Daniels was making brunch plans with a friend and choosing her wardrobe for an upcoming production she 's filming in L.A .
Justifying her Twitter time , Daniels 's point man ( and Democratic operative ) Brian Welsh said : " Stormy 's twitters highlight both her strong work ethic and a dedication to a conservative fiscal brunch policy .
This is exactly the kind of dedication and fiscal common sense that resonates with the American people . "
But for Republicans , all the attention on Daniels 's antics is actually quite annoying .
" It 's been clear for months , and evidence bears it out , that this is nothing but a shameless PR stunt engineered by Democrat Party operatives with connections to the Melancon campaign , " says NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh .
He added , " Charlie Melancon and his campaign operatives owe voters in Louisiana an apology , as do media outlets like the Associated Press who have given ink to this nonsense at a time when there are so many important issues facing the state of Louisiana and our country . "
Louisiana Republicans have also released a list of questions .
" This would be high comedy if it was n't such a sad reflection on Charlie Melancon 's campaign , " scoffed another Louisiana Republican .
" The coordination between their camp and hers is as clear as day .
This has the potential to really backfire on Melancon . "
However , Melancon 's team says there 's no connection between the two parties .
Spokesman Jeff Giertz tells POLITICO : " Ms. Daniels 's interest in running for Senate was publicly reported long before Charlie Melancon decided to run .
The Melancon campaign never recruited , encouraged or asked Ms. Daniels to run for Senate , and any suggestion to the contrary is a lie .
Period .
Regardless of who emerges from the GOP primary , Charlie will be focusing on his message of bringing more bipartisanship , common sense and honesty back to Washington . "
Of course , Team Stormy responded early Wednesday morning to what it called the " [ David ] Vitter attack machine . "
" We are disappointed that Senator Vitter has shamelessly allowed the Washington and Baton Rouge Republican elite to violate Ronald Reagan 's 11th Commandment and attack a fellow Republican who is not as of now even a declared candidate in this race , " a statement said .
" To be clear , the only people who have recruited Stormy Daniels are the hardworking men and women of Louisiana who are tired of federal spending , terrified of government intrusion and are looking for a true conservative to run for United States Senate . "
Added Louisiana Democratic Party spokesman Kevin Franck : " It sounds like the folks over at John Ensign 's former stomping grounds need to sit down , take off their tinfoil hats and take a deep breath .
You do n't need some half - cocked conspiracy theory to figure out why Republicans keep jumping into the race against David Vitter .
If the NRSC is uncomfortable with a Republican challenger who has a history of selling sex , I would suggest they reconsider standing by an incumbent with a history of paying for it . "
Queries to the Louisiana GOP went unreturned .

Swiss President and Economy Minister Doris Leuthard gestures during a news conference in Bern March 25 , 2010 .
Leuthard called on Sunday for a central register of paedophile priests , to prevent them from having further contact with children .
REUTERS / Michael Buholzer
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Swiss President Doris Leuthard called on Sunday for a central register of paedophile priests , to prevent them from having further contact with children .
Her statement to Swiss media came as a sexual abuse scandal sweeps the Catholic Church worldwide , with Swiss police too investigating allegations that children were harmed by priests .
‚Äú Whether perpetrators come from the civil or clerical world makes no difference .
Both are subject to Swiss criminal law , with no ifs or buts , ‚Äù Leuthard said .
Leuthard said it was important to ensure that paedophiles had no further contact with children and the possibility of a register for paedophile priests should be considered , on the lines of one for teachers .
The Swiss weekly SonntagsZeitung reported that the Swiss bishops ‚Äô conference was considering holding an emergency meeting , where the question of a register could be discussed , ahead of its regular annual meeting from May 31 to June 2 .
The Swiss church plans to counter the negative publicity from the sex abuse scandal with an advertising campaign in which posters saying ‚Äú More Good News ‚Äù would be displayed in churches in each of Switzerland ‚Äôs 2,000 parishes , another weekly , Sonntag , reported .
A 20 - year - old woman is thought to be the first person to be banned from all licensed premises in England and Wales .
Laura Hall , from Bromsgrove in Worcestershire , cannot enter a pub , club , off - licence , or drink alcohol in a public place for two years .
West Mercia Police said it applied for a " Drinking Banning Order " ( DBO ) after she was repeatedly arrested for drunken behaviour .
The order , introduced last year , was issued by Kidderminster magistrates .
We chose to use this new legislation as a way of helping address Laura 's offending behaviour
Sgt David Roberts , West Mercia Police Sgt David Roberts , from West Mercia Police , said : " While there have been some Drinking Banning Orders issued already since their introduction last year , this is the first to be issued on a nationwide basis .
" It effectively bans Laura Hall from drinking or buying alcohol in any licensed premises across the whole of England and Wales .
A spokesman for the Home Office said until the court data was processed , it could not confirm whether Ms Hall was the first in the country to be given a nationwide ban .
A police spokesman said the alcohol - related public order offences committed by Ms Hall were in and around the Bromsgrove area .
She had already been excluded from local licensed premises through the PubWatch and Bromsgrove Against Night - time Disorder ( BAND ) schemes .
Breaching the conditions of the order could incur a fine , unlike anti-social behaviour orders where a breach may result in imprisonment , police said .
Unsealed container " We chose to use this new legislation as a way of helping address Laura 's offending behaviour , and we very much hope that rather than seeing it as a punishment she will use it as an opportunity to get her life back on track , " Sgt Roberts said .
" We also hope that licensees throughout Bromsgrove , Redditch and into Birmingham will be reassured by the positive action we have taken . "
Ms Hall is also banned from having alcohol in any unsealed container or consuming alcohol in any public place .
She must also attend a course to tackle her alcohol - misuse issues , police said .
However , the order could be lifted after a year providing she has completed the course and has not breached any conditions of the order .
An order would not be approved for people with mental health issues or , for those who are drug or alcohol dependent , the police spokesman added .

BILLIONAIRE businessman Kerry Stokes paid for Senator Stephen Conroy 's ski runs when the pair met in an up - scale US ski resort .
The Sunday Herald Sun can reveal that Mr Stokes , half - owner of the Seven Network , provided a free pass to Communications Minister Senator Conroy - a passionate skier and snowboarder - when the pair met in ritzy Beaver Creek in Colorado in January .
Last week , the Victorian senator told the Sunday Herald Sun that the Colorado trip was a private holiday " which was fully paid for by me " .
But Seven has now confirmed Mr Stokes provided a ski-lift pass to Senator Conroy .
The pass was available because Mr Stokes is a life member of two exclusive ski clubs .
That entitles him to lift passes .
The revelation that Senator Conroy accepted Mr Stokes 's hospitality - less than a month before announcing a $ 250 million tax cut to the free - to - air TV operators - will put further pressure on the Rudd Government when Parliament resumes this week .
Senator Conroy did not declare the lift pass in his register of senators ' interests , despite declaring other gifts during the month of January .
Parliamentary rules state all gifts valued at more than $ 300 must be declared .
The value of the ski lift pass is not known .
Mr Stokes is a member of two exclusive clubs - the Beaver Creek Club , which has an " initiation fee " of $ 89,000 , and the Vail Mountain Club , which charges initiation fees of up to $ 309,000 , plus hefty annual fees .
Senator Conroy has refuse to answer questions about whether he accepted any hospitality from Mr Stokes .
Asked directly last week if Mr Stokes had provided him with ski-lift passes , he replied : " Any items that require disclose will be disclosed under the rules of Parliament . "
Asked yesterday to explain why he did not declare the freebie publicly - and instead claimed he had paid for the entire holiday - Senator Conroy 's spokeswoman said the Minister stood by his earlier comments .
The Sunday Herald Sun understands that Senator Conroy used his ski equipment for the two ski runs with Mr Stokes .
Senator Conroy visited Beaver Creek - which boasts the slogan " not exactly roughing it " - a month before he gave the $ 250 million tax - cuts to the free - to - air TV operators Seven , Nine and Ten .
He said the tax break was to protect local content .
But it failed to include any binding clause for the money to be spent on local content .
Pay TV operators including Foxtel ( part - owned by News Ltd , publisher of the Sunday Herald Sun ) claimed free TV had been given an unfair advantage .
Senator Conroy then said the tax - cut decision was made before Christmas .
Senator Conroy - already under fire for lobbying for a $ 450,000 - a year - job for his mate , former Labor MP Mike Kaiser - has been reluctant to spell out what went on at his meeting with Mr Stokes .
He said his meetings with Mr Stokes were " entirely appropriate " and that he met regularly with senior media representatives , including from News Ltd , Foxtel and Austar .

Video from Zimbabwe on Thursday showed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Robert Mugabe , two presidents who remain in office despite claims from opponents that they engaged in electoral fraud , enter a news conference hand in hand at the start of a state visit by Iranian officials to a country with untapped uranium deposits .
In their remarks at a news conference in the capital , Harare , and at a state dinner later on Thursday , both men tried to cast Western concerns over the elections that kept them in power and over Iran ‚Äôs nuclear program as ‚Äú neocolonial ‚Äù meddling .
Mr. Mugabe told reporters , ‚Äú President Ahmadinejad and myself have the same policy , and same stance , anti-imperialist , anticolonialist , and stands to protect our sovereignty and our right of ownership of our resources . ‚Äù
Mr. Ahmadinejad claimed : ‚Äú Iran and Zimbabwe are two countries that continue their efforts to maintain their sovereignty and they move in the path of independence , and do everything in the path of peace , brotherhood and justice . ‚Äù
Mr. Mugabe ‚Äôs decision to invite the Iranian president to visit led to a furious response from the Movement for Democratic Change , his coalition partners in Zimbabwe ‚Äôs awkward unity government , which was forged after a disputed , and violent , presidential election in 2008 .
The M.D.C. , whose leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , led Mr. Mugabe after the first round of balloting in the 2008 election , only to be forced by an outbreak of violence to withdraw and flee the country , now shares power with Mr. Mugabe ‚Äôs party , ZANU - PF .
Last week the Movement for Democratic Change issued a statement on the Iranian president ‚Äôs visit that began :
The unilateral decision by ZANU - PF to invite Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to officially open the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair is not only a colossal political scandal , but an insult to the peace - loving people of Zimbabwe and Iran .
The M.D.C. condemns the scandalous invitation of Ahmadinejad . [ ‚Ä¶ ]
It is no secret that Ahmadinejad has perforated human rights credentials .
He has made his reputation as a war monger , a trampler of human rights , an executioner of those with dissenting voices and a leader of questionable legitimacy due to his controversial electoral victory in last year ‚Äôs presidential election in June .
While we understand Mr Mugabe ‚Äôs shared values with Ahmadinejad , whose legitimacy is in tatters following the contestation of last year ‚Äôs presidential results by the Green Movement party led by Mir Hossein Mousavi , we call upon the inclusive government to desist from associating our peace - loving country with despots .
While Ahmadinejad will be wining and dining in our country next week , nine opposition activists in Iran will be facing death sentences for merely contesting the outcome of last year ‚Äôs presidential results .
As a party , we feel that a country is defined by its friends .
We want to place it on record that judging by his record , Ahmadinejad is coming not as a friend of Zimbabwe , but an ally of those that unilaterally invited him .
Choice of friends defines character , and inviting the Iranian strongman to an investment forum is like inviting a mosquito to cure malaria .
Hobnobbing with dubious political leaders confirms stereotypes that we are a banana republic .
A Zimbabwean newspaper controlled by ZANU - PF , The Herald , fired back at critics of the visit on Friday , in an article that noted M.D.C. officials were ‚Äú conspicuous by their absence ‚Äù at a ceremony where , it said , ‚Äú hundreds of jubilant Zimbabweans gathered to welcome Islamic Republic of Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . ‚Äù
According to the newspaper ‚Äú observers ‚Äù in Zimbabwe said Mr. Tsvangirai ‚Äôs party ‚Äú was simply dancing to the tune of Western countries , which have tried to effect illegal regime change in Iran since the popular 1979 revolution that deposed the Western - backed puppet regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi . ‚Äù
Background
The authors write that " knowledge of past climate can improve our understanding of natural climate variability and also help address the question of whether modern climate change is unprecedented in a long - term context , " which is perhaps the most burning scientific question of our day .
In addition , they say that " regional proxy temperature series with lengths of 500 - 2000 years from China have been reconstructed using tree rings with 1 - 3 year temporal resolution , annually resolved stalagmites , decadally resolved ice - core information , historical documents with temporal resolution of 10 - 30 years , and lake sediments resolving decadal to century time scales , " noting that " these proxies provide quantitative estimates of past climate through statistical calibration against instrumental temperature measurements . "
What was done
Dividing the country into five sections ,
Ge et al. developed three composite temperature reconstructions that extended back in time a full two millennia ( Northeast , Tibet , Central East ) , one that extended back approximately 950 years ( Northwest ) , and one that only went back about 550 years ( Southeast ) .
What was learned
With respect to the three sections of China that extended through the Medieval Warm Period and the one that extended into but not through it , the six scientists report that ( 1 ) in the Northeast , there was a warm period " between approximately 1100 and 1200 that exceeded the warm level of the last decades of the 20th century , " ( 2 ) in Tibet , there was a " warming period of twenty decadal time steps between the 600s and 800s " that was " comparable to the late 20th century , " ( 3 ) in the Central East , there were two warm peaks ( 1080s - 1100s and 1230s - 1250s ) that had " comparable high temperatures to the last decades of the 20th century , " although the graph of their data indicates that these two periods were actually warmer than the last decades of the 20th century , and ( 4 ) in the Northwest , " comparable warm conditions in the late 20th century are also found around the decade 1100s . "
What it means
Since portions of two of the four sections of China for which temperature reconstructions extended far enough back in time to sample the Medieval Warm Period exhibited temperatures comparable to those of the late 20th century , and since portions of two other sections actually revealed parts of the Medieval Warm Period to have been warmer than the late 20th century , it is clear that there is nothing unusual , unnatural or unprecedented about the country 's current level of warmth .
Hence , by the reasoning set forth by Ge et al. in the introduction to their study , there is no compelling reason to attribute late 20th - century warmth in that sprawling country to 20th - century increases in the air 's CO 2 concentration , nor to attribute it to concomitant increases in any other greenhouse gases .

Here , near the river Loire a giant deep - sea diver sleeps gently , waiting for his task to begin .
Sadness marks his face even as he sleeps .
He has been searching the world over for his missing niece and although he may not know it , the end of his search is coming .

Royale de Luxe was founded in 1979 and is actually based in Nantes , making this a return to the city that bore the company .
They have , however , performed all over the world , as far away as Chile and Australia .
You may remember the Sultan ‚Äôs Elephant strolling through the streets of London in 2006 .
An associate company , La Machine created last year ‚Äôs spectacular ‚Äò Princesse ‚Äô a massive visiting spider in Liverpool when in was European City of Culture .
Here , however , a giant returns home .
He rises , perhaps in the hope that his long quest will soon be over .
The Giant , now equipped in deep sea diving gear and his little niece , the Little Giantess have featured in the works of the theatre company before .
However , they have been away for a while with some information about which the world had previously been unaware .
As with any Royale de Luxe performance there is a long and some would said drawn out back story .
In 1912 the Titanic went down to the bottom of the ocean .
Unknown to us , however , was that in its hold a giantess was held captive , the mother of the Little Giantess .
From a distance he looks small , but only if he were an ordinary person paying a visit to a Lego theme park .
As he steadies himself he can resume his long search .
The enormous diver is the scouring the earth for the Little Giantesse .
She was captured in Iceland which was at the time the home of the giants , each having his or her own particular task .
The Little Giantess was to wake up the geysers of Iceland when a message needed to be sent .
You may wonder what on earth geysers and messages have in common but little known to the outside world the geysers were used to transmit signals between the giants , much like the smoke signals of American natives .
The mechanics behind this piece of street art are staggering and more than a little scary .
How much the gentlemen forty meters above the ground are being paid is unknown but whatever it is , it is not enough .
But where does the deep - sea diver properly come in to the story ?
He is the brother of the giantess who drowned on the Titanic .
Originally he had been busy doing his own job ‚Äì sawing up icebergs ‚Äì to realize that his sister and her daughter were missing .
His statistics are something extraordinary as well .
He stands at nine and a half meters and a width of almost three .
Weighing in at two and a half tones it takes thirty operators to control his movements .
In his past he has travelled the seabed for years and eventually he found the wreck of the Titanic .
He buried his sister near the sunken ship .
While there he discovered a mysterious box full of mail from the Titanic .
He now had two new goals in life ‚Äì the task of finding his niece and to deliver the mail .
Since then he has wandered the earth in search of the Little Giantess .
Still wearing the diving outfit he used to search the bed of the ocean , this festival marks the end of his search .
The momentum of his stride is enough to pick up two grown men off their feet and dangle them through the air .
As with all of the Royale de Luxe open air spectacles little was given away before the day of the event , in this case Friday 5 June .
All anyone knew was that the giant would wake up at 1.30 in the afternoon on the Tblisi Deck of the town .
He made his way , astonishing the crowds on the way with his sheer scale .
He was forced to stop twice on his route , however , not far from the hospital .
However , a huge crowd waited for him at the Place Gloriette and he did eventually make it .
Will he ever find his niece ?
Well , tomorrow is another day , after all .
However , this spectacle represents altogether another wonderful performance by the massed ranks of Royale de Luxe and a wonderful start to the Estuary 2009 Festival in Nantes .
Postscript .
The good people of Nantes and the world had to wait until the day after to see whether or not the giant was reunited with his niece .
It seems , now that it has happened , only fair to share with you the end result of his epic search .
The picture below speaks for itself .

Norman Olson is a former teacher , preacher and gun salesman .
The Nikiski resident transplanted his family and a few friends from Michigan several years ago , to take up root in Alaska .
This in itself is not unusual , as many disenchanted with life in the Lower 48 travel North to seek a new start .
What is unusual is that Olson came here to start an independent Alaska militia .
His group has ties to militias on a national hate watch list .

Following news earlier today that the CEO and President of Infinity Ward were fired by Activision over allegations of insubordination , Activision - Blizzard has issued a press - release that details the future of the Call of Duty series .
As was announced before , Treyarch is currently working on a new installment in the series due for release later this year .
Infinity Ward is currently involved in developing two map packs for Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , which was released in November 2009 .
However , Activision - Blizzard also stated that the recently established Sledgehammer Games , headed by former general manager of Visceral Games , will be working on bringing the Call of Duty franchise to the action - adventure genre .
Activision has stated that :
‚Äú The company is also for the first time announcing that a new game in the Call of Duty series is expected to be released in 2011 and that Sledgehammer Games , a newly formed , wholly owned studio , is in development on a Call of Duty game that will extend the franchise into the action - adventure genre . ‚Äù
Furthermore , a separate business unit will be established for all Call of Duty - related games .
This business unit will be headed by Philip Earl , who currently heads Activision ‚Äôs Asia / Pacific publishing department .
With respect to the unrest at Infinity Ward , Activision stated that ‚Äú Activision Publishing veterans Steve Pearce , chief technology officer and Steve Ackrich , head of production , will lead Infinity Ward on an interim basis .
Jason West and Vince Zampella are no longer with Infinity Ward . ‚Äù
Corporate CEOs and union chiefs would have to stand by political advertising they helped fund under legislation being introduced in Congress today .
The long - anticipated House and Senate bills come in response to a January Supreme Court ruling that opened the door to unlimited corporate and union spending on independent political ads .
The bills ' sponsors , including Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , and Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D - Md. , say the ruling will allow corporate interests to flood the airwaves and determine the outcome of November 's midterm elections .
President Obama said the legislation " will shine an unprecedented light on corporate spending in political campaigns " and urged Congress to act quickly to pass it .
" Powerful special interests and their lobbyists should not be able to drown out the voices of the American people , " Obama said in a statement issued Thursday morning .
" Yet they work ceaselessly toward that goal :
They claim the protection of the Constitution in extending this power , and they exploit every loophole in the law to escape limits on their activities . "
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , a leading opponent of campaign - finance restrictions , said the bill is about preserving an " election advantage " for Democrats .
" An effort to disregard the First Amendment and defy the Supreme Court in order to limit the speech of those who may disagree with you is an effort that has no place in this country , " the Kentucky Republican said in a statement .
As we reported recently , the proposals center on new disclosure requirements .
Donors to non-profit groups and trade associations , for instance , would be publicly disclosed if their money is used for " campaign - related " expenses .
Their donations would remain confidential if the contributors bar the groups from using the money for political activity .
CEOs would have to appear on TV ads they helped bankroll and take responsibility for the ad's message .
In addition , TV ads would list the top five donors who gave the largest amount of money available for campaign - related spending to the organization running the ad .
The bills also seek to limit the influence of foreign corporate interests in elections .
Sponsors hope to pass the legislation by July 4 .
" If we do n't act quickly to confront this ruling , we will have let the Supreme Court predetermine the outcome of next November 's elections , " Schumer said .
" It wo n't be Republicans or Democrats ; it will be corporate America and other special interests . "
( Schumer 's bill summary can be found here . )
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and groups that favor fewer campaign restrictions , such as the Center for Competitive Politics , have blasted the proposals .
In a statement , center officials said the bill attempts to " subvert " the high court 's ruling and " intimidate dissenting groups into silence as midterm elections approach . "
Updated at 7:30 p.m. ET : As the folks at The Center for Public Integrity note , the bills also include a provision that has been supported by some Republicans and groups that support fewer limits on campaign finance .
The proposed legislation also would ease some restrictions on when political parties can make expenditures on behalf of candidates .
It would allow parties to spend unlimited amounts of their own funds in support of candidates and to coordinate that spending with the candidates , provided the candidates do not direct or control how the money is spent .
( Editor 's Note : We 've corrected this post .
An earlier version erred when it said the proposal would affect the amount of money an individual could contribute to political parties .
The proposed legislation leaves those limits untouched . )

In the weeks leading up to the recent offensive in Marja , military officials said , several of the 32 remaining U - 2s found nearly 150 possible mines in roads and helicopter landing areas , enabling the Marines to blow them up before approaching the town .
Marine officers say they relied on photographs from the U - 2‚Äôs old film cameras , which take panoramic images at such a high resolution they can see insurgent footpaths , while the U - 2‚Äôs newer digital cameras beamed back frequent updates on 25 spots where the Marines thought they could be vulnerable .
In addition , the U - 2‚Äôs altitude , once a defense against antiaircraft missiles , enables it to scoop up signals from insurgent phone conversations that mountains would otherwise block .
As a result , Colonel Brown said , the U - 2 is often able to collect information that suggests where to send the Predator and Reaper drones , which take video and also fire missiles .
He said the most reliable intelligence comes when the U - 2s and the drones are all concentrated over the same area , as is increasingly the case .
The U - 2 , a black jet with long , narrow wings to help it slip through the thin air , cuts an impressive figure as it rises rapidly into the sky .
It flies at twice the height of a commercial jet , affording pilots views of such things as the earth ‚Äôs curvature .
But the plane , nicknamed the Dragon Lady , is difficult to fly , and missions are grueling and dangerous .
The U - 2s used in Afghanistan and Iraq commute each day from a base near the Persian Gulf , and the trip can last nine to 12 hours .
Pilots eat meals squeezed through tubes and wear spacesuits because their blood would literally boil if they had to eject unprotected at such a high altitude .
Could a plant virus have found a way to infect humans ?
It has always been assumed that plant viruses cannot infect animals , and vice versa , but plant viruses are known to be abundant in human faeces .
Now Didier Raoult at the University of the Mediterranean in Marseille , France , and his team think a pepper virus is making people sick , too .
They have found RNA from the pepper mild mottle virus in the faeces of 7 per cent of the 304 adults they tested .
Those with the virus were more likely to report fever , abdominal pain and itching than those without it , his team found .
Advertisement
Not everyone is convinced , however .
Because Raoult looked at many possible symptoms , he would be expected to find a few that randomly appear more common in virus - positive people , says Robert Garry , a virologist at Tulane University in New Orleans , Louisiana .
Moreover , in order to enter a cell and replicate , a virus must bind to a receptor on its surface , and a plant virus would be highly unlikely to recognise a receptor on a human cell , says Garry .
One possibility , Raoult says , is that the virus does not infect human cells directly .
Instead , the naked viral RNA may alter the function of the cells through a mechanism similar to RNA interference , in which the presence of certain RNA sequences can turn genes on and off .
Raoult ‚Äôs team is now working to gather more direct evidence that the virus does infect humans .

Ken Rockwell posted some links to photos of a Canon AE - 1 Program Digital a couple days ago , and photo - enthusiasts around the web have been discussing whether or not it ‚Äôs a real camera .
From the photos and videos showing the camera , it ‚Äôs pretty clear that it ‚Äôs fake , and that someone with a lot of time on their hands hollowed out a Canon AE - 1 Program camera and lens , put in a Power Shot SD 870 IS , and got the thing working .
It ‚Äôs pretty amazing that the AE - 1 was modified so that all of the controls on the PowerShot are still accessible .
Here ‚Äôs a video posted to YouTube showing that the camera actually works :
There ‚Äôs also a separate video on YouTube with a few more still photographs of the mod .
Addition photographs posted by Rockwell are here , here , and here .
Anyone know how they were able to get an ‚Äú AE - 1 Program Digital ‚Äù logo on the point - and - shoot ?

Last week the Oklahoma House of Representatives passed a bill that equates recruiting militia members to recruiting gang members .
‚Äú Recruiting membership in an unauthorized militia or the Ku Klux Klan would be a crime if legislation approved Thursday by the House of Representatives becomes law .
‚Äò This is making unauthorized militias illegal , ‚Äô said Rep. Mike Shelton , the amendment ‚Äôs author , ‚Äù News OK reported on Thursday .
Shelton wants to send people to prison who do not ask the state for permission to form a militia .
If the bill becomes law , it will likely be challenged as unconstitutional .
However , the bill and its passage in the Oklahoma House reveals there is support on the part of lawmakers to deny citizens their rights under the First Amendment ( specifically , the right to peaceably assemble ) .
A news report video on the law can be viewed here .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Shelton exploited the government attack on the federal building in Oklahoma City fifteen years ago in order to rationalize the law .
‚Äú In Oklahoma , we have seen the damage done by militia fanatics , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú The Ku Klux Klan has a long history of violence and domestic terrorism . ‚Äù
It sounds like Mr. Shelton has read too much Southern Poverty Law Center literature .
The Ku Klux Klan is not only almost entirely dormant ‚Äî with the exception of a few FBI - run stragglers kept around just in case the race card needs to be played ‚Äî but the throwback organization has nothing to do with state militia movements .
Even the ADL admits that Timothy McVeigh was not associated with a militia group .
‚Äú Involvement in those types of organizations should be treated no differently than participation in an urban gang , ‚Äù said Shelton , a Democrat .
‚Äú Shelton ‚Äôs amendment was filed about a week after news reports indicated some in Oklahoma tea party groups supported a volunteer militia to help defend the state ‚Äôs sovereignty against federal government infringement .
Several tea party leaders later said they had been talking about reinstituting a state guard , which would help with emergencies and would be under the direction of the governor and Legislature , ‚Äù News OK adds .
Rep . Mike Reynolds , R- Oklahoma City , asked Shelton if he characterized the Black Panthers as an unauthorized militia .
‚Äú Are they going around terrorizing communities , doing drive - by shootings , using ammonium nitrate to blow up buildings ? ‚Äù
Shelton asked .
‚Äú When they start doing that , they would be considered ( that ) . ‚Äù
Militia groups have never been accused or prosecuted for using ammonium nitrate to blow up buildings .
Shelton ‚Äôs bill has moved to the Oklahoma Senate .

I have pointed out in the past how Microsoft has a habit of spreading misinformation about other browsers to help portray IE as a safer , faster with overall superior browsing experience .
In the past they went as far as paying for browser security reports to make IE8 look better in comparison .
This time the Product Manager of Internet Explorer Pete LePage relied on misguided and selective information to make Chrome look like a privacy menace .
They are now threatened by Chrome , a browser that is not even two years old and has only about ~ 10 % market share .
Product Manager of Internet Explorer Pete LePage talking about IE8 and Chrome¬ís privacy concerns .
( Need Silverlight to play video , hosted by MSFT )
Selective Misinformation # 1 :
Pete claimed that Google sniffs information from Chrome browser address bar whenever you type anything on the address bar .
He also claimed IE8 doesn¬ít .
He demonstrated this by using a Web Debugger called Fiddler which can show you ( among other things ) all the connections your computer is making in real time .
The Truth :
Google Chrome address bar is not the same as an address bar on IE8 where you type URL to go to a specific site .
On Chrome , the Address bar and search bar is combined together into a feature called omnibox .
This feature is not unique to Chrome , this is also available on Firefox .
As a matter of fact Firefox was first to come up with the idea , but it was Chrome who implemented it first .
So when you are typing something on Chrome and Firefox address bar you are also searching for each term .
Its an efficient way to maximize the space on top of the browser , without having to clutter it with two separate boxes , one for URL and one for searches .
So of course when you type in words on the omnibox it will do queries to Google or Bing or whichever search engine you have configured on your chrome configuration .
As matter of fact when you set your default search engine as Bing and type in words on omnibox it does queries to Bing ( look at the screenshot below ) .
Is it right to say that Microsoft is snooping on your every letters and words when you type on Chrome ?
Exhibition 1 : Microsoft Spying on you when you type on Omnibox on Google Chrome
Pete also claimed that when you type on IE Address bar it doesn¬ít make any connection to your search engine , which is true because its not a search box , but when you do type something on the IE8 search box ( which Pete wisely ignored to show ) fiddler showed that IE8 makes connection to your search engine ( shown below ) .
Exhibition 2 : Microsoft Spying on you when you type on IE8 search box
So essentially when the Product Manager of Internet Explorer at Microsoft tells you how scary Chrome is when it comes to security he is being deceptive because he is comparing apples to oranges .
When you perform keyword search both on IE8 and Chrome ( or any other browser ) , they all behave the same way .
Selective Misinformation # 2 :
In the second part of the video , Pete mentions about InPrivate browsing on Microsoft and how it protects you by not storing any information on browser cache , but absolutely fails to mention that Chrome also comes with a Private browsing mode called Incognito .
The Truth :
When you are making a video comparing privacy and security features of one browser with another its only fair to do the same in all instances .
Private browsing was first introduced by Safari in 2005 , Google Chrome did it 2 months after its initial release in December 2008 .
IE8 released private browsing mode in March 2009 , 2 months after Chrome officially released it .
Yet Pete forget to mention this important bit .
As if , private browsing is something that is only available on IE8 .
Exhibition 3 : Late in the party , but just as loud .
Conclusion :
So this is what we have come down to with Microsoft .
Instead of innovating with new features and adhering to industry standards they are relying on spreading misinformation about the new popular kid in the browser town .
They have done it with Firefox and now they are doing it with Chrome .
Deception , misinformation and stagnating the industry with closed development and ignoring standards is the only way they know how to play the game .
I had some hopes for them when they showcased some of the improvements they are working on with IE9 and it seemed that they are slowly implementing industry standards in to their rendering engine .
But today Microsoft reminded us again how they play the game .
With Microsoft , its business as usual .
Over the last decade , Valve 's reputation and sales numbers have grown by leaps and bounds .
Franchises like Left 4 Dead and Portal have been introduced to fantastic critical and commercial reaction , resulting in the company as a whole growing in size .
As such , they started to outgrow their 38,000 sq. ft. studio in Bellevue , Washington .
This month , the entire studio packed up and moved down the road a bit to a brand - new location that will be almost three times as big when it 's all said and done .
Check out our video below to see the old studio pre-move , the new studio under construction , and finally , the finished product .
Be sure to check out the hub page for all of this month 's coverage of Portal 2 .
Of all the memes birthed by Portal , those involving the cake are easily the most infamous .
‚Äú The cake is a lie , ‚Äù has become a password to an elite club of sorts ‚Äì a sign of kinship amongst those who enjoyed Valve ‚Äôs critical darling .
When chatting with Portal 2 ‚Äôs writing team it became obvious that they wo n‚Äôt be resting on their comedic laurels ‚Äì meaning , do n‚Äôt expect the same jokes to be recycled .
We ‚Äôre sure you 're ready for some new one - liners , anyway .
So despite the fact that the cake may , in fact , be a lie , we could n‚Äôt resist the chance to pay tribute to it as our month of Portal 2 coverage draws to a close .
Valve did n't go through any kind of rigorous cake tasting process or hold a cake survivor contest in order to determine which delicacy would make it into the game , it merely picked the best looking confection from a caf√© near the company 's headquarters .
( The infamous cake .
Confirmed as delicious and moist . )
Since we were already in Redmond we took the opportunity to visit the nondescript bakery / Chinese caf√© responsible for inspiring the team .
While there , we tried a piece of the cake for ourselves and interviewed an unsuspecting employee to see if they were aware that their establishment had played an important role in creating the iconic meme .
You can read her conversation with GI 's own Ben Reeves below .
Ben Reeves :
First of all what 's the name of this restaurant ?
Jane : The Regent Bakery & Caf√©
Reeves :
And what do you guys specialize in ?
Jane : Cakes , buns , food ‚Äì we serve food .
And we have bubble tea .
Reeves : Bubble tea like ‚Äì
Jane : Yeah , we have bubble tea , like with the little black things .
Reeves :
So this is the official cake from Portal .
How do you guys feel having a cake in a game ?
Jane :
We were surprised .
We did n't know we had a cake in a game and then people came in and told us , ‚Äú Did you guys know your cake is in a game ? ‚Äù and we were like , ‚Äú What are you talking about ? ‚Äù
So then Steve [ the manager ] and some of the other guys started to look online and saw what was going on .
But we did n't know until people told us .
Reeves :
What kind of cake is this ?
Jane : This is a Black Forest cake .
Reeves :
How would you describe it ?
Jane :
A layer of chocolate cake with cherry cream inside , then another layer of chocolate cake .
Reeves :
So you would say it 's delicious and moist ?
Jane :
Yes , again it 's one of our more popular cakes
Reeves :
So then is the cake a lie ?
Jane : Huh ?
Reeves :
Is the cake a lie ?
Jane : ( confused ) No .
Since the bulk of you probably are n‚Äôt able to make the pilgrimage out to Redmond to try a slice for yourself , we ‚Äôve dug up a recipe that you can prepare at your leisure .
True , you can use the Easter Egg version hidden in lines of binary code , but that recipe calls for extra garnishes such as dirt , solid waste , ethyl benzene , and an assortment of fish - shaped artifacts .
Click on the image below for the full sized version , which you can print and share as desired .
Now you ‚Äôve got the perfect treat next time you have cause for celebration .
Enjoy !

Please donate here to send Bart Stupak a message !
Stupak has put his personal opinion on women 's rights ahead of everything else in the fight to reform health care and it 's sickening to me .
I understand that we all have a certain belief system , but he was undermining HCR way before the Senate even released their bill and that told me that he cared more for a single religious issue over the health of real working class families in America .
He relished the role of representing the party of the Catholic Bishops instead of being a Democratic politician .
Bart Stupak , a representative from Michigan , proudly states that Catholic bishops worked closely with him to help him and Joe Pitts , a Republican from Pennsylvania , draft an amendment proposing tight restrictions that prevent any insurance plan purchased with government subsidies from covering abortion .
Lisa Miller of Newsweek reports in the March 15 issue that Stupak told her that the " bishops were very , very , very engaged " in framing the amendment .
He went on to say that the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops " was working with my staff " and that " we had to coordinate forces " with the bishops and that he told the bishops , " I 'm not moving forward until you know what I 'm doing .
I 've had it and I 'm glad Connie is running against Stupak as a primary challenger no matter what happens .
Howie Klein :
It 's better not to let your emotions get in the way of real life political decisions .
But yesterday when I read that former Charlevoix County commissioner Connie Saltonstall had jumped into the primary race against anti-Choice fanatic Bart Stupak , I was on the phone to her within minutes .
Pro-choice and pro-healthcare reform , hardheaded and hardworking , we were happy to get her right up on the Blue America Sending Democrats A Message page .
And I was also happy pulling out my credit card and making a donation to the very tough campaign she 's taking on .
Stupak has successfully painted himself as a Democratic populist and justifies his anti-Choice mania with a veneer of sanctimonious moralism .
His overall voting record is n't nearly as populist or progressive as he attempts to portray it .
According to Progressive Punch he 's been with the Democrats only 66.15 % of the time on the tough closely contested votes where he 's been most needed .
Since Obama was elected he's been the 159th most progressive Democrat , a pretty mediocre record but one that the district has been satisfied with .
Connie has a great deal of sympathy in the district when she says that although Stupak " has a right to his personal , religious views ... to deprive his constituents of needed health care reform because of those views is reprehensible . "
" As a realist I know that defeating an incumbent is difficult , " Saltonstall told CNN .
" But I also know that there are many past supporters who have told me they have voted for Bart in every single election and they 'll never vote for him again .
It will be a lot of hard work , it will be a serious challenge , but we 're going to try because the voters of this district deserve a choice . "
Please , help us send the Democrats -- and conservatives -- a message , in this case , that their religious beliefs should not be imposed on the general public .
Do it here at ActBlue .
Listening to the TV talking heads discuss Stupak and Ben Nelson 's opinion on a women 's right to choose is very upsetting .
They talk as if a women 's right to choose is some icky - worthless issue and there comes a point when enough is enough .

The VW Touareg Hybrid is due for a North American release this fall , the hybrid SUV is set to target , perhaps surprisingly , the Porsche Cayenne market with an initial price tag of around $ 100,000 USD .
The hybrid uses a 38 Kw electric motor positioned between the gasoline engine and the 8 speed automatic transmission , offering electric drive mode , dual power mode and regenerative braking .
There has been some talk about the relatively high cost and mediocre fuel economy offered by the hybrid Touareg , 26 mpg does n‚Äôt really cut it for a hybrid , even a big SUV like this , and a price tag of close to $ 100,000 USD is just too much for a huge swathe of the population .
VW also , somewhat questionably , chose to use nickel metal hydride batteries in the hybrid , we ca n‚Äôt figure that one out as lithium - ion is better by far in every respect .
It ‚Äôs also worth asking if the VW name can compete with names like Range Rover , Porsche and Lexus in the luxury end of the SUV market , our initial impression is that it ca n‚Äôt and we might see the Touareg go down a similar path to the VW Phaeton , which lasted 3 years in the US market before being withdrawn due to pitiful sales .
The technology that VW has designed to use in the Touareg is destined to begin a slow roll out into their other models , even the venerable VW Golf will be getting a hybrid makeover next year , it is good to see huge manufacturers like VW dipping their toe into the electric / gasoline hybrid pool but realistically , we ‚Äôll need to see full plug - in capabilities , a decent battery only range , a much lower price and a big bump in fuel economy before giving the Touareg or any other SUV hybrid a thumbs up .

Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid Press Release
BlueMotionTechnologies ‚Äì Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid
Prototype : Touareg Hybrid with new V6 TSI can tow 3.5 metric tons
Charged V6 TSI and E - motor drive fuel consumption below 9 liters
Hybrid module was integrated between V6 TSI and 8 - speed automatic
Wolfsburg , 02 February 2009
In parallel to pure gasoline and diesel versions , Volkswagen will be bringing the next version of the Touareg to market as a hybrid version too .
Average fuel consumption : less than 9.0 liters fuel per 100 kilometers .
CO2 emissions : less than 210 g/ km .
For the first time , there is now a near - production prototype that offers initial glimpses of the full hybrid technology that will be implemented on the future Touareg .
This experimental platform has its conceptual basis in the current generation of the SUV .
The car ‚Äôs powertrain already embodies many aspects of the future Touareg Hybrid .
It will be powered by a new V6 TSI ‚Äì a highly advanced gasoline direct injection engine boosted by a mechanically - driven supercharger ‚Äì in tandem with an electric motor .
It will have a newly developed 8 - speed automatic transmission .
Volkswagen will be implementing a parallel hybrid drive on the future Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid .
This version of the SUV will have a high - performance , full - time all - wheel drive too .
V6 TSI stands for maximum power with minimum consumption
The V6 TSI on the Touareg prototype is fun to drive and delivers 245 kW / 333 PS at 5,500 rpm .
From its 2,995 cm3 displacement , it generates a maximum torque of 440 Newton - meters starting from 3,000 rpm .
These characteristics match those of the Touareg with an eight cylinder engine , yet with the V6 TSI it is significantly more fuel efficient .
This represents the principle of intelligent downsizing ( less displacement plus gasoline direct injection plus inlet boosting ) already established by Volkswagen on the globally successful TSI four cylinder engines , and it is now being applied to six - cylinder engines .
The results are convincing .
The substantial torque delivery that came from using a supercharger becomes even more fascinating with the addition of the E- motor , especially at low speeds .
If required , an exceptional amount of torque is available from a standstill ‚Äì a bonus that comes from a system that is designed for efficiency .
To increase further this efficiency , the V6 TSI makes use of a switchable engine water pump .
This remains off during the warm - up phase , ensuring rapid achievement of fuel efficient operation ..
The pump is integrated into the vehicle ‚Äôs overall heat management system .
V6 TSI plus E - motor drives fuel consumption below 9.0 liters
The E- motor integrated between the V6 TSI and the 8 - speed automatic transmission adds power of 38 kW / 52 PS and up to 300 Newton - meters torque .
In so - called boosting ‚Äì where requests for maximum power and torque ( by kickdown or gearshift selector in ‚Äú S ‚Äù position ) are supported by the engagement of both V6 TSI and electric drive systems ‚Äì the powertrain briefly supplies a power of 275 kW / 374 PS and the maximum available torque increases to 550 Newton - meters .
In this case , the Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid prototype accelerates to 100 km/h in just 6.8 seconds .
The hybrid system of the Touareg was not designed to deliver sports car performance .
Its purpose is to deliver very low emissions and fuel consumption values .
It may therefore come as a surprise to learn that this exceptional performance is accompanied by an average fuel consumption of less than 9.0 liters per 100 kilometers .
CO2 emissions are less than 210 g/ km .
The Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid will attain the limits of the Euro - 5 and American ULEV2 emissions standards .
More than 25 percent better fuel economy
Compared to a conventional SUV of the same size , the hybrid concept yields fuel savings of more than 25 percent in city driving .
Development engineers calculate an average savings of 17 percent in combined city , highway and freeway driving .
Essentially , there are four parameters with which the Volkswagen prototype achieves this improved fuel economy .
Start - stop system : an integrated start - stop system significantly reduces fuel consumption , especially in urban driving .
Regenerative braking : during braking , the E - motor operates as a generator and recovers energy , which is then stored in the high voltage battery ( NiMH batteries ) .
This means that the E - motor recovers a proportion of the energy that would otherwise be rejected in the form of heat through the braking system .
It comes into effect progressively during the initial travel of the brake pedal .
The E-motor :
The vehicle can operate on the electric motor alone at speeds of up to 50 km/h , which reduces fuel consumption in city driving .
In this case the V6 TSI is turned off , and it is disconnected from the transmission by a disengagement clutch .
In this condition the Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid operates with zero emissions .
Electric current flows from the battery to the E - motor via the power electronics which incorporates a pulse controlled inverter .
On the later production version , there are also plans for a special E - switch that the driver can activate for pure electric driving .
Coasting : as soon as the driver removes his or her foot from the gas pedal , a clutch disengages the V6 TSI from the transmission .
This is even possible at higher speeds ‚Äì in the later production version up to about 160 km/h ‚Äì and therefore in freeway driving as well .
This eliminates mechanical drag losses , which in turn makes the Touareg coast significantly better .
The driver can convert this directly into improved fuel economy by adopting an anticipatory driving style .
Intelligent energy mix
With regard to powertrain types ‚Äì and their associated energy flows ‚Äì besides electric driving and coasting there are two other operating modes : classic driving with internal combustion engine and the boosting that is typical of hybrid vehicles .
When driving with just the internal combustion engine , there are two possible modes of operation .
In the first case , the Touareg is driven like a conventional vehicle with the E- motor performing the function of a conventional 12 V alternator , which it replaces , to supply sufficient energy for the vehicle ‚Äôs electrical system and maintain battery charge ( in this case a high voltage battery ) .
In the second case , the engine supplies the energy needed to propel the vehicle plus the energy needed to charge the high voltage battery via the E- motor , but at a higher rate , replacing energy taken from battery when in conditions when the E - motor has been operating as an electric motor .
This so - called load point shifting makes it possible to operate the engine at a more favorable level of efficiency in the engine load / speed map .
The job of hybrid control is now to regulate this alternation of electric driving phases and active charge phases to achieve minimal fuel consumption .
Boosting : when the driver consciously activates a request for maximum power ( kickdown or gearshift lever in ‚Äú S ‚Äù position ) , the E - motor supports the V6 TSI beyond the engine ‚Äôs full - load curve .
The powers and torques of these two motors are then transferred to the front and rear axles by the 8 - speed automatic transmission .
As previously mentioned , this briefly makes available a total combined power of up to 275 kW / 374 PS and a maximum torque of 550 Newton - meters .
In addition , since it can be controlled extremely quickly the E - motor is also used ‚Äì in the framework of so - called transient compensation ‚Äì to make positive and negative torque interventions .
For example , when the driver makes a positive load request the E - motor briefly boosts the V6 TSI until it has reached its steady - state target value .
This allows the Touareg Hybrid to keep accelerating .
Negative torque interventions largely replace classic interventions via the internal combustion engine that are not optimal for efficiency , but are needed for occupant comfort during gear shifting or sudden charge changes .
The specific mode that is activated is shown by an energy flow indicator in the display of the RNS 510 radio- navigation system installed in the prototype vehicle .
Basic technical layout of the hybrid drive
Volkswagen has chosen a parallel hybrid drive for use in the Touareg .
In contrast to other possible hybrid systems , both off - road properties and unlimited continuous climbing capabilities are assured .
With a maximum trailer load of up to 3.5 metric tons , the Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid can also be recommended as an ideal towing vehicle .
Furthermore , the parallel hybrid approach offers a higher level of efficiency than alterne hybrid concepts in cross-country and freeway driving .
The powertrain itself primarily consists of the V6 TSI , the 8 - speed automatic transmission that is also ideally suited for hybrid and tow vehicle use and the hybrid module integrated between the internal combustion engine and the automatic transmission .
The latter weighs 55 kilograms .
The compact module houses ‚Äì in one unit ‚Äì the disengagement clutch located after the V6 engine and the E-motor .
The interplay of components is ‚Äú directed ‚Äù by a hybrid manager .
This multi-functional unit is integrated in the engine controller and communicates via the CAN bus lines with units such as the automatic transmission , high voltage battery and so - called power electronics that controls the electric motor .
The latter also manages the energy flow between the electric motor and battery .
Using the DC / DC converter , the power electronics also ensures that the car ‚Äôs 12V electrical system is supplied via the E - motor or the high voltage battery .
Depending on the charge state of the battery ( capacity : 6 Ah ) , vehicle speed and other vehicle - specific parameters , the hybrid manager automatically selects the ideal operating mode based on lightning fast analysis of all signals .
Nickel metal hydride battery in detail
The nickel metal - hydride battery used in the Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid reflects what is currently the best and most practical electric storage system for automobiles .
Functional safety , robustness and cost are all factors that favor the high - performance NiMH battery .
The battery is located in a space saving area .
On the prototype the cargo floor has been raised by 50 millimeters .
The battery weighs 67 kilograms , consists of a total of 240 individual cells and therefore generates a voltage of 288 Volt .
An additional duct integrated in the Touareg ‚Äôs interior ventilation system and two separate fans are used to keep the battery within an optimal temperature range .
A battery manager continually monitors battery charge by coordinating data with the hybrid manager integrated in the engine controller .
Special power cables connect the battery to the power electronics ‚Äì located to the left of the engine in the front of the vehicle ‚Äì to supply the E - motor with energy or ‚Äì in the reverse case ‚Äì to charge the battery by E - motor while it acts as a generator when braking ( regenerative braking ) or by the V6 TSI ( via load point shift ) .
In the event of a crash , the high voltage battery is protected by what is known as a ‚Äú Protect Box ‚Äù .
The battery system , which includes the Protect Box , battery and ventilation components , weighs 79 kilograms .
Partial compensation for added weight of hybrid system
To compensate for a portion of the weight of the hybrid components ( about 175 kilograms ) , the prototype exhibits numerous modifications compared to the production vehicle .
One example is the full - time 4 XMotion all - wheel drive .
In today ‚Äôs Touareg , the drive is transferred to the front and rear axles via a transfer box which contains a lockable central differential and a two - speed range gearbox .
On the Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid this is replaced by a lighter Torsen differential similar to the one Audi uses on the Q7 .
All the traditional capabilities of the Touareg are fully preserved , such as its optimal properties as a towing vehicle .
Other changes compared to the production Touareg
Various components have been redeveloped to retain all the traditional convenience and safety - related functions of the standard Touareg in the Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid .
For example , the prototype has electro - hydraulic power steering , which does not have to rely on a servo pump driven by the internal combustion engine .
In addition , a high voltage air conditioning compressor guarantees comfortable interior temperatures on the Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid , even when the V6 engine is switched off .
Instead of an alternator , the DC / DC converter integrated in the power electronics ensures a constant supply of power to the vehicle electrical system .
The 8 - speed automatic transmission was also specifically tuned for hybrid use .
Among other things , it received a special torque converter with larger lock - up system , an auxiliary electric oil pump ( to maintain a supply of oil when the V6 TSI is switched off ) , a transmission heater to reach optimal operating temperature faster , and a modified transmission controller .
Car is started by electric motor
The E - motor now takes over the role of engine starter motor .
This job is especially challenging , since restarting of the V6 TSI must be executed with a high degree of smoothness and precision to maintain comfortable transitions between the various modes of propulsion .
As soon as the engine is to be restarted , the transmission ‚Äôs lock - up torque converter is put in the ‚Äú Slip ‚Äù position and the E - motor ‚Äôs speed is increased to a setpoint value prescribed by the transmission controller .
Only then does the engine controller receive an enable to actuate the disengagement clutch .
The E - motor ‚Äú drags up ‚Äù the V6 TSI by subsequent engagement of the clutch and , as soon as the cylinders fill , the engine is started by enabling of injection and ignition .
The E - motor ‚Äôs torque is increased by the amount of the momentary torque transferred by the disengagement clutch during the drag operation and ‚Äì after the internal combustion engine has started ‚Äì it is reduced again in response to the increase in engine torque .
When positive engagement occurs at the disengagement clutch , the lock - up torque converter is engaged again .
All of this sounds complicated , and it is complicated , but the system operates in such a way that the driver and occupants are completely unaware of its contribution to smooth progress .
And that is just how things should be .

If you talk to employees at one of the US Governments nuclear facilities long enough , you ‚Äôre likely to hear a lot of interesting stories about the early days of dealing with nuclear materials .
One , apparently originating in Oak Ridge , TN , involves an underground tank and a tree .
Apparently during a regular check of the site some radioactive contamination was found in the ground near one of the storage tanks .
The area was promptly cleaned up , the soil carted away and replaced , but the people assigned to figure out how the ground became contaminated in the first place were stumped .
They found no leaks , no spills , nothing that could have caused the radioactive material to escape .
They checked over the spot for several months to see if the contamination recurred , which it did not , then finally shrugged and called it a mystery .
But a year later the contamination was back .
The second time was much like the first .
The clean - up went smoothly , the investigation did not .
It was not until the third time the same contamination recurred in the same place that the investigators found the culprit ‚Äì an oak tree .
The tree had sunk its roots into the tank , and was pulling up contaminated material .
While one would expect the whole tree to become radioactive , that was n‚Äôt the case .
Instead the oak preferentially shunted the contaminants to its leaves .
Every fall a new crop of radioactive leaves would hit the ground to mystify the workers at Oak Ridge , and every winter while they were investigating , there would be no sign of anything amiss with the tree .
It ‚Äôs an amusing story , but the ability of that tree has become a major weapon in the efforts to clean up contaminated soil .
You see , trees are n‚Äôt the only plants that can pull contaminants from the ground .
There are a slew of others that can do it too , and they are becoming more and more valuable in places where the ground has become polluted or contaminated .
The process is called phytoextraction , and it ‚Äôs one of a number of ways ecologists are beginning to use plants in bioremediation ‚Äì the treatment of environmental problems .
There are plants that can pull lead , uranium , arsenic , and any number of other contaminants out of the soil .
They can then be harvested , a new crop planted , and the process repeated until the soil is sufficiently recovered .
The process has already been used with great success .
At Chernobyl , genetically altered sunflowers have been used to clean up two ponds heavily contaminated with both cesium and strontium , while hemp plants are being used to clean up the soil .
Various companies and institutions are beginning to jump on the bandwagon .
Dr. Ilya Raskin of Rutger ‚Äôs University , one of the field ‚Äôs pioneers , has been working with members of the Brassica family ( mustards ) , which tests have shown effective at removing a number of heavy metals .
Dupont has found corn useful for lead , while Phytokinetics , a company in Ohio , is using trees to clean up deeper soil contamination .
All in all , the field of phytoextraction seems to be one of the most promising in the efforts to clean up the hundreds of thousands of sites worldwide ( 30,000 in the US alone , according to the EPA ) , that require hazardous waste treatment .
Even if only modestly successful , the use of plants as contaminant removers could reduce cleanup costs considerably .
Even more promising , phytoextraction is only one aspect of the whole field of phytoremediation , in which plants are being used not only to remove toxins , but sometimes to break them down ( phytotransformation ) , enhance microbial activity ( phytostimulation ) , or prevent leaching of contaminants in the first place ( phytostabalization ) .
Perhaps if they had known where it would lead , the site workers at Oak Ridge might have been less frustrated when they finally found their answer .
