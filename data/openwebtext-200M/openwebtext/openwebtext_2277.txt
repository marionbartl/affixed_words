Gold prices plummeted to 8 - month lows on Tuesday as the dollar ’s rally triggered a massive sell - off , hitting oil and industrial metals as well .
Spot gold touched $ 801.90 an ounce , its lowest level since late December , and was at $ 816.50/817.45 at 1433 GMT compared with $ 819.25/820.85 late in New York on Monday .
The precious metal is down more than 20 per cent since hitting a record high of $ 1,030.80 on March 17 .
“ The speed and severity of the dollar ’s run higher has resulted in some long liquidation , ” said Daniel Hynes , analyst at Merrill Lynch .
“ At the moment it is hard to see an end to it , but we still have some supportive factors such as inflation , geopolitical tensions and falling mine supply . ”
Prices of the metal attempted a recovery earlier on Tuesday after the dollar slipped on profit - taking .
Also under heavy selling pressure was industrial metal platinum used to make autocatalysts .
Investors have been selling their holdings on concern about falling demand from car makers .
The bulk of the world ’s platinum is used by automakers in autocatalyst systems that scrub exhaust fumes of dangerous and environmentally damaging chemicals .
Spot platinum fell to $ US1,462.50 an ounce , the lowest since the middle of December , and was last at $ US1,492/1,512 from $ US1,517/1,537 an ounce on Monday .

However , the dollar was still hovering near a 6 - month high against a basket of major currencies as investors looked beyond US growth worries to a slowing global economy .
A stronger US currency makes commodities priced in dollars more expensive for holders of other currencies .
Oil hit $ 112.48 a barrel , the lowest since early May as the market focused on events in currency markets and the International Energy Agency predicted higher supplies .
“ It looks like sentiment towards gold has turned negative , we ’re seeing long liquidation on the back of both dollar movement and the oil price movement , ” said Suki Cooper , analyst at Barclays Capital .
Propaganda is probably too light of a term to describe this piece of propaganda .
We 're referring to an educational comic strip ( fat .pdf ) on unlawful file sharing of music developed by judges and professors to teach students about the law and the courtroom experience .
It was produced by the National Center for State Courts , a nonprofit describing itself as an " organization dedicated to improving the administration of justice by providing leadership and service to court systems in the United States . "
But the story line here is a miscarriage of justice at best – even erroneously describing file sharing as a city crime punishable by up to two years in prison .
What 's more , the organization said Thursday , it has distributed some 50,000 copies of the 24 - page leaflet to students across the United States .
Threat Level 's sister blog , the Underwire , wrote about the leaflet 's debut in October .
" The Case of Internet Piracy , " however , reads like the Recording Industry Association of America 's public relations playbook : Download some songs , go to jail and lose your scholarship .
Along the way , musicians will file onto the bread lines .
" The purpose is basically to educate kids – middle school and high school - aged about how the justice system operates and about what really goes on in the courtroom as opposed to what you see on television , " said Lorri Montgomery , the center 's communications director .
The center just published its second educational leaflet , " The Case of Stolen Identity , " Montgomery said .
The piracy story has two plots .
One is of the file sharer 's grandmother fighting eminent domain proceedings to keep her house while Megan the criminal file sharer deals with the charges against her .
The story is simple : Megan learns to download music from a friend .
About 2,000 downloads and three months later , a police officer from the fictitious City of Arbor knocks on her door and hands her a criminal summons to appear in court .
All the while , her grandmother is trying to save her house from the city that wants to pave it over .
When the grandmother gets home from a day in court ( she eventually beats the city and keeps her house ) the criminal Megan is crying .
" Oh , Nana .
What have I done ?
I 've ruined everything , " she said .
" I 'll lose my scholarship .
I know I will . "
The two embrace .
" Hush now .
We will find a way to get through this .
I promise , " the grandmother tells her granddaughter , whose parents were killed in a traffic accident 12 years before .
To the criminal courtroom we go …
In the case of Megan Robbins , " Criminal Case Number 67589B , " a city prosecutor urges the maximum two - year sentence after Robbins pleads guilty .
The city appoints her a public defender .
( Criminal copyright infringement is when somebody sells pirated works and not sharing on a peer - to - peer network .
And it ’s the federal government , not local cities which prosecute the criminal cases . )
The local prosecutor , Terry Williams , tells the judge that the defendant " is charged with theft , at the state level " and adds that the girl faces " stiff penalties – up to two years in jail and $ 25,000 in fines . "
" Many consider downloading music without paying for it to be a victimless crime , but nothing could be further from the truth , " the prosecutor says .
The prosecution added that " Her conviction sends a message that illegally downloading music is a crime , and anyone involved will be held accountable . "
The criminal is handed a three - month suspended sentence and 200 hours of public service .
The bigger crime is this leaflet .

The settlements show an advanced level of planning A remote area of the Amazon river basin was once home to densely populated towns , Science journal reports .
The Upper Xingu , in west Brazil , was once thought to be virgin forest , but in fact shows traces of extensive human activity .
Researchers found evidence of a grid - like pattern of settlements connected by road networks and arranged around large central plazas .
There are signs of farming , wetland management , and possibly fish farms .
The settlements are now almost completely overgrown by rainforest .
The ancient urban communities date back to before the first Europeans set foot in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon in the 15th Century .
Urban planning Professor Mike Heckenberger , from the University of Florida , in Gainesville , said : " These are not cities , but this is urbanism , built around towns . "
" They have quite remarkable planning and self - organisation , more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism , " he said .
Although the remains are almost invisible , they can be identified by members of the Kuikuro tribe , who are thought to be direct descendents of the people who built the towns .
The tell - tale traces included " dark earth " that indicated past human waste dumps or farming , and concentrations of pottery shards and earthworks .
The researchers also made use of satellite images and GPS navigation to uncover and map the settlements over the course of a decade .
The communities consisted of clusters of 60 - hectare ( 150 - acre ) towns and smaller villages spread out over the rainforest .
Road network Like medieval European and ancient Greek towns , those forming the Amazonian urban landscape were surrounded by large walls .
These were composed of earthworks , the remains of which have survived .
In modern settlements , dams are used to funnel fish into weirs Each community had an identical road , always pointing north - east to south - west , which are connected to a central plaza .
The roads were always oriented this way in keeping with the mid-year summer solstice .
Evidence was found of dams and artificial ponds - thought to have been used for fish farming - as well as open areas and large compost heaps .
The people who once lived in the settlements are thought to have been wiped out by European colonists and the diseases they brought with them .

What are these ?
Click to viewLong the well of gadget blog content , the FCC website is chock - full of unannounced gear ripe for the plucking .
Finding these gadgets is a simple process , but for many , knowing where to begin is a difficult task .
We 've decided to throw together this how - to guide so you can find your own treasure chest of undiscovered gadgets ... just like the pros !
Advertisement
The Search Page
Advertisement
The first step is knowing when and where to look .
New FCC entries pop up every day of the week , but Thursdays seem to be the best day for new stuff .
The page you want to search is the Electronic Authorization System .
If you click the Search link on the top of the FCC home page , then choose FCC ID Search ( or just click the link above ) , it will take you to the form that runs through the test files for all pending electronics .
All the entry fields may look intimidating at first , but getting through this is surprisingly simple .
Here are the fields you should pay attention to :
Grantee Code
Every company has a three - character code under which all their filings appear .
While knowing this code is not mandatory , it is an easier way to bring up search results .
Here 's a quick list of codes for the hottest or most innovative companies :
• Apple – BCG
• Nokia – PYA
• Samsung – A3L
• Sony – AK8
• Sony Ericsson – PY7
• Nintendo – BKE
• LG – BEJ
• Microsoft – C3K
Applicant Name
This is where you list the company whose gadgets you 're searching for .
Generally , using a term such as Sony , Apple , Microsoft , etc... , will bring up the results you want .
But if you feel like you are n't getting the gadgets you think should be there , try getting more specific ( i.e. Sony Ericsson ) , or using the Grantee code .
Sometimes a company will have its products listed under the name of another company .
In 2006 Nintendo passed a pair of black and pink Wiimotes through the FCC using the company names Mitsumi Electric and Foxconn Technology , respectively .
And if you are n't looking for a specific company , just leave it blank .
In our example , we selected Samsung .
Grant Date Range
This field is arguably the most important .
Without entering a date , your results will come back in a mess with dates spanning a decade or more .
When I scour for products in general , I search across a date range of about a week .
This will return about 150 to 250 results , many of which are the same gadget listed multiple times .
If I 'm searching for a company , I search across a time span of a month , which again gives me plenty of results to work with , without overwhelming the mind .
Here , we 're searching between
01/15/2008 and 01/22/2008 .

Product Description
This is the last field worth paying attention to while searching the FCC .
Here you can use terms like computer , phone , networking etc. , to narrow down your search to a specific category of electronics .
I found the colored Wiimotes mentioned earlier by entering " wii " in the product description and searching between a date range of 2003 and 2007 .
Now you 're ready to hit the search button ( to prevent tedium , be sure to view more than 10 results at a time ) .
You 've got your results , but what do they all mean ?

The Results
Advertisement
Things to pay attention to on the Search Results page are company name and FCC ID .
Sometimes the FCC ID wlll contain a model number , sometimes it wo n't .
But it helps to identify which entries are repeats on the results page ( each gadget has a unique FCC ID ) .
Once you find a result that piques your interest , hit the link that says details to bring up the product page .
We 're going to select the entry with the FCC ID " A3LSCX4300 " ( aka the SCX - 4300 Printer ) .
The Details

Key links on the OET Exhibits page are Test Report , External Photos , and FCC Label ID .
Test Report may include info about the model number and specific functions of the gadget in question .
External Photos will offer up some " spy shots . "
And if all else fails , the FCC Label ID link might offer an outlined sketch of what a gadget looks like e.g. Sony Mylo 2 ) .

But this is just a starting point .
You may find more nuanced ways to glean the results you want from the FCC search page .
We hope you do .

Interview
STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS : J.J. Abrams Confirms Bad Klingons
It is a real wonder that J.J. Abrams , director of the upcoming Star Trek Into Darkness ...
This is the last reaction clip we ’re going to post tonight .
It ’s Alex Castellanos ’ response on CNN .
To understand the significance , you ’ve got to know a bit about who Castellanos is — a longtime , street - fighting Republican political consultant with a reputation that compares to Lee Atwater ’s in terms hard - edged political warfare .
I believe he ’s also informally working with the McCain campaign this cycle , as a sort of outside advisor .
Chuck Todd said below he thought Obama ’s speech had left the McCain camp speechless .
My own take was that the tone of the statement from the McCain campaign was like someone who’d had the wind knocked out of them .
In that context , Castellanos ’ response was very telling .
He made no attempt to put the speech in any positive context for McCain .
Midway through this clip he sounds like an Obama surrogate .
And he concludes by saying that “ whoever did n’t get picked for Republican VP today may be a lucky Republican . ”
In case , you ’re tuning in late , here ’s my initial reaction .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas held a hastily arranged meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jerusalem on Sunday ahead of a tour that will take him to Moscow and Washington .
There was little sign of movement in the peace negotiations the two leaders began under the auspices of President George W. Bush , who will meet Abbas at the White House around April 24 before himself visiting Israel early next month .
Officials said the Abbas - Olmert meeting , their second in less than a week , was arranged in haste to allow discussion before Abbas begins his tour .
An aide to Abbas , Saeb Erekat , told reporters afterwards that the two had reviewed the state of negotiations .
Abbas also urged Olmert to cooperate with Egyptian efforts to consolidate a shaky truce in the Gaza Strip between Israeli forces and Islamist militants from Hamas .
Though Abbas ’s secular Fatah movement has been deeply at odds with Hamas since the Islamists seized control of the enclave last year , Erekat said he wanted to avoid a “ humanitarian disaster ” .
Aides to Olmert declined official comment .
One senior Israeli official said only that the talks were “ serious ” .
An Israeli official said Olmert wanted to “ increase the level of cooperation and coordination before Abbas visits Washington ” .
A senior Abbas aide said he believed Olmert wanted to try to improve the mood around the negotiations after a less than positive meeting last week .
DIFFERENCES
Negotiations on issues at the heart of the conflict have shown little outward sign of progress since talks were renewed at a U.S. - hosted conference in Annapolis , Maryland , in November .
The negotiations have been bogged down by differences over Israeli West Bank settlement building and violence in Gaza .
Both sides are trying to meet a U.S. goal of a deal on Palestinian statehood before Bush leaves office in January , but differences remain over what that accord might entail .
Erekat said after the last Abbas - Olmert meeting that differences ran “ very deep ” over building in Jewish settlements , especially around Jerusalem .
Israeli officials said the leaders had agreed not to let that disrupt the negotiations .
Abbas last month briefly suspended the talks after an Israeli offensive killed more than 120 people in Gaza .
Israel said it was responding to rockets fired into its territory .

Two Hamas militants were killed in Gaza on Sunday by an explosion that residents said may have been accidental .
In the West Bank , the governor of Nablus , a close Abbas confidant , was attacked by gunmen whom officials said belonged to the Islamic Jihad group .
Jamal al - Mouhsen was not hurt , but his car was torched and he had to be escorted to safety .
Gaza ’s 1.5 million people were still short of fuel on Sunday , four days after militants attacked the terminal in Israel from which fuel is pumped to Gaza .
Western officials confirmed Israeli statements that some two days ’ supply of gasoline and diesel were lying untapped in tanks in Gaza .
Hamas said Israel was causing a fuel crisis , while Israel accuses the Islamists of engineering shortages .
Palestinian fuel distributors said they were on strike in protest at Israeli limits on their imports of fuel , and denied any Hamas role .

GORI , Georgia ( AP ) – Fighting raged in South Ossetia for a second day Saturday as Russia sent hundreds of tanks and troops into the separatist province and dropped bombs on Georgia that left scores of civilians dead or wounded .
Georgia , a staunch U.S. ally , launched a major offensive Friday to retake control of breakaway South Ossetia .
Russia , which has close ties to the province and posts peacekeepers there , responded by sending in armed convoys and military combat aircraft .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters in Moscow that some 1,500 people have been killed , with the death toll rising Saturday .
The figure could not be independently confirmed , but witnesses who fled the fighting said hundreds of civilians had probably died .
They said most of the provincial capital , Tskhinvali , was in ruins , with bodies lying everywhere .

When two unrelated human feet washed up on the beaches of two small islands north of Vancouver in six days last August , a police spokesman said the odds of it happening were a million to one .
This week the number of feet found rose to five .
What 's going on ?
Police in British Columbia are confounded , saying they have never seen a case like it .
The feet have all been recovered along the shorelines of the Strait of Georgia , which lies to the south and west of Vancouver .
They were all encased in trainers , and most are right feet .
Police say they have found no evidence of the feet being severed and that it is not clear whether a crime has been committed .
DNA has been collected from some of them , but police say that there has been no match to anyone on their missing persons database .
The unusual nature of the case has prompted much amateur speculation about murder mysteries , links to organised crime or to the 2004 Asian tsunami .
Local origin
The fact that they are being found repeatedly along the same stretch means they have to have come from roughly the same source
Dr Simon Boxall Experts initially speculated that the feet could have drifted more than 1,500 miles .
However , as the number has risen , estimates of the distance travelled have fallen .
Curtis Ebbesmeyer , a Seattle - based oceanographer who specialises in how things float on the ocean 's currents has dismissed any connection with the Asian tsunami , on the grounds that the distance is just too vast .
He has suggested that the feet could be a result of a possible accident along the Fraser River , which washed down and spread out along the Strait of Georgia .
Dr Simon Boxall , an oceanographer from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton in the UK , agrees that the feet are unlikely to have travelled far .
Why feet ?
" The fact that they are being found repeatedly along the same stretch means they have to have come from roughly the same source , and that source is likely to be local , " he told the BBC News website .
Experts say trainers could have preserved the feet
He added that because of the way objects are dispersed by ocean currents , the odds are very low of five feet that originated hundreds of miles away ending up in one relatively small area .
If , for example , they had travelled from as far away as Hawaii , there would have to have been thousands in the first place for so many to turn up in one area , he said .
In his view , it 's a coincidence that most of the feet are right feet , as there is no reason why right and left feet should float in different ways .
And why is it that just feet have been found ?
Mr Ebbesmeyer was quoted in the Vancouver Sun as saying that when bodies decompose , they break into 10 pieces , two arms , two legs , two feet , two hands , the head and the torso .
Experts say that it 's the running shoes that explain why only the feet are turning up .
They would have helped keep the decomposing feet intact , and protect them from fish .
The soles would also have helped them float , allowing them to be swept away from the rest of the body .
Plane crash
This might take a long time .
This is not CSI
Delta Police Constable Sharlene Brooks
Police have said it is possible the feet come from the passengers aboard a small plane which crashed into the water in the region several years ago - their bodies were never recovered .
The Coroners Service of British Columbia has investigated this idea but to date , it has failed to match DNA samples collected from members of the crash victims ' families with DNA obtained from some of the mystery feet .
Dr Joseph Finley , a physical scientist and retired special agent with the FBI , told Canada 's National Post newspaper that depending on the race of the victims , the feet might belong to stowaways who hid on commercial ships heading for Alaska .
Dr Boxall acknowledges that forensic scientists working to recover DNA profiles from feet could have an extremely difficult task on their hands .
Even if the remains are identified , scientists may not be able to determine how and when the victims died .
" Seawater can be horrendous , " he says .
" It can corrode very quickly or , bizarrely , it can preserve things quite well - it depends on how much biological activity there is at the time . "
Dr Gail Anderson , a specialist in decomposition at the Simon Fraser University was quoted in the New Scientist as saying that we " know next to nothing about what happens to bodies under water " but she added that feet normally come apart from legs .
Flesh immersed in water turns into adipocere tissue , she says , a soap - like substance , that no microbes or scavengers such as crabs will eat .
It is likely the case will remain a mystery for some time .
As one investigator put it this week , this is not CSI - a reference to popular fictional TV show in which challenging forensic cases are solved in no time .

Enlarge Department of Defense via AP Omar Khadr is shown in an interrogation room at the Guatanamo U.S. Naval Base prison while being questioned by members of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service .
TORONTO ( AP ) 
In a video released Tuesday , a 16 - year - old captured in Afghanistan cries out for his mother and says he needs treatment for his battle wounds during questioning by Canadian officials at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay .
" Oh Mommy , " he cries in despair in Arabic when he is alone in the room , watched only by hidden cameras .
The 10 minutes of video — selected by Omar Khadr 's Canadian lawyers from more than seven hours of footage recorded by a camera hidden in a vent — shows Khadr weeping , his face buried in his hands , as he is questioned by Canadian intelligence agents over four days in 2003 .
The lawyers hope to pressure Canada into seeking Khadr 's return .
VIDEO : Video of Guantanamo interrogation
The video , created by U.S. government agents at the prison in Cuba and originally marked as secret , provides insight into the effects of prolonged interrogation and detention on the Guantanamo prisoner .
A Canadian Security Intelligence Services agent in the video grills Khadr about events leading up to his capture as an enemy combatant when he was 15 .
Khadr , a Canadian citizen , is accused of throwing a grenade that killed one U.S. Special Forces soldier and blinded another during a 2002 firefight in Afghanistan .
He was arrested after he was found in the rubble of a bombed - out compound — badly wounded and near death .
At one point in the interrogation , Khadr pulls off his orange prisoner shirt and shows the wounds he sustained in the firefight .
He complains he cannot move his arms and says he had not received proper medical attention , despite requests .
" They look like they 're healing well to me , " the agent says of the injuries .
" No , I 'm not .
You 're not here ( at Guantanamo ) , " says Khadr , the son of an alleged al - Qaeda financier .
The agent later accuses Khadr of using his injuries and emotional state to avoid the interrogation .
" No , you do n't care about me , " Khadr says .
Khadr also tells his interrogator that he was tortured while at the U.S. military detention center at the Bagram air base in Afghanistan , where he was first detained after his arrest in 2002 .
Later on in the tape , a distraught Khadr is seen rocking , his face in his hands .
On the final day , the agent tells Khadr that he was " very disappointed " in Khadr 's behavior , and tries to impress upon him that he should cooperate .
Khadr says he wants to go back to Canada .
" There 's not anything I can do about that , " the agent says .
Navy Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler , Khadr's U.S. military lawyer , said the video shows " a frightened boy " who should be permitted to return to Canada .
He said Khadr is cooperative at the beginning of the four - day stretch of interviews , because " he believed that if he was cooperative and told them what he thought they wanted to hear that they would take him home . "
" So between Day One and Day Two he figures out that that is not going to happen and so you see a very emotional reaction on Day Two when this very scared 16 - year - old boy finally figures out that the Canadians are n't going to do anything for him and are going to leave him there .
He is devastated , " Kuebler said .
A Pentagon spokesman , Navy Cmdr. J.D. Gordon , denied that Khadr was mistreated .
" Our policy is to treat detainees humanely and Khadr has been treated humanely , " Gordon said .
The video was made by U.S. authorities and turned over to Khadr 's defense team , Gordon said .
The tapes are U.S. property .
A Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs report said Canadian official Jim Gould visited Khadr in 2004 and was told by the American military that the detainee was moved every three hours to different cells .
That technique , dubbed , " frequent flyer , " was one of at least two sleep deprivation programs the U.S. military used against Guantanamo prisoners .
Detainees were moved from cell to cell throughout the night to keep them awake and weaken their resistance to interrogation .
The document also says Khadr was placed in isolation for up to three weeks and then interviewed again and noted in an aside that at least one of his interrogators " seemed to be trying to intimidate ( Khadr ) or force ( him ) to talk rather than trying to cajole him into cooperation . "
" What you see in the video is a teenager begging for help and what you see is an interrogation that violates U.S. law and any international law concerning the rights of children , " said Wells Dixon , a lawyer for the New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights , which represents dozens of Guantanamo prisoners .
" If this is the way a teenager in Guantanamo has been treated , you can just imagine how anyone else has been treated . "
The Supreme Court of Canada in May ordered the Canadian government to hand over key evidence against Khadr to his legal team to allow a full defense of the U.S. charges against him , which include accusations by the U.S. that he spied for and provided material support to terrorists .
In June , a Canadian Federal Court judge ordered the Canadian government to release the video to the defense team after the court ruled the U.S. military 's treatment of Khadr broke human rights laws , including the Geneva Conventions .
The Canadian report indicates that Khadr , who was born in Canada and raised in Afghanistan , is questioned about his family , which has a long history of alleged involvement with radical Islamic causes .
His Egyptian - born father , Ahmed Said Khadr , and some of his brothers fought for al - Qaeda and had stayed with Osama bin Laden .
Khadr faces up to life in prison on U.S. charges that include murder for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed an American special forces soldier , Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer of Albuquerque During his last interrogation , according to the Canadian government report , Khadr is shown a picture of his family .
He denied knowing anyone shown , but when left alone with it later , he urinated on the photograph .
Gould later wrote a briefing note related to his visit stating he had met a " screwed up young man " whose trust had been abused by just about everyone who had ever been responsible for him — including his family and the U.S. military .
With the release of the video " We hope that the Canadian government will finally come to recognize that the so - called legal process that has been put in place to deal with Omar Khadr 's situation is grossly unfair and abusive , " said Nathan Whitling , one of Khadr 's lawyers .
" It 's not appropriate to simply allow this process to run its course . "
Canada 's Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper has maintained he will not seek Khadr 's return to Canada .
Government officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment Tuesday .
Khadr 's sister , Zaynab Khadr , who lives in Toronto , said she was pessimistic his situation would improve soon .
She noted that another brother , Abdullah Khadr , now in prison on terror charges in Canada awaiting extradition to the United States , was interrogated by Canadian agents despite having been abused in detention in Pakistan .
" He was tortured for their benefit and he still continues to be in jail and it has n't changed much , so I can't expect it to be any different in Guantanamo , " Zaynab Khadr said .

No , it 's not for comparing every quarterback in the NFL to Brett Favre , it 's actually an existing matter from one of his other business ventures .
Ron Jaworski has a ton of non-Football related ventures and one of those is apparently called Ron Jaworski Golf Management .
Well , the owner of Running Deer Golf Club in Elmer , New Jersey is taking Jaws to court and claiming that the MNF analyst deceived him and forced the club into bankruptcy .
From NJ.com ....
The suit depicts how the Monday Night Football broadcaster and motivational speaker convinced Carman in early 2008 " that he would never do anything to hurt ( them ) " and allow his family to continue operating the club .
" Jaworski intended ( Carman ) rely on representations of his good intentions , " according to Greiner .
" Carman believed that he was dealing with a future partner rather than someone hostile to his interests . "
Greiner said Jaworski offered at first to either enter into a near equal partnership so Carman could continue operating the club , or purchase the mortgage and resell it to Carman for a small profit .
Jaworski , 57 , the CEO of Ron Jaworski Golf Management of Blackwood , apparently reneged on his offer , instead opting for outright control by seeking to buy the mortgage from Sterling Bank for $ 3 million and make an unreachable proposal to Carman , according to the suit .
The mortgage package included the course and the Carman home , Greiner said .
Wow .
Now I know that someone with a handful of small businesses like Jaws often runs problems of this nature , but that reads pretty bad for the analyst .
Hopefully it was just a misunderstanding and that Jaworski was n't trying to snake his way to steal a man 's livelihood and home .
If any of you lawyers out there want to weigh - in , feel free to do so in the comments .

The chart above is from the recently released study " Given Half a Chance : The Schott 50 State Report on Public Education and Black Males . ''
From the report :
1 . The " good news " is that Detroit is one of the most successful school districts in the country at successfully getting black males to stay in school and graduate from high school at a higher rate than white males ( see chart above ) .
The bad news is that the high school graduation rate for black males in Detroit is only 20 % ( 1 out of 5 ) , and for white males only 17 % ( about 1 out of 6 ) .
2. Michigan ( 33 % ) is the worst state in the nation when it comes to graduating black male students from high school ( national average is 47 % ) , and Detroit Public Schools ( 20 % ) has the second - lowest rate for big-city school districts ( Indianapolis is lowest at 19 % ) .
The court was told that Rawson was meant to go to the woman 's home in Newark , Nottinghamshire , hold the knife to her throat , then bundle her into the boot of a car and take her to the woods .
Data from a recent study demonstrate the anti-inflammatory and pathogen protection benefits of Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 a probiotic bacterial strain of human origin .
Gastrointestinal benefits of probiotics have been well - documented , but more and more research is revealing that probiotic benefits extend to the entire body .
The report was published in the August issue of the Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) Pathogens .
The inflammatory response is a key part of the immune system 's battle against invaders .
The normal response to infection is rapid and effective , however , the immune response may occasionally cause inflammation and damage to healthy tissue .
" Inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue , " said Dr. Liam O'Mahony , lead investigator .
" Past research has shown that the probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can positively impact the body 's immune defense , and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract . "
Inflammation is associated with a wide range of conditions , such as inflammatory bowel disease , arthritis , bacterial - induced colitis , type I diabetes and organ transplantation .
Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 has previously shown ability to modulate the inflammatory response in a clinical trial of patients with irritable bowel syndrome .
The new data suggests additional health benefits of this particular probiotic strain .
The published study examined the effect of Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 administration on immunity to Salmonella ( Salmonella typhimurium ) , harmful bacteria that can cause intestinal infections and trigger the body 's inflammatory response .
Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 , a probiotic strain isolated from healthy human gastrointestinal tissue , was administered to mice in freeze - dried powder at least three weeks prior to salmonella infection .
Animals that received Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 showed dramatically increased numbers of certain immune cells that control the immune system response to harmful pathogens , in this case Salmonella .
Additionally , data show increased numbers of T - regulatory ( Treg ) cells , or cells that suppress inflammatory disease in a wide range of autoimmune diseases .
Administration of Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 resulted in the induction of these Treg cells , which protected the host from excessive inflammation during the course of infection .
Researchers concluded that the introduction of Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 results in enhanced protection from infection , while limiting pro-inflammatory damage caused by superfluous activation of the innate immune system .

I earned my Ph.D. in 1972 .
What I am about to describe is academically feasible .
It is surely economically feasible .
Wal - Mart should start a college .
As with virtually all colleges , it would be called a university .
Why ?
Because of higher perceived value by the consumers .
Why should Wal - Mart bother ?
Here is a good reason .
The total expenditure in the United States on higher education is in the range of a third of a trillion dollars a year .
That is a great deal of money .
Wal - Mart is not a company to let a large profit opportunity drift by .
You would be hard - pressed to find any industry with this level of income that is less efficient than higher education .
If Wal - Mart gets into the field , this will change .
Wal - Mart could offer far lower tuition than any other private university , and lower than 80 % of tax - funded universities .
All it needs to do is offer what is already available , but which almost no one knows about .
What about room and board ?
Whatever parents are charging now could be extended for four more years .
Or three .
Or maybe only two .
THIS ALREADY EXISTS
It is possible to earn a bachelor ’s degree from one of a handful of accredited universities by distance learning for about $ 15,000 , total .
You can do this from home , without quitting your job .
See my website .
A student can take all of his courses through examination , with or without the Internet , with or without DVDs , video tapes , and other technological tools .
If he is very bright , he can earn his bachelor ’s degree in two years .
I know a student who earned a bachelor ’s degree from an accredited university , Edison State University , which is located in New Jersey , in six months for $ 5,000 .
That was about eight years ago .
It might cost $ 6,000 today .
This can be done , and there is no economic reason why it should not be done .
It needs only a marketing system to deliver the product to large numbers of college - age students .
Could Wal - Mart do this ?
To ask the question is to answer it .
Is there any company more computer - savvy ?
More gifted at marketing ?
Better positioned to sell anything to anybody ?
The Internet can enable any college or university to provide high - quality education to students located anywhere in the world .
Examinations can be administered locally in the same way that college entrance examinations are administered locally .
Students can read only so fast .
They can read anywhere .
They do not need a campus .
Most of their academic time is spent either reading or sitting in a lecture hall .
Why not just view a YouTube video ?
They can buy an on online PDF textbook for $ 30 ( not $ 150 in hardback ) and print it out for ( say ) $ 10 .
That $ 30 is all profit for Wal - Mart University Press .
They do not need access to a huge college library .
They can write term papers in the local town library as well as they can write them on a distant campus .
If they ever do need a research university library , which is extremely unlikely for undergraduate education , they can get into a car and drive a few miles to use an existing university library .
Anybody can walk into any university library in the United States and use any of the materials free of charge .
Nobody asks if a student is enrolled locally .
They can download MP3 lectures from Wal - Mart University ’s website .
They can upload their term papers the same way .
Can students cheat ?
Only once .
Wal - Mart University will lease anti-cheating software that spots cribbed term papers .
Or it will create an in - house division that buys the term papers from online sellers , places them in its computer , and lets its faculty members use its in - house anti-plagiarism service .
( It could even market this service to other colleges . )
THE MULTIBILLION -DOLLAR MODEL
The University of Phoenix now has approximately 300,000 students .
These students are located all over the world .
It is a fully accredited educational program .
It is generating billions of dollars a year in tuition .
There is no reason why any accredited college or university cannot create a program comparable to the University of Phoenix .
All it takes is vision ( admittedly scarce ) , some start - up capital , and a willingness to convert from classroom education to online education .
This is a matter of technology ; it is not a matter of lack of demand .
Wal - Mart has retail outlets where an individual could sign up for classes .
It has outlets for the purchase of independently published textbooks and other materials .
It has the technological capability of delivering online education anywhere in the world .
Wal - Mart University would not have a campus , any more than Edison State University ( New Jersey ) or Excelsior University ( New York ) have campuses .
It would exist only digitally .
The university would not have any campus maintenance expenses .
It would not have to maintain a multimillion - dollar library because there would be no library .
The course work in the freshmen and sophomore years ( lower division ) could be graded by machine in most cases , since true / false exams are graded this way in most community colleges .
Digital term papers could be read and graded by graduate students enrolled in universities anywhere in the country , just as they grade lower division term papers today in all of the major universities .
( By the way , very few lower - division courses these days require term papers — grim , but true . )
Pay them $ 5 per term paper .
A term paper takes at most 15 minutes to grade .
Nothing has to change academically for lower - division courses .
The only difference is this : ( 1 ) it would all be handled online ; ( 2 ) it would be vastly cheaper for students .
This is going to come .
Whether Wal - Mart is going to do it , or FedEx , or Target , or UPS , or some other large multinational corporation , is a question that will be solved by the free market .
There is no question that it will be solved .
Companies are not going to let the University of Phoenix absorb a couple of billion dollars a year in tuition payments , without getting involved themselves .
Why should they let the University of Phoenix skim off this kind of money ?
Universities are mass - production factories at the lower division level .
They herd students into auditoriums of 500 or 1000 seats .
There is an untenured professor lecturing into a microphone far below the students in the top row .
Teaching assistants , who are paid practically nothing , grade all of the papers .
No student gets in to see the senior professor , who is in fact a junior professor .
Who are the universities kidding ?
( Answer : parents )
Some of the best private universities generate $ 1000 per student per semester in one of these mega- classes , or $ 1 million gross .
What does it cost them to run such a class ?
An auditorium , shared with eight other classes .
It may cost $ 100,000 in salaries per class .
Why should Wal - Mart or any other company let big - name universities skim off this kind of gross income for mass - produced classes taught by untenured assistant professors ?
THE MARKET
Approximately 15 million Americans are attending college this year .
About 14 million of them could get perfectly good educations online , at a university sponsored by a major corporation .
The corporation could cut tuition payments to 50 % of what most state universities charge .
In a decade , at least half of America ’s students could stay home , work part time , and graduate with a bachelor ’s degree in most of the social sciences or humanities , and pay no more than $ 30,000 for the privilege , saving tens of thousand dollars in room , board , and travel .
Of course , the kids do n’t want this .
They want their parents to pony up $ 50,000 or more to send them off to college for four years of party time .
They want to have fun and games at their parents ’ expense .
“ Boola - boola ! ” Moola - moola .
Parents ’ moola .
Parents are guilt - manipulated and peer - pressured into going along with this nonsense .
I am talking about getting a good education at a reasonable price .
The present university system does not deliver the goods .
It will take a large profit - seeking company to set up program that will deliver the goods .
Then rival corporations will get in on the act .
We will then have price competition in university education .
I am too controversial for Wal - Mart to hire me as a faculty member , but maybe I could run the advertising .
This would be a slam - dunk .
A fully accredited college education for the price of a Honda Civic .
College ?
Do n’t pay $ 50,000 for three years , and then your kid drops out .
College ?
Pay for your child ’s education , not four years of party time .
Wal - Mart University : Save Money .
Learn Better .
THE FACULTY
For undergraduate education , and especially for lower - division education , Wal - Mart could produce a first - rate educational program in one year .
It could easily assemble a faculty that is the best in the world .
Faculty members in any university have their summers free .
A faculty member in any field could produce an online course over his summer vacation .
He can then sell his course to Wal - Mart on a contract basis .
He can get paid a royalty on a new workbook that he writes .
Let ’s see : 10 % royalty .
The workbook is digital .
It sells for $ 10 . ( Cheap ! )
If 100,000 students enroll , that ’s $ 100,000 a year for the professor , and $ 900,000 for Wal - Mart .
He also will be paid a small amount of money for each student enrolled in his course .
At $ 3 per student , this is another $ 300,000 a year .
He will be a millionaire within two or three years , because there is no question that Wal - Mart could have a million students within three years .
If you think a big - name professor would not sign his name on a workbook for $ 100,000 a year , you do not understand professors .
If you think he would not stand in front of a camera to deliver the same lectures he has delivered for ten or twenty years , for a shot at $ 300,000 a year , you do not understand professors .
Wal - Mart could hire the most famous professors in the world in every field in the next three months .
Pay them a little money up front and give them a nice royalty agreement .
Universities would not have time to react .
It would be too late to stick a non-compete clause into the contracts .
Even if they do , Wal - Mart could hire world - famous retired professors .
What could Harvard , Princeton , Yale , Chicago , or Stanford do about this ?
Nothing .
Wal - Mart has plenty of money to invest .
It can sign up the best academic talent in the world .
It can create a college - level degree - granting program of such high quality that any accreditation agency that might resist granting accreditation would look like a cartel of special - interest , turf - protecting , guild - mentality dinosaurs still living in the 1950s .
In other words , it would look like what it really is .
These dinosaurs do n’t want the exposure . . . or a lawsuit accusing them of restraint of trade through a cartel agreement .
I can imagine these guys on the witness stand .
C - Span would have a field day .
Accredited colleges have long since implemented assembly - line education at the lower - division level .
The fact that a student will get his lecture from a computer screen rather than from a man with a microphone in a lecture hall of a thousand seats is neither here or there intellectually .
The difference is , the student getting educated at his computer screen will not be paying $ 500 per semester credit , or $ 1500 for the class ( maybe twice this ) .
He will be paying $ 100 per credit hour for lower division , and maybe $ 200 for upper division .
ACCREDITATION
The main barrier to entry in this field is accreditation .
The tenured university bureaucrats who control the granting of accreditation to a new university resist any suggestion that education can and should be delivered online at price - competitive tuitions .
They say : “ If the mountain cannot go to Muhammad , Mohammed must come to the mountain . ”
Well , in the digital age , the mountain can go to Mohammed .
Millions of Mohammeds .
What if Wal - Mart University cannot get accreditation in a year or two ?
So what ?
Wal - Mart has access to accredited colleges all over the United States , or even 30 miles down the road , that would be happy to take a grant of $ 5 million to set up a distance - learning program .
These schools are already accredited .
The distance - learning program sponsored by Wal - Mart would be a supplement to the existing program .
An accrediting agency would find it hard to deny an existing accredited college the right to set up a distance - learning program .
The fact that Wal - Mart would happen to get 80 % of the revenues is neither here nor there , officially .
“ We are scholars here .
A billion dollars in tuition has nothing to do with accreditation . ” ( Ha ! )
Wal - Mart could serve as a clearinghouse for several different colleges , with several different specialties , all leading to the same thing : an accredited bachelor ’s degree .
Within two years , Wal - Mart University will push a hundred accredited colleges to the verge of bankruptcy .
Then other corporations can do what Wal - Mart did .
They can set up a distance - learning program .
These desperate colleges will rush to do the deal .
Their survival will depend on it .
Within 10 years , college salaries will be where other middle - class salaries are .
No more tenure .
No more six hours a week of teaching .
The days of wine and roses will end .
RECRUITING FUTURE EMPLOYEES
Wal - Mart could create a special upper - division major for business students .
It could admit only the best and the brightest of the students who have gone through lower division .
Wal - Mart would be in a position to hire these students part - time as they take their upper division courses .
At the end of the college degree program , Wal - Mart could make offers to the best and the brightest of the students who have gone through its program .
Wal - Mart would tap into a huge pool of bright , energetic , tested students .
It could pick off these graduates to employ in its own organization .
In effect , students around the country , and around the world , would pay Wal - Mart for the privilege of becoming candidates to be employed by Wal - Mart .
Obviously , most students would not do this .
But for those students who want a career in business , and who want to enter a familiar organization , what better way of doing this than to go through a college degree - granting program sponsored by Wal - Mart ?
What better way for Wal - Mart to identify these students , test them in advance , and make offers to the very best ?
It is a win -win situation for the students and for Wal - Mart .
If Target does n’t like the competition , Target can start its own university .
The free market is perfectly capable of providing a college - level education program for millions of students .
There is nothing that the average college offers to the average undergraduate that an online college education program could not offer at half the price .
Of course , certain fields may not be suitable for this kind of education .
Nuclear physics is one of them .
Another would be organic chemistry .
But very few Americans major in these fields .
The vast majority of college graduates are majoring in the humanities , not the natural sciences .
Most courses in the humanities can be taught in this fashion .
Music may be an exception .
So , Wal - Mart University need not offer a music major .
But most fields are well suited for distance learning .
You can learn history , political science , sociology , psychology , philosophy , business , and most of the other disciplines through today ’s Internet technology .
If there are some fields that are not suitable , then sell only lower - division courses to these few students .
Every university requires certain courses of all the graduates .
These are generally liberal arts courses .
So , Wal - Mart University can offer these courses .
These courses will transfer to any four - year university from an accredited program .
NO MORE CONCEALED SUBSIDIES FROM PARENTS
The great threat to a university is that most of its profit per student comes from lower - division courses .
The students going through the required courses in their freshman and sophomore years provide the bulk of the funds needed to operate the typical university .
Upper-division courses barely break even .
Graduate school courses are always money - losing .
So , the parents of the freshman and sophomore students are subsidizing the parents of the junior and senior students .
They are especially subsidizing the graduate students .
Wal - Mart , by offering price competitive courses to freshman and sophomore students , will skim off the cream , leaving milk for the upper division courses , and skim milk for the graduate programs .
This would throw a monkey wrench into the financing of higher education in America .
This is exactly what needs to be done .
Any president of a university who does not see this coming is likely to find himself a former president three years after Wal - Mart University begins , and certainly five years after Wal - Mart University has spawned Target University , UPS University , and FedEx University .
Private colleges with fewer than 2000 students will be scrambling to survive within a decade of Wal - Mart University .
State university presidents will be begging state legislatures to fund their operations with taxpayers ’ money , just as they do today .
The difference will be , Wal - Mart University will be offering an equally good education for less money than the tax - subsidized State University will be offering .
This will make it a much harder sell to the state legislatures .
About the only thing that the state universities will be able to tell the state legislators to vote for is the football team or the basketball team at the sports program .
That will least let the world know what the real purpose of higher education is .
Wal - Mart University will be granting degrees for education ; the state universities will be granting degrees in order to recruit semi-professional athletes , half of whom will not graduate , to entertain the voters .
The voters deserve to know this .
WHY NOT TRY FREEDOM ?
Why should we believe that the free market , which delivers the vast bulk of the services and goods that we consume , is somehow incapable of delivering higher education at competitive prices ?
Why should we believe special - interest bureaucrats who claim that higher education is of necessity a nonprofit venture and usually a tax - funded venture ?
Wal - Mart University will have to deliver a high - quality product from the very beginning .
It will have to be visibly superior to the product delivered by every community college in the United States .
It will have to be better than the product delivered by 70 % of the private colleges and 80 % of the state universities .
It will not be better than the education delivered by the top schools in the country , because it will not recruit students of the highest caliber .
But this is true of 95 % of all colleges and universities .
The difference is , the free market , through its system of open entry and competition , can deliver what the buyers really want for their money .
Buyers today face an educational delivery system that is a cartel .
All it will take to break this cartel is for one major retailer to enter the field , produce a high - quality product , and enroll a million students .
At that point , the myth of nonprofit education will be a thing of the past .
Wal - Mart could put this together in three years .
In a crash program , it could probably put it together in two years .
All it needs is a cooperating college or university that is accredited and which would like to get 5 million or ten million dollars .
I daresay there are several that would like to do this .
Wal - Mart does not need to stick its name on the university .
It can simply make available the service and take a hefty fee for marketing .
Some large retailer is going to do this .
It may not be Wal - Mart .
It does n’t really matter which one launches the program .
What matters is that it will break the monopoly of the educational cartel .
It will generate so much money , enroll so many students , and deliver such a competitive product at a competitive price , that the cartel will have to respond in order to survive .
The moment colleges begin to respond to the free market by offering services at a competitive price , the cartel will be busted .
Cartels always break down .
There are always members of the cartel that cheat .
Cheating in academia means delivering a high - quality product at a competitive price .
There is no doubt that Wal - Mart or UPS or any other major American corporation could deliver such a program .
If Wal - Mart does n’t do it , then Toyota could do it .
The major television networks could do it .
Any of the major cable television networks could do it .
This is not rocket science .
Think about the big three television networks .
They are suffering from shrinking market share .
They have lost the young people .
Cable is eating their lunch .
Advertising revenues are falling .
Nothing has been done in the last 20 years to reverse the constant decline .
Here is a way that they could combine their digital communications skills with their retail outlets to produce an educational revolution .
Why wo n’t they do this ?
The oil companies could do this .
The tobacco industry could do this .
Proctor & Gamble could do this .
Dow chemical could do it .
Dow is already associated closely with the Northwood Institute .
It could simply extend its existing alliance to fund the creation of a national university .
There are times when I wonder about the entrepreneurial commitment of America ’s largest corporations .
They want to recruit bright entry - level employees .
They should imitate baseball .
Baseball has set up a system of farm teams .
They recruit players for the major leagues through the minor leagues .
If American businesses are really interested in recruiting superior middle managers from the pool of educational talent in the country , they can do this .
They can use Harvard , Princeton , Yale , Stanford , Chicago , and the other 30 universities to provide the super - talented graduates .
But there are never enough of these people to go around .
It makes far more sense to recruit bright students right out of college , put them in managerial positions in a low - level , and see how they produce .
Give them on - the - job training .
The goal is to attract competent students for the initial hiring .
This can be done through the creation of a national university .
Higher education has got to break away from tax subsidies .
As state budgets get tighter , legislators are going to be looking for ways to cut expenditures .
An obvious thing to cut is higher education .
This is going to happen .
The question is :
Will the free market provide a viable alternative to the red-ink universities that now absorb several hundred billion dollars a year ?
I think it will .
Another person who thought it would was management guru Peter Drucker .
He was convinced that higher education would be completely restructured as a result of the technological revolution that was taking place in the 1990s .
That revolution has begun : the University of Phoenix .
The model already exists .
It is a highly profitable model .
It will take only one major American corporation entering this field to prove that the existing model of tax - funded , nonprofit higher education is inefficient .
That model belongs to the past .
Technology , when coupled with price competition , always replaces older models that cannot match the discount prices of the new products made possible by the new technology and mass marketing .
Students will initially resist this .
They want their parents to give up half of their retirement portfolio in order to send them off for four years of partying , and four years of delaying making a judgment about what to do when they grow up .
University administrators will also resist this , because they want the students to show up on campus , and they want the parents to write the checks .
But , at some point , it is going to become obvious to hundreds of thousands of parents that there is a better way .
That better way is distance learning .
The technology exists .
The model exists : the University of Phoenix .
All it will take is the marketing .
The rest of it is just a matter of setting up the administration .
If an American firm does not do this , then a European firm will .
Or maybe a Japanese firm will .
There is nothing that keeps education inside geographical borders .
When the product is digital , there are no borders .
If an accredited university in a foreign country wants to create an international university , it can do so .
If American entrepreneurs are unable to see the potential , then some foreign company is going to enter the field and capture it .
All it will take will be a cooperative venture between the company and an accredited university in the home country .
There are dozens of universities in the British Isles that would be happy to do this .
Oxford and Cambridge probably wo n’t , but how many people do those two institutions educate ?
CONCLUSION
The free market is better able to deliver high - quality education than the state is .
The state has used its power to license and accredit colleges and universities to preserve an educational cartel .
That cartel can be broken , and it will be broken .
It is just a question of time .
Any university president who does not see what is going to happen has to be blind .
It is his job , as a fund - raiser , to make certain that his university is prepared for the competition of the future .
It is obvious where the competition is going to come from : the profit - seeking private sector .
The private sector is going to deliver the goods .
It is going to sell the goods cheaper , offer a wider range of choices , deliver the package anywhere in the world , and let the student graduate as fast as he can pass the examinations .
Of course , these schools will not have athletic teams , saving millions of dollars per year .
They can offer video game competitions for their students .
They can set up a league : the NDAA ( National Digital Athletic Association ) .
I can see it now : Wal - Mart University vs. Target University for the Division I national championship .
Then on to the World Series , where Tata Motors is the favorite .

The Wall Street Bailout : Obama Needs To Lead
I am still tied up and can't take the time to discuss the issues here , but I wanted to state what I think the most important question of the coming days for me is - will Barack Obama lead the Democrats in a fight against the 700 billion dollar blank check the Bush Administration is asking for to bail out Wall Street ?
This is a 3 AM moment .
The time to lead is now .
We will find out a lot about Barack Obama in the coming days .
We already know what John McCain is , an incompetent ideologue .
Let 's hope that Obama proves himself a leader .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon , which closed its Talon intelligence database nearly a year ago amid concerns about domestic spying , will soon begin testing an unclassified alternative for tracking possible threats to U.S. military bases , officials said on Tuesday .
A U.S. flag hangs from the side of the Pentagon at a ceremony marking the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks in Washington , September 11 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
The system , an FBI - operated program called eGuardian , would for the first time sever the Defense Department ’s collection of data on suspicious activity from U.S. intelligence operations by placing the information in an unclassified database for law enforcement agencies , officials said .
Pentagon officials hope an unclassified system run by the FBI would help insulate the job of gathering information about potential threats from public concerns about domestic espionage that surrounded Talon for years .
Air Force Lt. Col. Almarah Belk , a Pentagon spokeswoman , said a Pentagon panel of experts that spent a year examining 62 different systems formally recommended eGuardian to senior defense officials on July 29 .
The Defense Department will begin testing eGuardian as early as this month at sites in Florida and Virginia and the system could be formally adopted in December if the tests go well , she said .
“ This is the most promising solution at this point , ” Belk told Reuters .
Talon , a classified database maintained by a defense counterintelligence office that the Pentagon disbanded on Tuesday , was designed to gather pieces of information about suspicious activity near U.S. defense facilities .
Analysts could then examine the data for evidence of potential threats .
OUTCRY IN CONGRESS
But in 2005 , the database was found to have inappropriately retained information on U.S. antiwar protesters even after they were ruled out as threats .
That caused an outcry in Congress and among civil liberties advocates about the dangers of military spying on U.S. citizens .
“ The concept is still good .
Connecting the dots of the bits and pieces of possible information is a good thing .
It just should n’t be in a counterintelligence database , ” said senior Pentagon counterintelligence official Toby Sullivan .
When the Pentagon shut the Talon database in September 2007 , it transferred data collection responsibilities to a classified FBI system called Guardian , which continues to collect threat information about Pentagon facilities today .
e Guardian ’s name is derived from the Guardian system .
But unlike its classified sibling , eGuardian does not provide information directly to U.S. intelligence agencies , according to the Pentagon .
FBI officials were not available to comment on eGuardian , but the FBI ’s Web site described it as an automated method for sharing unclassified threat data with state and local law enforcement .
Pentagon officials said information about military installations collected by eGuardian would be available to law enforcement agencies but not the public , despite the system ’s unclassified nature .
Data found to pose an actual potential threat would be transferred to the classified Guardian system for analysis .
This week ’s shutdown of the office responsible for Talon , the Counterintelligence Field Activity office , was the final chapter in the controversy .
Its former responsibilities for managing defense and armed services efforts against intelligence threats from foreign powers and militant groups now belong to the new Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center , overseen by the Pentagon ’s Defense Intelligence Agency .
Hasbro's Nightmare : Scrabulous Returns With New Name And ( A Few ) New Rules

Well , you kind of had to see this one coming .
Days after taking Scrabulous down in response to the lawsuit from Hasbro , the brothers behind the game have put up a new game called " WordScraper " that is similar , but has a few different rules as well .
The idea , obviously is to be different enough to get around the lawsuit from Hasbro .
When you look this over , you begin to realize just how badly Hasbro screwed up in handling this situation .
In focusing on a legal solution , it may have created the worst case scenario for the business side of the company .
When we talk about various trademark and copyright disputes , one response we often get is that a companyto react that way to " protect " its " property . "
This is not quite accurate .
While there are some issues concerning trademark and preventing a trademark from going generic , there are almost always better business responses than suing -- and on copyright issues , there 's no requirement to protect .
However , in an age where lawyers all too often make business decisions based on what can be done legally , rather than what makes the most business sense , those options are all too rarely considered .
In the past , there was often little that could be done for those impacted by such decisions .
These days , however , things are quite different .
Pissing off a large group of people , even if you have the legal right to do so , can often be a disastrous business move .
This is clearly demonstrated by Hasbro .
The saga began earlier this year when Hasbro realized that Scrabulous was ridiculously popular on Facebook .
Scrabulous was developed by two brothers who liked the game Scrabble and noticed that it could n't be played online .
Hasbro had done little to help put the game online , and the brothers were merely doing a much better job responding to the market need than the company that supposedly " owned " the rights .
Hasbro finally put together its own version ( which got terrible reviews ) and then sued Scrabulous , getting the brothers to take the game down .
And , historically , that 's where all this would end .
Hasbro was legally in the right and had every right to push to block Scrabulous .
But , as a business decision ( as counterintuitive as it may seem ) , this reaction may be quite bad for business .
First , witness the rather loud and nearly immediate response from many Scrabulous fans , slamming Hasbro for its actions and pushing a boycott on all Hasbro products .
Some will surely claim that many of these folks would probably never buy a Hasbro product in the first place and so this is a lot of noise about nothing .
However , do n't underestimate the reputational hit that Hasbro will take for this -- especially among younger folks who may be Hasbro 's most important target audience .
As Metallica is still in the process of learning , your reputation is extremely important , and damaging it by treating your fans incorrectly can do an awful lot more damage to your brand than you might expect .
Now , add in the fact that the Scrabulous guys have come back with Wordscraper , and chances are people are going to flock to it , just as vehemently as they now want to avoid Hasbro 's Scrabble .
That 's about the worst case scenario for Hasbro , and it was entirely avoidable if they had simply realized how people would react to their decisions ( which was n't hard to guess from earlier responses prior to the lawsuit ) . :
Some folks in the comments ( and via email ) are pointing out the rumor that Hasbro offered to buy out Scrabulous from its creators .
That 's a valid point , but it does n't really change the rest of the calculus here at all .
Even given the fact that Hasbro made an effort at buying them out , that still does n't mean that ( having failed that ) suing them was the proper second response -- as evidence by exactly what 's happened since then .

The luxury builder , whose business is concentrated in Florida , one of the states hardest hit by the housing downturn , defaulted on its bank debt on July 29 when its liquidity levels fell below the threshold required by its lenders .
“ The banks have had enough , and understandably so , ” said Vicki Bryan , an analyst with Gimme Credit , a bond research firm .
WCI has $ 2.18 billion in assets and $ 1.92 billion in debts , according to its bankruptcy petition .
Its chief executive , Jerry Starkey , will leave the company effective immediately after agreeing with WCI on a “ mutually satisfactory severance package ” and will be available for consultation , the company said in a statement .
The former chief operating officer , David L. Fry , was named interim president and chief executive .
Beazer Homes USA is the builder most likely to declare bankruptcy next , Ms. Bryan said .
When Beazer reports its third - quarter earnings on Friday , the company will probably reveal such significant write - downs on land that is losing value that it might trip the covenants its banks have set to determine its minimum tangible net worth , she said .

Device to track truant students raises privacy concerns
Ankle device keeps track of students
GPS program lets court officials monitor truants
SAN ANTONIO — Court authorities will be able to track students with a history of skipping school under a new program requiring them to wear ankle bracelets with Global Positioning System monitoring .
But at least one group is worried the ankle bracelets will infringe on students ' privacy .
Linda Penn , a Bexar County justice of the peace , said she anticipates that about 50 students — likely to be mostly high schoolers — will wear the thick ankle bracelets during the six - month pilot program announced Friday .
She said the time students wear the anklets will be on a case - by - case basis , but she doubted any will wear them the entire half - year .
" We are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate , " Penn said , linking truancy with juvenile delinquency and later criminal activity .
Penn said students in the program will wear the ankle bracelets full - time and will not be able to remove them .
They 'll be selected as they come through her court , and Penn will target truant students with gang affiliations , those with a history of running away and skipping school , and those who have been through her court multiple times .
Penn said the electronic monitoring is part of a comprehensive program she started four years ago to reduce truancy .
She cited programs in Midland and Dallas as having success with similar electronic monitoring measures .
But Terri Burke , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas , said requiring students to wear the GPS bracelets full - time raises privacy concerns .
" We 're all for keeping kids in school , and we applaud any efforts to make that happen , " Burke said .
" But the privacy issue :
What happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out ?
Is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school ? "
Burke said truant students and runaway kids are different issues .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - French nuclear firm Areva said on Tuesday 30 cubic meters of a liquid containing natural uranium was accidentally poured on the ground and into a river at a site in southeastern France .
The uranium , which was not enriched , was poured on the ground during the cleaning of a tank at the Socatri group , an Areva subsidiary , on the site of the Tricastin nuclear plant .
“ Around 30 cubic meters of a liquid containing uranium , with a concentration of 12 grams of uranium per liter , was poured on the ground , ” France ’s nuclear safety authority said in a statement , adding that it will carry out an investigation on July 10 to determine the causes of the accident .
Socatri specializes in the maintenance and dismantling of nuclear material as well as managing nuclear waste .
Part of the liquid soaked into the ground at the company ’s premises while the rest ran into the Gaffiere and Lauzon rivers , which flow into the Rhone .
A Socatri spokesman said the firm will monitor the impact of the accident on the environment .
BEING DOING / MEANS ENDS Rén , , " benevolence , charity , humanity , love , " kindness .
The fundamental virtue of Confucianism .
Confucius defines it as , " Ài rén , " " love others . "
[ Analects XII : 22 ]
Yì , , " right conduct , morality , duty to one 's neighbor , " righteousness .
Lì , , " profit , gain , advantage " : NOT a proper motive for actions affecting others .
The idea that profit is the source of temptation to do wrong is the Confucian ground of the later official disparagment of commerce and industry .
The Master said , " The gentleman ( chün tzu , ) understands yì .
The small / mean man ( hsiao - jen , ) understands lì . " [ Analects IV:16 ]
Li3 , , " propriety , good manners , politeness , ceremony , worship . "
Xiào , , " to honor one 's parents , " filial piety [ Analects II : 5 ] .
Yì may be broken down [ Analects IV:15 ] into : zhong1 , , doing one 's best , conscientiousness , " loyalty " [ note ] ; and shù , , " reciprocity , " altruism , consideration for others , " what you do n't want yourself , do n't do to others " [ Analects XV:23 ]. quoted definitions , Mathews ' Chinese - English Dictionary , Harvard , 1972 ; quotations from Analects translated by D.C. Lau , Penguin Books , 1979
Confucius himself had a simple moral and political teaching : to love others ; to honor one 's parents ; to do what is right instead of what is of advantage ; to practice " reciprocity , " i.e. " do n't do to others what you would not want yourself " ; to rule by moral example ( ) instead of by force and violence ; and so forth .
Confucius thought that a ruler who had to resort to force had already failed as a ruler -- " Your job is to govern , not to kill " ( Analects XII:19 ) .
This was not a principle that Chinese rulers always obeyed , but it was the ideal of benevolent ( ) rule .
It should be noted , however , that even such humane principles are paternalistic and statist , without a hint of the ideals of individual liberty that are the basis of modern liberal society .
Nevertheless , the Confucian ideal avoids the worst of modern paternalism with the principle of government by example and by " Not Doing " ( ) , putting Confucianism closer to Taoism than to modern practices of authoritarian control .
Confucius thought that government by laws and punishments could keep people in line , but government by example of virtue ( ) and good manners ( ) would enable them to control themselves ( Analects II : 3 ) .
" The way the wind blows , that 's the way the grass bends " ( Analects XII:19 ) .
Self - control , indeed , is the basis of all the industrious virtues that have made the Chinese people economically successful whenever they have been allowed to prosper , whether in California , Malaya , or China proper .
Unfortunately , although Confucius himself says , " Wealth and high station are what men desire " ( Analects , IV:5 ) , later Confucians ( beginning no later than Mencius ) turned warnings against the temptation of profit ( ) into a condemnation of profit , which meant that their influence was often turned against the development of Chinese industry and commerce .
Thus , Confucians themselves were perfectly happy to seek " high station , " while stiffling the ability of ordinary Chinese to produce " wealth . "
Over time , this was an evil influence in Chinese history [ note ] .
While the essence of morality is the limitation of self - interest , Confucius is clear that this does not mean complete denial of self .
We have already seen a hint of this with Analects XV:23 , which begins with the character for " self " and ends with the characters for " others " ( or " persons " ) .
If what you do n't want for yourself , you should n't to do others , then you would like others to do for you what you would indeed like for yourself .
We see a similar word structure , and stronger implication , at Analects VI : 28 , " If you desire to establish yourself , also establish others . "
This sounds more like what Mohism called " mutual profitableness , " but it is clearly essential to Confucius .
The idea is distilled in a modern Japanese saying , jiri rita , " self profit , profit other , " or " self - interest[ed ] altruism . "
This can , of course , also be read in Chinese , as shown .
It contains different characters for " self " and " other " than Confucius uses , but these could easily be substituted , as can be seen by clicking on the image for a popup with the corresponding characters .
Helping oneself and others at the same time is characteristic of what we might even call the " worldliness " of Confucianism and Chinese civilization .
The Chinese have never been very big on the world - denying renunication so characteristic of India ; and even though monasticism was brought to China by Buddhism and adopted by religious Taoism , Confucianism , which usually also meant the government , always remained suspicious of it : Monks and nuns were often suspected of being licentious freeloaders , an attitude we see expressed in the Judge Dee novels .
The hostility to profit that can occur in Confucianism thus has to compete against this contrary sense that self - interest can be promoted by cooperating with and pleasing others -- the essence of a market exchange .
During the T'ang Dynasty , the canon of Confucian Classics became the basis for the great civil service examinations that henceforth provided the magistrates and bureaucrats ( the " Mandarins " ) for the Chinese government .
This system is still impressive , but , because of the attitude of the Confucian scholars , it was not entirely to good effect .
The founder of the Míng Dynasty ( 1368 -1644 ) Chu Yüan - chang , an illiterate peasant who rose to expel the Mongols and win the throne , was suspicious of the influence of the scholars .
He tried to balance the scholarly with the military establishment so that neither would dominate the government .
Later , when the Chinese sent Admiral Cheng Ho [ Zheng He ] , a Muslim eunuch who started out as a war prisoner and slave , on seven great naval expeditions into the Indian Ocean between 1405 and 1433 , it was the scholars who powerfully opposed engaging in anything so lowly as trade and dealing with such uncivilized barbarians .
The expeditions , indeed , visited not only Indonesia and India , but penetrated into the Persian Gulf , the Red Sea , and far down the east coast of Africa .
The fleets were large , heavily manned , well armed , and contained ships of nine masts ( the baochuan , " treasure ships " ) that , reportedly , were more than 400 feet long .
But when the court faction of the scholars triumphed and ended the expeditions , they also destroyed their records and made it a capital offense to build anything larger than a two - masted ship .
This crippled Chinese trade and foreign involvement ; and one is left to wonder just how world history would have been different had Vasco da Gama arrived in the Indian Ocean in 1498 , just 65 years later , to discover an overwhelming and technologically equal or superior Chinese naval presence .
In China itself , the scholars indeed went on to dominate the government and tip the balance against the military , which left the country so unprepared that in 1644 the last Ming emperor was forced to call in Manchuria to deal with a rebellion .
The Manchus took advantage of this to take over the country ; and so the final Chinese Dynasty , the Ch'ing [ Qing ] ( 1644-1912 ) , was n't Chinese at all .
This was probably not what the scholars would have wanted , but they had certainly brought it about .
Curiously , the Ch'ing Emperors adopted scholarly sensibilities and retained Ming naval and maritime policy xenophobia .
This left China once again helpless when forces technologically superior to the Portuguese , especially the British , eventually arrived , irresistibly pressing for commercial access to the country .
The scholars never did adapt , and the examination system was eventually abolished rather than modernized .
A curious and noteworthy aspect of the teaching of Confucius is his arm 's length attitude towards religion .
There is considerably irony in this , not only because Confucianism later became one of the major religions of China , but in comparison to the life of Socrates , who was born just nine years after Confucius died .
Socrates , although he talked about the gods all the time , and saw his own philosophical project as a divine mission , was condemned and put to death for presumably not believing in them .
Confucius , although he later became a god , to whom temples were dedicated in every Chinese city , as the patron of students and scholars , nevertheless did n't talk about the gods at all :
The topics the Master did not speak of were prodigies , force , disorder , and gods .
[ Analects translated by D.C. Lau , Penguin Books , 1979 , VII : 21 , p. 88 ]
The term for " god " here , ( shin or kami in Japanese ) , is often translated " spirit " or even " spiritual beings . "
We see another term in this quote :
Chi-lu asked how the spirits of the dead and gods should be served .
The Master said , " You are not able to serve to serve man .
How can you serve the spirits ? " [ XI:12 , p. 107 ]
" Spirits " or " spirits of the dead " here are kuei , , " spirits , demons , ghosts . "
This is a remarkable passage considering the attention given by Confucianism as a religion for one 's ancestors and for the care of one 's family grave plot ( at Ch'ing Ming , , see below ) .
This seems comparable to an instruction from Jesus :
[ Matthew 8:21 ]
And another of his disciples said unto him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . [ 8:22 ]
But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead .
Few Christians are so unconcerned about burial of relatives , or Confucians about the service of spirits -- although there was disagreement about the nature of the Chinese soul .
What Confucius honored rather than pious ritual is implied here :
The Master was seriously ill .
Tzu -lu asked permission to offer a prayer .
The Master said , " Was such a thing ever done ? "
Tzu-lu said , " Yes it was .
The prayer offered was as follows : pray thus to the gods above and below . "
The Master said , " In that case , I have long been offering my prayers . "
[ VII:35 , p. 91 ]
This is interpreted to mean that Confucius has been praying all that was necessary just by being good and polite .
Further prayers are unnecessary .
While the practice of Confucianism was not entirely consistent with these principles of Confucius just expressed , his attitude did have a significant effect on the conduct of Chinese religion , where popular gods possessed less status in terms of politics and high culture than we see in most other civilizations .
Thus , while most people have a least heard of major Indian gods , like Shiva and Krishna , I have frequently found entire classes of students who were unable to name even a single traditional Chinese god [ note ] .
The government of Imperial China treated the gods rather like other subjects of the Empire , assigning them rank and promoting or demoting them depending on their popularity or moral wholesomeness .
Confucian authorities thus never doubted their standing to judge the status and worth of the gods .
The Imperial cult , like Confucius himself , was concerned with much more abstract and impersonal entities , like Heaven .
Sometimes " Heaven , " , is therefore translated " God , " but it is a principle , one that is certainly inherent in things , but it is not a personal deity .
The reality of Heaven , however , does refute attempts to characterize Confucius as the sort of skeptical and positivistic " secular humanist " who has become familiar in modern society .
That interpretation goes along with a program , motivated by the circumstances of Confucianism just considered , that has led many people to conclude that Confucianism was never a religion at all , either as we find it in Confucius or in the later tradition of the Literati .
Since , as we know , Confucius did not talk about gods or spirits or the dead , and the principal content of the teaching of Confucius is clearly moral , social , and political , this interpretation is given a running start .
Le mot religion ne signifiait pas ce qu'il signifie pour nous ; sous ce mot , nous entendons un corps de dogmes , une doctrine sur Dieu , un symbole de foi sur les mystères qui sont en nous et autour de nous ; ce même mot , chez les anciens , signifiait rites , cérémonies , actes de culte extérieur .
La doctrine était peu de chose ; c'étaient les pratique qui étaient l'important ; c'étaient elles qui étaient obligatoires et impérieuses .
La religion était un lien matériel , une chaîne qui tenait l'homme esclave .
The word religion did not signify what it signifies for us ; by this word we understand a body of dogmas , a doctrine concerning God , a symbol of faith concerning what is in and around us .
This same word , among the ancients , signified rites , ceremonies , acts of exterior worship .
The doctrine was of small account : the practices were the important part ; these were obligatory , and bound man ( ligare , religio ) .
Religion was a material bond , a chain which held man a slave .

Against the rites , do not look ; against the rites , do not listen ;
Against the rites , do not speak ; against the rites , do not act .

Tseng
Tzu said , " Care for the dead , with rites for the ancestors ,
and the virtue of the people culminates . "
Analects I:9
Such an interpretation , of Confucius as a " secular humanist , " comes to grief , however , not only on the role and meaning of , " Heaven , " but most importantly on the " Rites , " .
The meaning of this , strongly endorsed by Confucius , first of all as propriety and manners , also extends to the rites and rituals of Confucian religion , particularly in the veneration of one 's ancestors and the care of the family grave plot .
Thus , Analects II : 5 is concerned with filial piety , , expressed through the practice of :
That parents , when alive , should be served according to ; that , having died , they should be buried according to ; and that the sacrifice ( ) to their spirits should be according to .
This sequence nicely bridges the range in meaning of from manners and propriety to the rites of burial and sacrifice to the dead .
Confucians never regarded any unbelief they might have as abridging their duty to perform the public and private Rites required by the State and by Family .
A Confucian neglectful of the Rites would not have been simply rebuked by the Emperor , but dismissed -- if not worse .
And they would have disgraced their Family by neglecting its graves and shrines -- every year , at the Solar Term Ch'ing Ming , , " Clear and Bright , " it is the duty of everyone to visit the family graves , to clean them up , and make offerings to the ancestors .
Then you have a picnic .
This practice is called , " sacrifice [ and ] sweep , " although the " sacrifice " these days is mostly burning incense and paper money .
Oddly enough , the religious character of the Rites was a matter of controversy in the Catholic Church .
When the Jesuits arrived in China , they adopted a strategy , largely due to Matteo Ricci ( 1552 -1610 ) , of accepting Confucianism as the moral equivalent of Christianity .
By this they hoped to persuade educated Chinese that they were already half Christian and should convert and come all the way over .
At the same time , the Jesuits argued that the Rites of Confucianism were not religious at all and therefore the Chinese could in a sense remain Confucians once they converted to Christianity .
And the Jesuits could present themselves as good Confucians in the Chinese Court .
This outraged other Catholic missionaries in China , who were well aware that the pagan religion of the Romans who persecuted Christians was itself largely a matter of ritual , without the sort of superstructure of doctrine , creed , and confession that became famliar in Christianity itself and later in Islam .
Thus , to avoid persecution , Christians did not need to abjure their faith or confess belief in the Roman gods .
All they had to do was offer a libation at a pagan altar .
Christians died rather than offer that libation ; but the Jesuits were now saying that even participation in the Rites of the Chinese State , involving the worship of Heaven or the veneration of the Imperial ancestors , was perfectly acceptable .
As it happened , the Jesuit strategy was ineffective in converting many Chinese .
But it did make the Jesuits acceptable enough that they found a permanent place at the Ming Court , renewed in the subsequent Ch'ing Dynasty , providing advice on the calendar .
This was harmless enough that the controversy over the Rites faded away , now to be revived in attempts to reinterpret Confucianism as a form of secular humanism before - its - time .
All such efforts , however , fall afoul of the history of religion , where most of ancient religion , and a great deal of modern , consists of ritual practices whose purpose or rationality is not at all obvious and which are not justified by the sort of systematic theology that became familiar in the Western monotheistic religions -- Protestants even rejected much of the traditional ritual of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches .
Thus , opinion polls in Japan consistently report that a large majority of Japanese are not religious , even while a large majority of Japanese participate in the Rites of the New Year and other occasions at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples , and otherwise patronize these places for prayer and amulets to help with personal problems , from disease to driving safety .
A country with little Shinto shrines in laundromats or on the roofs of department stores does not seem to me to be particularly irreligious -- in the clever title of the book by Ian Reader and George Tanabe , it is Practically Religious [ U. of Hawai'i Press , 2004 ] .
Theirs is still a religion of practice more than of confession -- and questions from pollsters about religious belief tend to evoke unpleasant associations with people like the Jehovah 's Witnesses coming to the door .
Thus , a secularized Confucianism only makes sense in terms of a particular kind of religion , that of doctrine and confession familiar in the Mediaeval and Modern West and Middle East .
This was not the tradition in China or the peripheral countries within China 's sphere of influence .
Editorial Note :
This page on Confucius is intended to focus on some particular issues of ethics and political economy that are important for the Friesian School and which I have stressed in my classes .
There is consequently nothing here about his life , which is largely legendary anyway .
Specialists may consider the detail here insufficient and oversimplified , and certainly anyone with a serious interest in Confucius should go to treatments by real historians of Chinese philosophy .
But the goal here is summary and basic , and could even be regarded as tendentious .
Indeed , the philosophy links are largely to pages that otherwise have little to do with Chinese philosophy .
The historical links are edifying in their own way .
Both Wades - Giles and Pinyin transcriptions are used on this page because both will be encountered in academic sources on China and Chinese philosophy .
There are also Chinese people , as from Taiwan , who refuse to use Pinyin because of its origin and associations ( with Communist China ) .
Pinyin has some convenient innovations ( like d for /t / ) , but it is also is phonetically redundant ( with separate symbols for palatal and retroflex intitials , which are unnecessary ) and gives some letters values ( like / thsh / , English " ch , " for q ) that are opaque and bewildering for those not already familiar with the system .

The Huí The Hàn , , Chinese are to be contrasted , for instance , with the Huí , , Chinese , who are simply those who practice ʾ Islâm , ( i.e. the " religion of the Huí " ) .
But ʾ Islâm never became a " Fourth Way . "
For one thing , ʾ Islâm , like Judaism and Christianity , was exclusivistic and could never think of itself as part of a larger system with Confucianism , Taoism , and Buddhism .
And that is what the " Three Ways " were about .
One could include practices from all three , as part of a uniquely Chinese , , syncreticism .
Confucians might always be distrustful or disrespectful of Taoism and Buddhism , but elements of Taoism and Buddhism were unavoidable in the life of Confucians .
But Muslims in general would avoid elements of any of them .
They dressed differently and ate differently , avoiding pork , which may have been the foremost meat animal in the Chinese diet -- the character for " family " and " home , " , shows a pig , , under a roof ( just as " peace , " , shows a woman under a roof , i.e. at home ) .
No Muslim is going to put a pig under their roof .
Also , the practice of circumcision likely suggested physical dismemberment , which was viewed with horror in all Chinese religion .
Since huí , , can also mean " Turks " or " Uighurs , " Muslim Chinese obviously were thought of as the equivalent of foreigners .
Confucians originally thought of Buddhists as similarly un-Chinese ; but Buddhism became so popular after the fall of the Later Hàn Dynasty ( 220 AD ) that , by the time of the Suí ( 590 - 618 ) and T'ang [ Táng ] ( 618-906 ) , it was accepted as properly Chinese .
The Huí are still counted as an ethnic minority , some 6,490,000 as of 1980 , and in the northern province of Ningxia constitute a majority of the population .
Although this usage has now lapsed , the Huí , or Huíhuí ( ) , in the Ming Dynasty meant Jews and Christians as well as Muslims .
All three groups had come down the Silk Road from Central Asia .
The original Christians in this case , of course , were the Nestorians who appeared at the T'ang court in 635 .
Jews as well as Muslims did not eat pork .
They all used related sacred languages , like Arabic , Syriac , and Hebrew .
They claimed many of the same prophets , like Abraham , Joseph , and Moses .
To the Chinese then , although there might be some differences between these groups , they were more similar to each other than to anyone else , and very different in belief , language , culture , and diet from the Chinese .
A telling incident in this respect was when Matteo Ricci received permission to attend the Ming Court , where he was then present from 1601 until his death in 1610 .
This extraordinary privilege for a foreigner , a " Southern " barbarian , , was granted because of the demonstrated mastery of astronomy by the Portuguese Jesuits , and because Ricci had learned the Chinese language and literature to the point where he could converse , and argue , as an equal with other courtiers and officials .
This can not fail to impress even now .
No one previously in Europe had known anything about the Chinese language or writing system .
That such permission was granted to Ricci is more extraordinary when we realize that the Emperor at the time , the Wan - li Emperor , had become a recluse and refused to appear in Court from 1600 until his death in 1620 .
In many disastrous ways this left the government simply unsupervised and undirected .
But the Emperor was not entirely unaware of what was going on , and took the trouble , as noted , to do things like allow Matteo Ricci to be received at Court .
But since the Emperor himself would then never attend Court , he never would lay eyes on Ricci .
But he was not without curiosity .
So he instructed a Court painter to make a portrait of Ricci and bring it to him .
So the Wan - li Emperor never saw Ricci , but he did see what the man looked like .
And the Emperor 's response was :
This was a -- big nose , round eyes , etc .
Later , Europeans would be given a new designation , as " Franks , " ( a term also used for European firearms , especially where the character means " machine " ) , following usage in ʾ Islâm ( Arabic ) and in India ( Hindi ) .
Return to text Confucius , Note 2
In Japan , as " loyalty , " pronounced chû , comes to mean " blind loyalty , " absolute obedience to a feudal lord or the emperor , regardless of whether instructions are right or wrong .
This was in stark contrast to the Chinese sense , where an expression of " true " loyalty might be the willingness to be put to death rather than do what is wrong .
See Analects XI:24 and " Zen and the Art of Divebombing , or The Dark Side of the Tao . " Return to text Confucius , Note 3 ; Profit in Confucianism
The attitude of Confucius towards profit ( ) is , at best , ambiguous .
The most interesting statement is Analects IV:5 , " Wealth and high station are what men desire , but unless I got them in the right way , I would not remain in them .
Poverty and low station are what men dislike , but even if I did not get them in the right way , I would not try to escape from them " [ D.C. Lau , p.72 ] .
There is some question about the translation here , but the thought is clearly that if wealth and high station can only be obtained , or poverty and obscurity avoided , by wrongful actions , then the good person will still not do wrong but will willingly accept the poverty and obscurity .
While Confucians would always disparage those working for profit , they certainly had no disinclination to avoid " high station , " which eventually would be obtained through the system of Examinations ( allowing them to live off the wealth generated by others ) .
Yet Confucius treats profit and high station identically here , so one might think that pursuing high station , i.e. the government rank of a Mandarin , would be no more worthy than the wealth generation of the merchant .
The interpretation we get , indeed , is what proved advantageous for the Confucians .
Some other statements in the Analects are ambiguous but tending towards condemnation .
Thus , at VII : 12 we find , " If wealth were a permissible pursuit , I would be willing even to act as a guard holding a whip outside the market place .
If it is not , I shall follow my own preferences " [ ibid . p.87 ] .
Since we do not find Confucius working as a guard , and he does follow his own " preferences , " it looks like wealth would not be a " permissible pursuit . "
I had a student produce a Confucius quote from the internet : " One who , on seeing profit , thinks of righteousness , may be considered a perfect man [ ] . "
I tracked this down to a webpage which took it to mean , " Confucianism regards as ideal the harmony between profit and justice .
Profit ( or wealth ) per se is not regarded as immoral , but it should be in harmony with justice . "
Now , I think this all would be a constructive and beneficial interpretation of Confucius ( which the student unfortunately took to be unproblematic ) , but I am not sure we can quite get that out of the text .
It does not follow from the quote given ( Analects XIV : 12 ) , for that need not be interpreted to allow the " perfect man " to go ahead and pursue the profit after thinking of righteousness .
He may well be stopped in his tracks .
And the quote has been redacted .
In full ( according to Lau ) , it goes , " If a man remembers what is right at the sight of profit , is ready to lay down his life in the face of danger , and does not forget sentiments [ or promises ] he has repeated all his life even when he has been in straitened circumstances for a long time , he may be said to be a complete man " [ p.126 ] .
This has a very different feel to it and clearly , with the reference to danger ( and previous references to the wise ) , is not describing the righteous merchant .
Another passage whose ambiguity is a matter of the translation is Analects IV : 2 , , , " A benevolent person is content with benevolence ; a knowing person profits from benevolence . "
This aphorism is something that is a little puzzling to even the most venerable translators .
James Legge [ 1893 ] translates it , " The virtuous rest in virtue ; the wise desire virtue . "
Arthur Waley [ 1938 ] sees it as , " The Good Man rests content with Goodness ; he that is merely wise pursues Goodness in the belief that it pays to do so . "
D.C. Lau [ 1979 ] has a very prolix version , " The benevolent man is attracted to benevolence because he feels at home in it .
The wise man is attracted to benevolence because he finds it to his advantage . "
Finally , Joanna C. Lee and Ken Smith [ 2010 ] say , " A kind person is content with his kindness , a wise person uses it for further ends . "
Here we find rendered as " virtuous , " " Good , " " benevolent , " and " kind . "
The last two are appropriate .
The first two , especially Legge's , are not the right idea .
The character is translated " is translated " wise " by everyone , which is not so bad , although the basic meaning is just " knowledge . "
The key word here , however , is the heavily loaded , " profit . "
The interest of the passage is that this looks like a positive use of the word , which seems extraordinary , if not unique , for Confucius , and quite contrary to later Confucians .
The difficulty of believing this picture seems to motivate the translations of Legge and Waley .
Legge avoids the problem by translating as " desire , " which voids the dilemma posed by its actual meaning .
Waley adopts the expedient of speaking of the " merely wise , " supplying a concept that is not there in Chinese , to make it sound like the wise man is improperly motivated , as looking for something that " pays " is ignoble -- which otherwise does seem to often be the sentiment of Confucius .
D.C. Lau says much the same thing but without the sour and disparaging form .
Lee and Smith follow more succintly .
It is hard to avoid the sense that the wise / knowledgeable person knows how to derive a benefit , , from benevolence , while the merely benevolent one is content with his virtue -- he is at peace , .
But part of the problem here is just that it seems to be an unusual construction with these characters .
After Confucius , Mencius starts in after profit like bulldog .
At the very beginning of the Mencius , , King Hui of Liang asks , " Venerable sir , since you have not counted it far to come here , a distance of a thousand li , may I presume that you are provided with counsels to profit my kingdom ? "
[ James Legge translation , The Works of Mencius , Dover , 1970 , p.125 ] .
Mencius in an annoyed and irascible way answers by taking exception to the use of the word " profit . "
He is not there to do anything of profit for the King , but only of " benevolence and righteousness " [ ] .
" Let your Majesty also say , ' Benevolence and righeousness , and let these be your only themes . '
Why must you use that word ' profit ' ? " [ ibid. p.127 ] .
From such a beginning , it is not surprising what follows in the Confucian tradition .
By the way , King Hui of Liang was Hui of Wei , , one of the Six Kingdoms during the Warring States Period .
He was a first the Marquis ( Hou ) of Wei ( 344-334 ) and then King ( Wang ) of Wei ( 334-319 BC ) .
See the details of the ranks of Chinese feudal nobility elsewhere .
Liang ( ) was the capital of Wei .
It would later be one of the Six Southern Dynasties ( 502-557 AD ) .
Judge Dee afterwards would be made the Duke of Liang ( ) .
Return to text Confucius , Note 4 ; Chinese Gods
An example of a popular Chinese god would be the goddess of mercy , Kuan - yin , ( or -- Kannon or Kanzeon in Japanese , Kwanse 'um in Korean , or Quan - âm in Vietnamese ) , who was a Chinese development of the Buddhist Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara -- the one who " Observes the Sounds of the World " ( literally , avalokitâ , " observer , " îshvara , " lord " ) .
Three other popular gods in China are Fú , , Lù , , and Shòu , -- " Happiness , " " Success , " and " Longevity . "
Lù , consistent with Confucian ideas about " success , " is shown in the robes of a Chinese judge , like Judge Dee , while Shòu , consistent with religious Taoist aspirations for immorality , is shown with the grooming and accoutrements of a wandering Taoist sage .
The three gods get combined into one in Japan , Fukurokuju , , as seen at left .
A god perhaps the most familiar to Westerners , but usually misidentified , is Pu-tai , , seen at right .
He is commonly called the " Laughing Buddha " but is not a Buddha -- in popular culture , as in the Ming novel Journey to the West , ( " Record of the Western Journey " ) , he seems to be identified with the Bodhisattva Maitreya .
His name actually means " Cloth Bag , " after the bag he carries , holding presents .
He is , after a fashion , simply the Chinese Santa Claus , fat , jolly , and generous .
In Japanese his name is Hotei .
In Japanese observance , Fukurokuju and Hotei are among the Seven Lucky Gods , the Shichifukushin , , or Seven Gods of Good Fortune , who usher in a prosperous New Year .

the Mandate of Heaven Whoever is called a great minister ,
when he finds that he cannot morally serve his prince , he resigns .
Confucius , Analects XI:23/24 , translation after James Legge [ 1893 ] , Arthur Waley [ 1938 ] , D.C. Lau [ 1979 ] , and Joanna C. Lee & Ken Smith [ 2010 ] , .
When a man has been your teacher for a single day ,
you should treat him as your father for the rest of his life .
Journey to the West , , Volume II
[ Foreign Languages Press , Beijing , 1993 , 2007 , p.711 ]
The " Six Relationships " or " Six Relations , " , are supposed to be the basis of all social connections between persons , and all six are based on the fundamental relationship between parents and children .
Thus they are all variations of xiào , or " filial piety " ( Latin pietas filialis ) , the religious respect that children owe to their parents .
Originally , the " six " referred to the six members of three sets of relations , as follows :
1 2 3 4 5 6
Different versions of these three sets can be found , however , and it is possible to expand the system so as to contain six entirely different sets of relations , including the following at right :
4 5 6
While the classic form of the six relationships did contain only three pairs , the later influence of the theory of the five elements gave the impression that there should be " five relationships , " .
Being an odd number , five relationships would require five whole pairs , not two and a half pairs .
These are given with the Chinese Elements .
Teacher and student seems to be the pair that gets left out in that version -- here distinguished by a darker background , and by my not being aware of a simple two - character expression for the relationship , as with the other five .
In each of the relationships , the superior member ( father , husband , etc. ) has the duty of benevolence and care for the subordinate member ( son , wife , etc. ) .
The subordinate member has the duty of obedience .
The only exception might be the relationship between friend and friend , which may actually involve equality -- unless , of course , one is older than the other , which would turn it into a relationship like that between older and younger brother .
The reverential attitude toward the teacher ( rather like the relationship in India to the guru ) may be easily seen in the Bruce Lee movie The Chinese Connection [ 1972 ] , in which Bruce Lee avenges the murder of his boxing master , whom he all but worships , by the Japanese in 1930 's Shanghai .
The expression ( sensei , also " teacher , " in Japanese ) is used today for the title " Mr. " in Modern Chinese .
In European languages , we see feudal titles like " lord " ( Señor , Herr ) and " master " used as such an honorific , while in Chinese it is " teacher " instead .
Unlike India , where social obedience was absolute and , for instance , a wife was supposed to obey and worship her husband even if he was worthless , unfaithful , abusive , etc. ( because it would be her karma to be in such a relationship ) , obedience in the Six Relationships in China was contingent on the superior member actually observing their duty to be benevolent , , and caring .
Since the highest Confucian " obedience " is to do what is right , " true " obedience to parents , husband , ruler , etc. is to refuse to obey any orders to do what is wrong .
Refusal to obey the emperor out of " true " obedience could , of course , get one put to death ; and Chinese history celebrates such martyrs .
An emperor who was no longer benevolent , however , could also be overthrown , and that is an interesting consequence of the conditional nature of obedience .
In this area , the matter is usually stated as part of the theory of the , the " Mandate of Heaven . "
This means at least four things , the first two of which are already present in the thought of Confucius himself :
The moral order of the universe : Thus Confucius says , " At fifty I understood the Mandate of Heaven " [ Analects II : 4 ] , i.e. knew what right and wrong were , and also perhaps the design of good government .
Fate :
Thus , in the Analects one of Confucius 's students is quoted as saying , " Life and death are the Mandate of Heaven , " i.e. beyond our control [ Analects XII : 5 ] .
The right to rule :
This becomes the most important meaning of the " Mandate of Heaven . "
Knowing the moral order of the universe and actually observing it make one a worthy ruler .
Otherwise one has no business , and no right , being in power .
Such an idea is quite different from mediaeval European ideas about government , where the king ( Pope , emperor , or whatever ) often derived authority directly from God and was answerable only to God .
There was therefore no right to rebellion in Western thought until the Protestant Reformation ( which questioned the authority of Catholic rulers ) .
But the right to rule of the Chinese ruler is conditional .
The judgment of history :
This combines the " right to rule " with " fate , " for the Chinese view was that losing the Mandate of Heaven as the right to rule would shortly be followed by the actual loss of power .
The historical precedent for this was the brief and ferocious rule of the Qin Dynasty ( 255 -207 BC ) followed by the more benign and durable tenure of the Han emperors ( the Former Han 206 BC - 25 AD , the Later Han 25 AD - 220 ) .
This becomes a principle that informs the writing of Chinese history : Beginning with the Later Han Dynasty , one of first acts of a traditional Chinese dynasty was the commissioning of an official history of the previous dynasty ( in that case the great History of the Former Hàn Dynasty ) .
Such a history in effect becomes the certificate of legitimacy for the new dynasty , showing how the previous dynasty was at first benevolent but then eventually lost the Mandate of Heaven , which means it was the obligation of the new dynasty to replace it .
The history of the last Chinese dynasty , the Qing ( 1644 -1912 ) , was completed by the government of the Republic of China on Taiwan .

( 2 ) With the enemy of [ one 's slain ] father ,

The Book of Rites , translated ( 1 ) by James Legge , Intercultural Press , Beijing , Washington , 2013 , p.20 ; literal translation ( 2 ) .
The word for a classic text is Ching [ Pinyin Jing1 , Kyô in Japanese , Kinh in Vietnamese ] .
The Confucian classics [ ] are the texts of the Confucian or the Ju [ Rú ] , " Learned , " School .
Taoism [ q.v. ] has its own classics [ ] , including the Tao Te Ching [ ] ; and ching is used to translate the Sanskrit word sûtra for Buddhist texts .
Buddhism thus has its own " classics " [ ] ,
The Five Classics : 1 . I Ching , , Book of Changes 2 .
Shih Ching , , Book of Odes ( Songs / Poetry ) -- Kinh - Thi in Vietnamese 3 . Shu Ching , , Book of History 4 . Li Chi , , Records of Ritual ( or Book of Rites , the Li Ching , ) includes : 4a .
Ta Hsüeh , , The Great Learning [ 1 ] 4b .

Erh Ya , , Dictionary of Terms 12 .
Kung - yang Chuan , , commentary on Ch'un Ch'iu 13 .
Ku-liang Chuan , , commentary on Ch'un Ch'iu [ 3 ]
The I Ching , , is supposed to be the oldest of the Classics .
Indeed , its device of broken and unbroken lines appears to go back to the oracle bones of the Shang Dynasty .
It ends up as much more than just a Confucian Classic , with strong affinities to most of the rest of Chinese philosophy , especially the Yin - Yang and Taoist Schools .
The dualism and Yin and Yang is discussed here in a separate essay ; it is also used as a device for organizing the Chinese elements .
The notes in the table refer to the following glosses :
The " Five Classics " were originally supposed to correspond to the Liu Yi , or the " Six Arts , " including the Yüeh Ching , or Book of Music , which is no longer preserved as separate work , according to Fung Yu-lan ( A Short History of Chinese Philosophy , Free Press , 1948 , 1966 , p. 39 ) .
The Confucian Canon began to be taught in government schools in the Former Han Dynasty , to educate officials .
In the T'ang Dynasty , a system of civil service examinations was created to qualify officials .
It was used down to the 20th century [ note ] .
Hence , the Chinese god Lù , " prosperity , success , salary , " is seen in the robes of a Chinese judge .
The Portuguese called Chinese officials " mandarins , " getting the word from Sanskrit ( mantrin ) by way of Malay ( menteri ) , meaning " counselor . " " Mandarin " not only stuck to the officials , in many languages , but has widely become the name of the principal spoken language of China .
The Classics are listed here as given in Mathews ' Chinese - English Dictionary [ Harvard , 1972 ] under ching , character 1123 , p.156 .

@WittyUserName : Hehe .
Sorry .
Totally did n't mean to do that .
But , I 'm still of the mind to say it would be cool if the Ghostbusters game did allow for some character customization in appearance ala Mass Effect or SC4 .
KTM is best known here in the states for rip - snorting dirt bikes and the go - anywhere , do - anything Adventure motorcycle , but the Austrian firm also builds a 240 - horsepower tarmac - terrorizing car that it now plans to bring to America – and make street legal .
It 's an about - face for the company , which had long said it would offer the X - Bow only in Europe and Asia and only as a track day weapon that could n't ( legally ) be driven on the street .
" We will do whatever is possible to bring the car to the United States – that I promise , " says Hubert Trunkenpolz , managing director of U.S. sales and service , according to Dealer News .
There 's already a long line of people waiting to get one .
Dealer News says 600 people have expressed interest in buying one of the cars , which feature the same 240 - horsepower ( Hell for Leather says it 's 237 , but what 's a couple of horsepower here or there ? )
2.0 - liter turbocharged engine used in the Volkswagen GTi .
" We need the support of the VW / Audi Group and we need to overcome some legal hurdles regarding licensing , but at the end of the day we want to see this vehicle on the streets of America , " Trunkenpolz says .
So do we , because the X - Bow ( Crossbow ) is supposed to be a blast to drive .
With a carbon - fiber monocoque and minimal accoutrements , the X - bow weighs 1,543 pounds – about 500 pounds less than the Lotus Elise SC .
The chassis was developed with help from Italian race - car builders Dallara and Loris Bicocchi , who had a hand in making the Bugatti Veyron and other superexotics handle so beautifully .
The chassis produces enough downforce to achieve 1.5 - g cornering loads , and the X - Bow accelerates from zero to 62 mph ( 100 kph ) in 3.92 seconds .
That 's just a few ticks shy of the Ferrari Enzo .
Evo magazine put an X - Bow through its paces and called it " terrific . "
KTM plans to build 1,000 X - Bows a year at a plant in Graz , Austria .
No word on when it 'll arrive in the states , but Hell for Leather predicts we 'll see it in 2010 .
It remains to be seen what they 'll cost , but they go for about $ 70,000 in Europe .
" The biggest joy was on the way home .
In my cockpit window every 2 minutes I saw the earth , the moon , the sun and the whole 360 degree panorama of the heavens .
It was a powerful overwhelming experience .
Suddenly , I realized the molecules of my body and the molecules of the spacecraft and the molecules in the bodies of my partners were prototyped and manufactured in some ancient generation of stars .
It was an overwhelming sense of oneness ... a connectedness .
It was n't THEM and US .
It was ... That 's me !... That 's all of it !
It 's all one thing !
This was accompanied by an ecstasy ... a sense of " Oh My God ! "
Wow !
Yes !... an insight ... an epiphany .
The presence of divinity became almost palpable , and I knew that life in the universe was not just an accident based on random processes .
. . .
The knowledge came to me directly . "

I SAY IT loud and proud .
I 'm a conscientious objector in the lawn wars .
While my neighbors fawn over their yards with fertilizer , pesticides , and weed whackers and spend countless hours trying to cultivate a greensward worthy of left center in Fenway Park , I 've given up .
I 've decided to let nature take its course .
On Saturday mornings when the lawn mowers sound throughout the neighborhood like rolling thunder , I grab another cup of coffee and dawdle over the sports pages .
The experiment began 11 years ago , when my son was born and I decided I would no longer allow my yard to be a toxic waste dump filled with chemicals concocted to grow a lawn that did n't belong there anyway .
The fact that I live in a pine grove that makes growing grass a Herculean effort only stiffened my resolve .
The result ?
The grass may be greener on the other side of the fence , but in my yard it 's a virtual rainbow of weeds , wildflowers , and indigenous groundcover .
In early April , when the neighbors ' lawn begins to glow green with cultivated grass , and they begin charging across the yards with their fertilizer spreaders , my front yard is still as brown as mud .
" I 'm waiting for the crabgrass crop to come in , " I tell my wan - looking neighbors .
But there 's so much more than that .
A patch of purple and white violets flourishes in the side yard in early spring , and the stand of sage - colored milkweed beside the lamppost attracts goldfinches and orange and black monarch butterflies .
The pachysandra with its deep emerald leaves and creamy white flowers eventually fills in the brown spots on the lawn .
And in midsummer I even get to feast on the wild blueberries that cluster at the bottom of our tallest white pine while sniffing the aroma of sweet purple clover .
This summer I took the greening of the old homestead up a notch .
I bought a hand - push lawn mower at a yard sale for $ 2 .
Not because I wanted to save the planet , but because my gas - guzzling self - propelled mulch mower broke down .
Of course , it 's a little tricky to operate ;
God knows how you 're supposed to sharpen the sucker , and I wear hiking boots so I can kick start the blade barrel when it gets stuck on a twig or a pine cone .
My defunct CO { - 2} - belching behemoth roared right over them , but the push - mower freezes up .
I 've perfected a stutter step and hop on my left foot while kicking the barrel blade with my right and continuing along my path .
It 's a man and mower pas de deux that might have been choreographed by Mark Morris .
But now I am pure .
I snicker now when I smell power mower exhaust wafting through the tall pines of our suburban settlement .
And do n't get me started on lawn tractors .
When did we become such a nation of wimps ?
Could it be that the drivers need to cultivate something , no matter how useless , as a salute to their agriculturalist ancestors ?
Or are they just plain lazy ?
( Many of these same people get in their sport utility vehicles and drive 1 mile to the gym to get exercise ) .
And what of the noise ?
Why must we shudder in their sonic backwash while they wear iPods to drown out their own mowing noise ?
As I walk behind my gently clicking push - mower I can hear the call of the chickadees and the buzz of the cicadas in the shrubs .
Toads and garter snakes escape easily from my path .
The cat does n't bother to skitter away , nor the dog who sits happily sunning himself while I skirt his tail .
And my wife is able to take a one - hour nap with the window open above the backyard .
It takes a little extra effort , of course , but I consider it part of my exercise routine .
And if the weeds get extraordinarily high - and some do - I break out my handy scythe .
I do n't know how much gasoline I 've saved .
The 5 - gallon plastic jug I fill up each spring is in the garage draped with spider webs , but I know I 'm making the planet better one mow at a time .

Well , that certainly did n’t take long .
On July 3 , news reports said Senator John McCain , worried that he might lose the election before it truly started , opened his doors to disciples of Karl Rove from the 2004 campaign and the Bush White House .
Less than a month later , the results are on full display .
The candidate who started out talking about high - minded , civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted Mr. Rove ’s low - minded and uncivil playbook .
In recent weeks , Mr. McCain has been waving the flag of fear ( Senator Barack Obama wants to “ lose ” in Iraq ) , and issuing attacks that are sophomoric ( suggesting that Mr. Obama is a socialist ) and false ( the presumptive Democratic nominee turned his back on wounded soldiers ) .
Mr. McCain used to pride himself on being above this ugly brand of politics , which killed his own 2000 presidential bid .
But he clearly tossed his inhibitions aside earlier this month when he put day - to - day management of his campaign in the hands of one acolyte of Mr. Rove and gave top positions to two others .
The résumés of the new team ’s members included stints in Mr. Bush ’s White House and in his 2004 re-election campaign , one of the most negative and divisive in memory .
Almost immediately , the McCain campaign was using Mr. Rove ’s well - honed tactics , starting with an attempt to widen this nation ’s damaging ideological divide by painting Mr. Obama as a far - left kook .
On July 18 , Mr. McCain even suggested that Mr. Obama is a socialist to the left of the Senate ’s only avowed socialist : Bernie Sanders of Vermont .
Roughan is accused of repeatedly punching and stomping on the boy before using a knife to stab him 133 times .
" The body was then dealt with in a barbaric way , " prosecutor David Meredith said .
" The head of the deceased was sawed or chopped off and it was seperated and not buried with the body .
" It appears on the face of it to be a thrill kill . "
Mr Meredith said Jones also told friends that Roughan used the head like a puppet and a bowling ball , which Roughan denied .
The court heard friends and neighbours of both Roughan and Jones would be called as witnesses in the trial and would tell the jury how the men , both of Sandgate , borrowed a car and then drove to Dayboro in Brisbane 's north to bury Mr Shepherd 's body in a shallow grave , before later burying him again .
The court was told Roughan had already pleaded guilty to interfering with a corpse and being accessory after the fact to murder , but not guilty to murder .
However , prosecutors said the Crown would not accept the alternative charge because evidence would show Roughan was directly involved in the crime .
He said former friends of the two men would give testimony that they had conversations in which Roughan was implicated in the murder and that a wound on the other man 's hand was a result of Roughan accidently stabbing him while stabbing Mr Shepherd .
Roughan has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge .
The trial is expected to finish late next week .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Would n’t it be nice if we could shop for clothes without constantly having to try them on in the fitting room ?
The vision could soon become a reality thanks to the “ virtual mirror ” presented by Fraunhofer researchers at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin from August 29 to September 3 .
This mirror - like display enables shoppers to see themselves wearing different items of clothing without having to undo a single button .
There is more than a grain of truth in the old cliché that men hate shopping for clothes .
They find fitting rooms a nuisance and prefer to go on wearing the same things that they have always worn .
Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications , Heinrich - Hertz - Institut HHI have developed a magic mirror that takes the stress out of trying on new clothes .
You simply have to choose one T - shirt or shirt , and the virtual mirror will show you wearing a range of different designs , without having to take off one to try on another .
“ The principle is similar to the virtual shoe - fitting mirror that we developed last year for the Adidas flagship store in Paris , ” says Anna Hilsmann of the HHI .
“ But it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of T - shirts , shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror .
These items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about . ”
Textiles have elastic qualities , their structure is not always uniform , and there are innumerable details that give each material its special appeal .
These characteristics represent a challenge for the virtual mirror .
Summing up the scientific work required , Anna Hilsmann explains : “ To reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric , we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously . ”
The research team has come up with a bright idea for demonstrating their technology to the public :
At the IFA international consumer electronics show in Berlin , visitors can see how easy it is to display different logos or graphics on the same T - shirt .
So what does a stress - free fitting room look like ?
The customer stands in front of a display that has a camera mounted above it .
By filming the person , the camera registers the way their clothing flows and moves .
To change clothes , the logo on a T - shirt might be replaced with a different , virtual design , for example .
The wearer then sees their own image in the display wearing the same T - shirt but with a blue Fraunhofer logo in place of the original green one .
To make the image in the magic mirror appear as realistic as possible , the folds and creases in the clothes actually worn by the user are reproduced in the virtual representation , even when the user is moving about .
The shadows and lighting effects seen in the virtual mirror are also identical to those on the real person .
As Anna Hilsmann explains , the ingenious part consists in “ calculating the spatial parameters of the projected image on the basis of a two - dimensional model .
This reduces the number of dimensions we need to simulate the image and allows us to rapidly evaluate any movements . ”
The 2 - D model consists of a closely meshed network of triangular fields .
This is sufficient to predict any changes .
The system also knows the directions in which the fabric is capable of stretching or flowing – in other words its specific deformation behavior .
To allow the virtual image to reflect these changes as realistically as possible , the apexes of the triangles can be displaced independently of one another .
The camera shoots frames at intervals of a few milliseconds and transmits them to a memory unit .
Here , the images are analyzed to determine what changes have taken place between successive frames .
To do so , a triangular meshwork is superimposed on each frame , employing a technique commonly used in computer graphics .
Since the content of the triangular fields does n’t necessarily change from one frame to the next , the system only compares those fields where changes have actually taken place .
This information is used to create a new virtual image of the item of clothing , incorporating the new logo .
The images are processed in real time .
Consequently , users have the impression that the image reflected in the display follows every movement they make , including the way this affects the folds and creases in the clothes they are wearing , just like a real mirror .
A touch screen allows shoppers to choose different styles and colors of the garment they have selected . , helping them to decide which color or design suits them best .
“ Shoes and clothes are just the first stage , ” remarks Anna Hilsmann .
“ The virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewelry . ”
Many reluctant shoppers are likely to be relieved by the simplicity this brings to the arduous task of buying new clothes , and might even be persuaded to adopt a new look !

6:52 p.m. Warren and McCain are talking about the crisis in Georgia , which the senator refers to as " a beautiful little country . "
McCain gives ....
6:55 p.m .
When asked why he wants to be president , McCain rattles off his stump speech , almost verbatim -- the one that begins : " I believe that America 's best days are ahead of us . . . . "
7 p.m. And . . . it 's over !
McCain 's time is up , and he leaves the stage .
The running text of our live blogging continues below :
H ere is a link to the full transcript of both sections of the event .
But it 's clear , after tonight , that those differences will make for some mighty interesting debates .
It 's too early to tell how their differences will affect voters ' decisions in November .
Compared to Obama , who spoke in long , nuanced sentences and made subtle points , McCain was much more direct .
Several times he interrupted Warren to answer a question with a quick , one - sentence response .
But considering that this was a forum at a church , he did n't talk much about his personal faith .
He stuck largely to his stump speech , sprinkling it with engaging stories and anecdotes .
McCain was much more gregarious .
He usually spoke directly to the audience , punctuating about every fifth sentence with the phrase " my friends . "
And he joked a lot -- as usual -- which played well with the crowd .
They took different approaches .
Obama seemed to treat his time as an intimate conversation with Warren .
He looked directly at the pastor when he spoke and only rarely turned toward the crowd .
He talked a lot about his faith -- at one point quoting from the New Testament .
He came off as thoughtful and even - toned , if not exceedingly engaging .
This event was meant to give voters a closer look at the candidates as people , and its most significant moments did not have to do with policy but with personality .
... a short history lesson , telling Warren about the Georgian king who converted to Christianity in the third century .
He advocates a hard - line approach to Russia , saying , " Let 's send the message to the Russians that this behavior is not acceptable in the 21st century . "
6:40 p.m. Warren asks McCain about the right to privacy versus national security .
McCain says that America 's law enforcement agencies need to step up their ability to monitor new forms of communication .
" There 's a constant tension , " he says .
" It is changing with technology , and we have to change with it . "
McCain seems very loose tonight .
He 's cracking more jokes than Obama , and the crowd seems to be leaning his way .
6:20 p.m. McCain is going on and on about energy , uttering his stump speech mantra : " We need off - shore drilling , and we need it now . "
Now Warren turns to the same set of three tough social questions that he asked Obama .
These are the answers that the religious audience will be listening to closely .
Warren : " At what point does a baby get human rights ? "
McCain : Life begins " at the moment of conception . "
Warren : Define " marriage . "
McCain : " A union between one man and one woman . "
Warren : Should the government fund stem - cell research ?
McCain : Like Obama , he advocates skin - cell research as an alternative to stem - cell research .
6:17 p.m. Warren asks McCain the same question he asked Obama : " What would be the greatest moral failure of your life ? "
McCain says it was his behavior during the dissolution of his first marriage .
This is significant , because McCain does n't talk about his first marriage much .
He says he takes responsibility for the divorce .
6:15 p.m. McCain is on stage now .
Warren begins by asking him to name the three wisest people in his life .
His answers : Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , Rep. John Lewis ( a Georgia congressman and civil rights advocate ) and Meg Whitman ( the former eBay chief executive who is a close McCain adviser ) .
Obama had been asked the same question .
He listed his wife and his grandmother as the two wisest people in his life .
He said that when it came to choosing advisers to his Presidency , he would n't restrict himself to three people -- though he did mention former Georgia senator ( and potential running mate ? )
Sam Nunn as one of the wisest people in his life .
6 p.m. Obama 's segment is over .
He stands up with Warren , who calls John McCain to the stage .
And then -- the handshake !
McCain leans over to Obama , and the two lock hands .
As McCain pulls back , Obama puts his hand out to pat McCain 's shoulder .
It 's more than a little awkward .
5:55 p.m. Warren is now talking about world issues .
He asks Obama what he thinks America should do about religious persecution around the world .
Obama brings up China .
He says that while China is a close American business partner , there are " very real persecutions taking place " there .
He says Americans must also make changes to avoid charges of hypocrisy .
" We have to lead by example .
. . .
We have to make sure we 're abiding by moral law and by habeas corpus and not engaging in torture . "
The camera pans , strangely , to the audience , where a man in a big American - flag T - shirt is clapping .
5:45 p.m. Warren has moved onto domestic politics and is talking about taxes .
Warren : " Define rich . "
Obama poked fun at Warren , whose book , " The Purpose - Driven Life , " was a best - seller .
" Well , if you 've got book sales of 25 million , you qualify , " Obama jokes .
Warren laughs , gives Obama a high - five .
Then Obama elaborates : " I would argue that if you 're making more than $ 250,000 , you 're in the top 3 % or 4 % of the country , and you 're doing well . "
5:35 p.m. Warren has moved on to the tough ones -- abortion , gay marriage , stem - cell research .
Warren : " At what point does a baby get human rights ? " Obama skirts the issue .
" From a theoretical perspective or scientific , answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade . "
He goes on to say that while he is pro-choice , he is not pro-abortion .
Then Warren asks Obama to define " marriage . "
Obama begins , " I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman . "
He is interrupted by the crowd 's applause .
Then he says : " I am not someone who promotes same - sex marriage , but I do believe in civil unions .
. . .
I do n't think [ they ] inhibit in any way what my core beliefs are . "
He says he can afford civil rights to gay couples without compromising his faith .
Warren asks about stem - cell research .
Obama says that already - discarded embryos should be used for research but that it would be best to find other methods -- like adult stem - cell lines -- that are less problematic morally .
5:28 p.m .
After a commercial break that features an ad with bikini clad women doing ad work , we 're back .
Warren reads a question submitted by a church member .
( He says he received about 2,000 questions . )
Warren : " What does your faith in Jesus mean to you ? "
Obama : " It means Jesus Christ died for my sins .
. . .
I know that I do n't walk alone . "
5:16 p.m. Obama has entered the stage to polite applause and has taken a seat with Warren .
After asking Obama about the wisest people in the senator 's life , Warren asks : " What would be the greatest moral failure of your life ? "
Obama talks about his experimentation with drugs in his youth .
He says he did it because he was selfish at the time .
5 p.m . Here we go !
Rick Warren , standing on a purple - lit stage , is making his introductions .
" We believe in the separation of church and state , but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics , " he says , before explaining the format .
Each candidate will get one hour with Warren .
Obama will go first .
While he speaks , McCain wo n't be listening .
" We have safely placed Sen. McCain in a cone of silence , " Warren says to laughter .
Before he brings Obama on stage , Warren tells the crowd , " I have to tell you up front : Both these guys are my friends . "
4:53 p.m.
Inside the church , a Christian soft - rock band is warming up the audience of 3,000 .
Outside , scores of protesters clog the streets .
The Orange County Sheriff 's Department estimates that there are 1,000 people there .
Our Susannah Rosenblatt counts about 700 .
There are McCain supporters , Obama supporters , antiwar protesters , anti-illegal - immigration demonstrators , abortion rights advocates , followers of libertarian candidate Bob Barr , followers of former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and anti-same - sex - marriage protesters .
And there 's a lot of yelling and sign - waving .
Our Seema Mehta passed by the melée on her way into the church and had this to report :
One woman carried a large picture of an aborted fetus that said " Barack Obama Change This . "
Others read " Obama Mama " and " Enough Dead . "
The requisite Ron Paul and Ralph Nader supporters made an appearance .
Two people held three signs that read " God Hates Obama , " " God Hates McCain " and " America is Doomed . "
And one man , inexplicably , held a sign that said " I Like Burritos . "
Saddleback Church has got to be the safest place on the face of the Earth right now .
The 120 - acre campus was crawling with Secret Service agents , including at least four on the roof .
Two helicopters buzzed overhead .
4:32 p.m. Hello , all .
Today we ’re going to be live - blogging the Saddleback Civil Forum , with presidential contenders Barack Obama and John McCain .
The candidates will appear at the Lake Forest church this evening and give back - to - back , hourlong interviews with Pastor Rick Warren .
As our Maeve Reston reports today , the event will be an important preview of what 's to come in the three presidential debates , the first of which takes place next month at the University of Mississippi .
This will be the first time since the general - election campaign kicked off that the candidates will share a stage together .
They 're expected to talk about faith , abortion , same - sex marriage and humanitarian efforts abroad .
As we reported yesterday , Warren has promised that the conversations will get personal .
" I 'm going to deal with their personal life , because character matters , " the evangelical leader and author of " The Purpose - Driven Life " told the Christian Broadcasting Network .
" Their personal life does matter as a leader .
God says so . "
For more on Warren , who has been called " America 's most influential pastor , " check out Duke Helfand 's recent profile .
To watch live coverage alongside us , you can tune in to CNN , MSNBC , the Fox News Channel , C- SPAN , the Daystar Television Network or KDOC - TV .
And live Web streaming of the event will be available here .
We 'll have a play - by - play of the candidates ' conversations with Warren as well as dispatches from our reporters inside and outside the church .

University of Calgary climate change scientist David Keith and his team are working to efficiently capture the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide directly from the air , using near - commercial technology .
In research conducted at the U of C , Keith and a team of researchers showed it is possible to reduce carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) – the main greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming – using a relatively simple machine that can capture the trace amount of CO 2 present in the air at any place on the planet .
" At first thought , capturing CO 2 from the air where it's at a concentration of 0.04 per cent seems absurd , when we are just starting to do cost - effective capture at power plants where CO 2 produced is at a concentration of more than 10 per cent , " says Keith , Canada Research Chair in Energy and Environment .
" But the thermodynamics suggests that air capture might only be a bit harder than capturing CO 2 from power plants .
We are trying to turn that theory into engineering reality . "
The research is significant because air capture technology is the only way to capture CO 2 emissions from transportation sources such as vehicles and airplanes .
These so - called diffuse sources represent more than half of the greenhouse gases emitted on Earth .
" The climate problem is too big to solve easily with the tools we have , " notes Keith , director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy , Environment and Economy 's ( ISEEE ) Energy and Environmental Systems Group and a professor of chemical and petroleum engineering .
advertisement
" While it 's important to get started doing things we know how to do , like wind power nuclear power and ' regular ' carbon capture and storage , it 's also vital to start thinking about radical new ideas and approaches to solving this problem . "
Energy - efficient and cost - effective air capture could play a valuable role in complementing other approaches for reducing emissions from the transportation sector , such as biofuels or electric vehicles , says David Layzell , ISEEE 's Executive Director .
" David Keith and his team have developed a number of innovative ways to achieve the efficient capture of atmospheric carbon .
That is a major step in advancing air capture as a solution to a very pressing problem , " Layzell says .
" David Keith 's vision and originality are key factors in our ranking this year as the top engineering school in Canada for sustainability initiatives , both in terms of research and curriculum , " says Elizabeth Cannon , Dean of the Schulich School of Engineering .
" Leaders like this are not commonplace , and we are proud to get behind this kind of leadership at the Schulich School . "
Air capture is different than the carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technology which is a key part of the Alberta and federal governments ' strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
CCS involves installing equipment at , for example , a coal - fired power plant to capture carbon dioxide produced during burning of the coal , and then pipelining this CO 2 for permanent storage underground in a geological reservoir .
advertisement
Air capture , on the other hand , uses technology that can capture – no matter where the capture system is located – the CO 2 that is present in ambient air everywhere .
" A company could , in principle , contract with an oilsands plant near Fort McMurray to remove CO 2 from the air and could build its air capture plant wherever it 's cheapest – China , for example – and the same amount of CO 2 would be removed , " Keith says .
Keith and his team showed they could capture CO 2 directly from the air with less than 100 kilowatt - hours of electricity per tonne of carbon dioxide .
Their custom - built tower was able to capture the equivalent of about 20 tonnes per year of CO 2 on a single square metre of scrubbing material – the average amount of emissions that one person produces each year in the North American - wide economy .
" This means that if you used electricity from a coal - fired power plant , for every unit of electricity you used to operate the capture machine , you'd be capturing 10 times as much CO 2 as the power plant emitted making that much electricity , " Keith says .
The U of C team has devised a new way to apply a chemical process derived from the pulp and paper industry cut the energy cost of air capture in half , and has filed two provisional patents on their end - to - end air capture system .
The technology is still in its early stage , Keith stresses .
" It now looks like we could capture CO 2 from the air with an energy demand comparable to that needed for CO 2 capture from conventional power plants , although costs will certainly be higher and there are many pitfalls along the path to commercialization . "
Nevertheless , the relatively simple , reliable and scalable technology that Keith and his team developed opens the door to building a commercial - scale plant .
Richard Branson , head of Virgin Group , has offered a $ 25 - million prize for anyone who can devise a system to remove the equivalent of one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide or more every year from the atmosphere for at least a decade .
Technical details of the air capture technology are available at : http://www.ucalgary.ca/~keith/AirCapture.html
Few will have seen a sky like it .
Yet this extraordinary - looking cloud formation was n't photographed in exotic climes , but in St Albans , Hertfordshire , on a recent August evening .
What is it and how did it form ?
MAMMATUS FORMATION
The bobbly clouds that make this image so startling are called mammatus clouds - a name derived from the Latin word for breast .
They hang under the main body of other clouds .
" There is one prerequisite for a mammatus formation - a big thunderstorm - because they form on the back edge of retreating storms , " says BBC broadcast meteorologist Peter Gibbs .
In storms , air moves in rapid " up draughts " and " down draughts " and mammatus clouds are essentially pockets of air and water droplets which have descended in downward draughts , he says .
While the whole cloud might measure 0.5 of a mile ( 0.8 km ) across , each mammatus cloud or " udder " is several metres wide .
They are also referred to as " supplementary features " because they are arguably not clouds in their own right , says Gavin Pretor - Pinney , who runs the Cloud Appreciation Society .
Mammatus formations can be seen on any type of cloud but look most dramatic on the cumulonimbus thunderclouds seen here , he says .
They will usually last no more than five to 10 minutes .
Return CUMULONIMBUS
THUNDERCLOUDS
Grey , brooding cumulonimbus clouds cause thunderstorms .
They are menacingly dark because they are about four to five miles ( 6.4 - 8 km ) thick or tall , according to Mr Gibbs .
They contain ice crystals which frequently produce hail stones and torrential rain .
Return LOW SUN According to experts , the low lying sun at 7.30 pm , when this picture was taken is what makes this formation so spectacular , because it highlights the edge of the clouds and brings out their formation .
" The lighting is just right in this photo - but mammatus formations are not just a British phenomenon , they can be seen all over the world , " adds Mr Gibbs .
Return OTHER OBSERVATIONS
Mammatus formations are not that uncommon , they occur after most thunderstorms , says Mr Gibbs .
But dramatic scenes like this are only captured about once a year , says Mr Pretor - Pinney .
The clouds are about 15 miles ( 24 km ) away in this photo , he estimates .
Mammatus clouds might be behind some UFO sightings .
" These visually arresting clouds draw attention to the beauty and drama of what is happening in the sky - and people spend too long looking at their feet , " says Mr Pretor - Pinney .
The picture was taken by Ian Pattison , 31 , on 12 August .

Sex infections in young up again
By Nick Triggle
Health reporter , BBC News
Young people have been warned to take greater care
Sex infections continue to rise with experts issuing a stark warning over the behaviour of young people .
There was a 6 % rise in sex infections in the UK in 2007 compared to 2006 , but this comes at a time when the numbers being tested is rising rapidly .
Half of the total were in people aged 16 - 24 , despite the fact they represent just one in eight of the population , the Health Protection Agency said .
The HPA said youngsters needed to be tested regularly , and take more care .
See figures for sexually transmitted infections Professor Peter Borriello , director of the HPA 's Centre for Infections , said : " It is increasingly the case that many young people see a casual shag as part of the territory , it is part of life . "
Young people still are n't getting the education and the services they need to manage their health and relationships
Lisa Power , of the Terrence Higgins Trust
But he added : " Increasingly a shag now stands for syphilis , herpes , anal warts and gonorrhoea . "
He said the solution was more regular screening and for young people to take more responsibility for themselves .
Across all age groups 397,990 new STIs were diagnosed in UK sexual health clinics in 2007 - an increase from 375,843 in 2006 .
The 16 - 24 - year - old age group accounted for 65 % of all new chlamydia cases diagnosed in 2007 , 55 % of genital warts and 50 % of gonorrhoea .
But to put this in context just over 1 % of this age group tested positive for chalmydia , which is the most common type of infection .
Overall chlamydia and genital warts were up 7 % , while herpes increased by 20 % - although this was partly put down to a better testing technique .
Both gonorrhoea and syphilis fell slightly .
More tests
However , some of the rises have been attributed to more people being tested .
A national chlamydia screening programme has been in the process of being rolled out since 2003 .
And overall the number of screens has risen by 10 % in the past year and by 61 % since 2003 .
Lisa Power , of the Terrence Higgins Trust , acknowledged better testing was playing a key role .
But she added : " Young people still are n't getting the education and the services they need to manage their health and relationships . "
The opposition parties both said the government had been complacent .
Shadow health minister Anne Milton said the figures showed the " cost of failure " , while the Lib Dem 's Norman Lamb linked them to cuts in public health budgets .
But health minister Dawn Primarolo said while the figures were a concern , it was important to remember there had been an increase in screening .
" That means more people are being screened and therefore detected . "

What are these ?
Most planets featured in science fiction tend to be rather generic .
These planets are usually convenient celestial bodies upon which to pitch a narrative tent for a few scenes before the plot moves on .
Generic planets also tend to be one - note , reflecting some particular environment on Earth .
You have your ice - worlds , desert worlds , lava worlds , jungle worlds , water worlds , city worlds , forest worlds ( in particular , forests that look like those near the city of Vancouver ) , earthquake worlds , and so on .
But sometimes an author will create a world whose presence has a weight and ring of truth , a world that feels like it could happily go on existing on its own terms , with or without a protagonist or antagonist strolling around on its surface .
Setting aside obviously artificial habitats like ring words or hollowed out asteroids , here are my top ten best science fiction planets , in chronological order :
Solaris ( 1961 ) :
You may or may not have liked the films , but Stanislaw Lem ’s conception of a world so utterly alien that it defies any genuine human comprehension still resonates .
Dune ( 1965 ) : Best Planet Ever .
At first glance , it ’s just one of those one - note desert worlds .
But Frank Herbert created a complete ecosytem , deep geological history , and a complex native society to go with his sand - covered planet .
Dune is no mere backdrop , it drives the plot of Herbert ’s complex saga as inexorably as the law of gravity .
Annares ( 1974 ) : Ursula LeGuin ’s novel
The Dispossessed featured two worlds , a more - or - less straightforward analog for cold - war era Earth , and the far more interesting Annares , where settlers established an anarcho - syndicate - based society in a bid to be free from authoritarian government .
LeGuin created a believable society for Annares — including the unpleasant side effects ( such as intellectual conservatism ) of trying to create a human utopia .
Mote Prime ( 1974 ) : In Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle ’s The Mote in God ’s Eye , this is the homeworld of the Moties , a species that , due to cosmic happenstance , has been bottled up in its solar system ever since it evolved .
Mote Prime is planet which has become a palimpsest , mutely testifying to the endless cycles of technological development and collapse experienced by the trapped Moties .
LV - 426 ( 1979 ) :
The dread planet that featured briefly in Alien , and was the location for 1986 ’s Aliens .
In both movies , LV - 426 is perfectly portrayed as part of a cosmos utterly indifferent to human concerns , such as staying alive .
Dagobah ( 1980 ) : The Star Wars franchise is a planet - producing machine : Tatooine , Yavin IV , Alderan , Hoth , Endor , Coruscant , Naboo , etc , etc .
But Dagobah sticks out for its organic messiness and claustrophobic atmosphere that stands in contrast to the typical open spaces that provide the large stages for the movies ’ space opera .
Lusitania ( 1986 ) : The setting of Orson Scott Card ’s Speaker for the Dead , Lusitania is the exception that proves the rule — it is fascinating not because it is a rich world , but because its ecosystem has so little diversity , and the implications that has for the book ’s characters .
Red , Green and Blue Mars ( 1993 - 1996 ) : Kim Stanley Robinson ’s MarsTrilogy has become the standard against which all hard science fiction books about Mars are weighed .
Beginning in the near future , with the founding of the first permanent outpost on the red planet , and continuing for two centuries as Mars is terraformed , Robinson ’s Mars is a meticulously researched and believable fictional version of our solar system neighbor .
P2 ( 2004 ) : P2 is a world orbiting the nearby Barnard ’s star , and it is settled by fantastically advanced exiles from the solar system in Wil McCarthy ’s Lost in Transmission .
Unfortunately , all their technology can’t make up for some basic deficiencies in the carrying capacity of the Barnard system , and what happens to P2 is reminiscent of Flowers for Algernon , but on a planetary scale .
Nasqueron ( 2004 ) : A gas giant , home of the maddeningly unconcerned Dwellers , and location of much of Iain M. Banks ’
The Algebraist .
Nasqueron becomes not just the huge canvas the Banks requires for his sprawling tales , but also becomes an integral element in the plot , as the protagonist struggles to understand the Dwellers .

WASHINGTON --
The House of Representatives defeated the White House 's historic $ 700 billion financial - rescue package -- a stunning turn of events that sent the stock market into a tailspin and added to concerns that the U.S. faces a prolonged recession if the legislation is n't revived .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sustained its biggest point drop in history and its biggest closing decline since the day the markets re-opened after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
The Dow , which had opened sharply lower on fears of ...
As Barack Obama moves to broaden his appeal beyond loyal Democrats , a chorus of anger and disappointment has arisen from the left .
But those voices are a distinct minority because the party has a more pressing concern : winning in November .
On Wednesday , Obama again bucked his liberal allies , voting in the Senate to give legal immunity to phone companies that took part in warrantless wiretapping after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Critics chided Obama for the vote -- which put him crossways with dozens of Democratic colleagues , including Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York .
The vote , a reversal of an earlier pledge , was Obama ’s latest perceived step away from his party ’s base on a range of issues , among them the death penalty , gun control and taxpayer money for religious groups .
Reaction has been swift and -- aside from the blogosphere and some newspaper columnists -- notably mild .

“ We ’re willing to work through this period , ” said Richard Parker , president of the liberal Americans for Democratic Action , one of the party ’s most enduring advocacy groups .
In the long run , he said , the organization ’s “ serious concerns ” about Obama are far outweighed by its disagreements with Republican John McCain .
Gerald Austin , a veteran Democratic strategist , put it more succinctly : “ When I hear people complaining . . .
I tell them I have one thing to say : ‘ President John McCain .
Three Supreme Court appointments . ’
That ’s all I need to say . ”
Obama denies any sort of shape - shifting .
Campaigning in Georgia on Tuesday , the Illinois senator said that those who see him as moving to the center “ have n’t been listening . ”
“ Everybody has become so cynical about politics that the assumption is you must be doing everything for political reasons , ” Obama said .
“ And the message I want to send to everybody is :
You ’re not going to agree with me on 100 % of what I think .
But do n’t assume that if I do n’t agree with you on something , that it must be because I ’m doing that politically .
I may just disagree with you . ”

At the very least , Obama has changed his tone and his emphasis after competing with Clinton for months to seem truest to the Democratic Party ’s traditional values .
Last week alone , Obama gave a speech on his support for public funding of social programs run by religious groups , and another on patriotism , wearing a flag pin on his lapel .
The week before , he welcomed the Supreme Court ’s decision overturning a handgun ban in the District of Columbia and criticized its ruling against the death penalty for child rape .
On Wednesday , he voted for the wiretapping bill , which passed 69 to 28 .
Obama has called his support a “ close call , ” saying the measure enabled authorities to investigate suspected terrorists but put limits on a president ’s power to approve wiretaps .
Few voters cast their ballots based on a single issue , making much of the discussion of Obama ’s evolution -- real or imagined -- just so much talk by political insiders .
Significantly , though , many have accepted what they see as Obama ’s shift .
Advertisement
“ At some point , it does cause a problem , ” said Kathryn Kolbert , president of the People for the American Way , another liberal advocacy group .
“ Is he there yet ?
Probably not . ”
It is hardly unusual for a candidate to move toward the middle in a general election ; in fact , it is fairly standard operating procedure .
That is part of what bothers some on the left .
Ben Austin , a former Clinton White House political deputy and early Obama supporter , called the senator ’s perceived drift “ unnecessary and potentially counterproductive ” for a candidate who aspires to be a transformational figure .
“ To the extent progressives see him as the Reagan of the left , Reagan did n’t tack toward the center , ” Austin said .
“ He moved the American electorate to the right . ”

The greater danger for Obama may come from outside the party .
His recent statements have made it easier for McCain to undercut his image by portraying him as just another garden - variety politician “ willing to change positions , break campaign commitments and undermine his own words in his quest for higher office , ” as Tucker Bounds , a spokesman for the Arizona senator , put it .
But McCain is also vulnerable to charges of flip - flopping , above all for embracing the Bush tax cuts that he once dismissed as giveaways to the rich .
The last Democrat to occupy the White House , Bill Clinton , benefited from the same sort of shrugging acceptance from the left .
A few years in the political wilderness can do a lot to promote party unity .
In 1992 , Clinton ran on a platform that included deficit reduction and “ ending welfare as we know it ” -- hardly Democratic orthodoxy .
Clinton , then the governor of Arkansas , also left the campaign trail to preside over the execution of a mentally incapacitated inmate , Ricky Ray Rector , and famously went before Jesse Jackson ’s Rainbow Coalition to repudiate Sister Souljah , a hip - hop artist and political activist .

While there was some outcry from liberal activists , the overwhelming majority of Democrats -- and liberal voters -- stuck with Clinton in the fall .
More significantly , the moves strengthened Clinton ’s reputation as “ a different kind of Democrat , ” broadening his appeal and helping him win a three - way contest against President George H.W. Bush and independent Ross Perot .
No two elections are the same .
Clinton no doubt gained mightily from the fact that there was no blogosphere back in 1992 :
The “ net - roots ” have been a source of much of the anxiety over Obama ’s moves .
But one similarity is a deep hunger among Democrats to take back the White House -- which has made many in the party willing to stomach views they might have once rejected .
Paul Helmke , president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , disagreed with Obama ’s support for the ruling on the right to bear arms .
But from a pragmatic standpoint , Helmke said , “ I think Obama probably played it the right way politically . ”

( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX )
Back story
President Bush acknowledged the existence of the Terrorist Surveillance Program in December 2005 , after it was first reported by the New York Times .
Advertisement
The program -- under which the National Security Agency monitors electronic communications , including e-mail and phone calls -- was aimed at identifying potential terrorists who were communicating with people in the United States .
As part of the program , U.S. telecommunications companies secretly granted government access to e-mails and phone calls on their networks .
Bush said the program had thwarted a number of attacks .
Critics have alleged that the program circumvented the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 .
That law created a secret , independent court to handle government requests for electronic surveillance in terrorism and espionage cases .
The law was enacted as a check on executive power after the Watergate scandal .
Bush has said he did not believe he needed court approval for the surveillance program , citing his authority as commander in chief and the authorization to use military force issued by Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks .
In January 2007 , the Bush administration said it would cease eavesdropping on international calls involving “ U.S. persons ” -- people or companies -- without first getting a court warrant .
Advertisement
In spring 2007 , the U.S. FISA court ruled that spy agencies were in violation of the law for warrantless interception of e-mails or phone calls that traveled through the United States .
In August 2007 , alarmed by the court ruling , the Bush administration pressured Congress to pass temporary FISA changes -- the Protect America Act -- in a scramble before leaving on its summer break .
Democrats complained of White House pressure tactics and vowed to revisit the issue .
This March , the House defied Bush ’s veto threat and passed a wiretapping law that did not shield telecommunications companies from lawsuits for cooperating with government eavesdropping .

Did you know that we have a Biblical responsibility to keep track our finances ?
Proverbs 27:23 says that we should “ Know well the condition of your flocks , and give attention to your herds , ”
You see , thousands of years ago , wealth was measured differently than it is today .
They obviously did n’t have paper money , but it was n’t just silver and gold that functioned as the indicators of wealth .
In fact , if you look at Genesis 13:2 , it says , ” Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold . ”
Is n’t it interesting that in this verse livestock is mentioned BEFORE silver and gold in defining his wealth ?
My point is that a modern take on Proverbs 27:23 might read like this , “ Pay attention to your money and know what ’s going on with it . ”
Just in case you want more evidence , check out the Parable of the Talents as it is a fantastic illustration on Biblical stewardship and our role as stewards of the money that has been entrusted to us .
So what does this mean practically ?
This could be a good argument for budgeting , but just in case that is too far of a leap for me to convince you of right now , at the very least start tracking your net worth once a year .
Do n’t worry , it is extremely easy to do and wo n’t take you much time .
Step - by - step instruction to calculate and track your Net worth
I made this video to show you how to track it and how to automate it so you can do it one time and have it tracked automatically in the future .
Oh , and if you use the tool I use they have a $ 20 signup bonus offer as well !
( see their site for more details )
Why track Net Worth ?
Your net worth gives you a true and accurate picture of your current financial situation in a way that nothing else does .
It is easy to assume that having a nice salary means that you are going to do well financially , but often that just is NOT true .
On the other hand , some people assume that their low salary means that they are doomed financially .
That is NOT true either .
Your net worth shows you what is ACTUALLY going on with your money , instead of what you think or hope is going on .
Why Net Worth rather than just debt ?
The primary reason I love using Net Worth as a gauge of your financial progress rather than the amount of debt you have is because it is more encouraging .
When you look at your amount of debt to track progress , you are only seeing the fruit of paying down those debts .
On the other hand , your Net Worth increases for every good financial decision you make .
For example , you can increase your Net Worth with the following actions :
Paying off credit cards or car loans
Paying more towards your mortgage
Buying property
Funding a Roth IRA
Contributing to your 401( k )
Building an emergency fund
Buying index funds , mutual funds , or dividend paying stocks
Or even just not spending as much money
There are many more things you can do to increase your Net Worth , but these are some of the bigger and more common ones .
It changes how you think about buying decisions
The second reason I prefer to use my Net Worth to track my progress is because I have found it helps change how I think about my buying decisions .
One of the most valuable financial lessons I have learned can be summed up in this video .
The gist is that we should spend more of our money on things that will keep cash in your pocket .
So they should at the very least :
maintain their value ,
but better yet increase in value
and the best would be increase in value and provide you income as well .
On the other hand , you should avoid buying things that are going to take cash from your pocket .
Coincidentally , these are most of the things most of us spend our money on .
When you buy clothes , food , electronics , decorations , cars , entertainment , you are ( generally ) using cash for something that is going down in value and therefore decreasing your Net Worth .
Examples of this would be :
Spending $ 200 on new clothes
A $ 50 steak dinner
Going to the Yankees game
A brand new BMW
Think about how much you could sell each of these for 2 years from now .
Each one of them is a depreciating asset , so 2 years later they would not be worth what you paid for it , if anything at all .
Obviously there is more to life than Net Worth , and you can never avoid spending money on depreciating assets , but you can avoid spending ALL of your money on depreciating assets .
This is the key to why many people never get ahead financially .
They spend all of their money on stuff that goes down in value .
Once you start buying things that increase in value , you begin building a snowball that just grows larger and larger , faster and faster .
I do n’t want to get the cart ahead of the horse , so lets get back to our Net Worth .
The reason I mentioned this is because I want you to be thinking about the end result of each buying decision .
None of the things listed above are necessarily wrong , but they should be thought about and decided upon rather than just reacting to what you “ feel like doing ” .
Your Net Worth will reflect each buying decision that you make – good or bad – and as such it is the most encouraging view of our financial progress .
Do n’t bury your head in the sand
There was a time in my life where it felt easier to just ignore my financial situation , rather than face the realities of it .
I was burying my head in the sand thinking that if I just ignored it , it would get better or maybe just go away .
Unfortunately it does n’t work like that .
I believe God wants us to know exactly where we are financially , so He can get the glory when He does the miraculous in our finances .
Moses had to get up close to the Red Sea BEFORE God parted it .
God did n’t part it when they were miles away .
I suspect that He wanted the Israelites to get an up close and personal view of the insurmountable obstacle in their path .
By doing so , they would much better understand the scope of the miracle that God was doing in their lives – and that it would be a story that they could tell of God ’s faithfulness for generations to come .
Regardless of how much of a mess you are in financially , find out where you really are – your starting point if you will – so you can start building your testimony .
The first time I calculated mine
When I did this for the first time in 2005 I found mine to be NEGATIVE 13k .
Initially I was discouraged by this number , but I quickly noticed that it was increasing every month as I began doing slightly less dumb things with my money . 😉
And now as I look back at all the miraculous things that God has done in our financial life I am so glad that I have that as part of my testimony .
I am honestly glad that it was negative , because it makes the story that much better .
If you have n’t done this , let ’s do it today and start building your testimony .
Take action in the next 3 days
Do yourself a favor and carve out some time this weekend to do this .
Depending on your situation you might be able to do this in 15 minutes or less .
In the step - by - step video I created showing you how to calculate it , I also show a tool that I am using to track it that I love and is free to use .
And for a limited time they are offering a $ 20 signup bonus for new customers ( check their website for details on this ) .
Just watch the video below to find out more .
How to calculate your Net Worth
There are 2 ways that I ’ve used to calculate my net worth .
The new way that I have been using is by using Personal Capital .
Basically it is an extremely secure website that allows them to monitor ( not make changes ) all your financial accounts in one place .
It is completely free to use , and provides a great snapshot of your overall financial picture .
It is the quickest and easiest way to calculate your net worth and continually monitor it over time .
All you need to do is :
1 Create your free account with Personal Capital
To see more about what they do check out this video :
2 Add all your financial accounts : banking , investments , credit cards , mortgages , etc .
Just click the “ + Link ” button in the left corner .
Then you will see a popup box that looks like this and from here you can search for each of your accounts .
Unless you have a ton of accounts , you can probably do this in under 10 minutes and then you will have your net worth nicely displayed to you as you can see in this screenshot below .
And unfortunately , this is n’t a screenshot of my personal account ( but rather a healthy demo account ) .
They even have an iPhone app , so you can calculate your Net Worth while you are sitting in the doctor ’s office .
My Old Method of Net Worth Tracking
Before Personal Capital came along to automate this process , I used to just do it manually every 6 months or so in a spreadsheet , just like how I track my household budget .
I have created a template from my own balance sheet that you can use if you would like .
You can download it here .
1 . Get a spreadsheet
First off , you can do this on paper if you really want to , but I suggest Excel , Google docs , Open Office , or really any kind of spreadsheet will do .
2. Total your assets
List every asset you can think of .
Anything that you could realistically sell .
For the purposes of sanity and simplicity , I do n’t bother with items under about $ 500 .
Yea , I am sure I could find someone on Ebay to buy my socks , but I am just looking for a general picture .
So I just lump together all these smaller items as one line called “ Misc items ” and take a conservative guess of what they could be sold for .
So your house , cars , retirement accounts , stocks , savings accounts , checking accounts , emergency fund , jewelry , and anything else similar would fall in this assets category .
To get real estate values you can use Zillow to get a decent estimate of what your home may be worth .
For automobiles you can check out Kelley Blue Book to see what they could be sold for .
For all your checking , savings and investment accounts you can either check the balances online , or just use your last statement .
Once you have them all listed with the estimated selling / liquidation value you can total them up .
3 . Total your liabilities
A few lines below the Assets total , we are going to now list every debt you have .
Mortgages , credit cards , student loans – they all apply .
Do the same as above , checking balances on each one and then total your debts to get your liability total .
4. Subtract them
Now you can subtract your liability total from your asset total and viola !
You have your Net Worth .
Date it and save it .
Now what ?
When I first calculated my Net Worth , it was -$ 13,843.84 .
This was eye - opening to me .
I knew I had a bunch of debt , but did n’t realize how below par I was .
Regardless of what your number is , just look at it as the starting point .
It is from this point that it will become larger .
After we had been working at it for one year , it was up nearly $ 15 K to +$ 746 !
We were so excited to have a positive Net Worth !
Even if it was only $ 746 .
As we kept on working on it , it has just continued to grow .
I normally check on my Net Worth two times a year .
But if you are working really hard at it and need to see the encouragement of it increasing , do it more !
As in just about anything , you are either moving forward or you are going backwards .
If you are increasing your assets by making good buying decisions or minimizing debts , your net worth will be growing .
Homework :
Your homework tonight is to calculate your Net Worth , using either Personal Capital , a spreadsheet , or a pencil and paper .

When it comes to sexual promiscuity , Madonna 's got nothing on the average free - loving , masturbation - happy bottlenose dolphin .
So I learned this morning at The Sex Lives of Animals , opening today at the Museum of Sex in New York City .
The exhibit contains everything you ever wanted to know about animal sex but were afraid to ask .
Heck , it 's probably more than you ever wanted to know , much less thought of asking .
Upon entering , wall text informs attendees that animals " participate in an astounding array of sexual behaviors , where all conceivable sex acts and sexual partnerships exist . "
Indeed they do – and things get crazy well before the sex .
There 's the sheer startling variety of animal sexual physiology : in about half the animal kingdom , individuals possess both male and female genitalia .
Many species have three genders , if not more .
Male Bornean fruit bats have milk - producing mammary glands ; female hyenas have a pseudo - penis .
Male barnacles are relatively better endowed than any other animal , and some tropical fish switch sex on demand .
Then we start getting into behaviors , which truly are astounding .
Hermaphroditic banana slugs sometimes chew off their own penises .
The aforementioned dolphins live in long - term , multiple - partner open relationships .
Red deer spontaneously ejaculate by rubbing their antlers against the ground .
Bedbug sex is every bit as horrid as you 'd imagine .
Baboons , bonobos and other primates engage in sex so frequently and variously that one wonders where wildlife documentarians get their G - rated footage .
( And the once - cute prairie vole , insufferable ever since conservatives used them as lessons in purity ?
They 're faithful and monogamous only when their booty calls go unanswered . )
It 's quite a show , and its centerpieces – life - size sculptures of copulating animals , including a deer threesome , by Norweigan artist
Rune Olsen – are stunning .
But for reasons I 'm still trying to explain to myself , I came away slightly unsettled .
" By exploring the most intimate part of life , " reads another gallery text , " we can appreciate the significance of research on animal sexuality and , perhaps , extrapolate these concepts to larger issues regarding sexuality in general . "
A noble goal , no doubt , especially when confronted with the moral opprobrium of bedroom police .
Calling homosexuality or most any other sexual behavior " unnatural " is simply inaccurate .
But sex – sexuality – is n't always a matter of mere physicality , or even pleasure .
It 's psychological ; it 's emotional ; it 's more than bodies .
And except for the human - like eyes of Olsen 's sculptures , that 's generally the level at which Sex Lives approaches its subjects .
It 's hard to interpet the animals ' behavior as anything else than getting their rocks off ; and when the sex takes place in a social context , as with primates , it still feels utilitarian rather than personal .
In short , Sex Lives goes a long way to dispelling our sanitized illusions of animal sexuality , but is n't without its own illusions .
And in some ways , these make it harder for us to interpret animal sexuality for ourselves , as with the shellbacked mates of Italo Calvino 's " The
Loves of the Tortoises , " who prompt Calvino to contemplate the nature of eros and union .
Also absent from Sex Lives is love .
That condition is not , it seems , uniquely human , and deserves as much consideration as any other in a discussion of sexuality .
And as the exhibit correctly places humans on the animal spectrum , one wishes they 'd saved a little space for the strangest and rarest of all sexual creatures : happy , faithful lovers .

TOKYO ( AP )  U.S. officials have found that an American nuclear submarine leaked radiation for more than two years and may have affected Japanese ports more extensively than initially thought , Japan 's government said Thursday .
The Foreign Ministry said a report provided by the U.S. Embassy showed that the USS Houston " has been steadily leaking a small amount " of radiation from June 2006 until last month , when it entered a dry dock in Hawaii .
Last week , the U.S. Navy notified Japan that the submarine may have leaked a small amount of radiation during three visits to the southern Japanese ports of Sasebo and Okinawa in March and April this year , but the amount caused no threat to humans or the environment .
It said at the time that slightly radioactive water may have been slowly leaking from a valve since March as the Los Angeles - class submarine traveled around the Pacific .
According to the U.S. Embassy report , provided by the ministry , the submarine was also leaking during nine earlier port calls in Japan .
It said the submarine made three previously undisclosed calls at Sasebo in July 2006 and in February and April 2007 , two port calls in 2007 in Yokosuka , a large U.S. naval base near Tokyo , and four in Okinawa in 2007 .
The report said the total leakage was still negligible and was below the limit of detection by personnel on the ship .
Embassy officials were not available for comment Thursday evening .
The radiation leak has caused a stir in Japan , where the continued presence of the U.S. military and its nuclear vessels remains controversial .
News of the incident also comes just weeks ahead of the arrival of the nuclear - powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington to be based in Yokosuka , just south of Tokyo .
The carrier 's arrival , originally set for August under a Japan - U.S. security alliance , was delayed until late September because of a fire aboard the vessel in May , another incident that has caused safety concerns in Japan .

Over the weekend , Democratic senator Barack Obama made a public statement during his presidential campaign trail in Titusville , Florida .
Whilst responding to a question about oceanic research , Obama elaborated on his plans for the future of NASA .
Previously , there have been hints that a possible Obama Presidency would see a reduction in space funding in favour of a boost in education spending .
However , Saturday ’s statement was followed by some detailed text on Obama ’s campaign blog outlining his priorities for the US dominance in space , the possibility of extending the Shuttle ’s operations and speeding up development of the Constellation program …
Many will argue that NASA is operating on a shoestring budget as it is under the current Republican US government , so when reports circulated that the Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama was n’t prioritising NASA spending , many became concerned about the bleak future for the space program should Obama be voted in .
Republican candidate John McCain has always said that if he is voted in that NASA funding would continue to be a priority .
However , in the most detailed statement yet about his vision for the future of NASA , Obama has stated , “ we have an administration that has set ambitious goals for NASA without giving NASA the support it needs to reach them . ”
This sentiment will be shared by many , not least by NASA officials , who have become very worried about the US position in space .
Dr. Michael Griffin , NASA ’s Director , is fully aware of the international competition the US space agency is facing .
In a recent interview with the BBC , Griffin was realistic about China beating the US back to the Moon .
“ Certainly it is possible that if China wants to put people on the Moon , and if it wishes to do so before the United States , it certainly can .
As a matter of technical capability , it absolutely can . ” he said .
Ultimately , NASA is overstretched and under - funded , but will Obama ’s promises be followed through after the election campaign trail ?
Regardless , Obama has some big policy plans indicating his increased interest in space exploration .
Firstly , he is highly critical of the current funding situation and voices his concern about the Shuttle - Constellation “ 5 - year gap ” :
“ And we have to do more than provide short - term relief .
We have to secure our long - term prosperity and strengthen America ’s competitiveness in the 21st century .
One of the areas where we are in danger of losing our competitive edge is our space program .
When I was growing up , NASA inspired the world with achievements we are still proud of .
Today , we have an administration that has set ambitious goals for NASA without giving NASA the support it needs to reach them .
As a result , they ’ve had to cut back on research , and trim their programs , which means that after the Space Shuttle shuts down in 2010 , we ’re going to have to rely on Russian spacecraft to keep us in orbit . ”
These points are shared by others .
U.S. Senator Bill Nelson recently headed a rally at Cape Canaveral in response to the announced Shuttle retirement job losses , voicing his opinion that once the Shuttle is shelved , NASA will rely on Russia for human space flight .
This would have the effect of losing skilled spacecraft engineers in the US , only to provide jobs in Russia .
Obama confronts this concern and highlights Nelson ’s aims for the future of Cape Canaveral employees :
“ We can not cede our leadership in space .
That ’s why I will help close the gap and ensure that our space program does n’t suffer when the Shuttle goes out of service by working with Senator Bill Nelson to add at least one additional Space Shuttle flight beyond 2010 ; by supporting continued funding for NASA ; by speeding the development of the Shuttle ’s successor ; and by making sure that all those who work in the space industry in Florida do not lose their jobs when the Shuttle is retired – because we cannot afford to lose their expertise . ”
Wrapping up his online statement , Obama appears to be devoted to future manned missions to the “ Moon , Mars and beyond , ” with increased spending toward robotic missions .
He also links strong space technology development with improvements in the US economy and world inspiration :
“ More broadly , we need a real vision for space exploration .
To help formulate this vision , I ’ll reestablish the National Aeronautics and Space Council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system – a plan that involves both human and robotic missions , and enlists both international partners and the private sector .
And as America leads the world to long - term exploration of the moon , Mars , and beyond , let ’s also tap NASA ’s ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change .
Under my watch , NASA will inspire the world , make America stronger , and help grow the economy here in Florida . ” – US Sen .
Barack Obama
Whilst many may be suspicious of any Presidential candidate ’s visions before they are voted in , it is a relief to know Obama has the drive to increase NASA spending and understands that this will have far - reaching benefits for the US and the world .
Aside :
Is it me or are the anti-Obama “ Paid for by John McCain 2008 ” ads on every website these days ?
Perhaps Obama needs to do some “ space advocacy ” ads to focus on some of the positive aspects of his campaign …

THE next time you hear someone blaming “ beer goggles ” for their behaviour , you may have to believe them .
People really do appear more attractive when our perceptions are changed by drinking alcohol .
There have been few previous attempts to investigate the idea that people seem to find others more attractive when drunk .
In 2003 , psychologists at the University of Glasgow , UK , published a study in which they asked heterosexual students in campus bars and cafés whether they had been drinking , and then got them to rate photos of people for attractiveness .
While the results supported the beer goggles theory , …
The UK's Labour government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown is still pushing for recriminalization of marijuana in spite of the recommendation of his own drug advisory council .
The government 's move may on the other hand not be fully implemented by the nation 's police as the UK's Association of Chief Police Officers has declared its support for the current " confiscate and warn " approach .
First , the Evening Standard on April 28 , 2008 ( " Brown Set to Regrade Cannabis As Class B Despite Experts ' Advice " ) reported that " Gordon Brown has decided to throw out the recommendation by a high - powered group of government advisers who say it should stay a " soft " drug .
The Prime Minister will instead take a hard line , sending a message that drugs are dangerous to young people 's health and heavily linked to serious crime .
His stance was confirmed on the day that the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs was handing in an official report that is understood to recommend that cannabis should remain in the lowest category of illegal drugs , Class C .
The advisory council is the most senior authority on drugs policy and was asked by Mr Brown to review the law amid concerns over stronger forms of cannabis such as skunk that are linked to mental illness in long - term abusers . "
According to the Standard , " With 23 experts in drugs and their treatment , the advisory council has never before been ignored by the Government . "
The Standard noted that " At present , most adults found carrying cannabis are unlikely even to be arrested .
Young people are most likely to be arrested and reprimanded .
That may now change , however .
As a Class B rather than a Class C drug , the maximum penalty for possessing cannabis will rise from two to five years .
In both cases the maximum penalty for supply is 14 years .
Cannabis was downgraded from a Class B drug to Class C in January 2004 , with the aim of freeing police time to tackle harder drugs .
The move came after former home secretary David Blunkett became convinced that it was far less of a threat than heroin and crack cocaine . "
The Guardian reported on May 1 , 2008 ( " Police Reject Tougher Action on Cannabis " ) that " Police will not adopt a tougher approach to cases of simple possession of cannabis when ministers upgrade the legal status of the drug to class B , the Guardian can disclose .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) confirmed last night that the current policy of " confiscate and warn " would continue , despite Gordon Brown 's determination to reclassify the drug in an attempt to " send a tough message " to young people about its use .
Chief constables are debating whether or not fixed penalty fines should be available alongside cannabis warnings .
But the basic approach of saving police time by not making an arrest and taking the offender to the police station to be charged , introduced four years ago , will remain . "
According to the Guardian , " Campaigners for drug law reform last night questioned the relevance of the drug classification system , which dates back to 1971 , and its ability to send a message .
Roger Howard , chief executive of the UK Drug Policy Commission , and a former government drugs adviser , said : ' There will be no new powers or resources for policing if cannabis is made class B , and cannabis warnings can still be issued instead of arrest . '
He said this underlined the muddle at the heart of government over the purpose of a drug classification system which was unlikely ever to be able to ' send a message to young people ' .
Since cannabis had moved from class B to class C , the number of schoolchildren who think it is fine to try cannabis had halved , he said . "
The Guardian noted that " It is expected that Acpo guidance to police officers will use different language from existing guidelines to stress the discretion that is available to constables to take more robust action in cases involving repeat offenders or aggravating factors such as disorder or evidence of organised crime .
An Acpo spokesman last night : " The key will be the discretion for officers to strike the right balance .
We do not want to criminalise young people who are experimenting . "
However , he stressed that cases involving " aggravating factors " were more likely to see an arrest and prosecution . "

It almost feels like financial terrorism .
It feels like we are in a moment where there are institutions that are willing the destruction of our banks , institutions that want the nation 's financial system to fail .
I have no evidence of any of this , honestly , and I have canvassed enough short - sellers today to be able to say that I do not know one of them at this point who wants our financial system to be destroyed for his or her own profit .
I have no facts , no understanding of the situation that would ever for a moment be able to explain what 's going on .
I literally am searching for a reason why this is all happening and why people believe that a failure of a
Goldman Sachs
( GS ) - Get Report
or a
Morgan Stanley
( MS ) - Get Report
can actually occur , given how well they are doing .
But I will tell you ahead of time that any investigation at this point of the selling in these firms might prove that it is motivated by more than just typical short - selling .
Still , I believe it is imperative to point out the non-terrorist causes , if only because I do n't want to believe that there are others at work trying to bring the U.S. financial system down .
First , all of these firms took on too much debt , even Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs , to make loans to all sorts of players .
Many of those loans are being repaid , in fact almost all of them .
They are current .
Second , when the government seized the common stocks of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , it did unleash a view that common stocks of even the best financial institutions -- and Fannie and Freddie were hardly the best -- could never be trusted .
Third , if it did n't have tangible assets and just relied on confidence and faith , which is the nature of a financial institution , the faith has been destroyed by the subsequent Lehman and
AIG
( AIG ) - Get Report
failures .
All of these could very well amount to reasons for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to fail .
But I do n't think they do .
Should they be " allowed " to fail simply because of a temporary loss of faith ?
I do n't think so .
My conclusion : I believe that fear can destroy many stocks , but this selling feels motivational and
not
done by those who sell short stocks as a way of living .
I sure would like to be able to see who is selling these stocks in order to take financial terrorism off the table .

Support the PAW Act - End Alaska 's Aerial Hunting Program !
by : Care2.com
recipient : U.S. House of Representatives
So far , more than 1,000 wolves have been chased down by gunmen in low - flying aircraft and killed with high - powered rifles .
This year alone , at least 232 wolves have been killed – putting the 2008/2009 aerial wolf killing season on pace to become the deadliest in years .
In just a few weeks , Congressman George Miller will re-introduce the Protect America 's Wildlife ( PAW )
Act , federal legislation to end the controversial practice of using aircraft and gunmen to chase and kill wolves in Alaska .
It 's time to stop aerial hunting once and for all .
Sign the petition below to urge your Representative to sign on as an original co-sponsor of Representative George Miller 's re-introduced PAW
Act to help end this awful practice in Alaska and prevent it from spreading to places like the Northern Rockies .
read petition letter ▾
Dear [ Decision Maker ] ,
As one of your constituents and someone who cares about protecting wildlife , I urge you to sign on as an original cosponsor of Representative George Miller 's soon - to - be introduced Protect America 's Wildlife Act , federal legislation to end the controversial practice of using aircraft and gunmen to chase and kill wolves in Alaska .
Officials in Alaska have flouted the intent of the Federal Airborne Hunting Act that Congress passed in 1972 and perpetuated a scientifically unfounded aerial wolf killing program .
[ Your personal comments will be added here . ]
So far , more than 1,000 wolves have been chased down by gunmen in low - flying aircraft and killed with high - powered rifles .
This year alone , at least 232 wolves have been killed -- putting the 2008/2009 aerial wolf killing season on pace to become the deadliest in years .
This brutal practice has been condemned by wildlife biologists , hunters and conservationists from Alaska and around the world ... and with good cause .
Under the program , private trophy hunters can use planes to track and shoot down wolves from above or chase them to exhaustion and kill them at point - blank range .
It is not ethical hunting and the state has no reliable numbers on which to base their decisions on how many wolves are killed under the program or any solid data to substantiate the program 's effectiveness .
I am outraged by aerial wolf killing and hope that you will do everything in your power to stop this awful practice as an original cosponsor of the Protect America 's Wildlife Act .
Thank you for considering my comments .

Re : Please Co-Sponsor the Protect America 's Wildlife Act in the 111th CongressDear [ Decision Maker ] , As one of your constituents and someone who cares about protecting wildlife , I urge you to sign on as an original cosponsor of Representative George Miller 's soon - to - be introduced Protect America 's Wildlife Act , federal legislation to end the controversial practice of using aircraft and gunmen to chase and kill wolves in Alaska .
Officials in Alaska have flouted the intent of the Federal Airborne Hunting Act that Congress passed in 1972 and perpetuated a scientifically unfounded aerial wolf killing program .
[ Your personal comments will be added here .
]
So far , more than 1,000 wolves have been chased down by gunmen in low - flying aircraft and killed with high - powered rifles .
This year alone , at least 232 wolves have been killed -- putting the 2008/2009 aerial wolf killing season on pace to become the deadliest in years .
This brutal practice has been condemned by wildlife biologists , hunters and conservationists from Alaska and around the world ... and with good cause .
Under the program , private trophy hunters can use planes to track and shoot down wolves from above or chase them to exhaustion and kill them at point - blank range .
It is not ethical hunting and the state has no reliable numbers on which to base their decisions on how many wolves are killed under the program or any solid data to substantiate the program 's effectiveness .
I am outraged by aerial wolf killing and hope that you will do everything in your power to stop this awful practice as an original cosponsor of the Protect America 's Wildlife Act .
Thank you for considering my comments .
I look forward to your response .
BAGHDAD  When Jabbar , an elderly Shiite man , stormed out of his house here in June wanting to know where all his furniture had gone , the sharp look of the young Sunni standing guard on his street stopped him cold .
The young man said nothing , but his expression made things clear : Jabbar had no home here anymore .
After Iraq ’s sectarian earthquake settled , his neighborhood had become a mostly Sunni area .
Instead of moving back , he is trying to sell the house while staying in a rented one less than a mile away in an area that is mostly Shiite .
It is not an unusual decision .
Out of the more than 151,000 families who had fled their houses in Baghdad , just 7,112 had returned to them by mid-July , according to the Iraqi Ministry of Migration .
Many of the displaced remain in Baghdad , just in different areas .
In one neighborhood alone , Amiriya , in western Baghdad , there are 8,350 displaced families , more than the total number of families who have returned to their houses in all of Baghdad .
The reasons for the hesitation are complex , based on dangers both real and imagined .
In most cases , Iraqis say they feel safe with their neighbors but are not sure about other residents .
Some are afraid of the new guards on their blocks .
In rarer cases , they cannot face neighbors who they suspect helped in killings .
Mozilla is leveraging an impressive new optimization technique to bring a big performance boost to the Firefox JavaScript engine .
The code was merged today ( but is not yet ready to be enabled by default in the nightly builds ) and is planned for inclusion in Firefox 3.1 , the next incremental update of the open - source web browser .
I discussed this new optimization strategy with Mozilla 's VP of engineering Mike Shaver and Mozilla CTO Brendan Eich , the creator of JavaScript .
They are concerned that sophisticated web applications are being held back by the limitations of JavaScript interpreter performance .
They aim to improve execution speed so that it is comparable to that of native code .
This will redefine the boundaries of client - side performance and enable the development of a whole new generation of more computationally - intensive web applications .
They are " getting ready to take JavaScript performance into the next tier " with a radically innovative optimization tactic called tracing that has already produced performance improvements ranging between 20 and 40 times faster in some cases .
They believe that this is just the beginning of what can be accomplished with tracing , and they expect to be able to achieve even better speed as the work continues .
The theories behind tracing optimization were pioneered by Dr. Michael Franz and Dr. Andreas Gal , research scientists at the University of California , Irvine .
The tracing mechanism records the path of execution at runtime and generates compiled code that can be used next time that a particular path is reached .
This makes it possible to flatten out loops and nested method calls into a linear stream of instructions that is more conducive to conventional optimization techniques .
Tracing optimization is particularly effective in dynamic languages and also has a very light memory footprint relative to alternative approaches .
Mozilla already incorporated tracing optimization into Tamarin , a next - generation JavaScript runtime engine that leverages Adobe 's ActionScript virtual machine .
Tamarin , however , still lacks maturity and does n't yet deliver significant performance gains — partly because Tamarin 's ActionScript heritage means that it is optimized for efficient execution of code with type annotations .
Tamarin is a long - term project and wo n't be ready until Firefox 4 .
SpiderMonkey art by Shane Lewis
To get a real - world performance increase right now , Mozilla has adapted the tracing technology and Adobe 's nanojit so that they can be integrated directly into SpiderMonkey , the JavaScript interpreter that is used in Firefox 3 .
This has produced a massive speedup that far surpasses what is currently possible with Tamarin - tracing .
In addition to empowering web developers , the optimizations will also improve the general performance of the browser itself and many extensions because many components of the program are coded with JavaScript .
Bringing more power to client - side scripting will move the web forward and create new opportunities for web developers .
Eich says that Mozilla wants to " get people thinking about JavaScript as a more general - purpose language " and show them that " it really is a platform for writing full applications . "
Apple has also been implementing some extremely impressive JavaScript performance improvements with its compelling Squirrel Fish virtual machine engine , which will be included in Safari 4 .
Like Mozilla , Apple says that the current performance gains delivered by the latest optimization techniques only scratch the surface of what is possible .
JavaScript is n't just a clumsy solution for client - side form validation anymore .
While the implementors are aggressively addressing JavaScript 's performance limitations , the ECMAScript standards community is making progress on addressing some of the language 's historical syntactic weaknesses .
The addition of some rather nice Pythonic sugar in JavaScript 1.7 and 1.8 is a great start , and the recent emergence of consensus in the standards community on the future of ECMAScript lifts some of the roadblocks that had prevented those efforts from going further .
With so much forward momentum and rapid evolution , JavaScript appears capable of meeting the demand for a more robust web programming platform .
As more applications shift into the cloud , these capabilities will be essential for building the future of the web .

ATLANTA --
The NFL officially notified its players union on Tuesday that it will opt out of the current collective bargaining agreement , which could lead to a season without a salary cap in 2010 and a possible lockout in 2011 .
Owners voted unanimously Tuesday morning to opt out of the deal , which was extended in March 2006 .
The NFL had until November to opt out , but decided to do it early instead of waiting for the deadline .
The league , however , emphasized that it will keep negotiating with the NFL Players Association and said games will be played " without threat of interruption for at least the next three seasons . "
" We have guaranteed three more years of NFL football , " commissioner Roger Goodell said after the owners used the opt - out clause built into the agreement signed more than two years ago .
" We are not in dire straits .
We 've never said that .
But the agreement is n't working , and we 're looking to get a more fair and equitable deal . "
The decision by the owners was anticipated , although not this early .
The 2006 agreement allowed either side to negate the contract by Nov. 8 .
Goodell said the owners acted early " to get talks rolling . "
NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw had been anticipating the early termination of the agreement .
He met with owners two weeks ago , and from that meeting he asked for audited financial reports from owners to document their economic problems .
Two Lamar High School coaches used a defibrillator and CPR to revive a 10th - grade football player who collapsed on the field before practice this morning , officials said .
The 15 - year - old student collapsed just after 9 a.m. as football players — dressed in shorts and shirts , but with no pads and helmets — started a stretching drill in preparation for practice , school officials said .
So I was abed this morning listening to NPR and on comes Mara Liasson with a report about the women 's vote .
Typical silly evenhandedness , and then she plays a snippet from a McCain - Palin radio commercial that sums up the whole problem , really .
The commercial is about the " sexist " attacks on Palin .
The script is read of course in a woman 's voice , and she conveys just the right tone of anger and contempt for the sneering hypocritical liberal elite misogynists .
They tried A , and B , and C , the woman says .
And then , when that did n't work , " they called her a liar . "
She brands this " despicable . "
Okay .
I spent yesterday afternoon fretting that Obama 's message was too muddled , not pointed enough .
Almost everyone I know thinks this .
Maybe we 're right .
Or maybe we 're just compulsive fretters , because that 's what liberals tend to be based on experience .
So maybe the Obama team is flailing .
But now I hear this ad and I think , how do you fight an opponent that not only lies , but then tells lies about the lies ?
Palin is a liar .
Of this there 's no question .
She supported the bridge to nowhere .
She asked for earmarks as governor – and not just one or two , but $ 453 million worth .
She still goes around the country saying the exact opposite of both of these things .
To adoring supporters , natch , who care nothing about what the truth of the matter is , only that she 's sticking it to the liberal - elite man .
Eugene Robinson summed this up nicely yesterday in his Wash Post column .
Palin , he explained , did sort of ' fess up about the bridge in her Charlie Gibson interview .
But a few days later , she was back out on the trail saying the same thing .
Robinson :
What kind of person tells a self - aggrandizing lie , gets called on it , admits publicly that the truth is not at all what she originally claimed -- and then goes out and starts telling the original lie again without changing a word ?
Yesterday , John McCain talked about the need for reform on Wall Street , vowing that his administration will crack down on the shysters and the greedhogs .
Sure .
Virtually every chance he 's had , he 's supporting lifting regulations .
Today the Wash Post has the goods and places them on the front page .
McCain wants to " tap into " populist anger , writes the paper :
But his past support of congressional deregulation efforts and his arguments against " government interference " in the free market by federal , state and local officials have given Sen.
Barack Obama an opening to press the advantage Democrats traditionally have in times of economic trouble .
And , today , I can guarantee you , McCain spokespeople and spinners will tell reporters and cable TV hosts that this obviously true documented record is nonsense and McCain has always been an opponent of such excess .
Again , in both cases , these are n't just lies .
They 're lies about lies .
That 's a really different thing .
In life , a typical person lies .
If they get caught – hopefully , they tender an apology ; at the very least they stop telling the lie .
But here we have a case where the liars not only do n't do either of those things .
They just keep on lying .
But wait , there 's more !
Because it is n't only that they lie and then lie about the lies .
They follow that by playing the victim , claiming that the allegation from the other people that they 're lying is nonsense , or a sign that they 're part of the Washington establishment , or " despicable . "
Imagine this happening in your own life .
You knew your spouse was cheating , and she or he kept on denying it and called you despicable .
Imagine that in a court of law , a plaintiff or defendant 's attorney could lie , get caught , lie again and then get at least some members of the jury to believe that the allegations that he lied were just an elitist plot .
That in business , one party could break a contract , lie about it , lie about having lied about it , charge that the other party 's willingness to stand by the original terms of the contract showed only that the other party was weak and inflexible -- and still come out of the deal smelling sweet .
Other campaigns have lied , and yes , Democratic ones as well as Republican .
But none I 've ever covered has lied like this one and told lies about the lies and then gone and played the victim to its base voters and then , as a parting shot , shut off all serious press inquiries so that it did n't really have to answer any difficult questions about its lies .
John McCain , of " straight talk " fame , has n't spoken with the reporters on his plane in more than a month .
So what are the Obama people supposed to do in the face of this ?
I honestly do n't know .
You can try to persuade a few figures of authority with some bipartisan credential to step forward and call lies lies , but most such people will be chary of doing that .
Or maybe you can get down in the gutter .
It 's certainly what they deserve .
But you can't have an argument with people who play according to these rules .
They enforce no code of decency upon themselves , and no one exists to enforce it .
The " objective " media ?
Stop joking .
They 're powerless to stop it ; all they really do , as NPR did this morning , is give more air time to the victim - playing about the lies about the lies .
We 're down the rabbit hole .
If these people win , we 'll be in a worse place than that .
August 21 , 2008 23:56 IST
From a moderate start to a dreaded terror outfit , the Students Islamic Movement of India has come a long way .
Though the theories attached to the shift in stance by SIMI are relatively old , Safdar Nagori , the most prominent face of the banned outfit , said in his confession statement before the Madhya Pradesh police that SIMI had decided to intensify operations in India in 2001 after it had been banned by the then National Democratic Alliance government .
Nagori in his confession statement admitted that he and his men had undertaken a massive recruitment drive .
In the process , they recruited several youth to the outfit following which training was imparted to each of them .
He said that the idea was to transform SIMI into a militant outfit .
The confession is very much on the lines of the interview given by Nagori prior to the outfit 's ban .
In the interview , he said it is not when an individual is harmed , but when an entire community finds itself collectively persecuted that the cry for jihad is given .
If nothing works then one is forced to revolt , take to arms .
Nagori said that he was an extremist and not a fundamentalist and his actions were never on the basis of religion .
" I was pained and angered by the atrocities against Muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the Gujarat riots only made matters worse , " he said .
Giving details about the training programme , Nagori said that nearly 25,000 SIMI activists met in Mumbai in 2001 and this was the first time that the call for jihad was given .
The meeting also hailed Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden as a true warrior .
Prior to Nagori 's arrest , there were 400 active SIMI members known as the Ansars and 20,000 Ikhwans who were ordinary members .
The training programme for SIMI began in Jammu and Kashmir .
They trained along with the Hizbul Mujahideen .
Following this , the selected cadres were assigned to major terror operations in the country .
Further , he also gave information regarding a training camp in Choral , Madhya Pradesh .
He confessed that the training camp in Choral was unique and was used to train different classes of militants for different kinds of operations .
Nagori also spoke at length about the manner in which the SIMI split into two groups , thanks to differences of opinion .
He said during his interrogation that the main reason for the split was due to ideological differences between his faction and the Misba - ul - Islam faction .
While the Islam faction wanted the SIMI to have a more moderate approach , Nagori pressed for a more aggressive view .
Nagori made the same claim during his narco - analysis which was conducted in Bengaluru recently .
He said that SIMI did give it a try to sort out the differences and they met at Ujjain .
Nagori found that he had a majority of the members supporting him .
This is when he decided to breakaway and carry forward the outfit with his ideology .
Nagori also spoke about his idea of recruiting more educated youth into the outfit .
He said that persons from an IT background were preferred and in this regard a technical cell was also started .
He said the idea of recruiting persons from an IT background was because these persons could remain low key and they were excellent planners .
Nagori also mentioned about the Shaheen Force , an all - woman wing of SIMI .
He explained during his confession and narco - analysis that women could convince their children easily to take the SIMI route and hence he had decided to float this wing .
He felt that women could help boost the membership of SIMI .
Social news sites like Digg are a great way to get a bird 's - eye view of what 's going on in virtually any topic without having to subscribe to feeds from an insurmountable number of individual sites .
A number of competing aggregators have emerged over the last couple years , all of which take different approaches .
Regator is the latest , and it melds social news features with a web - based RSS reader .
Ars Technica went hands on to see if Regator has a shot at being the one news source to rule them all .
As its " blog aggregator " description suggests , Regator attempts to unite two separate products — a social news service and a typical RSS reader — into a single , one - stop - shop for all your news needs .
Since the main page defaults to a " Top Rated " list of stories that have been voted up by registered users , though , the company is clearly focusing on helping users to find the most important articles from the veritable flood that is the Internet .
A " Channels " panel in the left sidebar offers a basic list of categories and sub-categories that websites , blogs , and their stories are organized into , making it easy to zero in on a particular topic one is interested in .
After sifting through and voting on stories , and perhaps marking a few blogs as " favorites , " users can check out the the " My Regator " tab of the aforementioned panel , where the straight RSS reader aspect of the site comes into play .
Users can add a link to any website or RSS feed , and organize feeds into folders .
This kind of organization is fairly standard these days so we were n't entirely impressed , though the ability to easily share news items to a Twitter or Facebook account ( with more options on the way ) , makes it easy to keep friends and co-workers in the loop .
The ability to add any feed to one 's Regator library , however , is still a very rough feature , even though the company went through a one - month private beta phase after " 9 months of stealthy development . "
Even though Regator is now in a public beta , we were never actually able to get this feature to work .
We could add feeds just fine , but multiple feeds , even those that are already in Regator 's database of hand - picked sites , never displayed any headlines for us ; they just perpetually sat loading .
Speaking of hand - picking feeds , this is one of Regator 's few interesting selling points .
Digg and most of its competitors thus far have an open door , we 'll - take - anything policy towards the content that is submitted for voting .
Yahoo's similar Buzz generated , uh , buzz , when it debuted because it did n't allow users to submit news items .
Only a select batch of sites are allowed into Yahoo's Buzz social news garden , and , if you are n't on the list , you have to ask for inclusion .
Regator takes a middle road between these two approaches .
The site debuted with a hand - picked list of over 3,000 sites from which content is automatically aggregated and displayed for all users to vote on .
While users can add any feed they want to their personal RSS reader , sites must be submitted to Regator 's editors for consideration before they will included in the list that all users see .
The company 's blend of filtered news sources , voting on popular stories , and a personal RSS reader sounds interesting but , after playing with Regator for a bit , it 's clear that it has n't been executed very well .
We all could use help in sifting through the cruft for important information , but basic features we expect from both social news sites and RSS readers are missing .
There 's no vote count on news items , for example , so there 's no way to tell how many users consider a story to be interesting or important .
Given that we kept getting logged out while testing and the RSS reader never worked , it seems that Regator could probably have benefitted from a little more time in the oven .
AUGUST 6-- Though many key details of the federal investigation of bioweapons researcher Bruce Ivins have already leaked , today 's unsealing of 436 pages of documents provides some new information about the government 's probe of the late government employee whom prosecutors believe was solely responsible for the deadly 2001 anthrax attacks .
The government 's circumstantial case against Ivins , who committed suicide last month , is sketched out in affidavits filed in support of 14 search warrant applications filed since November 2007 , when agents raided Ivins 's home , cars , and his safe deposit box .
As seen here , included in the affidavits is the government 's bid to possibly explain why Ivins sent anthrax - filled letters to Tom Brokaw ( an NBC investigative reporter had filed a Freedom of Information request regarding Ivins 's laboratory work ) and U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy and Tom Daschle ( the pols 's pro-abortion stance angered Ivins , a practicing Catholic ) .
The documents also describe how Ivins created a bogus e-mail trail in a bid to deflect investigative attention from him to two other scientists at Fort Detrick , where Ivins worked .
The documents also describe Ivins 's fascination with the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and how he engaged in an ' edit war ' on the group 's Wikipedia page .
Ivins , investigators reported , repeatedly posted negative information on the KKG page and was angered when it was removed from the site by other users .
In a February 2007 online posting traced to one of his e-mail addresses , Ivins bizarrely claimed that the sorority had , many years earlier , labeled him an ' enemy ' and had issued a ' Fatwah ' against him .
Following the September 11 attacks ( but before the anthrax mailings ) , Ivins sent an e-mail to a colleague warning that Osama bin Laden disciples possessed anthrax and sarin gas .
In other e-mails sent during 2000 and 2001 , Ivins described his precarious mental state and wrote that he worried about someday reading a headline in the National Enquirer exclaiming , ' Paranoid Man Works With Deadly Anthrax !!!'
A July 11 , 2008 affidavit reported that Ivins , angered at being the government 's prime suspect , planned ' to kill co-workers and other individuals who had wronged him . '
The law enforcement searches , executed by agents with the FBI and U.S. Postal Service , targeted Ivins 's Frederick , Maryland home , his government lab , three automobiles , several e-mail accounts , and a safe deposit box .

Colorado ’s tickets to see Barack Obama ’s acceptance speech at Invesco Field at Mile High were more than spoken for within about 24 hours , officials said , and the application process closed Thursday for all but those willing to be put on a waiting list .
Obama ’s campaign set aside for Colorado half of the more than 60,000 seats available to the public for the final night of the Democratic National Convention .
It turns out the battleground state could have filled the stadium , as the campaign ended applications after collecting more than 60,000 Thursday afternoon .
“ This incredible response and excitement shows that there is a huge appetite for change in Colorado , ” Anne Filipic , the general election director for the Campaign for Change , said in a statement .
The demand for the credentials was so great that phone lines were jammed much of the day .
Callers got an array of messages that suggested the lines were n’t functioning .
A spokesman for the campaign insisted the hotline number was good but that volunteers could n’t keep up with demand .
Internet sign - up went more smoothly , said the spokesman , Matt Chandler .
Chandler also said the campaign ’s Denver office saw a “ steady stream ” of applicants who arrived in person .
Shortly before the campaign shifted into wait - list mode , Sue Adams of unincorporated Arapahoe County managed to register herself and her son , Zachary Adams , for credentials .
Zachary turns 18 on Aug. 28 , the day of Obama ’s speech , and he plans to skip school that day to register to vote and try to attend Obama ’s speech .
His mother says he is a “ huge ” Obama supporter .
Last year ’s birthday present was a mandolin .
Sue Adams hopes this year ’s is a seat at Invesco .
Information on how the sign - up process was going outside of Colorado was n’t immediately available .
Campaign officials will start contacting applicants Tuesday and screen them to make sure those who say they will attend have actual plans and the ability to do so .
Any rejected applications or awarded credentials that have n’t been claimed by Aug. 20 will go to those on the waiting list .
The huge demand could entice some to try to sell their tickets , but the Obama campaign said it will closely track the bar codes on tickets and any ticket up for sale will be deactivated .

Let me start with this shadow of a hand holding a coin .
If you look closely at the shadow of your hand on a really , really bright sunny day , you ’ll see a thin bright halo around the shadow itself .
It ’s bright for the same reason that the water is choppy round the end of a jetty in the sea : the light kind of bends round the edges of your hand and gets kind of caught up in itself .
So it proves that light is a bit like waves .
It ’s dependent on something called the ‘ diffraction limit ’ , which is the very finest , the very smallest light can go before it gets too choppy , like the ink from a felt tip pen bleeding out into thin paper .
So it reveals the grain of the universe , the smallest resolution ; like an inkjet printer , the universe has a maximum DPI .
It ’s one of the few times you can see that kind of deep physics visible in the day to day , and all you need to do is be observant .

The newest Batman movie The Dark Knight absolutely stunned me .
Not since Dr. Strangelove has a movie contained so much game theory .
A lot of people have focused on a scene near the end of the movie .
But there is so much more to see .
In fact , I ’ll be so bold as to suggest the following : the entire film is a sequence of games and an illustration of strategic thought .
There is a lot of creativity going on .
Game theory is illustrated even at times when it ’s not clear what the “ game ”  really is , like the opening bank robbery scene .
This scene is one of the most powerful movie openings and it foreshadows the chaos and tempo that will follow .
Let ’s take a moment to analyze it in detail .
( Warning : this article contains spoilers and covers roughly the first five minutes of the movie .
The thoughtful comments contain major spoilers so only read them if you ’ve seen the movie . )

How can we split up the stash ?
The movie starts out with a bang .
An aerial attack begins when a window shatters on a skyscraper , allowing two robbers to glide across a zip - line on to a bank ’s roof .
On the street - level , a car screeches to a stop to pick up the last member of the ground attack .
The first spoken words concern the topic of strategy .
These lines introduce the Joker ’s character and they foreshadow the punch and counterpunch of the entire movie .
The robbers in the car explain the job and how the loot will be divided .
It ’s apparent they are not happy with the plan :
Driver :
Three of a kind .
Let ’s do this .
Passenger side :
That ’s it –three guys ?
Driver :
Two guys on the roof .
Every guy gets a share .
Five shares is plenty .
Passenger side : Six shares .
Do n’t forget the guy who planned the job .
Driver :
He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice .
I know why they call him the Joker .
The robbers do n’t like that the Joker gets an equal share for doing unequal work .
Their complaint raises the issue of fair division , which is central to game theory .
In fact , fair division is the first problem that game theory addressed historically .
The problem appears in the Babylonian Talmud about how creditors should divide an estate .
The text offers a mysterious solution that had baffled scholars for over 2,000 years .
It was only very recently that a Nobel Laureate economist deciphered the answer using the tools of coalitional game theory .
Let me tell you , the answer is fascinating .
Fair division is about understanding incentives and strategic thought .
How can you trust self - interested people ?
How can you achieve cooperative outcomes with diametrically opposed motives ?
Such ideas have been applied to important areas such as nuclear disarmament and labor negotiations .
But they are even applicable to mundane situations , like when you ’re eating out .
I hate splitting the bill when I ordered a less expensive item ( do n’t you ? ) .
Understanding game theory can bring us to a better answer ( finally , a return to splitting the bill fairly ) .
Ultimately , the robbers accepted an equal division for unequal work .
Given that , should they have believed things would have gone according to plan ?
Perhaps they should not have , if they would have considered the incentives and possible landmines about trust .
You see , in game theory you do not trust someone because they agree with you on a plan .
You trust them because it is in their self - interest to help you .
Had the robbers considered these issues , perhaps their fate would have been different .
A little bit of thinking ahead and reasoning backwards would have demonstrated flaws in the plan .
The scene is reminiscent of a popular game theory puzzle about pirates and splitting up treasure .
Some of you may have even heard this as a technical interview question .
The game offers insights to collective voting and the ability of a leader to buy off votes .

Or , you can just continue reading …
The Pirate puzzle
The game
Three pirates ( A , B , and C ) arrive from a lucrative voyage with 100 pieces of gold .
They will split up the money according to an ancient code dependent on their leadership rules .
The pirates are organized with a strict leadership structure–pirate A is stronger than pirate B who is stronger than pirate C .
The voting process is a series of proposals with a lethal twist .
Here are the rules :
The strongest pirate offers a split of the gold .
An example would be : “ 0 to me , 10 to B , and 90 to C. ”
All of the pirates , including the proposer , vote on whether to accept the split .
The proposer holds the casting vote in the case of a tie .
If the pirates agree to the split , it happens .
Otherwise , the pirate who proposed the plan gets thrown overboard from the ship and perishes .
The next strongest pirate takes over and then offers a split of the money .
The process is repeated until a proposal is accepted .
Pirates care first and foremost about living , then about getting gold .
How does the game play out ?
The solution
At first glance it appears that the strongest pirate will have to give most of the loot .
But a closer analysis demonstrates the opposite result –the leader holds quite a bit of power .
The game can be solved by thinking ahead and reasoning backwards .
All pirates will do this because they are a very smart bunch , a trait necessary for surviving on the high seas .
Looking ahead , let ’s consider what would happen if pirate A is thrown overboard .
What will happen between pirates B and C ?
It turns out that pirate B turns into a dictator .
Pirate B can vote “ yes ”  to any offer that he proposes , and even if pirate C declines , the situation is a tie and pirate B holds the casting vote .
In this situation , pirate C has no voting power at all .
Pirate B will take full advantage of his power and give himself all 100 pieces in the split , leaving pirate C with nothing .
But will pirate A ever get thrown overboard ?
Pirate A will clearly vote on his own proposal , so his entire goal reduces to buying a single vote to gain the majority .
Which pirate is easiest to buy off ?
Pirate C is a likely candidate because he ends up with nothing if pirate A dies .
This means pirate C has a vested interest in keeping pirate A alive .
If pirate A gives him any reasonable offer–in theoretical sense , even a single gold coin–pirate C would accept the plan .
And that ’s what will happen .
Pirate A will offer 1 gold coin to pirate C , nothing to pirate B , and take 99 coins for himself .
The plan will be accepted by pirates A and C , and it will pass .
Amazingly , pirate A ends up with tremendous power despite having two opponents .
Luckily , the opponents dislike each other and one can be bought off .
The game illustrates the spoils can go to the strongest pirate or the one that gets to act first , if the remaining members have conflicting interests .
The leader has the means to buy off weak members .
Do n’t get caught up in the exact assumptions or outcomes of the game–just remember the basic lesson .
In the real world , it might be necessary to buy a vote with 20 gold coins .
Nonetheless , the general logic is the same .
Here are some of the main insights from the game :
Lessons :
Players should think ahead and reason backwards
A leader can win by exploiting conflict among weaker members
Players derive worth from voting power , and some players can be bought off
The robbery scene in The Dark Knight
The original plan of equal division is flawed .
Each robber has incentive to increase his share by killing a fellow team member .
Once a member performs his job , he loses his negotiating power and value to the team .
The Joker plays off this conflict by instructing the robbers to take out fellow teammates once their tasks are performed .
The game would be different if the robbers were a group and they repeated crimes together –perhaps an even split could be sustainable .
But as the movie hints right away with the first backstabbing scene , this robbery will be a one - shot game .
Many of the robbers fail to see they can be victim to the same deceit they pull on others .
The second robber on the rooftop is a prime example .
After his partner disarms the silent alarm , he quickly kills him and then proceeds to perform his own job .
He does n’t see the same thing could happen to him .
After he disarms the bank vault , he is greeted with a most unpleasant surprise :
Robber :
Where ’s the alarm guy ?
Vault guy :
Boss told when the guy was done , I should take him out .
One less share , right ?
[ opens the vault ]
Robber : Funny .
He told me something similar .
Vault guy :
What ?
No !
No ! [ gets shot in the back ]
By now it ’s clear the Joker wants everyone dead , and minutes later we learn the Joker has been present on the job all along .
The plan finishes with two more deaths both involving the escape vehicle bus .
The Joker , being the “ strongest pirate , ”  was able to sequentially bribe the weaker robbers one by one .
In the end , he puts a twist on the game by taking the whole pie .
Other strategic elements
There are many other mini-strategy elements during the robbery scene .
Here are three that came to my mind :
How can a handful of robbers overtake a bank ?
In theory , a mob of unarmed citizens should be able to overwhelm a small group of armed robbers .
The problem is there will be casualties , particularly for those that act first .
Who is going to step out and be the hero ?
Robbers make sure that people do n’t coordinate by forcing them to act sequentially .
Any individual that attempts to be a hero will be killed as an example , like the angry bank employee .
In the movie , the robbers demonstrate they are willing to use lethal violence by shooting up in the air and taking out the bank cop .
Do you trust your teammate ?
This is a subtle point and I loved it .
The robbers face a small obstacle when an angry bank employee starts firing his shotgun .
The robbers duck for cover , and after a few shots , one robber asks the other if the bank employee is out of bullets .
If you watch closely , you ’ll see the robber ( really the Joker ) ponders the question carefully and then nods his head “ yes . ” 
The other robber jumps out and is greeted with a bullet that narrowly misses him .
Almost immediately the disguised Joker jumps out and disables the bank employee with a round of bullets .
The disguised Joker acted so quickly and without fear , almost as if he was now sure the bank employee was out of bullets .
Did the Joker lie on purpose earlier to put the other robber in danger ?
The other robber , not aware it ’s the Joker , is furious that he was almost shot and yells back : “ Where did you learn to count ? ” 
The disguised Joker looks back in scorn .
What kind of robber is the Joker ?
The cops who arrive on the scene will be stunned .
They will see a crime scene with five dead robbers and a bank vault that has been cleaned out .
They will likely conclude the Joker is interested in selfish gains , a simple criminal , who wants all the money in Gotham .
As the cops , the mobsters , Batman , and we as the audience experience the complex themes that unfold later in the movie , many of us are left with one thought : if only the Joker were so simple .
The Joker demands money , yes , but is that what he really wants ?
That ’s a question the Joker plays off later in the movie in an explosive fashion .

Sometimes a single driver can vastly improve traffic .
Drive like a trucker : keep a large space ahead of your car .
This can erase the patterns of stop - and - go driving ( wipe out the Traffic Waves . )
It can also break up the clogged merge - zones at certain highway exit ramps .
Also your daily commute becomes a Zen - like experience .
No more rage - fest .
See trafficwaves **** NOTE WELL : in this video , I 'm driving in the exit - only lane .
( It 's a merge - zone jam at a major city exit . )
The lane to my right is another exit - only lane .
The actual fast lane is TWO LANES RIGHT .
The European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve are facing similar problems but pursuing different policies .
The ECB has been raising interest rates while the Fed has been cutting them .
The overnight federal funds rate is now 2 per cent while the corresponding ECB rate is 4.25 per cent .
Which central bank is doing the right thing ?
Or could they both be ?...
The power of Europe ’s unions , its history of hyperinflation and the need to develop credibility for a young institution all justify the ECB ’s tough stance .
Because the Fed does not have these problems but faces a potentially serious recession , it is prepared to gamble that the weakness in US employment and the general decline in economic activity will prevent a wage - price spiral without further increases in the interest rate ....
I think the Fed ’s current interest rate strategy makes sense but would be too risky for the ECB .
Yep , it 's that time again kids .
Gather round and hear the story of yet another " we 're giving you the Internet — but in 3D ! " product .
ExitReality ( get it ? ) is a company based in Melbourne , Australia that apparently is n't very happy with browsing , searching , and socializing on the web in its current state .
Thursday , it released a plug - in named after itself that " allows anyone to view every web page in 3D . "
Its ExitReality plug - in is built for IE and Firefox on Windows ( though you wo n't find any of those details on its barren download page ) , and also offers 3D search , chat with other users , customizable avatars , social networking , and virtual recreations of real - world destinations .
The idea behind ExitReality is that when browsing the web in the old - n - busted 2D version you 're undoubtedly using now , you can hit a button to magically transform the site into a 3D environment that you can walk around in and virtually socialize with other users visiting the same site .
This shares many of the same goals as Google 's Lively ( which , so far , does n't seem so lively ) , though ExitReality is admittedly attempting a few other tricks .
Installation is performed via an executable file which places ExitReality shortcuts in Quick Launch and on the desktop , but somehow forgets to add the necessary ExitReality button to Firefox 's toolbar .
After adding the button manually and repeatedly being told our current version was out of date , we were ready to 3D - ify some websites and see just how much of reality we could leave in two - dimensional dust .
Aaaand there you have it .
ExitReality is designed to offer different kinds of 3D environments that center around spacious rooms that users can explore and customize , but it can also turn some sites like Flickr into virtual museums , hanging photos on virtual walls and halls .
Strangely , it 's treating Ars Technica as an image gallery and presenting it as a malformed 3D gallery .
A visit to Flickr demonstrates one of ExitReality 's few marginally appealing abilities , but even this was an embarrassing and awkward display of what happens when a shiny VC pipe dream meets engineers who do n't have anything better to do .
We never got a chance to test ExitReality 's social or chat features since we never ran into another user , even at popular 2D web destinations .
Sorry the campfire story could n't have been more interesting , but we 're pretty sure rendering this article in 3D wo n't help matters much .
The " Internet in 3D ! " thing has been attempted more times than we can count , but if a conceptual and financial juggernaut like Google can't get very far with it , we are n't too surprised that ExitReality has stumbled as well .
Now , Hindu Nationalists Rewriting California Textbooks
By Angana Chatterji
08 January , 2006
Countercurrents.org
The attempts of diasporic Hindu nationalist organizations in the United States to intervene in revising segments on India , Indian history , and Hinduism in 6th grade textbooks in California State schools is disturbing .
On December 2 , 2005 , the Curriculum Commission , an advisory body to the California State Board of Education accepted 131 of the 153 revisions proposed by Hindu Education Foundation ( HEF ) and Vedic Foundation ( VF ) , two groups affiliated with Hindutva , militant Hindu nationalist ideology .
The edits offered by these groups were adopted amid intense lobbying and the misrepresentation that their views represent those of ' ALL HINDUS ' in the diaspora .
This bears testimony to the power and resources of long - distance Hindu nationalism , and its organizing capabilities in the United States .
The changes proposed by HEF , VF , and the Ad Hoc Committee , on the basis of recommendations made by Professor Shiva Bajpai , who too is affiliated with the World Association for Vedic Studies , a Hindu nationalist organization , assert a nationalistic and mythic history of India as ' social fact ' .
Contrary to reputable scholarship , the revisions refute the migration of Aryans , associated by historians with the emergence of Hinduism , from Central Asia into India .
The revisions posit Hinduism as indigenous to India and ascribed with its origins , rendering mute the histories of adivasis ( tribal , first peoples ) and their subjugation by Hindus .
On page 238 , the Ad Hoc Committee proposed , and the Curriculum Commission accepted , that the current text , ' The Aryans created a caste system … ' , be replaced with : ' During Vedic times , people were divided into different social groups ( varnas ) based on their capacity to undertake a particular profession . '
Such storying dissociates the caste system from Hinduism , and discounts and neutralizes the oppressive structure and politics via which the caste system was constituted .
It presents the caste system as a fluid arrangement , not restricted by ancestry .
On page 245 , the Ad Hoc Committee proposed , and the Curriculum Commission accepted , that the current text , ' Men had many more rights than women ' , be replaced with : ' Men had different duties ( dharma ) as well as rights than women .
Many women were among the sages to whom the Vedas were revealed . '
The inequity of women 's rights is legitimated and discoursed as ' different rights ' , invisibilizing women 's subordinated role in a patriarchal society , and the Vedas posed as ' revealed ' doctrines .
The revisions highlight Hindutva 's misogyny and bigotry , and assert a non-reflective gaze at power that justifies Hindu dominance and cultural nationalism .
Their history makes Hinduism uniform , monotheistic , and monolithic , dismissing the disenfranchisement of women , dalits , adivasis , and religious minorities under centuries of Hindu ascendancy in what is today India , and therefore their ongoing struggles for justice and self - determination .
What message are we sending children ?
The positions taken by HEF and VF are deliberate , and consistent with the attempts of Hindutva groups toward rewriting history in India , where sectarian education campaigns undertaken by Hindu extremist groups demonize minorities through the teaching of fundamentalist curricula .
The Hindu right - wing has instituted an educational network for rural and disenfranchised peoples in India , building on a mandate that validates the paramountcy of a ' Hindu worldview ' and the assembling of a Hindu state .
Such corruption of education incites political and social fires , cultivating a culture of hatred toward non-Hindus and those that refuse to submit to Hindutva 's tyranny .
Hindu nationalist organizations , such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) , have spearheaded this movement in India , successfully penetrating into educational systems and centralized regulatory commissions .
The RSS has fashioned an institutional umbrella that has had damaging impact on education at the local level .
Created by the RSS in 1977 , the Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan network focuses on moral , extracurricular and physical education for ' mind , body , and spirit ' .
The Vidya Bharati system supervises over 18,000 schools in India , with a shared curriculum across the country .
The RSS has established a network of schools , such as the Vanvasi Kalyan Parishads , Vivekananda Kendras , Sewa Bharatis , Ekal Vidyalayas , to advance the ideological agenda of Hindu nationalism .
For adivasis ( referred derogatorily by Hindu nationalists as ' vanavasis ' or ' forest dwellers ' ) and dalits ( erstwhile ' untouchable ' castes ) , this ongoing reality of Hinduization forces their coercive incorporation into Brahmanical Hinduism .
Hindu nationalists have utilized such educational networks as mechanisms through which to recruit and mobilize women , adivasis , and dalits in campaigns against religious minorities .
The participation of Hinduized women , adivasi , and dalit communities in the genocide of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 exemplifies this pattern .
Following the Bharatiya Janata Party's ( BJP ) accession to power at the centre in 1998 , Hindu nationalist educators were inducted into the National Council for Education and Research Training ( NCERT ) , the national curriculum development and review body , to make changes to school curricula .
With the defeat of the BJP at the centre in 2004 , processes to reverse these changes have been instated .
The United States Department of State , in its International Religious Freedom reports of 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 , stated that attempts at Hinduizing education endangered religious freedom in India .
Now it appears that this same strategy is insinuating itself in California .
Hindu nationalist curricula must not masquerade as ' standard education ' in California .
The California State Board of Education must note that that the VF and HEF and their supporters are closely connected to Hindu nationalist organizations .
The HEF , its coordinators and advisors , for example , include members of the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh ( HSS , the US counterpart of the RSS ) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America ( VHP - A ) , another key Hindutva organization .
The Hindu American Foundation has threatened legal action against the California Board of Education in regard to the textbook changes .
Its president , Dr. Mihir Meghani , has been a member of both the HSS and VHP-A .
Hindu nationalists in the US have been targeting Professors Michael Witzel ( Harvard University ) , James Heitzman ( UC , Davis ) , and Stanley Wolpert ( UCLA ) .
These scholars reviewed the edits proposed by Hindu nationalists and suggested responsible changes premised on credible histories .
Mr. Gaurang Desai of the HSS derogatorily equated Professor Witzel to Hitler in speaking to the Curriculum Commission .
This is ironic criticism given Hindutva 's professed admiration for Hitler and the Nazi Party , as Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar , an early RSS ideologue , expressed in 1938 , in ' We or Our Nation Defined ' : ‘ Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of the Semitic races -- the Jews .
National pride at its highest has been manifested here . ’
He continued : ‘ The non-Hindu people in Hindustan [ homeland of Hindus ] .... may stay in the country wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation claiming nothing , deserving no privileges , far less any preferential treatment , not even citizen 's rights ’
After being nominated Chief Minister of Gujarat in October 2001 , Mr. Narendra Modi incorporated the teachings of Hindutva in his governance of Gujarat .
According to a Times of India article , entitled , ' In Modi ’s Gujarat , Hitler is a textbook hero ' , tenth grade school texts : ' present a frighteningly uncritical picture of Fascism and Nazism .
The strong national pride that both these phenomena generated , the efficiency in the bureaucracy and the administration and other " achievements " are detailed , but the exterminations of Jews and atrocities against trade unionists , migrant laborers , and any section of people who did not fit into Mussolini or Hitler 's definition of rightful citizen do not find mention . '
Hate mail directed at Professor Witzel has accused him of being a ' racist ' .
This is a despicable example of slander , and , in the name of a high moral principle , makes a mockery of the seriousness of racism .
Respected and credentialed scholars such as Professor Witzel and others who served on the review panel must be judged by the merits of their scholarship .
Instead , Hindu nationalists , such as Mr. Desai and Dr. Yvette Rosser , who ambiguously refers to Professor Witzel as ' a professor from Harvard University ' ( India - West ) , systematically fabricate libelous and defamatory allegations to discredit individuals , rather than engage with integrity the issues raised by those who oppose them .
Issues of racism and ethnocentrism that diasporic communities are confronted with in the United States are of critical concern and prompt us to seek curricular changes , hoping that a respectful curriculum will further facilitate a multicultural society .
In proposing curricular changes , we must however make distinctions between national pride that wishes to put forward a uniform and glorifying version of history and the scholarship of history , which seeks to present the complexities within .
Fiction as history does not benefit Indian - American and other California school - goers , for whom engagement with the past must facilitate a deep questioning of how things come to be , of what constitutes knowledge , of how knowledge is contested , so that the study of history informs the work of citizenship .

IF YOU'RE going to complain about your opponent getting too much press attention , and that he 's a celebrity , then when you give a radio address , it 's your time , Mr McCain !
Try to , you know , leave that Obama fellow to one side .
After the jump , the text of Mr McCain 's weekly radio address , with the bits about Mr Obama in blue , the bits about Mr McCain in red .
I make it 414 of 815 words about his opponent , and 372 about himself .
It really does give the impression that it's all about Mr Obama , something the McCain folks themselves have ( rightly ) complained about .
Good morning , this is John McCain .
The differences between my opponent and me are coming into sharper focus .
As the day draws closer , the choice becomes clearer .
One difference is our willingness to break ranks with our own political parties when principle and good sense demand it .
When a Republican administration was making terrible mistakes in Iraq , I spoke up against it .
And I spoke for the new strategy that has saved us from a catastrophic American defeat in the Middle East .
This was back when Senator Obama was speaking as if Iraq was a lost cause , confidently declaring the surge would fail and calling for an immediate withdrawal of our troops no matter how disastrous the consequences .
I have seen war up close .
I know its terrible costs .
And , as president , I am going to end this war -- by winning it .
When my own party turned out to be just as financially irresponsible as my opponent 's party -- spending recklessly and leaving more debt for your children to pay -- I spoke up .
When America needed reform in energy policy , the current administration and likeminded Republicans in Congress served up yet another energy bill stuffed with corporate welfare -- and Senator Obama joined them .
I spoke up for real reform to lower energy prices , and to gain energy security for our country .
My independence has n't always made me friends in Washington .
It has n't always done much for my political prospects , either .
The pundits and pollsters have written me off many times -- and , now and then , they seemed to be on to something .
But I do n't answer to the pundits and pollsters .
I answer to you .
And even when we do n't agree , you will always know exactly where I stand .
For his part , Senator Obama is an impressive orator , and it's a lucky thing for me that people are n't just choosing a motivational speaker .
Washington is full of talented talkers .
And Senator Obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while .
Unfortunately , on issues big and small , what he says and what he does are often two different things .
Senator Obama says he 's going to change Washington .
But his plan to raise your taxes and expand the federal government is not exactly my idea of a solution to what troubles Washington .
In fact , it bears a suspicious resemblance to the problem .
Real change in Washington requires a top - to - bottom review to root out wasteful spending , and a willingness to veto bills with useless and costly earmarks .
Senator Obama himself has requested more than a million dollars in pork per working day since he arrived in Congress .
That is just the kind of abuse we need to end in Washington , and I know how to end it .
Senator Obama says he will raise taxes only on the rich .
But in the Senate , he voted for tax hikes that would have impacted those taking home just $ 32,000 a year .
He has proposed tax increases on income taxes , capital gains taxes , dividend taxes , estate taxes , and Social Security taxes .
All of these tax increases are the fine print under his slogans , and they add up to more than a trillion dollars in new taxes over the next decade .
Raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it would kill more jobs in an economy thats already losing too many .
I 'm going to keep current tax rates low , and cut others , not because I want to make the rich richer , but because low tax rates keep jobs in America and create new ones .
Senator Obama says he wants energy independence , but he does n't support anything that serves that goal .
He is opposed to new domestic drilling , opposed to nuclear power , and wants to add taxes to coal producers .
He has said the high cost of gasoline does n't bother him , only that it rose too quickly .
He believes every domestic energy source has a problem .
I believe every energy source needs to be part of the solution .
We need to develop new advanced alternative energies like wind , solar , tide and biofuels , but we also need to develop more existing energies like nuclear power and clean coal .
And we need to start drilling and producing more oil at home , and bring down the cost of gasoline that is killing our economy .
To summarize the Obama agenda : Government is too big , and he wants to grow it .
Taxes are too high , and he wants to raise them .
Congress spends too much , and he proposes more .
We need more energy , and he 's against producing it .
We 're finally winning in Iraq , and he wants to forfeit .
With an agenda like that , a knack for rhetoric comes in mighty handy .
But good speeches are n't everything in politics -- good judgment matters too .
And that 's what America is going to need from the next commander in chief .
Thanks for listening .
TSA mishap results in grounding of nine planes RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday August 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Negligence during TSA security checks on planes at Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport caused at least forty commuter flights to be delayed after nine American Eagle planes were grounded , a source told ABC News .
A TSA agent , conducting a security check on a parked plane , reportedly used an air thermometer mounted on the plane 's fuselage as leverage to climb on .
" The brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers , " a pilot wrote on an Internet forum .
" They decided this instrument , the TAT probe , would be adequate to use as a ladder . "
" Our inspector was following routine procedure for securing the aircraft that were on the tarmac , " TSA official Elio Montenegro said .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Tests have cleared the way for the start - up next month of an experiment to restage a mini-version underground of the “ Big Bang ” which created the universe 15 billion years ago , the project chief said on Monday .
In this artist 's impression provided by the journal Science , swirling clouds of hydrogen and helium gases are illuminated by the first starlight to shine in the universe after the Big Bang .

Lyn Evans of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) said weekend trials in the vast underground LHC machine in which the particle - smashing experiment will take place over the coming months and years “ went without a hitch ” .
“ We look forward to a resounding success when we make our first attempt to send a beam all the way round the LHC , ” said Evans , who heads the multinational team of scientists that shaped the project and the machine , the Large Hadron Collider .
The final tests involved pumping a single bunch of energy particles from the project ’s accelerator into the 27 - km ( 17 - mile ) beam pipe of the collider and steering them counter - clockwise around it for about 3 kms ( 2 miles ) .
Earlier in the month a clockwise trial in the LHC -- which runs deep under French and Swiss territory between the Jura mountains and Lake Geneva -- had been equally successful , CERN said .
The LHC team now plans to send a full particle beam all the way around the collider pipe in one direction on September 10 as a prelude to sending beams in both directions and smashing them together later in the year .
That collision , in which both particle clusters will be traveling at the speed of light , will be monitored on computers at CERN and laboratories around the world by scientists looking for , among other things , a particle that made life possible .
The elusive particle , which has been dubbed the “ Higgs boson ” after Scottish physicist Peter Higgs who first postulated nearly 50 years ago that it must exist , is thought to be the mysterious factor that holds matter together .
Recreating a “ Big Bang , ” which most scientists believe is the only explanation of an expanding universe , ought to show how stars and planets came together out of the primeval chaos that followed , the CERN team believes .
Efforts to track it down in a predecessor to the LHC at CERN , and in another experiment in the United States , failed .
But scientists are confident that the vast leap in technologies represented by the LHC will make the difference .
Higgs , a 79 - year - old Edinburgh University professor who as an atheist angrily rejects the idea of calling the boson the “ God particle ” -- believes it will show up very quickly once the beams are colliding in the LHC .
“ If it does n’t , ” he said during a visit to CERN earlier this year , “ I shall be very , very puzzled . ”
Selling management on the value of investing time and resources into building an online community using social media is a challenge , and you need all of the support you can get .
One way to convey the value of corporate social media participation is to leverage published statistics about who ’s using social media platforms and how they are using it .
There have been a host of new studies published recently that you can use to help make the case for your own company ’s involvement :
The Society for New Communications Research recently published their report titled , “ New Media , New Influencers & Implications for Public Relations ” that provides several case studies illustrating how social media has benefited organizations like the American Red Cross , the Mayo Clinic and Quicken Loans .
Among their findings , “ Social media is rapidly becoming a core channel for disseminating information .
Fifty - seven percent of this group of early social media adopters reported that social media tools are becoming more valuable to their activities , while 27 % reported that social media is a core element of their communications strategy . ”
One of the most popular studies is the Universal McCann ’s Social Media Research Wave 3 research report , which looked at 17,000 Internet users in 29 countries .
According to this study , social media can have a dramatic impact on your brand ’s reputation .
“ 34 % post opinions about products and brands on their blog and 36 % think more positively about companies that have blogs . ”
The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth Center for Marketing Research recently released the results on the usage of social media in the Inc. 500 .
Of note here , “ Just over one quarter of the Inc. 500 reported social media was very important to their business / marketing strategy in 2007 .
That number has increased to 44 % just one year later . ”
If you ’re especially interested in stats about Facebook or other social networking sites , Comscore released some statistics earlier this month announcing the growth of social networking worldwide .
Included is the statistic that social networking use grew 25 % year over year worldwide , with notable increases in Europe and the Middle East .
Rapleaf released the results of their study examining the gender and age of social network users .
Note that these two studies were conducted independent of each other , so do n’t confuse the results between them .
As part of the promotion for their book Groundswell , Charlene Li and Josh Bernhoff created the Social Technographics profile tool where users can plug in some basic information and then see how participation varies among demographics .
The resulting graphs are useful in illustrating the social media habits of your target audience .
You can also use Trendpedia or BlogPulse to create interesting visuals examining keyword statistics about topics in your industry .

Sprinkle with herbs and bake until crusty ; serve to everyone but Jeff .
Vegetarian friends ?
Try veggie rumaki : wrap a strip of imitation bacon around a water chestnut , spear with a toothpick , and broil — but instead of imitation bacon use real bacon , and instead of a water chestnut use veal .
Steal Cheryl ’s famous potato - salad recipe .
When Cheryl asks , “ Why did you steal my recipe ? , ” say , “ I do n’t know , Cheryl , why did you break my heart ? ”
Then laugh so she knows you ’re just kidding .
Blend fresh crabmeat with diced avocado , scallions , and a dollop of mayonnaise for a canapé topping so delicious that it will take your guests a full minute to realize that they ’re eating it off dog biscuits .
Once they catch on , act mortified and stammer that you must have “ mixed up the boxes , ” until everyone calms down .
Then start crying because the biscuits remind you that today marks exactly eight weeks since you had to put down Buster , and you just miss him so much .
Tell Marissa that you appreciate her concern , but in the two years since Cheryl broke off the engagement you ’ve grown up a lot , and you ’re really in a much healthier place now .
Then say , “ Speaking of fiancés , how ’s Peter ’s alcoholism ? ” ( Note : This is not technically an appetizer . )
For a taste of the U.K. , fry up mini-servings of fish - and - chips .
Take it to the next level by wrapping them in small pieces of newspaper , which , oddly enough , all seem to be printed with unfavorable reviews of Jeff ’s novel .
Have you ever noticed how sun-dried tomatoes and top - grade peyote look exactly the same ?
Not a suggestion , really .
Just saying .
Another one for the vegetarians .
If they think they like tofu , wait until they sample your delicious mock tofu — all you need is chicken fat , puréed pork loin , and five cups of piping - hot tallow .
Cheryl will never know the difference .
Tempura makes great finger food , and the batter locks the flavor of just about anything in a savory , opaque crust .
Impress your friends with creative choices , from squash blossoms to mislaid car keys to the two - carat engagement ring that Cheryl gave back to you after she “ reassessed things . ”
Surprise !
Guests getting antsy ?
Head them off with a big bowl of steamed mussels .
No one can resist mussels , not even emotionally stunted ex-fiancées and their new poorly - received - novelist boyfriends .
Besides , disappearing into the kitchen will give you a chance to collect your thoughts and also to go slash Jeff ’s tires .
Homemade sugared almonds make the perfect sendoff , sure to please all your guests , even the ones who would be bludgeoning you with a tire iron if Peter were n’t standing between you .
Good old Peter .
He may not be the brightest or the handsomest person , but he ’s very large .
As the party disperses , your guests might seem a little ungrateful , calling you an obsessive sociopath or pelting you with sugared almonds .
Do n’t worry , it ’s probably the peyote talking .
Just stand on the porch as their cars pull out , your eyes brimming with tears , and shout , “ You know , I try , I really do . . . ”
Add , “ My dog died !
He died !
And he ’s never coming back ! ”

で、注目の新作だが、日本盤のほうがなぜか圧倒的に価格が安いようなので、その発売を待ったほうがよさげである。
The decision by the Federal Reserve to loan insurance giant AIG $ 85 billion in return for as much as 80 % ownership of the company is by any measure dramatic .
The takeover early last week of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac represented the culmination of years of intermingling of public and private interests .
But the AIG move is de facto a government nationalization of an ailing private company , which , if not unprecedented , has rarely happened in the United States .
Even if the intervention was imperative , its scope is startling .
The crisis on Wall Street has , of course , become a political football .
Cries of " moral hazard " and " socialism " on one side are drowned out by charges that the current mess is the result of deregulation , and too cozy a relationship between " Wall Street fat cats " and the current administration in Washington .
If only reality were that simple .
The blame game will continue , but it wo n't do much to fix what 's broken .
Let 's get a few canards out of the way : First , yes , stupidity and cupidity and complacency and hubris are involved , and yes , there is gambling in Casablanca .
Second , the idea that there is this thing called " the free market " that governments tame or muck up with regulation is a fiction .
Governments create the legal conditions for markets ; markets shape what governments can do or are willing to do .
Regulation versus free - market is a false dichotomy .
Maybe in some theoretical universe , if we could start with a blank slate and construct society anew , it would n't be .
But we exist in a web of markets and regulations , and the challenge is to respond to problems in such a way so that we decrease the odds of future crises .
And that is where AIG becomes instructive .
Even good regulations can't prevent all future crises , especially ones that are the result of new technologies and changes that result from them .
The capital flows , derivatives contracts and nearly frictionless interlinking of global markets today are the direct result of the information technologies of the 1990s .
The implications were n't known until very recently , so it would have been nearly impossible for regulations to have prevented what is happening .
But if good regulation can't prevent crises , bad regulations can cause them .
The current meltdown is n't the result of too much regulation or too little .
The root cause is bad regulation .
Acupuncture is the practice of placing very thin needles through the skin in specific locations of the body for the purpose of healing and relief of symptoms .
This practice is several thousand years old and is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine .
As practiced today it is often combined with other interventions , such as sending a small current of electricity through the needles or burning herbs on the acupuncture points ( a practice called moxibustion ) .
Acupuncture has recently been transplanted to the West , riding the wave of tolerance for unscientific treatment practices marketed as “ complementary and alternative medicine . ”
While advocates have been successful at pushing acupuncture into the culture , the scientific medical community has still not accepted the practice as a legitimate scientific practice .
I count myself among those extremely skeptical of acupuncture .
I outline here the reasons for my continued skepticism .
1 ) Acupuncture is a pre-scientific superstition
Proponents often cite acupuncture ’s ancient heritage as a virtue , but I see it as a vice .
Acupuncture was developed in a pre-scientific culture , before anything significant was understand about biology , the normal functioning of the human body , or disease pathology .
The healing practices of the time were part of what is called philosophy - based medicine , to be distinguished from modern science - based medicine .
Philosophy - based systems began with a set of ideas about health and illness and based their treatments on those ideas .
The underlying assumptions and the practices derived from them were never subjected to controlled observation or anything that can reasonably be called a scientific process .
An example from Western culture of philosophy - based medicine was the humoral theory – the notion that health was the result of the four bodily humors being in proper balance while illness reflected one or more humors being out of balance .
Treatments therefore sought to increase or decrease one or more of the humors ( such as the practice of blood - letting ) to re-establish balance .
The humoral theory survived for several thousand years in Western societies , perpetuated by culture and the power of deception inherent in anecdotal evidence .
Acupuncture is based upon the Eastern philosophy of chi ( also spelled qi ) , which is their name for the supposed life force or vital energy that animates living things .
In Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) chi flows through pathways in the body known as meridians .
Illness results from the flow of chi through the meridians being blocked , or by the two types of chi ( yin and yang ) being out of balance .
Acupuncture is the practice of placing thin needles at acupuncture points , which are said to coincide with points at which meridians cross , to improve the flow and restore the balance of chi .
There is no more reason to believe in the reality of chi than there is in the four humors , or in the effectiveness of acupuncture than the effectiveness of blood letting .
2 ) Acupuncture lacks a plausible mechanism
Centuries of advancement in our understanding of biology has made the notion of life energy unnecessary .
Further , no one has been able to detect life energy or formulate a scientifically coherent theory as to what life energy is , where it comes from , and how it interacts with matter or other forms of energy .
Withn science , the vitalists lost the debate over a century ago .
Without chi , there is no underlying basis for acupuncture as a medical intervention .
Recent attention given to acupuncture has attempted to bring it into the scientific fold by hypothesizing physical mechanisms for its alleged effects .
For example , some proponents argue that the needles may stimulate the release of pain - killing natural chemicals , or relax tense muscles , or inhibit the conduction of pain through counter - irritation .
These potential mechanisms , while more plausible than the non-existent chi , remain speculative .
Further , they would only explain a very non-specific effect of acupuncture ( no better than rubbing your elbow after accidentally banging it against something hard ) .
They might account for a temporary mild reduction in pain .
Such mechanisms could not account for any of the medical claims made for acupuncture , or the alleged existence of acupuncture points .
Further , it is misleading to say that such mechanisms could explain “ acupuncture . ”
Acupuncture is the needling of acupuncture points to affect the flow and balance of chi .
Using needles to mechanically produce a temporary local counter - irritation effect is not acupuncture – even though it may be an incidental consequence of this practice and may have contributed to its perceived effectiveness .
3 ) Claims for efficacy are often based upon a bait - and - switch deception .
The most common example of the “ bait - and - switch ” for acupuncture are studies that examined the effects on pain of electrical stimulation through acupuncture needles .
This is not acupuncture – it is transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( TENS ) , which is an accepted treatment for chronic pain , masquerading as acupuncture .
This is not a quibble .
Science requires unambiguous definition of terms and concepts .
If acupuncture is said to be something scientifically then it must have some specific and unique characteristics .
In medicine that means it should have a specific mechanism of action – and it is that mechanism that we would call acupuncture .
Electrical stimulation is no more acupuncture than if I injected morphine through a hollow acupuncture needle and then claimed that any resulting pain relief was due to “ acupuncture . ”
Further , during a typical acupuncture treatment there are many other incidental effects that may occur .
The atmosphere is often relaxing , and practitioners typically will palpate the “ acupuncture points ” prior to inserting the needles , for example .
Practitioners also provide their kind attention , which has a positive psychological therapeutic value .
There are therefore many nonspecific subjective effects that could lead to clients feeling better , making the actual insertion of needles an unnecessary component .
Reports of acupuncture anaesthesia are also misleading .
Independent investigation shows that patients having surgery under anaesthesia ( dramatic reports of which are largely credited with acupuncture ’s popularity in the West ) reveal that patients were receiving morphine in the IV fluid .
Other reports indicate that patient were experiencing great pain , but were simply instructed to remain quiet by the surgeon ( a product of Eastern culture ) .
There are no verified reports of acupuncture serving as effective anesthesia during surgery .
4 ) Clinical trials show that acupuncture does not work
The previous points are all reasons to be highly skeptical of the claims made for acupuncture , but they are all also trumped by the ultimate consideration – the direct scientific evidence .
There is a surprisingly large published literature on the clinical effects of acupuncture .
Most people are equally surprised to learn that the literature is essentially negative – probably because the press cherry picks apparently positive studies and re-prints without investigation the press releases of acupuncture proponents .
It is important to evaluate the literature as a whole to see what pattern emerges .
The pattern that does emerge is most consistent with a null effect – that acupuncture does not work .
Controlled clinical trials of actual acupuncture ( uncontrolled trials should only be considered preliminary and are never definitive ) typically have three arms : a control group with no intervention or standard treatment , a sham - acupuncture group ( needles are placed but in the “ wrong ” locations or not deep enough ) , and a real acupuncture group .
Most of such trials , for any intervention including pain , nausea , addiction , and others , show no difference between the sham - acupuncture group and the acupuncture group .
They typically do show improved outcome in both acupuncture groups over the no-intervention group , but this is typical of all clinical trials and is clearly due to placebo - type effects .
Such comparisons should be considered unblinded because patients know if they were getting acupuncture ( sham or real ) .
The lack of any advantage of real over sham acupuncture means that it does not matter where the needles are placed .
This is completely consistent with the hypothesis that any perceived benefits from acupuncture are non-specific effects from the process of getting the treatment , and not due to any alleged specific effects of acupuncture .
In other words , there is no evidence that acupuncture is manipulating chi or anything else , that the meridians have any basis in reality , or that the specific process of acupuncture makes any difference .
More recent trials have attempted to improve the blinded control of such trials by using acupuncture needles that are contained in an opaque sheath .
The acupuncturist depresses a plunger , and neither they nor the patient knows if the needle is actually inserted .
The pressure from the sheath itself would conceal any sensation from the needle going in .
So far , such studies show no difference between those who received needle insertion and those who did not – supporting the conclusion that acupuncture has no detectable specific health effect .
Taken as a whole , the pattern of the acupuncture literature follows one with which scientists are very familiar : the more tightly controlled the study the smaller the effect , and the best controlled trials are negative .
This pattern is highly predictive of a null - effect – that there is no actual effect from acupuncture .
Rice : McCain may have made Georgia crisis worse
On Hardball last night , Obama advisor Susan Rice voiced the strongest version I 've heard of the criticism of McCain 's rapid condemnation of Russia Thursday .
" John McCain shot from the hip , [ with a ] very aggressive , very belligerent statement , " she said .
" He may or may not have complicated the situation . "
McCain 's first statement was dramatically different from the White House 's , Obama's , and the Western Europeans , all of whom were urging calm , and all of whom shifted to condemning Russia only after it emerged that that was futile .
( Indeed , Obama moved toward McCain 's statement just a couple of hours later . )
I have n't seen it suggested , however , that the Russian push past the disputed regions was in response to McCain .
UPDATE : Tim Kaine , meanwhile , seems to have given Obama credit for the ceasefire .
Red Light Cameras Don't Work
Interesting : the solution to one problem causes another .
“ The rigorous studies clearly show red - light cameras do n’t work , ” said lead author Barbara Langland - Orban , professor and chair of health policy and management at the USF College of Public Health .
“ Instead , they increase crashes and injuries as drivers attempt to abruptly stop at camera intersections . ”
Comprehensive studies from North Carolina , Virginia , and Ontario have all reported cameras are associated with increases in crashes .
The study by the Virginia Transportation Research Council also found that cameras were linked to increased crash costs .
The only studies that conclude cameras reduced crashes or injuries contained “ major research design flaws , ” such as incomplete data or inadequate analyses , and were always conducted by researchers with links to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
The IIHS , funded by automobile insurance companies , is the leading advocate for red - light cameras since insurance companies can profit from red - light cameras by way of higher premiums due to increased crashes and citations .
And , of course , the agenda of the government is to increase revenue due to fines :
A 2001 paper by the Office of the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives reported that red - light cameras are “ a hidden tax levied on motorists . ”
The report came to the same conclusions that all of the other valid studies have , that red - light cameras are associated with increased crashes and that the timings at yellow lights are often set too short to increase tickets for red - light running .
That ’s right , the state actually tampers with the yellow light settings to make them shorter , and more likely to turn red as you ’re driving through them .
In fact , six U.S. cities have been found guilty of shortening the yellow light cycles below what is allowed by law on intersections equipped with cameras meant to catch red- light runners .
Those local governments have completely ignored the safety benefit of increasing the yellow light time and decided to install red - light cameras , shorten the yellow light duration , and collect the profits instead .
The cities in question include Union City , CA , Dallas and Lubbock , TX , Nashville and Chattanooga , TN , and Springfield , MO , according to Motorists.org , which collected information from reports from around the country .

You may not think of public broadcast television at the cutting edge of innovation , but PBS is proving otherwise .
A trio of traditional media organizations , including PBS , The New Republic , and the National Review , are teaming up with social news site Reddit to create an experimental new interactive news program called YourWeek that allows people to actively participate in determining what news stories get reported .
Using Reddit , which allows users to vote stories up and down and have conversations around particular items , YourWeek producers , " search out the smartest conversation and stories from your world " and use the wisdom of crowds to determine what stories they should cover .
Basically , it 's " the traditional weekly " story meeting " with 10,000 people ( or more ) instead of just the small editorial staff , " said Erik Martin , the online producer for YourWeek , who took the time to explain the start - up 's strategy to Citizentube .
" We 'll post questions to the Reddit community , ask them for the best angles on stories , or just ask them which headlines from the front page they 'd like to see explored on the show . "
The YourWeek team then posts drafts of each of the video story segments online ( here on YouTube ) and solicits feedback from the community , which they then incorporate into the final version of the episode .
After the show is completed , the discussion continues back on the web and users can start suggesting content for the next episode .
" Ideally , " Alexis Ohanian , co-founder of Reddit , told us , " it 's 24 - 7 news program that marries the quality of PBS journalism with the vast resources and timeliness of the Internet . "
YourWeek is still in beta , so it 's hard to say if this is the future of television just yet -- but our curiosity is highly piqued .
Stay tuned !
With the economy in turmoil and the country ’s second - largest insurer faltering , John McCain was unequivocal Tuesday : “ We cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else . ”
By Wednesday , he had changed his mind .
The rapid about - face followed another quick retreat by the Republican presidential nominee earlier this week when he insisted that “ the fundamentals of our economy are strong ” even as one brokerage house filed for bankruptcy , another nearly went under and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 504 points .
McCain ’s reversals underscored the difficulty he has had in finding the right response to the deteriorating economy , the issue voters say is most important .
The reversals also highlight the contradiction between McCain ’s oft - repeated campaign message -- that the federal government should largely stay out of the economy -- and his new promises to help voters whose jobs , houses and retirement accounts are disappearing .

In a matter of days , McCain shifted from invoking small - government icon Ronald Reagan to quoting Franklin D. Roosevelt , the architect of the modern regulatory state .
And he and his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , dropped their promise , as Palin put it , to “ get government out of the way of private - sector progress , ” and are now pledging “ stringent oversight ” to deal with “ a toxic waste there on Wall Street . ”
The wildly swinging rhetoric from the McCain campaign has delighted Barack Obama , who just last week was struggling to respond to the enthusiasm whipped up by Palin ’s unexpected arrival on the national stage .
Campaigning in Nevada on Wednesday , the Democratic nominee mocked McCain ’s attempts to cast himself as a reformer .
“ This is somebody who ’s been in Congress for 26 years , who put seven of the most powerful Washington lobbyists in charge of his campaign , ” Obama said .

McCain ’s zigzags on the deepening economic crisis may also be stirring doubts with some voters .
Several recent polls suggest that his post - convention lead is slipping away .
The latest New York Times / CBS poll , taken Friday through Tuesday , found that Obama had the support of 48 % of registered voters to 43 % for McCain , a statistical tie .
Voters overwhelmingly indicated the economy was their top issue and that they had more confidence in Obama than in McCain to make the right decisions .
And a CNN / Time / Opinion Research poll , taken Sunday through Tuesday , showed the race deadlocked in some battleground states , including Florida and Ohio .
This is not the first time in the presidential campaign that McCain has appeared to be caught off guard by an economic crisis .

Six months ago , as signs emerged of a slowdown in the housing market , McCain chided Hillary Rodham Clinton , then still competing for the Democratic nomination , for offering a plan to help homeowners facing foreclosure , noting critically that it looked “ very expensive . ”
After McCain was criticized for appearing unsympathetic , he came back several weeks later with a plan he said would help “ well - meaning , deserving homeowners ” facing foreclosure .
In May , though , McCain was back to attacking government intervention .
In a speech to the National Restaurant Assn. in Chicago , he mocked Obama ’s and Clinton ’s plans for “ more federal regulation , more government control of the economy , ” according to a text of his remarks .
And in July , when a report showed that the nation had shed 62,000 jobs the month before , McCain issued a statement warning : “ We can not . . . increase regulation . ”
Advertisement
Just three weeks ago , McCain -- who once said he was “ proud to be a foot soldier ” in the “ Reagan revolution ” -- was accepting the Republican presidential nomination with tough rhetoric about bureaucrats and bloated government .
Palin , too , invoked Reagan ’s famous quip that “ government is the problem ” as she touted her own record of limiting the role of government as mayor of Wasilla , Alaska .
“ I reminded people that government is not always the answer , ” Palin said at a rally in Lee ’s Summit , Mo. , last week .
“ In fact , too often government is often the problem . ”
Yet while campaigning in Michigan on Wednesday , McCain twice quoted Roosevelt , calling the president who triumphed over Republicans to create a vast system of regulatory agencies and government programs “ one of our great presidents . ”
( McCain was reminding autoworkers at a General Motors plant in Lake Orion that Roosevelt had urged optimism even in the depths of the Great Depression . )

Instead of attacking government , McCain and Palin now routinely call for robust federal action .
“ We ’ve got to get a more coordinated and a much more stringent oversight regime , ” Palin said Wednesday in an interview on Fox News Channel ’s “ Hannity & Colmes . ”
“ Government can play a very , very appropriate role in the oversight . ”
Obama , who has consistently criticized the Bush administration ’s economic management , avoided taking a position on the American International Group rescue plan , saying Wednesday , “ We do not know all the details . ”
The Illinois senator added that the plan should not “ bail out the shareholders or management of AIG . ”
But he and his running mate , Joe Biden , have been working to exploit McCain ’s changing positions to cast doubt on his ability to tackle the economy .
Biden , who began a two - day swing through Ohio on Wednesday , blasted the Arizona senator before a raucous crowd in Muamee , Ohio .

“ All of a sudden it ’s : ‘ My goodness , there ’s greed on Wall Street .
My goodness , we need common - sense regulation , ’ ” Biden said , citing examples of workers who lost their jobs while the chief executives of failed companies walked away with golden parachutes .
“ Please , please , please spare me about how Republicans are good managers of our money . ”
As Obama has intensified his attacks , the McCain campaign has appeared unprepared to respond the fast - changing economic landscape .
As recently as Tuesday , the campaign ’s senior policy advisor flatly rejected any detailed plan to deal with the mounting crisis .
“ The senator is not running to be Treasury secretary .
He ’s not running to be head of the SEC .
He is running to be the leader of the United States .
He can and has the judgment to put people in place with the technical expertise , ” Douglas Holtz - Eakin told reporters .
“ The moment when we write down a specific piece is the moment we send legislation from a McCain administration to Congress , ” Holtz - Eakin added .

On Wednesday , Holtz - Eakin said McCain would create a bipartisan fact - finding commission to study the crisis .
He also said that McCain would push legislation to strengthen financial regulators and protect consumers from mortgage fraud .

When the dog days of summer come to an end , one thing we can be sure of is that the school year that follows will see more fights over the teaching of evolution and whether intelligent design , or even Biblical accounts of creation , have a place in America ’s science classrooms .
In these arguments , evolution is treated as an abstract subject that deals with the age of the earth or how fish first flopped onto land .
It ’s discussed as though it were an optional , quaint and largely irrelevant part of biology .
And a common consequence of the arguments is that evolution gets dropped from the curriculum entirely .
This is a travesty .
It is also dangerous .
Evolution should be taught  indeed , it should be central to beginning biology classes  for at least three reasons .
First , it provides a powerful framework for investigating the world we live in .
Without evolution , biology is merely a collection of disconnected facts , a set of descriptions .
The astonishing variety of nature , from the tree shrew that guzzles vast quantities of alcohol every night to the lichens that grow in the Antarctic wastes , cannot be probed and understood .
Add evolution  and it becomes possible to make inferences and predictions and ( sometimes ) to do experiments to test those predictions .
All of a sudden patterns emerge everywhere , and apparently trivial details become interesting .
What is the speed of the Solar System ?
( by Amara Graps )
Or , how fast is the Sun ( Solar System ) hurling towards the constellation Hercules ?
From the book : _ Guide to the Galaxy_ , 1994 ; Henbest and Couper ; Cambridge University Press .
The Sun is moving towards Lambda Herculis at 20 kilometers per second or 12 miles per second .
Or in units " per hour " : 72,000 kilometers per hour or 45,000 miles per hour .
This speed is in a frame of rest if the other stars were all standing still .
The three - dimensional picture of the Sun 's movement through the Galaxy is a little more complicated .
The Sun is moving upwards , out of the plane of the Milky Way , at a speed of 7 kilometers per second .
Currently the Sun lies 50 light - years above the mid-plane of the galaxy , and its motion is steadily carrying it further away .
But the gravitational pull of the stars in the Galactic ( Milky Way ) plane is slowing down the Sun 's escape .
The astronomer Frank Bash estimates that in 14 million years the sun will reach its maximum height above the Galactic disk .
From that 250 light - year position , it will be pulled back towards the plane of the Galaxy .
Passing through , it will travel to a point 250 light - years below the disk , then oscillate upwards again to reach its present position 66 million years from now .
We crossed the plane 2 million years ago .
We are currently in the thick of the galactic disk and our view of distant regions is largely blocked by dust but 10 - 20 million years from now , our motion will allow a full view of our starry galaxy .
The Sun-Galactic center distance is 25,000 light - years -- plus or minus 2,000 light - years .
The galaxy is thought to be 100,000 light - years in diameter and we are thought to be about halfway out from the center ( used to be thought that we were two - thirds out ) .
If you have a good idea of the Sun 's distance from the Galactic center , then the solar system 's speed can be approximated .
Using speed measurements of the gas at different distances from the Galactic center , the Sun appears to be cruising along at 200 kilometers per second and it takes 240 million years to complete the grand circuit around the Galaxy .
This speed is an absolute speed .
Note :
1 light - year = 9.46*10 ^ { 15} meters
1 parsec = 3.08 *10 ^ {16} meters

Robert Bly. Iron John : A Book About Men. Addison - Wesley , New York 1990 .
Reviewed by Daniel Egger , Yale Law School Iron John has a thesis : U.S. fathers fail to give their sons what they need to be men .
Young men need initiation into adulthood , to be welcomed among the fathers of the world , or they rage and sulk alone through life .
Robert Bly was a Movement leader , and the war in Vietnam stands behind this book .
Bly views the radical break in generations which characterized the Vietnam War at home as a consequence of the long - broken connection between fathers and sons .
Modern history provided the dynamic , but the war brought a crisis .
Distrust of the father , a quiet reality of U.S. life , became riotous rebellion as a consequence of the war , where all distrust proved justified .
Bly says , " The older men in the American military establishment and government did betray the younger men in Vietnam , lying about the nature of the war , remaining in safe places themselves , after having asked the young men to be warriors and then in effect sending them out to be ordinary murderers . " ( at p.95 ) That rift has never been healed , or even acknowledged and mourned .
The story of the lives of U.S. men which Bly tells is easily recognizable .
As men grow up , they seek without clear direction to do what society expects .
They work dutifully , but even as they " succeed " they find feelings freezing up and vitality drifting away .
Friendships fade and they slip into isolation .
By the time they reach 45 or 50 they are numb inside .
Children find them foolish and wives find them dull .
It does n't matter that a man may have done everything " right . "
The John Wayne stories he told himself in his twenties about what it means to be a man , the understanding of toughness as stoicism and denial , just do not work for a lifetime .
If he allows himself his feelings , they are : disappointment that he does n't enjoy the anticipated pleasures of manhood , and anger that his father did not give him what he needed as a boy .
He feels loss .
In short , he grieves .
Bly has spent the last few years talking about this problem to groups of men .
He offers them traditional initiatory solutions .
The meetings are part poetry reading , part spiritual retreat , part group therapy .
That his book has become a number - one best seller in the United States suggests he has indeed tapped a deep well of unspoken pain .
Bly 's exposition in his book follows his technique in the face to face meetings .
Bly tells a fairy tale , which like all fairy tales comes down to the present from an initiatory culture .
He recounts a bit of the story , pauses to give an interpretation , quotes a poem on a related theme , talks about his own ideas , then returns to the tale again .
It is a controlled meander , as if he wishes less to persuade than to sensitize his audience , and remind them to turn for verification to the inner world which has always been the true home of myth and poetry .
Bly takes seriously the poet 's traditional sacred responsibility as preserver and transmitter of the collective memory of spiritual experience .
Bly began to recognize the crippled inner life of men in U.S. culture when he was in his mid-40s .
He had achieved success as a poet , but he had never written a word about his father .
Bly began a process of self - investigation , supplemented by formalized discussions with other men , perhaps an outgrowth of veterans ' rap groups .
He concluded that in almost all cultures boys are taken from their parents and deliberately initiated into manhood by the older men of society .
There men acquire roles which encompass the full range of men's inner experience .
The father cannot himself be the initiator ; as Bly says , " it 's too tense ; after all you 're both in love with the same woman . "
However , in " traditional " ( for want of a better word ) societies fathers do have a vital role to play , as protectors and educators of their children .
Yet in our culture fathers fail even in this more limited role .
Not that it is a personal failing on their part .
Bly stresses that it is not a question of personal blame but that individual failings are part of a larger pattern .
In the special mythology of the U.S. , says Bly , all you need to do to become an American man is reject your father .
In situation comedies , in popular media , fathers are portrayed as weak and ridiculous .
In this atmosphere it is little wonder that older men lack the confidence , or even the knowledge needed , to be more generous .
In Bly 's view their failure has to be seen to have its roots in the modern collapse of millenia - old ways of living and working .
Bly dates the roots of the present grief to the rise of industrialization in the early nineteenth century .
Once , young men could work alongside their fathers .
This is the characteristic way fathers teach their sons ; not face to face , but shoulder to shoulder .
Now most sons hardly know what their fathers do at work .
Fathers disappear early in the morning and return in the evening exhausted , irritable , frustrated from the demands and abuses of the workplace .
They are even mean or drunk .
Or they simply run away , and make their absence complete .
Thus the father boys see is not so admirable , nor what one would want to emulate : he is almost pathetic .
Yet in our society , parents are often the only models boys have .
Caring relations between men have broken down at every level , not just within the family .
Men rarely rely on one another .
Nor do older men feel an obligation to help and encourage younger men as they come along .
On the contrary , competition rules almost every relation between men .
Most men have no successful initiatory experiences .
The drill instructor is not a true initiator ; he may train our bodies , but he cares nothing for the life of our soul .
One relationship roughly analogous to that of initiator exists in our culture : the academic or corporate mentor .
The relationship of student to mentor can be highly charged , unstable , and often ends in betrayal .
Yet those who are lucky enough to find a mentor have found far more than most men .
It is interesting to examine the phenomenon of the counter - culture from the point of view of these ideas .
Whether through long hair or search for alternative philosophies and states of consciousness , its male adherents acted out their rejection of the Fathers and everything they stood for .
But driving that rejection was the grief of shattered illusions .
Interestingly , the most successful and permanent manifestation of counter - culture rejection of the ways of older men has proved to be feminism .
Feminism ' scritique of male aggression , misogyny , and the self - destructiveness of male roles has much to commend it , and many , if not most , younger men have found themselves drawn to its ideas .
However , feminism represents an accurate critique of male roles in industrial capitalism but does not offer men a full alternative vision of manhood .
As Bly points out , men can not be initiated by women .
Bly talks about a phenomenon he encounters everywhere he goes the " soft man , " who has rejected every aspect of the male roles which might be associated with violence and aggression .
Bly points out how one - sided this response is .
It leaves men ashamed of their natural strengths , their sexual hunger , their wildness , their necessary forcefulness .
Caught in a web of guilt , U.S. men respond to inappropriate violation of their boundaries by being passive , or " nice . "
The result , a sense of playing a role to give women what they think they want , but without bringing any heart to it , may be poisonous to love .
Bly speaks over and over of how easily men can shame women and women men in our culture .
It is for this reason that most meetings
Bly conducts are for men only , so that men , free from fear of being belittled or misunderstood , can speak about their inner life to other men .
Bly and his gatherings have been misunderstood by many feminists , female and male , who believe he is advocating some kind of return to macho values .
This is untrue .
Bly wants to help men to thaw out , to feel what they are , in order that they may begin to look for more adaptive ways of being with one another , their wives , and their children .
In this respect , Bly is directly in the great healing tradition of the poets .
As everybody knows , Dante awoke to find himself at midlife in a dark wood , not knowing where he was or where he was going .
It was not Beatrice who helped him to find himself and reintegrate his fragmented being , but his mentor , Virgil .
But his reunion with Beatrice did come , after the long journey .
There is a tragic irony to Bly 's book which perhaps he himself has not fully considered .
Unlike the meetings he has held around the country , where his own forceful presence brings emotion to the surface , the book is read and experienced in isolation .
Bly identifies the need for direct , man to man acknowledgment of grief and loss .
He makes a compassionate plea that older men take up the challenge of helping younger men by giving them personal recognition of their struggle .
But his book merely describes such nourishment ; it can not provide it .
In fact , as Bly well knows ( since he has obviously sampled Gurdjieff Work and Jungian analytic practice , using an inconsistent hodgepodge of their techniques himself ) all esoteric ideas depend for their efficacy upon personal transmission from the mouth of the teacher to the ear of the student .
His book reads like an edited transcript of a face to face meeting , but it is impersonal and inert on the page .
It is easy to picture thousands of men reading his book alone in their rooms , nodding in agreement , but unable to do anything on their own to ease their sadness or change the nature of their predicament .
To acknowledge inner problems , but do nothing towards a cure , may even be counterproductive , as ideas powerful in the air become vulgarized and dated on the page .

Update : NASA said at a press conference this morning that launch officials were forced to destroy the rocket less than 30 seconds after it ’s 5:10 a.m. launch .
The rocket had veered off - course , although they could n’t say how far , and they had to terminate the flight at about 12,000 feet .
A suborbital rocket carrying experiments conducted by NASA exploded early Friday morning 27 seconds after launch on Wallops Island in Virginia .
The ATK ( Alliant Tech Systems ) rocket lifted off with no apparent problems at 5:10 a.m. NASA said no property damage or injuries have occurred , but there were conflicting reports as to whether debris had been sighted on land .
NASA said it believes that most of the debris landed in the Atlantic Ocean .
NASA said the debris potentially could be hazardous .
People who spot debris are being asked to call Wallops Emergency Operations Center at 757-824-1300 .
“ NASA is very disappointed in this failure but has directed its focus on protecting public safety and conducting a comprehensive investigation to identify the root cause , ” the agency said in a statement .
NASA is assembling a multidiscipline team , along with ATK of Salt Lake City , Utah to begin the investigation promptly .
The payload was a 5 - in - 1 experiment on hypersonic flight , air breathing engines and a rocket recovery system .

A report by scientists from The Netherlands published in The FASEB Journal identifies a compound in human saliva that greatly speeds wound healing .
This research may offer hope to people suffering from chronic wounds related to diabetes and other disorders , as well as traumatic injuries and burns .
In addition , because the compounds can be mass produced , they have the potential to become as common as antibiotic creams and rubbing alcohol .
Specifically , scientists found that histatin , a small protein in saliva previously only believed to kill bacteria was responsible for the healing .
To come to this conclusion , the researchers used epithelial cells that line the inner cheek , and cultured in dishes until the surfaces were completely covered with cells .
Then they made an artificial wound in the cell layer in each dish , by scratching a small piece of the cells away .
In one dish , cells were bathed in an isotonic fluid without any additions .
In the other dish , cells were bathed in human saliva .
After 16 hours the scientists noticed that the saliva treated " wound " was almost completely closed .
In the dish with the untreated " wound , " a substantial part of the " wound " was still open .
This proved that human saliva contains a factor which accelerates wound closure of oral cells .
Because saliva is a complex liquid with many components , the next step was to identify which component was responsible for wound healing .
Using various techniques the researchers split the saliva into its individual components , tested each in their wound model , and finally determined that histatin was responsible .
" This study not only answers the biological question of why animals lick their wounds , " said Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal , " it also explains why wounds in the mouth , like those of a tooth extraction , heal much faster than comparable wounds of the skin and bone .
It also directs us to begin looking at saliva as a source for new drugs .
The Times reports that ITV ’s latest comedy star , Katy Brand , is angry at the decision by ITV lawyers to veto a sketch called The Imam of Dibley , deeming it “ culturally insensitive ” .
Katy Brand ’s Big Ass
Show will not contain the theology graduate ’s Vicar of Dibley spoof , premised on a new imam arriving in a sleepy parish and the misunderstandings that ensue .
Says Katy ,
The vast majority of Muslims are able to have a laugh at themselves just like everyone else .
Why should they be excluded from comedy ?
It ’s funny that ITV had no problem with a new sketch about a pregnant Jesus ’s girlfriend who has to deal with dating the Son of God
A very good question – especially when you consider that Jesus is also a Muslim “ prophet ” , and that to suggest God had a son is highly blasphemous in Islam .
Why did n’t they ban this too ?
TIME columnist Joe Klein
WASHINGTON
IPS
US
TIME columnist Joe Klein ’s accusations that Jewish neoconservatives , who played a particularly visible role in the drive to war in Iraq and have since pushed for military confrontation in Iran , sacrificed “ US lives and money … to make the world safe for Israel ” have spurred angry charges of anti-Semitism and personal attacks from critics at such neoconservative strongholds as The Weekly Standard , National Review , and Commentary .
But the fierceness of the controversy surrounding Klein , generally considered a political centrist , highlights the growing antagonism between neoconservative hardliners and prominent US Jews whose more moderate views are aligned more closely with those of the foreign policy establishment .
The controversy began 24 June , when Klein argued in a TIME blog post that the “ fact that a great many Jewish neoconservatives — people like [ independent Democrat Sen . ]
Joe Lieberman and the crowd at Commentary — plumped for this war [ in Iraq ] , and now for an even more foolish assault on Iran , raised the question of divided loyalties . ”
Within a day , Abraham Foxman , head of the Anti-Defamation League , accused Klein of espousing “ age - old anti-Semitic canards about a Jewish conspiracy to control and manipulate government . ”
The reaction from the right - wing press was even harsher .
Commentary editor John Podhoretz reiterated the accusation of “ anti-Semitic canards ” and called Klein “ manifestly intellectually unstable . ”
Writing in National Review , former George W. Bush speechwriter Peter Wehner called Klein “ a man who cannot control his anger and even hatred . ”
But Klein has refused to back down , accusing his attackers of using charges of anti-Semitism to silence criticism of neoconservative policies .
“ When [ Commentary writer ] Jennifer Rubin or Abe Foxman calls me anti-Semitic , they ’re wrong , ” he said in an interview .
“ I am anti-neoconservative . ”
In its broad contours , the controversy is a familiar one , as critics accuse neoconservatives of exercising pernicious influence on US Middle East policy and neoconservatives reply with charges of anti-Semitism and conspiracy - mongering .
What distinguishes the recent furor over Klein , however , is that it involves someone who is widely regarded as an exemplar of the centrist political establishment .
Klein is best known for his 1996 novel Primary Colors , a thinly - veiled and largely unflattering portrait of Bill Clinton ’s 1992 presidential campaign that was originally published anonymously and subsequently made into a Hollywood movie .
A frequent critic of Clinton , Klein has at times expressed admiration for George W. Bush .
He also endorsed the invasion of Iraq in 2003 ( although he has since expressed regret for his support ) and describes himself as “ a strong supporter of Israel . ”
The Klein dust - up is the latest in a series of events over the last several years that have placed neoconservatives both in the spotlight and on the defensive .
Neoconservatism , a predominantly — but by no means exclusively — Jewish movement , got its start in the late 1960s and early 1970s , when a small but influential group of Democrats began distancing themselves from the party which , in their view , had become too dovish toward the Soviet Union and too sympathetic toward Arab demands against Israel .
By 1980 , most had become strong supporters of Ronald Reagan .
A number of prominent neoconservatives joined his administration , including many who would later play key roles in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war .
Consigned to the political wilderness under President George H.W. Bush , the neoconservatives became increasingly identified in the 1990s with Israel ’s right - wing Likud Party .
It was also during the same period that they began agitating for “ regime change ” in Iraq , arguing that such a move would transform the balance of power in the Middle East decisively in favor of both Israel and the US .
They experienced a rebirth with the election of Bush ’s son in 2000 , and particularly after the 11 September 2001 attacks , when they played a major role , both inside the administration and in the media , in rallying the public and Congress behind war in Iraq .
But with the deterioration of the situation in Iraq , the influence of neoconservatives inside and outside the administration began to wane , and critics began charging that they had led the US astray .
A series of incidents also focused critical scrutiny on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , the powerful lobbying group whose hawkish right - wing leadership has often defied both the views of the broader US Jewish community and the policies of Israeli governments .
In 2004 , the Justice Department charged Pentagon staffer Lawrence Franklin with passing classified US government documents to two AIPAC lobbyists , who had then given the documents to an Israeli Embassy official .
In January 2006 , Franklin was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison , while the AIPAC staffers are still awaiting trial .
In March 2006 , the well - respected and staunchly realist international relations scholars John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt published the article “ The Israel Lobby ” in the London Review of Books .
That article , which charged that the lobby had for decades skewed US policy towards Israel in a direction detrimental to US interests , became the basis for their 2007 book The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy .
Mearsheimer and Walt ’s thesis was instantly controversial .
Like Klein , they were accused by critics , including the Anti-Defamation League and Commentary , of anti-Semitism and of perpetrating stereotypes about shadowy Jewish conspiracies .
But as a result of their stature , the two authors ’ work clearly created political space for those , both within the foreign policy establishment and within the US Jewish community , who had been long privately critical of the neoconservatives but had been worried about the consequences of going public with their misgivings .
More recently , AIPAC has come under fire for its close alliance with right - wing Christian Zionists , particularly controversial pastor John Hagee and his organization Christians United for Israel ( CUFI ) .
Hagee views an undivided Israel as a precondition for precipitating the Armageddon , and his group has accordingly pushed for hawkish US policies in the Middle East that have been consistent with the neoconservatives ’ own preferences .
Matters came to a head earlier this year , when Republican presidential candidate John McCain was compelled to repudiate Hagee ’s endorsement after comments came to light in which the pastor suggested that the Holocaust was biblically ordained in order to force Jews to resettle in Israel .
Nonetheless , Hagee and CUFI have maintained close ties with the neoconservatives , and a collection of prominent Israel hawks , including Senator Lieberman , spoke at CUFI ’s summit in Washington earlier this month .
The belief that AIPAC has failed to accurately represent the views of the US Jewish community led to the foundation earlier this year of J Street , a Jewish lobbying group that aims to push for a more moderate stance on Middle East issues .
In the wake of these developments , many observers have taken Klein ’s comments — and particularly his refusal to back down in the face of withering criticism from neoconservatives — as a sign that new political space is being created for the public airing of more moderate views on Middle East policy .
M.J. Rosenberg , a former AIPAC staffer now associated with the moderate Israel Policy Forum , expressed the hope that commentators would stop equating neoconservatism with Judaism and start treating it as a political movement subject to political criticism .
“ Although most [ neocons ] are Jews , few Jews are [ neocons ] , ” he wrote Wednesday .
By equating the two groups , “ [ the neocons ] want Americans not to follow the trail of war - mongering that leads not to Jews but to them . ”

This situation is so common that the art of the ‘ backup ’ has spawned an entire industry .
Today there are dozens of firms offering different data backup solutions .
Sadly , I ’m writing this post just a day after I was forced to reinstall Windows and recover my data .
I ca n’t tell you what a nightmare it would have been had I not backed up all my important stuff .
Keeping that in mind , I ’ve decided to mention 4 important data backup strategies for Windows users , most of them being almost the same for Mac users except for the change in the software type .
Check them out and start backing up .
Offline files and folders are things stored on your computer ; you know , the files that are available to you when you ’re no online .
It can include all your pictures , documents , videos and many other files .
To back them up , you should use an external storage device like an external USB hard disk drive .
Such drives are plug and play and very easy to use .
As I have mentioned in a previous post , I use the 500 GB Western Digital MyBook for the purpose .
Apart from this strategy , I highly recommend signing up with an online backup service like Mozy and getting your files backed up with them .
In case your external hard drive gets stolen or damaged , they will send you the DVDs containing your data .
Talking about back up software , there are many .
I have spoken about a free tool called AceBackup for this purpose .
There ’s one more tool which I came across known as IdleBackup .
It ’s an excellent tool which is free and automatically backs up files while you ’re away from your computer .
LifeHacker has a detailed description about the entire process and how it works .
Your browser is your gateway to the internet .
It stores data which includes your bookmarks and passwords and many other customized settings which should be backed up .
If you are using Internet Explorer then you can export your bookmarks and save them to the external drive .
Regarding the passwords , there are some paid tools to export and store IE passwords , although I have n’t tried any of them .
For Firefox users , there is much more data , like the extensions and preferences .
Fortunately , the backup is not that tough .
Check out this post – 3 Useful Methods to Back Up Your Firefox Preferences .
My personal favorite is the FEBE extension which backs up everything with a single click .
I used to restore all my Firefox preferences easily , after reinstalling Windows .
Now emails are something which are as important as any other data and they need to be backed up .
If you are using any web based email account , a separate Gmail account can function as an online email backup center for those accounts .
You can go ahead and set up the Gmail mail fetcher for the purpose .
If you are using desktop email app like Outlook , you can export and backup the emails using the Import and Export Wizard .
You could even export and backup emails from Outlook to Gmail online
We have discussed how to backup your data , however if you do n’t organize and sync the data in your computer and the external storage device then that ’s work half done .
You need to setup tools which would also sync the data between the devices .
IdleBackup , which I ’ve mentioned above does incremental back ups which means it only backs up those files which have changed .
So in a way it takes care of the sync task .
Other good tools which let you sync data between two locations are SyncbackSE and the free tool , Microsoft SyncToy .
SyncbackSE comes with a free trial and is probably the best backup and sync tool available .
It also offers a free version called Syncback Freeware which is a pretty awesome tool too .
Hope you like the data backup strategies mentioned and make use of them to back up your data everyday .

The financial elite will propose a “ new , improved ” version of the bailout bill in the next couple of days .
Here is some advanced ammunition to use against the proposal :
The snake oil salesmen said the bailout was needed to save the economy .
But most experts who have looked at the bailout said it was n’t needed , would n’t have worked , and would actually have made the economic crisis worse
Unless the new bailout proposal will actually help Americans , use the above proven lies by the proponents of the original bailout monster to argue that the liars cannot be believed , and that the fruit of the poisonous tree is itself poisonous .
Sweet & low : Dreamy desserts made with fruit pump up the flavor , not the fat Dreamy desserts made with fruit pump up the flavor , not the fat

" I have never met a low - fat dessert I liked , " exclaimed my size - 2 friend while scarfing down a hot fudge sundae buried under a mound of whipped cream .
" Why in the world would you want to write an article on that ? "
" Not everyone is as lucky as you , " I replied , " and I can make them so good that you would never know the difference . "
She looked at me with utter disbelief .
When I was young , the thought of reducing fat in desserts never entered my mind .
I was born with an insatiable sweet tooth and lived by the adage that a meal is not a meal without dessert - and fruit is not dessert .
I used to tell my cooking classes , " When it comes to dessert , eat half as much ; do n't make them half as good . "
But with aging and all of the known medical risks , all that has changed .
My husband and most of our friends are faced with the same weight and cholesterol issues , so everyone appreciates it when I serve a delicious low - fat dessert .
The one thing that has n't changed , however , is my desire for wonderful desserts that are satisfying and delicious .
My goals are simple :
--
To develop the best desserts using only the finest ingredients , never anything fake or artificial ;
--
To reduce the fat and cholesterol without sacrificing flavor .
Whenever possible I attempt to reduce the sugar , but that is not my paramount goal .
Sugar adds moisture to a recipe and butter adds tenderness and there is no standard formula for reducing them .
Cutting back sugar and fat in a crisp topping is very different from reducing them in a pie crust .
Choose ripe fruit
It 's easy to create delicious low - fat desserts when you begin with the bountiful array of fresh fruit available in the Bay Area .
Marisa Churchill , consulting executive pastry chef at the newly opened Pampas , a Brazilian steakhouse in Palo Alto , suggests asking the produce vendor to recommend the freshest local fruit in season and tasting it before buying .
It 's imperative that you use only the ripest , juiciest fruit when making desserts , especially low - fat ones .
My ice cream machine runs nonstop throughout the summer because for me , sorbets are the quintessential fat - free summer dessert .
All you need to make them is ripe , or even overripe fruit , sugar and water or juice .
Poaching and roasting are two other ways of preparing fruit desserts without fat .
Peaches , apricots , plums and chunks of cantaloupe or honeydew are all delicious simmered in a syrup made with sugar , water , wine or juice .
David Lebovitz , author of " Ripe for Dessert " ( Harper Collins , 2003 ) suggests substituting honey for the sugar to add greater depth of flavor .
Other noteworthy additions are fresh herbs , such as mint , thyme , or basil ; lemon , lime or orange zest ; flavorings , such as vanilla , cinnamon , cloves , cardamom or fresh ginger .
Simple roasting rules
Roasting fruit is similar to roasting vegetables .
Baking the fruit in a hot oven intensifies its flavor .
The best summer fruit for roasting are peaches , nectarines , apricots and plums .
I like to cut them in half , remove the pits , and drizzle the cut side with a little honey or brown sugar .
If you cut the fruit in half , it should only need to bake for 20 to 30 minutes at 425 degrees .
Meringue desserts are a low - fat dessert lover 's dream , because egg whites are fat - free .
By adding sugar to the whites you can make hard , crisp meringue shells that are delicious filled with a variety of fresh fruit and berries .
But I 'm partial to soft meringue desserts , like Forgotten Meringue Torte .
The outer edges become very crisp while the inside melts in your mouth .
Few desserts show off summer 's bounty like fresh fruit pies and shortcakes .
( See recipe for Chocolate Berry Shortcakes at sfgate.com / food . )
The challenge , of course , lies in reducing the fat in the crust and the biscuits .
A traditional pie crust contains half the amount of fat to flour , and often even more .
By browning the butter , a technique that evaporates the water and intensifies the flavor , you can reduce the amount of butter and still get great taste .
To help keep the pie crust tender , I substitute pastry flour for part of the all - purpose flour .
It may not be traditional , but it works .
When you have fabulous fresh fruit , the crust or biscuit becomes far less important .
Rethinking whipped cream
Many years ago , I began substituting low - fat sour cream for half the whipping cream when making whipped toppings for desserts .
I was looking for something that tasted like creme fraiche , French fermented cream .
My guests liked it so much they often asked me what brand of cream I was using .
You can whip it up a day ahead and it will remain soft and fluffy , perfect for dolloping on pies , crisps and shortcakes .
( See " Whipped Sweet & Sour Cream " recipe at sfgate.com / food . )
I have n't had a chance to try these desserts on my friend , but I am pretty confident that when she tastes them , she will change her mind .
I did bring several to a large gathering recently and they were impressed .
I hope you will be , too .
Sorbet made simple
For the softest and creamiest texture , use 1/2 cup of sugar to every 1 to 1 1/2 cups of pureed fruit .
If you reduce the sugar too much , the sorbet will become icy .
A little lemon or lime juice , spices such as vanilla or cinnamon , and a tablespoon of alcohol , such as vodka or a complementary fruit liqueur , are often welcome additions .
Many chefs recommend cooking the sugar and water to make a simple syrup and then refrigerating it until it cools .
I have found this step to be unnecessary and time consuming , unless you want to add fresh herbs or spices that need to steep in the hot syrup .
Otherwise , substitute superfine sugar for regular granulated sugar and add it and the water directly to the fruit .

Lighter dessert tips -- Substitute thick Greek yogurt for part of the sour cream .
--
Substitute half low - fat sour cream for whipped cream when making a topping for shortcakes , pies , crisps and cobblers . --
To reduce saturated fat , substitute canola oil for part of the butter . --
To reduce butter in pie crusts and biscuits , heat half the amount of butter called for in the recipe until golden brown .
If the recipe calls for it chilled , pour it into a bowl and freeze or refrigerate . --
When reducing fat in a pie crust ( using brown butter , per above ) , roll it out between sheets of plastic wrap instead of with flour .
-- Substitute unsweetened cocoa for chocolate .
It is significantly lower in fat .
You can generally replace 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate with 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa plus 1 tablespoon of butter . --
To enhance chocolate flavor , add coffee , a chocolate or coffee liqueur or chocolate extract . --
To obtain a nutty flavor using a small amount of nuts , toast them and add a small amount of nut oil .
--
For a fat - free boost of flavor , add a small amount of spirits or liqueurs to custards , mousses , ice cream and sorbet .

Nectarine & Boysenberry Pie with Brown Butter Crust Serves 8
You need to make and freeze the brown butter at least 45 minutes ahead , so be sure to plan accordingly .
The nectarines and half of the berries in the filling are not cooked , so it is important that they are ripe and sweet .
Because the pie crust has such a small amount of fat , it is best to roll it out on plastic wrap .
The pie crust :
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/4 cups all - purpose flour
1/2 cup cake flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
5 to 6 tablespoons ice water
The filling :
7 ripe nectarines
3 cups boysenberries
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon cornstarch Instructions :
To make brown butter , melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat , swirling pan as needed .
Cook until it turns deep golden brown and has a nutty aroma .
Watch carefully ; it goes from brown to burnt black in seconds .
Immediately pour into a small bowl that can be put in the freezer .
Freeze until solid .
When ready to use , go around edge with the tip of a sharp knife and remove to a cutting board .
Cut into small pieces .
For the pie crust :
Put both flours , sugar and salt into food processor ; process 30 seconds .
Add brown butter and oil and process until crumbly .
Add 5 tablespoons ice water all at once and mix until dough begins to hold together .
If necessary , add remaining 1 tablespoon water .
Place oven rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375° .
To roll the pastry , lay 2 sheets of plastic wrap overlapping lengthwise on work surface .
Turn pastry onto center of wrap and press into a flattened disk .
Cover with 2 more sheets of plastic wrap .
Roll the dough into a 14 - inch circle .
Remove the top sheets of wrap and invert the dough into an ovenproof glass 9 1/2 - or 10 - inch pie dish .

Forgotten Meringue Torte Serves 8 - 10
Many years ago , a friend 's mother gave me this unique recipe .
She said that it had been in her Austrian family for decades .
A springform pan is filled with meringue and put into a 450° oven .
The oven is immediately turned off and the dessert is left in it for 12 to 24 hours , during which time it can be forgotten .
Just remember to take it out before you turn on the oven again .
If you are worried about food safety , use pasteurized egg whites .
They will take a little longer to whip than specified .
You can make the Triple Berry Sauce ahead of time , and freeze .
7 egg whites ( 1 cup ) , at room temperature
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar

It 's rather humorous to read and hear the outrage by pundits and politicos against the assassination comments by Hillary Clinton .
Keith Olbermann seems to be leading the way in this effort .
He calls Clinton to task for invoking ' the nightmare of political assassination ' and rails about the ' inappropriateness ' of using such a word .
After listing past politicians killed or injured while in office or while campaigning , he sums ups his outrage with this :
' This is unforgivable because this nation 's deepest shame , its most enduring horror , its most terrifying legacy , is political assassination .
The politics of this nation is steeped enough in blood , Mrs. Clinton .
You cannot and must not invoke that imagery - anywhere , at any time . '
Why should anyone be shocked ' anywhere at any time ' at the mention of violence in politics ?
Summed up , the election game is merely a battle among gangsters to decide who controls the power of the most vicious , amoral institution created by man -- the state !
This superficially ' peaceful ' political battle successfully masks the underlying method used to enforce state policy -- violence !
Once elected , the new or returning powers that be will use whatever force necessary ( including imprisonment , kidnapping , torture , and outright killing ) to enforce its decree .
This violence will be easily perceived by anyone not blinded by unwavering nationalism .
This violence will be easily detected and clearly understood as such by anyone whose mind is not clouded by beguiling words spewed by political spin artists and media apologists .
No one will have to invoke any ' imagery ' to expose it .
Apparently , in a ' democracy , ' violence is only allowed ( or even to be mentioned , as Olbermann whines ) once ' the people ' ( at least a majority of voting , consenting slaves ) officially grant the use of violence .
Can you think of a more perverted concept to define a social institution ?
Is it not comical to witness the moral outrage claimed by statists against political violence while they dutifully accept and rabidly defend the institutional violence generated by the establishment they serve ?
Recently I watched the movie ' The Trials of Henry Kissinger . '
I highly recommend you see it .
Near the end of the movie , Kissinger is shown making this statement :
' The average person thinks that morality can be applied as directly to the conduct of states to each other as it can to human relations .
That is not always the case because sometimes statesmen have to choose among evils . '
Has there ever been a more succinct explanation as to why the state is not an institution conducive to the success of a civilized world ?
And this comes from one of history 's leading proponents and initiators of state - sponsored violence .
Does this quote not expose an inherent moral weakness in an institution that must use violence to reach its objectives , rather than peaceful persuasion of individuals ?
Persuasion is hailed by nearly everyone as the only proper method to initiate change amongst individuals , while the use of violence as a means to ends is properly condemned .
This moral imperative seems sadly absent when questions of state accountability arise .
This nation 's ' deepest shame ' and ' most enduring horror ' is not that a few politicians have suffered the risk that comes with holding or seeking power over others .
Rather , it is the acceptance , as common wisdom , that the winner of an election is bestowed the power of life and death over any individual -- at any time and in any manifestation they deem necessary .
This nation 's ' most terrifying legacy ' is not political assassination but the collective acceptance that marks on a ballot give legitimacy and justification to decades of war , economic impoverishment , false imprisonment , theft of property and even political assassination ( as long as it's conducted against other countries , of course ) .
Outrage rings hollow when expressed by hypocrites .
Outrage is nonsensical when declared by the deluded .
Prosecutors say friend of ‘ Big Oil ’ was on the take – and lied about it
[ social_buttons ]
Long time Republican Senator Ted Stevens , perhaps best known today for his advocacy of federal funding for the “ bridge to nowhere ” and his reference to the internet as a “ series of tubes , ” has been indicted by a federal grand jury on corruption charges .
Stevens faces seven counts of making false statements involving an investigation about VECO , the oil services company in Alaska , and renovations done on his home .
From May 1999 to August 2007 , prosecutors said Stevens concealed “ his continuing receipt of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of things of value from a private corporation . ”
The indictment released Tuesday said the items included : home improvements to his vacation home in Alaska , including a new first floor , garage , wraparound deck , plumbing , electrical wiring ; as well as car exchanges , a Viking gas grill , furniture and tools , the Associated Press reports .
VECO was once the dominant force in Alaska oil services industry .
Its founder , Allen , and vice president , Rick Smith , have pleaded guilty to bribing state lawmakers to push legislation to help the company .
While it is unclear what , if any , direct relationship there may have been between VECO and the push to drill in ANWR , the implications do not bode well for the Republican , who was thought to be a shoe - in when he faced re-election this November .
Not exactly a friend of the environment
Earlier this month Stevens had the dishonorable distinction of being named to the League of Conservation Voters ’ “ Dirty Dozen , ” an annual compilation of current and former members of Congress who consistently vote against the environment .
Stevens has been one of the biggest global warming deniers delayers in congress over the last several decades .
Last September , he told the people of Shishmaref , a village that has lost hundreds of feet of coastline to rising sea levels , not to worry , because “ We ’re at the end of a long , long term of warming .
700 to 900 years of increased temperature , a very slow increase .
We think we ’re close to the end of that . ”
“ For forty years in the Senate , Ted Stevens has stood in the way of progress .
Today , he literally lives in the house that oil built , ” League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski said .
“ With his scandalous ties to the oil industry finally exposed , Alaska has the chance to let Mr. Stevens retire to that nice house . ”
The indictment stops short of charging Stevens with bribery or other traditional corruption crimes .
Had prosecutors been able to prove any special treatment for VECO , much stronger charges would have been filed .
Stevens has maintained he did n’t do anything for VECO that he did n’t do for any other constituent or pro-Alaska interest .

' Safe haven ' Coventry BS pulls in £ 2.7bn
Almost a year after the collapse of Northern Rock , Britain 's fourth - biggest building society , the Coventry , provided more evidence that consumers are flooding back to what they see as the safer havens of mutuals rather than the risk of smaller banks .
Coventry , which has recently come up with some of the widest ranges of mortgage and savings offers in the market , said it had attracted £ 2.7bn of extra savings in the year since the end of June 2007 .
- How to evaluate the strength of your building society
That is a staggering 32 % increase in its retail savings balance reflecting consumers ' flight to safety .
At the same time , it has taken advantage of its weaker banking rivals , who have effectively shut their door to much new mortgage business .
In the last six months , the Coventry 's mortgage and loan book rose £ 862 m or 7 % and its market share of net lending rose by 24 % to three times its usual market share .
Chief executive David Stewart said that this represented a quarter of all new home loans that were made by building societies in the first half of 2008 .
He added : ' The overwhelming majority of our lending continues to be in low - risk sectors .
The average loan to value of our new lending was 57 % , and we expect this figure to fall further in the second half . '

The deals between ISPs and anti-piracy organizations are a worrying trend .
In just a few months entertainment industry representatives managed to convince ISPs and governments that they should have the right to accuse and warn Internet subscribers , without solid proof .
The question that remains unanswered is whether these warnings will have any effect .
The power of the entertainment industry and anti-piracy lobbyists is growing rapidly .
In the UK , six major ISPs have teamed up with the music industry to start mass warning filesharers .
France has gone even further , recently adopting a law that will enable the entertainment industry to disconnect alleged pirates on their third warning .
Similar methods are proposed throughout the rest of the world .
It ’s quite scary if you think about it .
In France the right to access the Internet now rests on the shoddy evidence of anti-piracy units , evidence that is known to be inaccurate .
Christine Albanel , the French Minister for Culture recently quoted research that allegedly found that 97 % of all file - sharers will stop downloading copyrighted content when they receive a warning , but this seems to be very unlikely .
Unfortunately , the minister failed to name the resource for the study , but it does raise some interesting questions .
All these new agreements and policies have strong faith in the deterrent function of these so called warnings , but thus far there is no evidence that these actually have any effect .
That ’s right , millions of people are now receiving warnings ( sometimes even threats ) , and they may very well lead to nothing .
You would think that the government would at least get some solid proof of the deterrent effect of these letters but , perhaps even more importantly , check the validity of the anti-piracy evidence before they allow the entertainment industry to start contacting millions of citizens with intimidating letters .
It might turn out that thousands of users receive a letter for something they did n’t do , and that would n’t be the first time that had happened .
On the other hand , even those who are correctly accused might not change their behavior so easily .
Warning letters will most likely make most pirates more cautious , and they will find ways to get what they want more anonymously .
Whatever happens , it wont stop the most of them from getting what they want .
As Justin Milne of Telstra BigPond , Australia ’s largest Internet provider put it : “ There ’s no one thing that you can do that is going to fix the problem ( but ) when people think about this area , they often look to ISPs to provide the silver bullet . ”
So how can “ pirates ” be stopped then ?
This is not an easy question to answer .
Right now , 50 % of all BitTorrent traffic is generated by people who download TV - episodes , something that ’s available for free in most countries , but not available on demand .
It might be a good start for the entertainment industry to rethink their outdated business models , experiment and use peer - to - peer technology to fulfill the ever growing demand for media online .
The goal of software development teams should never be “ Being Agile . ”
The goal should be to deliver software to help the organization further its goals .
That ’s why so many Agile adoption efforts fail — because there is / was a belief that once you are Agile everything will be great !
The truth is , once you ’ve found the development practices — regardless of Agile — to help you meet your organization ’s goals in a better way , everything will be great .
There ’s quite a bit of risk management inherently built into agile principles and practices , but there does n’t seem to be any explicit risk management discipline .
How do we integrate risk management within the iterative cycles of agile development ?
Make it visible .
Put it on the wall for all to see .
For the team , project manager , product owner , etc to see every day in the daily stand - up meeting .
Make it collaborative .
Allow anyone to add a new risk or add comments on an existing risk any time they want .
Make it visual .
Chart out the risk on a graph and rate the risk 1 - 9 .
Make it clear and not cluttered on a white board .
Scorecard – as well as asking what went well , what did n’t go so well , what would we do differently in the next iteration – Facilitate the team ’s thought process to actively identify risks .
Add them to the risk log on the wall .
Include it in the product backlog ( ‘ feature ’ list ) .
If it ’s appropriate to do something to mitigate a risk and reduce its likelihood , or to prepare contingency for the risk , add the actions to the Product Backlog for the project and prioritize them along with the features .
Review it daily .
In the daily stand - up meetings – as well as asking what have you done since the last meeting , what will you do before the next meeting , and if there anything holding up your progress – also ask each team member if there ’s anything that could prevent them from meeting their goals .
This will encourage a little proactive thought , not just reactive when progress is blocked .
In other words , on major projects particularly , make risk management part of your everyday business .

We all complain about the high price of oil : businessmen worry about the rising cost of petroleum - based raw materials , and politicians fret about the geo-political situations in oil rich countries and the rest of us pay through the nose whenever we fill up at the pump ( yes , it has come down a bit , but only after such a huge run-up ) .
But what do we really know about oil ?
Do you know where petroleum came from ?
( hint : not dinosaurs ) .
Or that during the early days of Standard Oil , gasoline was so useless that it was dumped in rivers ?
Did you know how much it actually costs the Saudis to produce a barrel of crude oil ?
( This explains why they 're SO rich ) .
Here are the 10 Facts You Didn't Know About Oil :
1. Petroleum = Rock Oil
The word petroleum comes from the Greek word " petros " and the Latin word " oleum " meaning " rock " and " oil " .
Before " petroleum " was coined by German mineralogist Georg Bauer in 1556 , people simply called it " rock oil . "
Indeed , the Chinese , who had drilled the world 's first oil well in 347 AD ( a 800 feet or 240 m deep pit using bits attached to bamboo poles ) , called it - and still calls it - shi you , which literally means rock oil .
2. " Fossil Fuel " Came From Dinosaurs , Right ?
Photo : Osborn , H.F. ( 1913 )
It 's common knowledge that oil came from decomposing dead dinosaurs and plant matters ( after all , it is called " fossil fuel , " right ? ) - but that 's actually wrong .
Though most scientists believed that oil has a biological origin , they do n't believe that oil came from dinosaurs .
They thought that oil was derived from single - celled planktons that flourished , died and then decomposed hundreds of millions of years ago .
Some scientists ( mostly Russian and Ukrainian geologists ) believe that oil was n't produced from any living thing at all .
This abiogenic petroleum origin hypothesis claims that oil was formed from deep carbon deposits dating from as early as the formation of Earth .
If that sounds kooky to you , just know this : one of the proponents of this theory was Dmitri Mendeleev ( yes , the guy who invented the periodic table of elements ) .
( If you 're interested , Cecil Adams talked about this at The Straight Dope )
3. Ancient Uses of Petroleum
Greek Fire , from the Skylitzes manuscript
Humans have been using petroleum products for a long time .
Asphalt was used in ancient Babylon as mortar for buildings and for waterproofing ships .
Tar was first used in 8th century Baghdad to pave roads .
Crude forms of kerosene was used to light lamps .
During the reign of the Byzantine Empire , greek fire - an incendiary weapon which exact formula was long lost to history but thought to contain various petroleum products - was a formidable weapon because pouring water on it only intensified its flame .
4. Love the Whales ?
Thank Petroleum !
In the 19th century , high demand for whale oil for industrial uses fueled the whaling industry .
Indeed , whale oil was widely used for lamp illuminants ( whale oil burned slowly without any odor ) , candle wax , and clock lubricants .
Whale oil was used as a glaze for early photographs , and it was an essential ingredient for pharmaceuticals , soap , varnish and cosmetics ( whale oil imparts a " rich glossy sheen " ) .
Thanks to petroleum distillation , however , the demand for whale oil dropped significantly until there 's no longer any economic reason to go whaling .
Indeed , commercial whaling was completely banned in 1986 .
One final note : there is one thing that we still use whale oil for and that 's space exploration .
NASA found out that sperm whale oil does not freeze even in very cold temperatures ( like in outer space ) , thus making it an ideal lubricant for space probes .
5 . When Gasoline was so Cheap it was Worthless
Standard Oil refinery in 1910 .
Photo : Richmond Public Library
During the early days of Standard Oil ( this was before cars became popular ) , kerosene was the name of the game .
Gasoline , a by - product of petroleum distillation to produce kerosene , did n't have much demand .
It was a cheap product used to treat lice and a solvent to remove grease stains from clothing ...
In fact , gas was so cheap that oil companies used to dump it in rivers !
6. Zone Pricing : How Gas Gets Priced at the Pump
Ever wonder why the same gas costs differently across town , even if it costs the same to make and transport ?
You can blame zone pricing :
On a recent Wednesday , 72 - year - old veterinarian Charles Hendricks filled up his Mercury Grand Marquis at a Chevron in west Anaheim .
On the other end of town , 22 - year - old sandwich store manager Ryan Ketchum gassed up his Nissan Sentra at a Chevron in Anaheim Hills .
Both men bought regular gasoline .
Both pumped the gas themselves .
But there was one important difference : Hendricks paid $ 2.399 a gallon , whereas Ketchum paid $ 2.539 — 14 cents more a gallon for the same Chevron gas . [...]
The primary culprit is zone pricing , a secret and pervasive oil company strategy to boost profits by charging dealers different amounts for fuel based on traffic volume , station amenities , nearby household incomes , the strength of competitors and other factors .

Wait , should n't that be illegal ?
Not according to both the Federal Trade Commission and the courts :
It 's a controversial strategy , but the courts have thus far deemed it legal , and the Federal Trade Commission recently said the effect on consumers was ambiguous because some customers got hurt by higher prices while others benefited from lower ones .

7. Oil Shocks of the 1970s

It 's easy to think that today 's sky high oil prices is a new problem , but the fact is , it actually has happened before .
Twice .
In 1973 , spurred by the Yom Kippur ( or Ramadan ) War , the Arab members of the OPEC announced that they would cut oil production and not ship oil to United States , Europe , and Japan for supporting Israel .
In essence , they were using oil as a weapon to punish the West .
The effect was immediate : oil quadrupled in price ( to $ 12 / barrel - how quaint that seems now ! ) and gasoline price jumped more than 40 % .
The U.S. government moved to control the price of gas and lines of cars waiting to buy gasoline became a familiar sight .
In many places in the country , gas was rationed :
... officials in Massachusetts , Maryland , New Jersey , Washington , B.C. , Bade County , Fla. , and other areas last week adopted Oregon - type rationing schemes that will allow motorists with even - numbered license plates to buy gas on even - numbered dates , and those with odd - numbered plates to buy on odd - numbered dates ( Source )
To help reduce consumption , the national maximum speed limit of 55 mph was imposed in 1974 , and the US started to stockpile crude oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 .
Calls for conservation went hand in hand with greater interests in renewable energy , specifically wind and solar power .
In 1979 , the second oil crisis happened when Ayatollah Khomeini took control of Iran after the Iranian Revolution , forcing the Shah of Iran to flee the country .
For the second time in six years , the price of crude oil spiked and gas lines formed at the pump .
The 1970s oil crises were followed by the 1980s oil glut , which drove down the price of gas ( though not to the level before the crises ) ... and - surprise !
- caused everyone to forget what it felt like to pay exorbitant gas prices until the next crisis .
8 . The Reason the Saudis are so Rich
Extracting oil from the ground is complicated - but it's also a well established science .
Have you asked yourself how much exactly does it costs Saudi Aramco , the state - owned national oil company of Saudi Arabia and the world 's largest oil producer , to produce a barrel of crude oil ?
Forbes magazine has the answer :
Aramco can quench its gargantuan thirst for development :
It 's easily the most profitable company on the planet .
While results are closely held , Aramco stands to net , after amortization of capital costs , roughly $ 200 billion a year on revenue in excess of $ 350 billion .
Last year oil minister Ali Al - Naimi told reporters that the average barrel of Saudi oil costs just $ 2 to produce .
It sells for $ 130 .

9. Rising Oil Price Ultimately Leads to Rising Goods Price
So what if oil price skyrockets if you can just walk or bicycle to work ?
Well , it turns out that out of 20 million barrels of oil United States imports every day , only 45 % is used for gasoline fuel .
Though the large majority of the rest are used as fuel of some sort ( like heating fuel ) , a portion of the petroleum is used for raw materials found in practically all consumer products sold today :
No business in America produces more of the oil - based ingredients that go into the nation ’s products than the Dow Chemical Company , based in Midland , Mich .
From
Dow ’s petrochemical operations come the basic ingredients of a wide variety of plastic bottles and packaging , including numerous containers once made of glass or tin .
Indeed , paint , computer and television screens , mobile phones , light bulbs , cushions , paper , mattresses , car seats , carpets , steering wheels and polyesters are all made with ingredients that Dow and other chemical companies refine from oil and natural gas .
Dow normally raises prices piecemeal .
Last month , though , the surge in the cost of oil and natural gas , the company ’s principal raw materials , produced a rare across - the - board price increase of as much as 20 percent .
( Source )
So far , worried by the weak economy , many businesses have not passed along the rising cost of raw material to consumers .
A growing number of economists , however , think that it 's just a matter of time before they have to .
And it 's not just the price of hard goods .
According to the Buzzwatch blog at the Wall Street Journal , many other things are blamed on high oil prices :
- Some schools may cut back on field trips
- Pizza delivery charges are rising .
- Kangaroo harvesters are seeking alternative careers .
( Really )
- Gas theft is on the rise in California ’s San Joaquin Valley .
10 . Have We Reached Peak Oil ?
This graph shows that oil productions have peaked in non-OPEC , non-former Soviet Union countries .
Domestic oil production in the United States peaked in the 1970s .
( Image from Wikipedia )
" Peak oil " is a concept created by geoscientist M. King Hubbert in 1956 to predict when U.S. oil production would peak .
Scientists and oilmen are concerned about the amount of oil produced over time and the amount of oil still in the ground that can potentially be extracted in the future .
Why ?
Because the cost of production would begin to go up as oil becomes scarcer ( at the same time , the world 's population would continue to grow thus requiring even more oil ) .
Economists say that oil demand is inelastic - this means that a small drop in production can cause price to skyrocket .
Indeed , in the 1970s oil shock , a production drop of 25 % caused oil price to jump 400 % .
So clearly peak oil spells trouble for the world 's economy .
So , have we reached peak oil ?
Some people argue that we have and certainly the rising oil prices lend support to this argument ( note that the decline in the value of the dollar also contributed to high oil prices ) , whereas others argued that we 're about a decade away from reaching this point .
It 's prudent to note that other researchers predicted that we would reach peak oil in the 1990s , and that obviously did n't happen .
But one thing is for sure : if the 1970s oil crises were any indications , high gas prices are here to stay .
Can a lobster ever truly have any emotions ?
What about a beetle ?
Or a sophisticated computer ?
The only way to resolve these questions conclusively would be to engage in serious scientific inquiry — but even before studying the scientific literature , many people have pretty clear intuitions about what the answers are going to be .
A person might just look at a computer and feel certain that it could n’t possibly be feeling pleasure , pain or anything at all .
That ’s why we do n’t mind throwing a broken computer in the trash .
Likewise , most people do n’t worry too much about a lobster feeling angst about its impending doom when they put one into a pot of boiling water .
In the jargon of philosophy , these intuitions we have about whether a creature or thing is capable of feelings or subjective experiences — such as the experience of seeing red or tasting a peach — are called “ intuitions about phenomenal consciousness . ”
The study of consciousness ( see here and here ) has long played a crucial role in the discipline of philosophy , where facts about such intuitions form the basis for some complex and influential philosophical arguments .
But , traditionally , the study of these intuitions has employed a somewhat peculiar method .
Philosophers did not actually go ask people what intuitions they had .
Instead , each philosopher would simply think the matter over for him - or herself and then write something like : “ In a case such as this , it would surely be intuitive to say … ”
The new field of experimental philosophy introduces a novel twist on this traditional approach .
Experimental philosophers continue the search to understand people ’s ordinary intuitions , but they do so using the methods of contemporary cognitive science ( see also here and here ) — experimental studies , statistical analyses , cognitive models , and so forth .
Just in the past year or so , a number of researchers have been applying this new approach to the study of intuitions about consciousness .
By studying how people think about three different types of abstract entities — a corporation , a robot and a God — we can better understand how people think about the mind .
The Mental Bottom Line on Corporations
In one recent study , experimental philosophers Jesse Prinz of the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and I looked at intuitions about the application of psychological concepts to organizations composed of whole groups of people .
To take one example , consider Microsoft Corporation .
One might say that Microsoft “ intends to adopt a new sales strategy ” or that it “ believes Google is one of its main competitors . ”
In sentences such as these , people seem to be taking certain psychological concepts and applying them to a whole corporation .
But which psychological concepts are people willing to use in this way ?
The study revealed an interesting asymmetry .
Subjects were happy to apply concepts that did not attribute any feeling or experience .
For example , they indicated that it would be acceptable to use sentences such as :
• Acme Corporation believes that its profit margin will soon increase .
• Acme Corporation intends to release a new product this January .
• Acme Corporation wants to change its corporate image .
But they balked at all of the sentences that attributed feelings or subjective experiences to corporations :
• Acme Corporation is now experiencing great joy .
• Acme Corporation is getting depressed .
• Acme Corporation is experiencing a sudden urge to pursue Internet advertising .
These results seem to indicate that people are willing to apply some psychological concepts to corporations but that they are not willing to suppose that corporations might be capable of phenomenal consciousness .
Bots and Bodies
Perhaps the issue here is that people only attribute phenomenal consciousness to creatures that have the right sort of bodies .
To test this hypothesis , we can look to other kinds of entities that might have mental states but do not have bodies that look anything like the bodies that human beings have .
One promising approach here would be to look at people ’s intuitions about the mental states of robots .
Robots look very different from human beings from a physical perspective , but we can easily imagine a robot that acts very much like a human being .
Experimental studies could then determine what sorts of mental states people were willing to attribute to a robot under these conditions .
This approach was taken up in experimental work by Justin Sytsma , a graduate student , and experimental philosopher Edouard Machery at the University of Pittsburgh and in work by Larry ( Bryce ) Huebner , a graduate student at UNC - Chapel Hill , and all of the experiments arrived at the same basic answer .
In one of Huebner ’s studies , for example , subjects were told about a robot who acted exactly like a human being and asked what mental states that robot might be capable of having .
Strikingly , the study revealed exactly the same asymmetry we saw above in the case of corporations .
Subjects were willing to say :
• It believes that triangles have three sides .
But they were not willing to say :
• It feels happy when it gets what it wants .
Here again , we see a willingness to ascribe certain kinds of mental states , but not to ascribe states that require phenomenal consciousness .
Interestingly enough , this tendency does not seem to be due entirely to the fact that a CPU , instead of an ordinary human brain , controls the robot .
Even controlling in the experiment for whether the creature had a CPU or a brain , subjects were more likely to ascribe phenomenal consciousness when the creature had a body that made it look like a human being .
God in the Machine
What if something has no body ?
How does that change our conceptions of what conscious experience might be possible ?
We can turn to the ultimate disembodied creature : God .
A recent study by Harvard University psychologists Heather Gray , Kurt Gray and Daniel Wegner looked at people ’s intuitions about which kinds of mental states God could have .
By now , you have probably guessed the result .
People were content to say that God could have psychological properties such as :
• Thought
• Memory
• Planning
But they did not think God could have states that involved feelings or experiences , such as :
• Pleasure
• Pain
• Fear
In subsequent work , the researchers directly compared attributions of mental states to God with attributions of mental states to Google Corporation .
These two entities — different though they are in so many respects — elicited exactly the same pattern of responses .
Looking at the results from these various studies , it is hard to avoid having the sense that one should be able to construct a single unified theory that explains the whole pattern of people ’s intuitions .
Such a theory would describe the underlying cognitive processes that lead people to think that certain entities are capable of a wide range of psychological states but are not capable of truly feeling or experiencing anything .
Unfortunately , no such theory has been proposed thus far .
Further theoretical work here is badly needed .

Chimps do it .
Gorillas do it .
Michael Phelps does it too .
The exuberant dance of victory -- arms thrust toward the sky and chest puffed out at a defeated opponent -- turns out to be an instinctive trait of all primates -- humans included , according to research released Monday .
Scientists from the University of British Columbia and San Francisco State University looked at thousands of photographs of judo matches taken during the 2004 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games in Athens , for such classic in - your - face victory moves as clenched fists , thrown - back heads and outstretched arms .
The images of the 140 blind and sighted athletes from 37 countries revealed that Paralympic athletes blind from birth struck the same triumphant stance as sighted Olympic athletes .
Since the blind athletes could not have learned the victory dance by watching others , the scientists concluded that the behavior was innate .

They found that the dance was the same for all , regardless of what culture or country they came from .
This display of human pride and exuberance -- witnessed by millions when swimmer Phelps and teammates won the men ’s 400 - meter freestyle relay for the U.S. on Sunday -- closely resembles the dominance displays of chimps and monkeys , which also feature outstretched arms and exaggerated postures , researchers said .
The animal world is filled with inflated displays of superiority , noted Daniel M.T. Fessler , a UCLA anthropologist not involved in the research .
Birds puff themselves up and cats arch their backs to make themselves look bigger and scarier to adversaries , he said .
Advertisement
Jessica L. Tracy , a psychologist at the University of British Columbia and lead author of the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , said that the hangdog look of losers also turns out to be instinctive .
Blind athletes across all cultures slumped their shoulders and narrowed their chests , a posture that signals shame in humans and submission in other primates .
Sighted athletes from most parts of the world did the same .
But the researchers unexpectedly found that sighted athletes from individualistic societies , such as in the U.S. and Western Europe , tended to put on a brave front , outwardly appearing to stand tall in the face of defeat and shame , the report said .
Tracy speculated that the athletes were intentionally hiding their feelings -- consciously overriding their innate urge to signal defeat -- because losing is so stigmatized in their cultures .

“ We have been taught that even if we screw up in life , to hide it , ” she said .
It ’s just like politics in the West , she added .
“ It ’s not OK to say , ‘ Hey , I was wrong . ’ ”

In the Red state of Montana , that is .
But red for how much longer ?
Barack Obama spent his Fourth of July at a parade in Butte , Montana , making good on his promise to take Montana seriously in the run-up to the November election .
This is Obama ’s fourth trip to Montana since April and last month he hired a full - time director for his state campaign .
The Obama campaign has already begun running informative TV ads to introduce Obama to the people of Montana and the voters are paying attention .
But can Barack turn this red state blue ?
Montana has consistently gone to the Republican Party in presidential elections :
Only two Democratic presidential candidates have won the state since 1948 .
The most recent was Bill Clinton in 1992 , who won thanks to third - party candidate Ross Perot ’s garnering 26 % of the vote to the disadvantage of George H. W. Bush and the Republicans .
But Obama believes he can win Montana ’s three electoral votes in November and the latest polling numbers support his prediction .
Just days before Obama arrived in Montana this week , Rasmussen Reports released the results of a telephone survey that shows Obama leading McCain by five points .
The report predicts Republicans still have a 62 % chance of winning Montana in November , but the state has been shifted from “ likely Republican ” to “ leans Republican ” in the Rasmussen Reports Balance of Power .
This leftward shift has been evident in Montana as Democrats have gained ground in recent years .
In 2006 , Democrat John Tester defeated Republican incumbent Conrad Burns for a U.S. Senate seat , ending a longtime Republican stronghold .
Then in 2004 , Democrat Brian Schweitzer capitalized on Montanan ’s distaste for corrupt Washington politics in his bid for Governor , and his victory has been succeeded by overwhelming public approval ratings .
The Obama campaign is hoping that its own message of change will appeal to the voters who sought the same by electing both Tester and Schweitzer .
The Rassmussen Report telephone survey responses support the theory that Montanans desire better representation in the federal government : 66 % of Montanans say that the federal government has itself become a special interest group that looks out primarily for its own interest .
Only 19 % of Montanans believe that the government today represents the will of the American people .
For years , Republicans have been able to take Montana for granted – and John McCain appears to be doing the same .
McCain has yet to visit Montana this election year and he has not set up any state offices or employed any paid staff in Montana .
More bad news for McCain from the Rassmussen Report : 50 % of Montanans surveyed believe it ’s more important to get the troops out of Iraq than it is to win the war .
Only 44 % hold the view that victory is more important .
But even with poll numbers in Obama ’s favor and many Montanans seeking the change that his campaign promises , it is questionable whether the three out of the total 538 electoral votes justify the time and money Obama is committing to his Montana campaign .
Some speculate Obama ’s presence in Montana is primarily intended to force McCain to spend campaign funds on a state that McCain wrongly assumed he had in the bag .
By opting out of public financing , Obama can afford to keep a presence in Montana , while John McCain desperately needs to use his funds to fight for states with more electoral votes .
Another interesting response in the polling : 50 % of Democratic Montanans want Hillary on the ticket with Obama in November .
Perhaps that played a role in Obama ’s decision to spend his 4th of July holiday in Butte , rather than in Missoula or Bozeman where he enjoys significantly more popularity .
Butte is the only urban county that Obama lost to Clinton in the June primary , and it is home to a heavily - unionized , white , working class population , a demographic that better connected with Hillary Clinton throughout the primary season .
Obama made a brief speech ( which you can see in this post at TSR , scroll down to the 2nd video ) during his holiday in Butte , decrying the nation ’s reliance on foreign oil and criticizing our country ’s energy policies .
He also lamented the status of our healthcare system and touted his message of change .
One topic he did not address : guns .
Obama ’s stance on gun ownership – that guns are subject to “ reasonable and commonsense regulation ” - is viewed with skepticism by some Montanans and could spell trouble for Obama in November .
So despite the good news he received from this Rasmussen poll it would be a staggering upset if Obama were to win Montana in November .
But if Obama is able to connect with and win over traditionally Republican states like Montana , he could not only win the Presidency , but his coattails could possibly win him a large enough margin to have a large legislative mandate .
Then Obama could put into effect the changes for which he has campaigned and fulfill his promise to unite a divided country .

A measure to place a constitutional ban on gay marriage on the fall ballot was narrowly voted down in the state Senate on Wednesday , but the referendum could still come back for a revote in the final days of the legislative session .
The failure of the measure was largely blamed on the absence of Sen. Karen Johnson , R - Mesa , who missed a planned vote a week ago and is on vacation this week .
Johnson said in a memo to her Republican colleagues that she would try to return Friday to vote on the measure .
Republican lawmakers and conservative groups were already launching efforts to pressure her to make sure she returns , but it 's not certain whether the measure will be reconsidered on Friday .
The vote Tuesday , which would have sent the measure to the ballot if it had been successful , was part of a several months - long odyssey to get a constitutional amendment on the fall ballot defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman .
The measure seemed like a sure thing when it was introduced in February , but it struggled to get out of the House after several false starts and it languished for many months without being put to a vote in the Senate .
On the floor Tuesday , supporters said voters should have the right to decide whether to ban gay marriage in the constitution and cited the recent court decision in California legalizing gay marriage there as a reason to move forward .
" We are going to have homosexual couples from Arizona go to California to get married and come back to Arizona and challenge our state law , " said Sen.
Ron Gould , R - Lake Havasu City .
Opponents argued the measure is unnecessary and called it a waste of time as the Legislature struggles to finalize a budget for the fiscal year that begins next week .
Gay marriage is illegal under state law , and state courts have upheld that law .
Democratic Sen. Paula
Aboud said she does n't believe this is the kind of bill that constituents in Arizona want lawmakers working on .
" They want us to work on things that impact life in the state , " Aboud said .
In 2006 , Arizona voters became the first in the nation to defeat a ballot initiative banning gay marriage .
It also would have barred governments from offering benefits to domestic partners of employees , gay or straight .
Extrawheel has been producing single wheel bicycle trailers since 2006 .
As the only one in the world , we offer trailers on a large wheel .
And it is also a spare wheel for a bicycle .
Extrawheel bicycle trailers fit almost any bicycle , because we have a patented secial Fastening Fork ( drawbar ) that connects bicycle and trailer .
trailers can be attached to both a recreational city and road bike , but also a trekking , gravel or a mtb b-k .
They will also fit carbon bikes , tandem or other unusual models , e.g. recumbent ones .
Since the standard wheel in the trailer is perfect for off - road and gravel road .
It is worth combining Extrawheel trailers with mountain and enduro bike .
Interestingly .
Our trailers are also great for the recently fashionable fatbikes and e-bikes .
The 100 - Year Gap in Understanding
William Tucker , author of the forthcoming book Terrestrial Energy , blogged here earlier this week about nuclear power .
This is his last of three guest posts here on the subject .
When I was in college I took a course on the great political philosophers .
Soon I had them all lined up with their respective eras : Hobbes and the 18th - century monarchies , Locke and the American Revolution , Kant and 19th - century nation - states .
Then I chanced to see a timeline of their births and deaths .
To my amazement , each had lived 100 years before I had placed him .
The lesson seemed plain .
It takes about 100 years for ideas to enter history .
It has been the same with nuclear power .
The potential of nuclear energy was first formulated in 1905 in Einstein ‘s famous equation , E=mc2 .
Most people know it by now .
Mariah Carey even named her latest album after it .
But its true significance has not yet been recognized .
E=mc2 says that energy is created out of matter .
Chemical energy comes from the transformation of very small amounts of matter in the electron shells , which contain one eighteen - hundredth of the mass of an atom .
But most of the atom ’s mass is in the nucleus and the energy stored there is two million times greater .
To most people , this has meant “ big , big bombs . ”
But the more important implication is “ small , small environmental impact . ”
A 1,000 - megawatt coal plant is fed by a 110 - car coal train arriving every day .
A nuclear reactor is replenished by a single tractor - trailer bringing new fuel rods once every 18 months .
Over the course of a year , the coal plant will release 400,000 tons of sulfur and fly ash .
Some of this ends up in landfills , but most escapes into the atmosphere where it kills 30,000 people annually , according to the E.P.A .
Then there ’s the carbon dioxide — seven millions tons annually from each plant — which is the principle cause of global warming .
By comparison , the “ wastes ” of nuclear power can once again be contained in a single truck .
I recently watched one of these spent fuel assemblies being lifted into the receiving room at France ’s nuclear reprocessing center in La Hague .
It is an eerie sight — the most radioactive object in the solar system emitting double what you would have received standing at ground zero in Hiroshima .
Yet a three - foot wall separated us , and the emissions did n’t even register on our badges .
More than 95 percent of the spent fuel rod can be recycled .
That is why France is able to store all its “ waste ” ( from 30 years of producing 75 percent of its electricity ) beneath the floor of a single room .
It all seems too good to be true .
People conjure up all kinds of nightmare scenarios just to compensate .
Yet the reality remains : nuclear energy is the most environmentally benign discovery ever made .

This is my OLD blog .
I 've copied this post over to my NEW blog at :
http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/07/django-blog-project8-adding-basic/
You should be redirected in 2 seconds .
This post describes how I added basic commenting functionality using Django 's Free Comments .
Note , this built - in functionality does not support comment moderation ( used to counteract spam ) or other nice features .
I tried to use David Bennett 's comment_utils , but I could n't get it to work .
So for now , I 'm just going to use Django Free Comments and hopefully add in moderation and other features later .
I basically followed the instructions on the wiki : Using Django 's Free Comments .
See there for more information .
It was pretty easy to set up .
In my settings.py file , I added django.contrib.comments to the list of installed apps .
~/src/django/myblogsite/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = ( ' django.contrib.auth ' , ' django.contrib.contenttypes ' , ' django.contrib.sessions ' , ' django.contrib.sites ' , ' django.contrib.admin' , ' django.contrib.comments ' , ' iwiwdsmi.myblogapp ' , )
Excerpt from
I modified my urls .py to use the comment module 's URLConf .
~/src/django/myblogsite/urls.py
from django.conf.urls.defaults import * from django.contrib.comments.models import FreeComment from iwiwdsmi.myblogapp.views import * from iwiwdsmi.feeds import * feeds = { ' latest ' : LatestPosts , } urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ( r'^site_media / ( ?
P< path >.* ) $ ' , ' django.views.static.serve ' , {' document_root ' : '/home/sofeng/src/django/myblogsite/media'} ) , ( r' ^admin / ' , include ( 'django.contrib.admin.urls ' ) ) , ( r'^feeds / ( ?
P<url >.*) /$ ' , ' django.contrib.syndication.views.feed ' , {' feed_dict ' : feeds} ) , ( r' ^comments / ' , include ( 'django.contrib.comments.urls.comments ' ) ) , ( r ' ^myview1 / $ ' , myview1 ) , ( r ' ^blog / $ ' , frontpage ) , ( r ' ^blog /( \d{4} ) / ( \d{ 2} ) / ( [ \w \ - ] + ) /$ ' , singlepost ) , ( r ' ^blog / ( \d{4} ) / $ ' , yearview ) , ( r '^blog /( \d{4} ) / ( \d{ 2} ) / $ ' , monthview ) , ( r ' ^blog/tag / ( [ \w\ - ] + ) /$ ' , tagview ) , )
To install the comments model , I ran python manage .
py syncdb :
$ cd ~/src/django / myblogsite $ python manage .py syncdb
Then I modified my list page template to display the number of comments for each post :
~/src/django/myblogsite/templates/listpage.html
{ % extends " base.html " %} { % load comments %} { % block title %} {{ main_title }} { % if subtitle % } :{ % endif %} {{ subtitle }} { % endblock %} { % block header1 %} { % if subtitle %} < a href= " / blog / " >{{ main_title }}</a> { % else %} {{ main_title }} { % endif %} { % endblock %} { % block header2 %} {{ subtitle }} { % endblock %} { % block main %} { % for post in post_list %} < h3 > < a href= " / blog/{{ post.date_created|date : " Y / m " }}/{{ post.slug }} / " > {{ post . title }}</a> </h3 > {{ post.body }} < hr > < div class= " post_footer " > { % ifnotequal post.date_modified.date post.date_created.date %} Last modified : { { post.date_modified.date }}< br > { % endifnotequal %} Date created : { { post.date_created.date }}< br>
Tags : { % for tag in post.get_tag_list %} < a href= " / blog / tag /{{ tag }} / " >{{ tag }}</a>{ % if not forloop .
last %} , { % endif %} { % endfor %} < br > { % get_free_comment_count for myblogapp.post post.id as comment_count %} < a href= " {{ post.get_absolute_url }} " >{{ comment_count }} Comment{{ comment_count|pluralize}}</a> </div > < br > { % endfor %} { % endblock %}
Oh , I forgot to mention , I implemented a get_absolute_url method in my Post model .
This is the preferred way to specify the url to the detail view of my Post object .
The code for the method is shown below :
~/src/django/myblogsite/myblogapp/models.py
import re from django.db import models class Post ( models .
Model ) : title = models .
CharField( maxlength=200 ) slug = models .
SlugField( maxlength=100 ) date_created = models.DateTimeField( ) # auto_now_add=True ) date_modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True ) tags = models .
CharField ( maxlength=200 ) body = models .
Text Field ( ) def get_tag_list ( self ) : return re.split ( " " , self.tags ) def get_absolute_url ( self ) : return " / blog/%d/%02d/%s/ " % ( self.date_created.year , self.date_created.month , self.slug ) def __str__( self ) : return self .
title class Meta : ordering = [ " - date_created " ] class Admin : pass
Then I modified my single post , or detail page , template :
~/src/django/myblogsite/templates/singlepost.html
{ % extends " base.html " %} { % load comments %} { % block title %} {{ main_title }} : {{ post .
title }} { % endblock %} { % block header1 %} < a href= " / blog / " >{{ main_title }}</a> { % endblock %} { % block main %} < h3 > {{ post .

Tags : { % for tag in post.get_tag_list %} < a href= " / blog / tag /{{ tag }} / " >{{ tag }}</a>{ % if not forloop .

Ich habe ja schon drauf gewartet .
Nachdem sich fast alle Politiker in den letzten Tagen für stärkeren Datenschutz ausgesprochen haben und lediglich Wolfgang Schäuble und ein paar andere eher defensiv behaupteten , beim Staat wären die Daten ja sicher ( China - Trojaner oder Großbritannien , anyone ? ) , kam heute Abend der Gegenangriff der Überwachungsfreunde in der ARD .
Genau die selbe Redaktion hatte vor ein paar Monaten übrigens die Datenlecks bei den Meldebehörden aufgedeckt .
Die können und wissen das also eigentlich besser , was darauf hindeutet , dass dieser Beitrag eine politisch - strategische Entscheidung war .
Es ging um die anstehende Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichtes zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung , wozu die Bundesregierung in Kürze ihre Stellungnahme abliefern muss .
Die zentrale Message war jetzt : „ Datenschutz ist Täterschutz “ .
Leider war der Beitrag so tendenziös gemacht , dass sich eine ernsthafte Auseinandersetzung kaum lohnt .
Daher hier nur drei Punkte , die ich dort auch schon ins Forum geschrieben habe , die aber noch der Moderation harren .
Der Bericht enthält eine Reihe von falschen Informationen :
1 ) Vergewaltigung ist auch nach der Eilentscheidung des BVerfG noch ein Straftatbestand , der eine Nutzung von Vorratsdaten erlaubt .
In dem im Beitrag genannten Fall ist der Zusammenhang offenbar ohnehin nur „ wenn das Handy nicht geklaut worden wäre , hätte man den Täter nicht fassen können “ .
Und ?
Wenn man bei einer Straftat keine Telekommunikation nutzt , greift diese natürlich nicht .
2 ) Die U - Bahn - Schläger aus München im Dezember 2007 sind nicht wegen der Vorratsdatenspeicherung gefasst worden .
Diese trat nämlich erst im Januar 2008 in Kraft .
3 ) Die Verfassungsklage gegen die Vorratsdatenspeicherung ist nicht „ nur “ „ von einer Bürgerinitiative “ eingereicht worden , sondern von mehr als 34.000 Bundesbürgern .
Sie ist damit die größte Verfassungsbeschwerde der BRD .
Fazit : Schlecht recherchierte , plumpe Meinungsmache .
Schade .
Interessant und investigativ herausfordernder wäre es zum Beispiel , mal zu recherchieren , wie diese Daten , die immerhin auch bei privaten Firmen lagern , vor Missbrauch und Weiterverkauf geschützt werden können , bzw .
ob das überhaupt möglich ist .
Update : Zwei Tage nach der Sendung sind endlich bei report München die ersten Forenbeiträge freigeschaltet .
Mein eigener , der direkt nach der Ausstrahlung dort eingestellt wurde , findet sich leider nicht darunter .
Statt dessen gibt es bisher nur zustimmende Meinungen bzw .

New Carbon Material May Allow for Storage of Large Amounts of Renewable Energy
September 17th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
One of the biggest roadblocks to a future of renewable energy production is the ability to store such generated electricity .
The current networks of power supply and storage simply have no chance of being able to provide necessary storage capacities for renewable sources such as solar and wind , given the propensity for spikes in generated electricity .
However engineers and scientists at The University of Texas at Austin have made a breakthrough in the development of a new carbon - based material that they believe might allow for at least a doubling of current electricity storage capabilities .
The new structure is called grapheme , and measures in at one atom thick .
“ Through such a device , electrical charge can be rapidly stored on the graphene sheets , and released from them as well for the delivery of electrical current and , thus , electrical power , ” says Rod Ruoff , a mechanical engineering professor and a physical chemist .
“ There are reasons to think that the ability to store electrical charge can be about double that of current commercially used materials .
We are working to see if that prediction will be borne out in the laboratory . ”
One of the benefits of this breakthrough is the possible boost it could give to ultracapacitors .
Batteries have long been the primary source of electrical storage , with ultracapacitors making a late arrival into the game , yet staying below the radar .
But given that they last longer , have a high power capacity , and require lower maintenance , they are the preferred option and are slowly being commercialized .
“ Our interest derives from the exceptional properties of these atom - thick and electrically conductive graphene sheets , because in principle all of the surface of this new carbon material can be in contact with the electrolyte , ” says Ruoff , who holds the Cockrell Family Regents Chair in Engineering # 7 .
“ Graphene ’s surface area of 2630 m2 / gram ( almost the area of a football field in about 1/500th of a pound of material ) means that a greater number of positive or negative ions in the electrolyte can form a layer on the graphene sheets resulting in exceptional levels of stored charge . ”
The use of graphene in ultracapacitors could significantly improve the efficiency and performance of electric and hybrid vehicles , as well as more obsequious items such as cell phones .
But the real gold mine will be in whether graphene will provide a means to increase reliability on wind and solar farms for electrical generation .

US Airline Industry Set To Shrink
Former American Airlines CEO
Bob Crandall tells Businessweek some changes that would help the struggling airline industry .
-- Revising U.S. bankruptcy laws to ... ... deprive failed carriers of the right to use lower costs to undercut the fares offered by their more prudent rivals , forcing both management and labor to face the twin specters of liquidation and unemployment .
In other words , take away the option of Chapter 11 and force troubled carriers into Chapter 7  the mere threat of which could force labor groups to offer concessions more readily , rather than being content to milk the cow until it keels over and only then consent to a lower wage scale .
You know this will be popular with workers -- Creating regulations that limit the number of scheduled flights to what the airport can handle .
This is already a problem at airports like JFK in New York , which routinely slot far more flights than was ever intended  explaining why your 5 pm flight never leaves before 7 pm .
Crandall argues that current schedules should be reduced proportionally ,  which would force each carrier to use the largest feasible aircraft in each slot .
So bye - bye regional jets and bye - bye competition .
The problem with takeoff and landing slots could be solved by selling them to the highest bidder .
But the airlines have opposed this introduction of market forces for years .
Business jet operators have opposed it even more because they want to land at places like JFK at peak times but would get outbid by jumbo jets .
As for bye - bye competition : if the slots were sold in a bidding process that would increase competition since airlines would compete to use each slot for the most profitable purpose .
That would increase efficiency , reduce delays , and also reduce fuel usage as airplanes would n't circle waiting to land or idle waiting to take off .
The ability to periodically bid for slots would allow new entrants to displace existing entrants .
Regardless of what the airlines do we are going to see less air travel in the United States and other Western countries as limited oil supplies and the bidding up of prices on those oil supplies by Asian countries drives ticket prices so high that passenger volume and number of flights will drop .
American and American Eagle are ending service to 8 airports .
American ( NYSE : AMR ) , based in Fort Worth , Texas , and American Eagle serve 250 airports combined .
The airports American will leave are : Oakland , Calif. ; London Stansted ; and Barranquilla , Colombia ; and Albany , N.Y. ; Providence , R.I. ; Harrisburg , Pa. ; Samana , Dominican Republic ; and San Luis Obispo , Calif. , for American Eagle , which also will close its maintenance base in San Luis Obispo .
The US airline industry is going to shrink back to where it was 10 years ago .
Then it will shrink even further .
This week , the countrys two biggest airlines , American and United , announced plans to lop cities like Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , and San Luis Obispo , Calif . , out of their networks .
Cuts also are taking place on international routes to cities like London and Buenos Aires , and even to popular vacation destinations in the United States like Las Vegas , Honolulu and Orlando .
With more reductions coming next year , all the domestic industrys growth over the last decade will most likely be lost .
 The U.S. industry is undertaking a historic restructuring ,  Gary Chase , an industry analyst with Lehman Brothers , wrote in a research report Friday .
Some of the major airlines are headed for bankruptcy and liquidation .
In the hopes of bringing attention to the magnitude of the oil crises , Business Travel Coalition ( BTC ) commissioned AirlineForecasts , LLC to provide an analysis of what oil at several different price points means in terms of lost airline jobs , reduced seat capacity and increased fare levels .
AirlineForecasts concludes that if oil prices stay anywhere near $ 130 / barrel , all major legacy airlines will be in default on various debt covenants by the end of 2008 or early 2009 .
The implication is that several large and small airlines will ultimately end up in bankruptcy , and of those , some will be forced to liquidate .
Each of the airlines is trying to survive until their competitors liquidate .
With the resulting reduction in total capacity the survivors can raise fares to levels high enough to pay for higher fuel costs .
So which ones will go into liquidation ?
Some of the liquidations have to involve big airlines because the amount of needed capacity reduction is quite large .
At current oil prices about 1000 airplanes will need to get parked by US airlines .
Every $ 10 increase in the price of oil results in $ 4 billion in additional costs for the 40 passenger - only airlines .
Oil prices have spiked to $ 135 / barrel from last year 's $ 72 / barrel average .
With oil prices in the $ 135 range , the airline industry could be forced to park upwards of 1,000 aircraft and shed over 80,000 employees , and still not return to health .
1000 idled airplanes equal about one year of the combined output of Boeing and Airbus .
Airbus has a backlog of 3,655 planes , or more than six years of work .
It delivered a record 453 aircraft last year and is planning to hand over about 470 this year .
EADS Chief Executive Officer Louis Gallois said on June 18 there were no plans to slow the production increase .
Boeing , which had a backlog of 3,645 orders as of May , is in ``constant contact ' ' with customers and regards deferrals and cancellations as ``a normal part of its business , '' spokeswoman Sherry Nebel said last night by telephone .
It plans to deliver 480 planes this year , up from 441 in 2007 .
The older and less fuel efficient airplanes will get parked first .
You might expect Boeing to benefit from this because of their new and highly fuel efficient 787 Dreamliner .
But Boeing needs to delay 787 shipments yet again for some redesign work .
Georgia said yesterday that it would appeal to the international community this week to pressure Russia to end its " occupation " , adding that Russian troops were now digging in across the country in violation of the ceasefire deal .
Russian soldiers established about 25 checkpoints over the weekend , including some outside the original conflict zone and in areas adjacent to the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , Georgian officials said .
Russia said its troops were no longer an occupying force but merely performing peacekeeping operations .
It added that it could keep soldiers on Georgian territory under an agreement following civil wars in both breakaway republics in the early 90s .
Georgia said the troops ' presence on its territory was illegal .
" Russia has no right to establish checkpoints in Georgia .
The ceasefire agreement is the only agreement that is still alive .
All others are broken , " interior ministry spokesman Shota Utiashviavi told the Guardian .
He added : " Georgia considers this as a continuation of occupation .
They have just changed their helmets .
Georgia will continue to observe the ceasefire and launch international diplomatic initiatives to force Russia to keep its word . "
French president Nicolas Sarkozy signalled continuing European dismay at the situation by announcing a special meeting devoted to Georgia for next Monday at which the EU will consider future relations with Moscow .
Also yesterday , firefighters tried to extinguish a blaze on a railway line near Gori - caused when a train carrying crude oil from Kazakhstan rolled over a mine .
Twelve tanker cars slithered off the line .
Georgian officials said the attack was the latest attempt by Russia to destroy its infrastructure and to stop the transit through Georgia of oil from Azerbaijan and other Caspian Sea nations .
A large artillery shell had been wedged under the tracks and hidden by stones , Georgian investigators said .
Under the ceasefire deal brokered by Sarkozy , Russia is obliged to withdraw its forces to their pre-August 7 positions - before Georgia launched its brief , disastrous incursion into rebel - held South Ossetia .
On Saturday , however , the deputy chief of Russia 's army , Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , said this would n't happen .
Instead , he unveiled a comprehensive network of new checkpoints leaving Russia in control of Georgia 's strategic road links and the Black Sea port of Poti .
Under Russia's " peacekeeping plan " , soldiers would establish checkpoints outside the conflict zone , he admitted .
These included two outside Poti , several others next to the main east - west highway linking Tbilisi to the Black Sea , and one at Shavshebi , 25 miles west of the capital .
On Saturday , about 1,000 Georgians marched on the checkpoint four miles from Poti .
They waved Georgian flags and threw leaflets at the Russian soldiers with the slogan " No to Russian chauvinism and Russian fascism " .
In neighbouring Batumi , the US naval warship McFaul delivered humanitarian aid supplies yesterday in the latest sign of Washington 's support for its beleaguered ally .
Moscow has criticised the growing number of US and other Nato ships in the Black Sea , saying they do not " contribute " to solving the conflict .

Fusion centers are a creature of the Department of Defense and DARPA , an outgrowth of the supposedly discredited and " defunded " Total Information Awareness program
In order to sell us on surrendering our rights , the government told us they would establish “ fusion centers ” around the country to collect intelligence on al - Qaeda and assorted other amorphous bad guys , an explanation that made sense to a lot of people after September 11 , 2001 .
For some reason , though , the government did not get around to telling us that these so - called “ fusion centers ” are a creature of the Department of Defense and DARPA , an outgrowth of the supposedly discredited and “ defunded ” Total Information Awareness program , the brainchild of convicted Iran - Contra felon John Poindexter .
Back in 2002 , writing for the New York Times , William Safire said Poindexter was “ determined to break down the wall between commercial snooping and secret government intrusion .
The disgraced admiral dismisses such necessary differentiation as bureaucratic ‘ stovepiping . ’
And he has been given a $ 200 million budget to create computer dossiers on 300 million Americans . ”
In other words , the TIA program would create computer dossiers on virtually every American — not just blue eyed , blond haired al - Qaeda Americans , mind you , but everybody without exception .
Due to a spate of bad publicity , the House and Senate moved to cut funding for the program by adding provisions to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act , 2004 .
Two years later , in early 2006 , Shane Harris , writing for the National Journal , revealed that TIA “ was stopped in name only . ”
It lives on behind the veil of the classified intelligence budget and “ names of key projects were changed , apparently to conceal their identities , but their funding remained intact , often under the same contracts . ”
Two of the most important components of the TIA program were moved to the Advanced Research and Development Activity , housed at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade , Md. , documents and sources confirm .
One piece was the Information Awareness Prototype System , the core architecture that tied together numerous information extraction , analysis , and dissemination tools developed under TIA .
The prototype system included privacy - protection technologies that may have been discontinued or scaled back following the move to ARDA .
In other words , after a meddling and mostly clueless Congress stuck its nose in TIA , the program went undercover and now poses even more of a threat to the liberty of average Americans , not just al - Qaeda dimwits and patsies .
TIA and the fusion center concept was just too good for the spooks to let go .
An idea “ that grabs so much government power at the expense of its citizens ’ privacy always has a phoenix - like ability to resurrect itself , and so the fusion center initiative has been reborn under the Department of Homeland Security ’s ‘ Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative ’ and been provided with $ 380 million in funding for 40 installations throughout the country , ” writes the Ohm Project .
“ These fusion centers are usually located deep in the bowels of some state law enforcement agency …
All forty coordinate and share data with each other , but no single agency , Congressional or otherwise , has oversight authority over them . ”
However , the sales pitch is ongoing , never mind the lack of “ oversight authority ” or the Orwellian aspects of the government shuffling through credit , medical , and sundry other records of over 300 million Americans .
As KLAS in Las Vegas reported earlier this week , while supposedly preventing terrorism “ is the main mission of Metro ’s Fusion Center , ” it is also “ proving successful in solving local crimes , ” much to the approval of Nevada Congress critter Harry Reid .
Las Vegas is not alone in this move away from investigating terrorism and concentrating of crime — Boston , Chicago , and other large cities are selling their fusion centers in the same way .
In fact , Chicago ’s fusion center dispenses entirely with the idea of terrorism — its fusion center is called the Crime Prevention Information Center .
The Kentucky Intelligence Fusion Center promotes its operations as follows :
The principle role of the Intelligence Fusion Center is to compile , blend , analyze and disseminate criminal intelligence and other information ( including , but not limited to , threat assessment , public safety , law enforcement , public health , social service and public works ) and to support efforts to anticipate , identify , prevent and monitor criminal activity .
The ultimate goal is to provide a mechanism where law enforcement , public safety and the private sector can come together with a common purpose to improve the ability to safeguard our homeland and prevent criminal activity .
Not specifically prevent al - Qaeda terrorism , mind you , but “ prevent criminal activity . ”
In order to do this , you have to surrender any last shred of privacy , any quaint idea that you are protected by an increasingly moribund Constitution and Bill of Rights .
“ Fusion center technologies of all kinds vacuum up information from the real and digital worlds day and night , ” explains the Government Security website .
“ In addition to microphones placed in crime - ridden hot spots , real world citizens send information to fusion centers by calling telephone tip lines or sending e-mail .
Video cameras installed by local law enforcement , state departments of transportation and corporate security departments often provide visual data to fusion centers through memoranda of understanding ( MOUs ) and sometimes by request during emergencies . ”
In order to fight crime , fusion centers bring together the FBI , DHS , FEMA , CIA , and state and local law enforcement , all of them using a networked system developed by DARPA and the Pentagon .
“ Intelligence centers run by states across the country have access to personal information about millions of Americans , including unlisted cellphone numbers , insurance claims , driver ’s license photographs and credit reports , ” the Washington Post reported in April .
“ The centers use law enforcement analysts and sophisticated computer systems to compile , or fuse , disparate tips and clues and pass along the refined information to other agencies .
They are expected to play important roles in national information - sharing networks that link local , state and federal authorities and enable them to automatically sift their storehouses of records for patterns and clues … .
The list of information resources was part of a survey conducted last year , officials familiar with the effort said .
It shows that , like most police agencies , the fusion centers have subscriptions to private information - broker services that keep records about Americans ’ locations , financial holdings , associates , relatives , firearms licenses and the like . ”
Additional records at the disposal of widely dispersed fusion centers include “ wage and property records , corporate charters , utility records and a host of government files , including criminal justice information and traffic tickets . ”
According to the government , all of this data is required to protect you from al - Qaeda … er , excuse me , protect you from pot dealers , shoplifters , prostitutes , drunk drivers and the like .
More than half of all federal and state inmates were convicted on drug and “ public - order ” offenses in 2006 .
Naturally , they are a national security risk .
“ The still rising prison population comes after a decade of declines in violent and property crime .
According to the FBI ’s annual Uniform Crime Reports , violent crime declined 2.2 % last year and has dropped a whopping 32 % since 1995 .
Property crime rates have also declined , although not so dramatically , dropping 23 % since 1985 , ” reports the Drug Reform Coordination Network .
“ Violent and property crime is down , but discretionary drug arrests continue to go through the roof . ”
The bastard son of TIA , growing like a cancer in the bowels of the NSA , and the proliferation of fusion centers employing this technology have nothing to do with crime , even nonviolent and victimless crime — it has to do with implementing a total surveillance panopticon , a high - tech control grid .
The FBI is not particularly interested in drug crimes , or violent crime for that matter , but as numerous news stories reveal they are interested in infiltrating and disrupting political activist groups .
Under the guise of fighting crime — and more and more , domestic crime is considered terrorism — the government has provided an excuse to roll out its intrusive technologies , cooked up by DARPA and the Pentagon , not so much to surveil Joe and Jane Taxpayer , but rather the troublemakers among us .
And the troublemakers , of course , are those opposed to endless war and the imposition of a fascist corporate state .
Joe and Jane are not a problem — that is so long as they pay their taxes , follow myriad state and federal laws , get their vaccinations , drink their fluoride , eat their GMO , and donate their kids to various perpetual war for perpetual military - industrial complex profit scams .

I think I ’ve figured out why many people who question the government ’s explanation for the anthrax attacks do n’t question the official story about 9/11 .
Specifically :
• 9/11 involved much greater loss of life .
While 5 people died in the anthrax attacks , close to 3,000 died on 9/11 • None of us have seen gruesome images of the victims of the anthax attacks .
But we all watched horrific images of 9/11 : planes slamming into buildings , people jumping out of the Twin Towers , the Towers collapsing . . . • 9/11 was the first attack on the U.S. by " foreign terrorists " .
As such , it was the point at which America took the fork in the road away from traditional notions of liberty , justice and the Geneva Convention and towards the " war on terror "
9/11 and the anthrax attacks – and the government ’s " investigation " into both – were actually very similar in many ways ( as I will show in a later essay ) .
Many people can see how ridiculous the government ’s case against Dr. Bruce Ivins as the " sole culprit " is .
With 5 dead and no gruesome images , and occuring after the " war on terror " was already underway , the anthrax attacks are something that people can think about rationally .
But many people are so traumatized by the thousands of deaths , the overwhelming and horrible images , and the unique status of 9/11 as the day when " we were attacked and everything changed " , that they are still in shock and still trying to suppress the fear and pain .
They simply will not allow themselves to honestly and fully investigate 9/11 , but are still reacting out of primal emotions .

You check in at the airline ticket counter .
But instead of a boarding pass , you get shackled with an electronic bracelet which tracks your every move , contains all your personal information , and can shock you senseless .
This vision of the future of air security is being floated around the Department of Homeland Security ’s research and development office .
According to a video promoting the so - called EMD Safety Bracelet , all airline passengers would be required to wear it “ until they disembark the flight at their destination . ”
The device , in addition to storing all of your sensitive personal information and tracking you with GPS , would allow someone to activate it remotely and immobilize the wearer for several minutes .
This is EMD , or electro - muscular disruption .
And the Department of Homeland Security is interested in buying them .
According to a letter from Paul S. Ruwaldt of the DHS Science and Technology Directorate , the department is interested in using them to control illegal immigrants as well as “ prisoner transportation , detainee control and . . . to improve air security , on passenger planes . ”
Would every paying airline passenger flying on a commercial airplane be mandated to wear one of these devices ?
I cringe at the thought .
Not only could it be used as a physical restraining device , but also as a method of interrogation , according to the same aforementioned letter from Mr. Ruwaldt .
Would you let them put one of those on your wrist ?
Would you allow the airline employees , which would be mandated by the government , to place such a bracelet on any member of your family ?
Why are tax dollars being spent on something like this ?
Is this a police state or is it America ? — Washington Times
While you ’re celebrating your paid day off work today , government officials are hard at work looking for new and innovative ways to take away your freedom .
You thought they were protecting your freedom ?
Here ’s what will happen if these things ever get used on airplanes .
First , a lot of people will simply refuse to fly .
Who can blame them ?
A lot more will refuse to fly when the first reports of how these things get used surface .
One “ unruly ” passenger starts making noise on the plane and the crew , who have this nice shock collar device , are n’t going to spend a few minutes looking up which of the 87 passengers he is , especially if they “ feel threatened . ”
They ’re just going to shock everyone on the plane .
Including you and your kids .
But , you asked for security and gave up your freedom for it , and now you ’re going to get it .

Update : DHS spokesman John Verrico denies that these bracelets will be used for air passengers .
See his full statement below .
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF Brooke Bennett on June 25 seemed exactly the sort of case that the Amber Alert system was created for .
The 12 - year - old went missing from a convenience store in Randolph , Vt. , and the next day state police issued an Amber Alert , Vermont 's first .
Local police and sheriffs ' departments were put on notice .
Television and radio cut into programming with emergency broadcast bulletins saying a young girl had vanished .
News shows were told to ask viewers to call in with any sightings .
Residents who had signed up for wireless Amber Alerts received warnings on their cellphones .
And anyone playing the Vermont state lottery found , in the middle of the ticket , a reminder that a brown - haired , blue - eyed girl named Brooke was missing .
Since its birth 12 years ago after a fatal kidnapping in Texas , Amber Alert has quickly become one of the best - known tools in the national law enforcement arsenal .
The warnings are familiar to anyone who watches cable TV news , especially during the summer , when the drumbeat of abduction stories seems to increase .
Last year , 227 alerts were issued nationwide , each galvanizing interest in the local community and flooding police with tips .
While the particulars of the state systems differ , the goal is the same : to disperse news of a kidnapping as widely and quickly as possible , in the hope that someone will spot the kidnapper before a child is harmed .
The program 's champions say that its successes have been dramatic .
According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , more than 400 children have been saved by Amber Alerts .
Of the 17 children Massachusetts has issued alerts on since it created its system in 2003 , all have been safely returned .
These are encouraging statistics - but also deeply misleading , according to some of the only outside scholars to examine the system in depth .
In the first independent study of whether Amber Alerts work , a team led by University of Nevada criminologist Timothy Griffin looked at hundreds of abduction cases between 2003 and 2006 and found that Amber Alerts - for all their urgency and drama - actually accomplish little .
In most cases where they were issued , Griffin found , Amber Alerts played no role in the eventual return of abducted children .
Their successes were generally in child custody fights that did n't pose a risk to the child .
And in those rare instances where kidnappers did intend to rape or kill the child , Amber Alerts usually failed to save lives .
In the case of Brooke Bennett , police quickly began to suspect an uncle with a history of sex crimes , and a week after she disappeared , investigators found her body in a shallow grave a mile from her uncle 's house .
" Amber Alert is a victim of its own fantastically good intentions , " says Griffin .
" If someone gets ahold of a kid and has sufficiently nasty intentions , in the long run there 's not much we can do . "
Defenders of the program reject Griffin 's argument .
Some dismiss it as needless hair - splitting , while others question his data .
And , considering the grim stakes , most see little point in criticizing a tool that saves any lives at all .
" If an Amber Alert saves any child , do n't you think it was worth it ? " says Terrel Harris , a spokesman for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security .
What Amber Alerts do create , its critics say , is a climate of fear around a tragic but extremely rare event , pumping up public anxiety .
Griffin calls it " crime control theater , " and his critique of Amber Alerts fits into a larger complaint on the part of some criminologists about crime - fighting measures - often passed in the wake of horrific , highly publicized crimes - that originate from strong emotions rather than research into what actually works .
Whether it 's child sex - offender registries or " three strikes " criminal - sentencing rules , these policies , critics warn , can prove ineffective , sometimes costly , and even counterproductive , since they heighten public fears and distract from threats that are at once more common and more tractable .
" The problem with these politically expedient solutions is that they look good but do very little to solve the problem , " says Jack Levin , a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern .

The " Amber " in Amber Alert is an acronym - it stands for America 's Missing : Broadcast Emergency Response .
It is also the name of Amber Hagerman , a 9 - year - old girl abducted and murdered in 1996 near her grandparents ' house in Arlington , Texas .
In the ensuing public outpouring of grief and frustration , a caller to a local radio station suggested that broadcasting information about the kidnapping over the radio might have saved Amber 's life - thanks to a witness , the police knew what sort of car the kidnapper was driving .
The next year , radio stations and police departments in that part of Texas put in place a program to do just that .
The idea quickly spread to other states , and in 2003 President Bush signed the PROTECT Act , directing all states to develop programs of their own , and providing funding and oversight through the Justice Department .
Amber Alerts have had some dramatic successes .
One of the best - known is the kidnapping at gunpoint of two teenagers , Tamara Brooks and Jacqueline Marris , from a lovers lane near Los Angeles in 2002 .
Thanks to an Amber Alert that went out a few hours later , several motorists and a highway worker called in sightings of the kidnapper 's stolen Ford Bronco .
Sheriff 's deputies used the tips to track down the kidnapper , fatally shooting him when he refused to surrender , and rescued the girls unharmed .
According to Griffin , however , such successes are exceedingly rare .
Part of the problem is the nature of the crimes :
In cases in which an abducted child is murdered , the killing usually happens within the first three hours , and few of the Amber Alerts Griffin looked at were issued that quickly .
It takes time to notice a child is missing , and police then have to confirm that the report is not a hoax or a mistake .
Griffin considers his findings " preliminary " : he and his team examined only a portion of the Amber Alerts issued over the three - year period they focused on , and did not have access to the full police reports on each case .
But the overwhelming weight of the data , he argues , is unequivocal .
One of the main arguments for the effectiveness of Amber Alerts is that , in the vast majority of kidnappings in which Amber Alerts are issued , the children are returned safely .
But most of those kids , says Griffin , would have been rescued whether an alert had been issued or not .
Around 63 percent of Amber Alert issuances they looked at had " no direct effect on recovery , " Griffin and his coauthors wrote in a paper last year in the Criminal Justice Policy Review .
Instead , kidnappings were resolved in many cases by traditional police all - points bulletins and investigations - or because kidnappers simply changed their minds .
That still leaves a third of cases in which Griffin and his team found that Amber Alerts played a role , either because they brought in tips or because the kidnapper , seeing the alert , lost his or her nerve and released the child .
When Griffin looked at those cases , however , what he found was that very few were the sort of imminent - harm situations Amber Alert was created for .
In fact , only a tenth of Amber Alerts , he determined , helped rescue a child from what Griffin saw as a dangerous situation - and that group included situations in which an armed parent abducted his or her own child .
While an armed parent is not something to be taken lightly , Griffin says , it 's very different from a sexual predator with rape and murder on his mind .
" If a mom is told by a court she can't see her kid , does n't trust her husband , and abducts the child , it 's stretching reason to say we need an Amber Alert to save the kid's life , " Griffin argues .
He cites studies showing that , even before Amber Alert 's existence , 70 percent of parental abduction cases were resolved in less than a week .
" Thus , AMBER Alert ' failures ' are usually cases when there was little hope and ' successes ' are merely instances when there was relatively little threat , " Griffin and fellow criminologist Monica Miller wrote in a paper earlier this year .
" An AMBER Alert is therefore essentially irrelevant compared to the main factor ( the perpetrator 's intention ) that determines an abducted child 's fate . "
Opinion
Jim Hoagland : Obama or not , world hopes for renewal of U.S. ideals
John McCain 's prisoner - of - war experience is a strong selling point for him in this American election .
But it is a powerful drag on his popularity in Europe , where past U.S. involvement in Vietnam still generates intensely negative feelings .
Barack Obama 's flirtation with protectionism similarly divides opinion at home and abroad .
His attacks on NAFTA helped Obama compete for the Democratic nomination .
But they cause important foreign partners like Mexico , China and Japan to wonder if an Obama presidency would be good for them .
The world is very much with Americans in this thoroughly unorthodox year .
Foreign leaders traditionally complain that they cannot vote in our presidential elections even though their nations ' fortunes frequently depend on the outcome .
This year they get a say of a sort in a campaign in which foreign policy is both urgent and important .
One aim of Obama 's high - flying whistle - stop tour of Afghanistan , the Middle East and Western Europe was to assemble televised images suggesting that the world is eagerly awaiting the change in Washington that he promises .
That was certainly no problem in George W. Bush - weary Germany .
Which raises two big questions :
Is it true that the rest of the world is solidly behind Obama and the Democrats ?
And should Americans care what the rest of the world thinks about our election ?
My own unscientific poll — conducted while traveling in May and June to six of the G - 8 industrial nations ( I missed Germany and Canada ) and three other European countries — suggests that while Obamania is deep in Western Europe , it is not as broad globally as is often thought here .
Eagerness to leave the Bush years far behind mingles in France , Britain , Italy and elsewhere with the resurrection of a strongly romantic view of the United States as a place of endless surprises , good and bad — a place that can do and be anything , in contrast to the more regulated and tradition - bound societies of the Old Continent .
This flatters not only the Democratic contender but Americans as a whole .
Obama also benefits from general disappointment among Europeans with their own leaders , who stumble under a seemingly endless European Union constitutional crisis , uncertain economies and personality tics of various sorts .
Vicarious trans -Atlantic change will do if the real thing is not available locally .
Russia 's political elite and its government can probably be safely counted in the Obama camp as well .
The Kremlin has often preferred to work with Republican administrations , which were thought to be more reliable in getting arms - control agreements through Congress and less likely to press Russia on human - rights issues .
But McCain 's visceral support for including former Soviet republics Ukraine and Georgia in NATO , as well as his suggestion that he will work to get Russia expelled from the G - 8 , has turned attitudes in Moscow against the GOP this year .
" The rhetoric of both candidates disappoints Russians , " a Russian diplomat told me in Moscow .
" But McCain 's has been more offensive . "
Members of Russia 's weak opposition parties also shy away from voicing support for McCain , even though he has been a sharper critic of Vladimir Putin 's retreat from democratic freedoms than has Obama .
In Asia , trade is the biggest dividing line of the campaign and works in McCain 's favor .
Both China and Japan have settled into a comfortable relationship with Bush and give his administration high marks for its Asia policy and for promoting free trade .
They would expect McCain to continue this pattern and fear that victorious Democrats would disrupt it , I was told in Tokyo .
India 's political leaders seem to share those concerns .
Obama did little during his meticulously choreographed Middle East stops to dispel worries in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and elsewhere that he will be at least as pro-Israeli as McCain — and more likely to quit Iraq , and to engage Iran , without regard to the effect those actions would have on the region .
" For us , he is high risk for sure , high gain only maybe , " an Arab diplomat told me .
" Anyway , the United States could elect Osama bin Laden as president and American Middle East policy would not change .
It is that locked in for Israel . "
Not monolithic when it comes to the virtues and shortcomings of the two candidates , the world 's view of the American electoral process is nonetheless consistent on one point :
There is a hunger for renewed U.S. leadership that emphasizes American ideals and principles as much as American power .
And that should matter to Americans come Nov. 4 .

I just realized due to a forum thread that it ’s been about 7 months since I posted my Java 7 Predictions .
So , it seems like a good time to update those predictions .
At the time I was expecting that the Java SE 7 JSR would be created before JavaOne 2008 but obviously that did n’t happen and we ’re still waiting for the JSR .
Waiting on what , I ’m not really sure .
I know the open source effort and subsequent JavaFX in Java 6 work has been soaking up a lot of focus , but seems like it ’s still a bit late .
Maybe it ’s on vacation for the summer .
Anyhow , I ’m going to organize this a bit differently this time by putting stuff in three categories – Likely , Possible , and Unlikely .
As always , these are my own opinions based on stuff I ’ve read although I talk to various spec leads and members occasionally , you should trust this about as much as anything you read on the net .
Also , these do n’t reflect what I ’d like to see , just what I think is most likely .
Likely
Possible
Feature Chance Comment JSR 275 Units and Quantities 60 %
Well defined , but I ’m not sure this will be included in the actual JDK JSR 284 Resource Consumption Management 50 %
Hard to judge this one – there is a proposed final spec and seemingly interested support from major players , but not too much info out there .
JSR 326 Post Mortem JVM Diagnostics API 40 % Depends on timing , just starting now so would depend on JSR moving fast and Java 7 moving slow Type Literals 40 % I think some useful class or reflective helper will be added as a small stopgap to no reified generics .
Type Inference 40 % Possible but hard to tell
Unlikely

In popular perception , BitTorrent is a decentralized protocol ; after all , all that data is coming from other peers and not from a central server , right ?
But because searching for particular files on BitTorrent networks can be a dodgy proposition , most BitTorrent users rely on torrent indexes like those provided by , ahem , The Pirate Bay , giving the system a central choke point .
Shut down the torrent aggregators and files become much more difficult to find , so it's no surprise that content owners have recently targeted aggregators like Demonoid , OiNK , and the aforementioned The Pirate Bay .
Now , a new project out of Cornell hopes to provide good quality , approximate keyword searching directly through BitTorrent networks — a truly decentralized system that does n't rely on aggregators .
The state of P2P search
Cornell 's " Cubit " project is the brainchild of graduate student Bernard Wong , his advisor Emin Gun Sirer , and Microsoft Research 's Aleksandrs Slivkins .
The goal of the project , in the words of its authors , is to provide " an efficient , accurate and robust method to handle imprecise string search in filesharing applications . "
Wong tells me that the motivation is misspellings , both in searches and filenames , and he points to Google stats showing that a full 20 percent of Google searches for Britney Spears spell the singer 's name incorrectly .
Bernard Wong
P2P applications can perform searches , but most are n't very good at it .
Distributed hash tables ( DHT ) are one common approach , but these are generally good only at finding exact matches due to the nature of hashes .
Building an approximate DHT search system by iterating through all possible spelling variations of search queries is , in the understated terms of the Cubit team , a " highly inefficient solution . "
So most users just visit aggregators , but as Wong points out , such sites are getting raided or sent takedown notices and provide a centralized failure point .
While the team does n't advocate for copyright infringement , they are concerned with building robust and truly decentralized P2P networks , and they see approximate keyword search as being crucial to that effort .
Yes , it 's a " very cool research problem , " as Wong put it , but it 's also a chance to build the sort of decentralized search that could one day do what the RIAA and MPAA have so far failed to do : make The Pirate Bay irrelevant .
" We do hope that this type of system can be used in place of a centralized aggregator , " Wong tells me , but that day is still a long ways off .
Aggregators have the potential to offer more metadata and offer better organization than Cubit , which relies on data from filenames and the comments sections of files .
" Edit distance " is everything
To start , the team built an Azureus ( now called " Vuze " ) plugin for Cubit to demonstrate the technology .
With the plugin installed , Cubit creates a lightweight overlay network that exists in parallel with BitTorrent , but is used only for searches .
Cubit 's central insight is the abandonment of hashes , which are only good at detecting identical matches , and instead building a network based on " edit distance . "
Edit distance is " equal to the minimum number of insertions , deletions , and substitutions needed to transform one string to another . "
The edit distance between " ring " and " rings " is 1 , for example , while the number of changes needed to go from " ring " to " earring " is 3 ( see example below ) .
Edit distance between nodes
All files on all machines running Cubit are given a node ID , like " ring " or " earring , " and the computer builds an internal map of all the nodes based on their edit distance from one another .
When a search is accidentally run for " rong , " nodes with the lowest edit distance from the word appear first in the results list .
That means " ring " and " rang " would show up near the top of the list since they have an edit distance of one , while " rings " would be one of the next results because of its edit distance of two .
This is all grossly simplified ; tech heads who want to read about " Levenshtein distance " and " small - world construction " should check out the official paper describing Cubit ( PDF ) .
Because of the way that the node map is created , searches also do n't require querying every peer in the network and are claimed to require an entire order of magnitude fewer queries than DHT systems while providing more useful results .
In addition , the system works for any language in which a " word similarity metric " ( the edit distance ) can be defined , so nothing about it is particular to English .
What 's in a name ?
So why choose " Cubit " for a project to build approximate search into P2P apps ?
Wong says that the team needed a name , the system relies on " edit distance , " and cubit is an old unit of measurement .
The name seemed " fitting . "
To see the system in action , we installed the plugin and ran two searches .
The first was through Vuze 's own search functionality , and we looked for " machinime " ( a misspelling of " machinima " ) .
Predictably , there were no results , though " machinima " returned plenty .
When we ran the search through Cubit , numerous results popped up , but most were for " machine " rather than " machinima . "
Cubit results in Vuze
While the system , when complete , should make it simple to find and start torrent downloads without utilizing an index , Wong points out that it 's not a boon to would - be copyright infringers .
It makes it neither any harder nor any easier for investigators to find the IP addresses of people sharing files ; they just need to search the network rather than the index .
But what Cubit can do is force content owners to go directly after end users who are sharing particular files rather than simply trying to shut down the biggest indexes in order to hobble BitTorrent , bringing torrent search into the full decentralized world .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Experts are growing increasingly concerned that the United States will have to rely entirely upon Russia to take astronauts to and from the international space station for at least half a decade .
NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson endured a chaotic Soyuz capsule landing in April .
Observers say the situation is all the more worrying as earlier in the week , NASA announced a delay in the launch of its next - generation Orion spacecraft .
NASA 's dependency upon the Russian Soyuz space capsules and rockets to carry astronauts to the station is the result of a five - year gap between the scheduled retirement of the shuttle in 2010 and the debut of its replacement in 2015 .
The agency had hoped it could narrow this gap by accelerating the initial launch of the craft to 2013 but announced on Monday that because of inadequate funding and technical issues the new Constellation space program would not be ready for testing until September 2014 .
While the new date is still within the March 2015 absolute deadline , many experts say NASA 's reliance upon Russia to take astronauts into space has placed the agency in an unnecessary position .
" It is a vulnerability , " John Logsdon , director of the space policy institute at George Washington University , told CNN .
" Any time you are relying on a single system to do a critical task , you are vulnerable if that system has problems . "
" It is our fault for not having a replacement for the shuttle much earlier than Orion will be available .
It puts Russia in a very powerful position , " Logsdon said .
Russia will be the only country capable of providing human access to space not only for the Americans but also the rest of the world in the near future , said Howard McCurdy , a space expert at American University in Washington .
" It is like a monopoly position where you are at the mercy of that supplier , " said McCurdy .
" You do n't want to be dependent on a single provider no matter who it is . "
McCurdy warned that because the United States has positioned itself to be completely dependent on Russia to get humans into space until 2015 , it may be harder for the American government to take diplomatic action against the country , especially in light of recent tensions between Russia and Georgia .
" That is a real concern , " said McCurdy .
" You are much more reluctant to be nasty with somebody who is a sole provider of an essential service .
" We have other international arrangements with them that could be jeopardized by our reliance on them , " McCurdy continued .
" Everything from their foreign relations with ex-Soviet states to their role in economic summits . "
Does NASA 's dependence on Russia bode badly for U.S. space program ?
For its part , NASA says it remains confident that diplomatic affairs between the two countries will not adversely impact the space agency 's relationship with Russia .
" While it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities , NASA has no reason to believe that it will be unable to rely upon Roscosmos - provided Soyuz vehicles for future ISS activities , " spokesman Michael Curie wrote in an email statement to CNN .
The threat of a breakdown in diplomatic relations is not the only one hanging over NASA 's space program .
Legislation passed in 2000 ( now called the Iran , North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act ) could soon bring an abrupt halt to NASA 's partnership with the Russian Space Federation , Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida told CNN .
The law bans the United States from buying space technology from Russia unless the president determines Russia is taking steps to prevent the proliferation of nuclear and missile technology to Iran .
Congress waived the ban in 2005 , allowing NASA to enter into a $ 719 million contract with the Russians for use of the Soyuz through 2011 .
NASA says it is currently renegotiating a new long - term contract for use of the Soyuz but , according to Nelson , the success of that contract could depend on whether or not lawmakers decide to approve the waiver again .
Election - year politics combined with increasing concerns about Iran and the ongoing crisis in Georgia all but guarantee that lawmakers will not vote for the exemption , said Nelson .
That means NASA could lose access to the $ 100 billion space station unless it continues to fly the shuttle or strikes some sort of deal with another space agency willing to put forward money for additional Soyuz seats , the Senator explained to CNN .
" It is a lose - lose situation , " said Nelson .
" If our relationship with Russia is strained who knows if Russia will give us rides in the future ? " Nelson continued .
" Or if they give us rides will they charge such an exorbitant price that it becomes blackmail ? "
Questions about the safety and reliability of the Soyuz have also been raised in recent months after two consecutive troublesome landings by space capsules , including one in April with American astronaut Peggy Whitson on board .
NASA has been working with Russian engineers to try to determine the cause of the dangerous descents but has so far failed come up with any concrete answers .
But NASA officials say the space agency still believes the Soyuz is a reliable transport system for its astronauts .
" We do not have concerns , " NASA spokesman Rob Navias told CNN .
" The Soyuz , which has been flying for decades now , is extremely reliable and is extremely capable . "
" We have been partnering with the Russians for decades now for space flights . "
The Russian Federal Space Agency , Roscosmos , could not be reached for comment on the matter .
Here is a solution for Project Euler ’s problem # 1 in R .
The problem is expressed as :
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5 , we get 3 , 5 , 6 and 9 .
The sum of these multiples is 23 .
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 .
As usual with Project Euler questions , there is an obvious way , and a less obvious , but much more efficient way .
In this case , the obvious way is :
[ code lang= ” R ” ]
x < – seq( 1,999 )
sum ( x[x % % 3 ==0 | x % % 5 == 0 ] )
[ / code ]
Which very concisely returns the correct answer , 233168 .
However , if we use the following intuition :
\[ S_N = S_3 + S_5 – ( S_ { 3,5} ) \ ]
i.e. the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 or 5 is the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 , plus the sum of all numbers divisible by 5 , minus the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 and 5 ( as we have double counted them ) , then we get the correct answer .
Since \[ S_n = \ frac{ n ( a_1 + a_n ) }{2}\ ] , where \( n = \lfloor \ frac {N}{n} \rfloor\ ) , and \( a_n = a_1n\ ) , the last piece of the puzzle is what to use for \ ( S_ { 3,5}\ ) .
This is straightforward , we just use the lowest common multiple of 3 and 5 , which in this case is 15 .
Hence , the R representation of this is :
[ code lang= ” R ” ] sum ( 333*(( 3+333*3) /2),199 *(( 5+199*5)/2) -66*(( 15+66*15 ) /2 ) ) [ / code ]

Apple has slacked on the copy and paste feature for the iPhone .
One app , MagicPad , made it available but it only worked within itself .
Now , Zac
White figured out how to implement copy and paste on any iPhone App without violating the iPhone SDK agreement .
It ’s called OpenClip and developers can add it to any app .
Since it ’s open source it could be added to both App Store and Jailbroken apps .
Cali Lewis from GeekBrief.tv shows a demo of it on her latest show .
She also has an audio only interview with Zac here :
The way it works ( in very plain english ) is when you copy something from an app , it writes it in it ’s own folder , when you paste something into an app , let ’s say WordPress , WordPress would look in all other copy and paste compatible apps folders for recently copied info , sort it by date , and select the most recent one and paste it into WordPress .
If you are an iPhone developer and would like to add this feature to your app or want to look deeper into how this all works watch the second video .
If you ’d like more info visit the site OpenClip.org .
Zac is also working on a search application based on the fact he can read into other applications on the iPhone .
Look for this in the next few weeks in the App Store .
Senate Republicans block effort to aid paralyzed vets John Byrne
Published : Wednesday July 30 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) has done it again .
The Christopher and Dana Reeve Act , named for the actor who was made famous by his portrayal of superman and later became a champion of the disabled , along with his late wife ( pictured at right ) , is part of a broad package created by Democrats which lumps together 36 bills .
It would have allocated $ 25 million for research on spinal cord injuries , rehabilitation and measures to improve the quality of life for paralyzed Americans .
The effort is backed by the Paralyzed Veterans of America , which claims 19,000 members .
Some 200,000 Americans suffer spinal cord-related injuries .
 We have a war with many veterans who suffer some from spinal cord injuries or paralysis ,  said Lee Page , associate advocacy director for Paralyzed Veterans for America told the Navy Times Tuesday .
The overall bill , dubbed the Advancing Americas Priorities Act , was blocked by a 50 - 42 vote , short of the 60 votes need to overcome a filibuster .
It was created in an effort to draw attention to Sen .
Tom Coburn , a stalwart crusader for tightening the pursestrings of government .
The bill also included funding for victims of torture , disability , and disease .
The House passed the Reeve bill in 2007 , but the Senate has never followed suit .
The Democrats ' package bundled numerous uncontroversial proposals in an attempt to overcome procedural hurdles Coburn has imposed .
Dr. Coburn is famous for his efforts to moonlight as a physician while serving in Congress , and was blocked by the Senate when he attempted to continue delivering babies while in office .
He 's also known for his annual screening of films warning congressional staffers of venereal disease .
Republicans blasted the bill as an attempt to bait them and distract from measures to deal with high gas prices .
" They 're using every trick to get us away from dealing with high gas prices , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R- KY ) .

Richard Lenski is an evolutionary biologist who studies evolution by analyzing changes in bacterial populations .
Perhaps he is most famous for his long - term experiment where his group identified a population that evolved to use a nutrient ( citrate ) that E. coli normally ca n’t use .
This was a very important finding as it provided proof - of - concept that random mutations alone are sufficient to induce new functions .
In a recently published paper in Nature , Lenski takes the above experiment and analyzes the frequency of mutation throughout these populations .
The goal of this paper was not to show which specific mutations led to the ability of the bacteria to use the new nutrient source .
The goal was to look at the level of overall mutation rate during the experiment .
In the authors own words :
The relationship between rates of genomic evolution and organismal adaptation remains uncertain , despite considerable interest . …
Thus , the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment .
In particular , beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time , whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable .
Of course the Discovery Institute and ID proponents are not going to keep quiet about any work coming from Lenski ’s lab as their work provided such an important part of the evolutionary puzzle .
Michael Behe took up the challenge this time and wrote an entry at Evolution News and Views .
Lets address some of Behe ’s points .
Behe ’s first compliant is that
[ Lenski ’s group ] identified a couple score of mutations which they say are likely beneficial ones .
That is almost certainly true , but what they do n’t emphasize is that many of the beneficial mutations are degradative — that is , they eliminate a gene or its protein ’s function .
First ,
Behe is attacking the paper for something that is really irrelevant to the point of the paper .
It also does n’t disprove the original result of that spontaneous mutations that led to a novel attribute .
It is a red herring designed to poke holes in Lenski ’s work instead of directly arguing against it .
So why all the degradative mutations ?
Well , these experiments were done in a lab under strict conditions ( single temperature , no other organisms , defined nutrients ) to eliminate other variables .
Without these other stimuli , is it any wonder that most changes are degradative ?
Behe also criticizes the rise in what is called a mutator line in these experiments .
A mutator strain is one in which mutations arise more frequently than in a normal strain .
Again this does n’t really address the ideas of the new paper or in the proof - of - concept of Lenski ’s original data .
Anyway , who cares that these strains became mutator strains .
A mutator just increases the frequency by which mutations arise .
Maybe it would have taken 3 times as long for the beneficial mutation to arise if the mutator strain had n’t evolved .
It does n’t change the fact that the cells evolved into a state where they could use a nutrient that they could n’t before .
Besides , it is a moot point as one of the original mutation had arose before the 20,000 generation , a time before the mutation that led to mutator strain had occurred .
Finally , Behe closes with the expected tactics that we have grown to love from ID proponents .
The first tactic as illustrated above is to wrongfully criticize valid experiments in favor of evolution .
The second tactic is then to say how this data really proves intelligent design :
Lenski ’s decades - long work lines up wonderfully with what an ID person would expect — in a huge number of tries , one sees minor changes , mostly degradative , and no new complex systems .
So much for the power of random mutation and natural selection .
First , an ID proponent would not expect the E. coli to ever use the new nutrient .
The “ power of random mutation and natural selection ” led the bacteria to a whole new attribute .
Do n’t forget , this experiment lasted only decades , or 1/100,000,000 the time bacteria are believed to inhabit the earth .
Finally , like I stated above , these were very unnatural conditions that would never be experienced during normal life on earth .

The most thought - provoking economics book of recent times , A Farewell to Alms , has an answer to this on page 288 :
The increasing returns to scale inherent in most modern production processes imply that for the typical transaction the price is much greater than the marginal cost …
That means that modern markets for industrial products … are imperfectly competitive . …
The difference between price and marginal cost means that producers have an incentive to spend resources in trying to sell more product at the current price , through trying to get customers to choose their products rather than the nearly identical products of their competitors .
Selling is a huge part of modern economies …
Mobile phone service is the ultimate in discrepancy between marginal cost and price .
The cost of serving one additional user on an existing network is just about zero ; the price collected from that user is $ 50 per month .
This is the least interesting insight from the book , but it is one of the simplest to relate in a Weblog .

Hamdan ’s lawyers dismiss US terror trial as unfair
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , August 6 , 2008
Sentencing will be passed down later today on Salim Hamdan , a man described by defense attorneys and witnesses as a low level driver who knew nothing of Al Qaeda .
The driver will face life imprisonment while it was revealed last week that Osama Bin Laden ’s most senior bodyguard was simply let go from the prison at Guantánamo Bay .
A jury of six military officers at Guantanamo Bay reached a split verdict Wednesday in the war crimes trial of a former driver for Osama bin Laden , clearing him of some charges but convicting him of others that could send him to prison for life , reports AP .
The so called “ mastermind of 9/11 ” Khalid Sheik Mohammed dismissed Hamdan in written testimony as a mere chauffeur “ not fit to plan or execute ” .

Dear Reader ,
As you may know , the July 31 , 2014 edition of Global Security Newswire ( GSN ) was its last .
Launched just weeks after 9/11 as part of the Nuclear Threat Initiative ’s public education mission , the five - day - a - week , online news service covered terrorism and nuclear , chemical and biological threats — urgent issues under - covered by mainstream news organizations .
GSN boasted a talented and award - winning news staff , led by Editor Elaine Grossman .
We are proud of their work , and we appreciated the strong partnership we had with National Journal to produce the Newswire .
The decision to end GSN was difficult , driven by familiar themes in today ’s changing news media environment .
When NTI launched GSN , there were few news options for our international policy audience .
Today , readers can choose from myriad blogs , aggregation services and news alerts , diminishing GSN ’s once - unique position .
Some of them are listed below and may help you fill the gap .
In addition , GSN ’s articles and daily editions will remain archived and available on NTI ’s web site .
We are grateful to National Journal ’s leadership , to Elaine Grossman , and to the GSN journalists who over the years brought you the latest news on the issues important to all of us .
And we are especially grateful to you , GSN ’s readers , for your interest and for your dedication to building a safer world .

No other member of congress was able to foresee the impending collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
He has a savvy that he wisely chooses not to parade about as a part of him , yet it is no less lacking in it 's ability to win over the hearts and minds of those millions who still love freedom and are not willing to ever give it up .
This September , Dr. Paul told us a message that slipped under the radar of the guys ( and their minions ) with “ D's ” and “ R's ” in front of their names and I 'm glad that it did .
The message was n't for them anyway even if they did have the common sense to appreciate it .
The first “ number ” he pulled , if you dare to see it as such .
His endorsement of Chuck Baldwin left many thinking that Paul was throwing something away when he was actually trying to build a foundation for a movement that would last well beyond November and teach others a lesson that was years overdue .
I personally would n't vote for Chuck Baldwin because I do n't pick and choose which rights people have .
It 's already been spelled out for us .
The US Constitution and the Magna Carta immediately come to mind as trusty enough guides .
Chuck can't play “ The Name Game ” in polite company and he would not be my choice to lead America even if Ron Paul himself introduced me to him as “ one of the five best men in the world ” .
Then why do I think that Ron Paul created a masterpiece of political insight ?
Looking at this from a standpoint after the 2008 election , then please first understand that the ballot box is only a means of achieving liberty in our time , not an end .
The Libertarian Party is the third of those parties I am referring to .
His “ number ” that Ron did on them , was that Bob Barr should not lead us to the polling places , as he has not earned it from his deeds , only from his popularity or at least the temporary illusion of it .
I wavered back and forth as to whether Barr was deserving of my vote .
I only recently came to the conclusion that Ron Paul was to show that another minor party candidate , even with all his obvious flaws , was more Libertarian than who the LP faithful was running for president .
He also wanted to show the party what would happen to them if they strayed from their time honored tradition of nomination of the candidate that best represents liberty that we want to show to the world .
The nomination convention of the “ Party of Principle ” openly rejected vastly more qualified candidates for president , choosing instead an only slightly famous congressman who never showed any respect for freedom or The Constitution while serving in office .
The LP was begging to be taken out behind the woodshed and shown how it 's downward slide split the party faithful into mere splinters .
Mr. Paul is bringing them back together without the party 's blessings or assistance .
His choice to have the conference and invite minor party candidates on September 10th was sheer brilliance .
He was n't compromising himself to them , he was offering them to join the movement for liberty .
He showed the minor candidates that they too had also been badly stung by big government .
Mired in their ignorance of economic reality , the minor parties have drifted too .
Ron Paul offered a coalition to them , but one on his terms and that makes all the difference .
Congressman
Paul has taken it upon himself to educate them about the flip side of the freedom equation and it's vast importance to us all .
The bailout , jobs , the economy , new loads of taxes , yeah , timings good too .
Ron Paul chugs along whether you give him credit for smarts or not .
It 's a given that naysayers do not slow him down .
Big brother is losing it 's friends , and liberty is scooping them up and pointing them in the direction they have finally realized they wanted to go in .
This can build into something incredible .
I am so grateful that I 'll be here to witness it when he pulls the next number .
He 's one of us , pledging his life , fortune and sacred honor ,
With Liberty ,
Dan Steward
Yesterday I caved in and bought myself one of those cute little laptop devices : an Acer Aspire One .
Note that the giant machine on the left is my previously considered smallish 14.1 ″ laptop from Dell .
It comes with a Taiwanese distribution , Linpus Linux , based on Fedora 8 .
More specifically , it comes with the ‘ Lite ’ variant of the distribution which features Xfce as its desktop environment .
Well , actually , it is part modified Xfce , part Easy ( tm ) interface created by Acer for this device ( they call it xfdesktop2 , a bit strange if you ask me ) .
Wow .
A commercial offering available from a store for regular people , with software that I helped create .
Awesome .
Maybe I should have asked for a discount ;-)
I ’ve just started playing with it and I think they did a pretty good job .
The interface is really easy , but can only access a few predefined applications .
I have wanted to write such a full screen launcher / control center interface for a long time , but never got around to actually doing anything about it .
It would be perfect for my parents , who have a very hard time working with their Windows XP .
They use a modified Thunar ( My Disk : // , Removable :// , indication of disk usage in the side bar ) that seems to work fairly well .
They do n’t provide easy access to changing the configuration , since they disabled the right mouse menu on the panel .
However Alt - F2 brings up xfrun as in a regular Xfce installation and Terminal is installed .
There ’s xfce- setting - show to bring up our own settings dialog .
It does n’t fit on the screen ( 1024×600 ) , but this is partly due to the very big icon they added for screen settings , making all buttons in the dialog much bigger than they need to be .
I got rid of the XP window decorations and used the Xfce theme instead of RedHat ’s Nodoko .
Now that looks better !
xfce4 - panel - a gives you the add item menu , where you can add for instance the xfdesktop menu .
Also in edit mode some right - click menus do become available ( not all ) .
I ’ve added a menu and a pager to get a bit more functionality .
Since it ’s based on fedora you can use yum to install more software .
I ’ve just installed gimp to be able to create a decently sized picture for this post .
It has an 8 GB SSD for storage and two card reader slots for possible extensions .
The one thing where the SSD really shows its advantage is boot time .
It boots in about 15 seconds , maybe a bit less ( although some daemons are still being started in the background ) , very nice indeed .
Oh , and it weighs slightly less than 1 kg .
So , now I ’ll go back to playing with this thing ;-)

When I was younger , one of the wealthier businessmen in her small town me a small savings bond as a gifts to use for my college education .
When age 18 came around , there was barely enough money in there to purchase one text book .
Then I got to thinking , is it really ever a good idea to get a savings bond ?
Is there any case that it makes sense to get a savings bond versus another sort of savings investment ?
For the uninitiated , a savings bond is basically an investment in government debt .
You can go over to the IRSâ€™s website and purchase an electronic bond for any value amount over $ 25.00 .
The current rate for EE savings bonds is 1.40 % .
You cannot cash in the bond for a period of less than one year , and if you cash it in before five years , thereâ€™s a penalty of 3 months interest .
There are other types of bonds with slightly different features and rates , but for the purposes of this article , weâ€™ll talk about EE bonds , which are the commonly purchased by individuals .
There are some tax benefits to federal treasury bonds that should be considered as well .
The interest that you earn on savings bonds are exempt from state and local taxes , which is nice .
Even with this , youâ€ ™re still better off to get a certificate of deposit or a high - yield money market savings account that offers around 3 % and to just pay the state taxes on it .
In my case it doesnâ€™t really matter because there are no state capital gains or income taxes in South Dakota .
In addition , you can make the interest tax exempt if you use the money for education .
This is a nice perk , but there are so many better educational savings plans around .
Your best bet is to use an educational savings account ( ESA ) , so that you can invest in some solid mutual funds which will average closer to 10 % , and still not pay any taxes on the money if its used for educational purchases .
The tax benefits arenâ€™t reason enough to get a treasury bond , but the primary reason to not get them is because the interest rates arenâ€™t competitive .
The fixed rate EE bond goes for 1.40 % right now , and you can get a good certificate of deposit for around 3.5 % .
The variable rate bond , the I bond goes for about 2.4 % right now , which is even beat by a nearly all of the high - yield money market accounts .
Thereâ€™s also the problem of liquidity .
You canâ€™t cash these in for under one year , and thereâ€™s an interest penalty for cashing them out under five years .
These arenâ€™t exactly the best term , you could put the money in a high - yield savings account instead and get all of the same interest and more , as well as having your money wholly liquid .
People also have a tendency to lose savings bonds .
A lot of people arenâ€™t very organized in their financial lives and just happen to misplace savings bonds they get as gifts and never think about it again .
Decades later one of their children will happen to find it once again long after it could have been used for its intended purpose .
Savings bonds are often used as gifts for another .
When you give someone cash , theyâ€™ll spend it and not think anything of it .
Savings bonds are a bit less liquid , so itâ€™s like you are helping them build wealth .
If you want to do this , consider giving them a certificate of deposit or high - yield savings account in their name .
This way the money will be more flexible , still be a financial gift that isnâ€™t exactly cash , and will make the recipient more money .
When it comes to you and I as individuals , there really arenâ€™t any good situations where itâ€™s smart to get a savings bond .
There are better rates found elsewhere , savings bonds are very illiquid , and the tax benefits donâ€™t really pan out and there are better options for financial gifts available .

An Indiana diamond found in deposits that date to the end of the last Ice Age .
Tests reveal it originated from the Canadian Shield .
Diamonds and precious metals found in the eastern United States might have rained down during the last Ice Age after a comet shattered over Canada and set North America ablaze , all leading to a mass die - off of animals and humans .
New chemical analyses of diamond , gold and silver found in Ohio and Indiana reveal the minerals were transported there from Canada several thousand years ago .
The question is , how ?
" There are no gold mines or silver mines in Ohio that anyone knows of , but there are plenty of them in Canada , " said retired geophysicist Allen West , who was involved in the study .
The discovery is consistent with a theory proposed by West and colleagues that a 3 - mile - wide comet splintered over glaciers and ice sheets in eastern Canada about 12,900 years ago and wiped out man and beast .
" These would have been like ten thousand Tunguskas going off at once , " said West , referring to a mid-air explosion over Siberia a century ago possibly caused by a fragmenting meteor .
Precious rain
The diamonds , gold and silver could have been ejected into the air during the blasts , West said , or they could have been carried south by rivers formed from the meltwater of liquified glaciers .
For several months following the comet strike , the skies rained precious stone and metals , the researchers speculate .
Diamonds drizzled down by the tons .
" Some of them you could n't see , and animals would 've been breathing them in , " West told LiveScience .
" But other ones would clearly have been visible .
They might 've even hurt if they hit you . "
The larger diamonds were visible to the naked eye and dropped like hail stones within seconds of the blasts , West said .
The smallest diamonds , the " size of cold viruses , " would have lingered in the atmosphere for weeks or months , eventually wafting down to Earth like expensive snowflakes .
Killed man and beast
Flaming fragments of the comet crashing to Earth sparked forests fires around the globe , West contends .
The intense heat from the blasts set the very air on fire .
North America 's grassland , the furs of animals , the hair and clothing of humans — all would have been set ablaze .
West and his colleagues have proposed that the comet strike contributed to the extinction of several species of North American megafauna , including mammoths and mastodons , and led to the early demise of the Clovis culture , a Stone Age people who had only recently immigrated to the continent .
The multiple airbursts might have also caused large amounts of fresh water to be dumped into the Atlantic Ocean , temporarily disrupting currents and prompting a sudden global cold snap called the Younger Dryas period .
" The kind of evidence we are finding does suggest that climate change at the end of the last Ice Age was the result of a catastrophic event , " said study team member Ken Tankersley , an anthropologist at the University of Cincinnati .
While the discoveries in Ohio and Indiana are consistent with the theory of a comet colliding with Earth during the last Ice Age , West cautions that it is not a " smoking gun . "
" We 're a long way from saying categorically that these things got here because of this event , " West said .
" They 're consistent , but we 've got a lot more work to do to show there 's a direct connection . "
The researchers are preparing to submit their research to a scientific journal .
Reduced finances should not mean reduced socialising A charity is warning people not to risk their mental health by isolating themselves as they try to cope with the credit crunch .
A Mental Health Foundation poll of 2,000 British adults found a third are cutting back on going out with friends due to limited funds .
The charity said this may be the first time the younger generation have dealt with such financial stress .
It urged people to opt for cheaper , but still social activities .
The survey found eight out of 10 do have worries about the impact of the current financial situation and two thirds say money worries are always at the back of their mind .
Almost twice as many people aged 18 - 24 are stressed by their financial situation as those aged over 55 .
By spending less , people can help themselves avoid serious debt , which can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety

Mental Health Foundation
But people are taking positive steps .
One in four of those surveyed said they were growing their own fruit and vegetables , while one in five are choosing to walk or cycle rather than use public transport or taxis .
They are also cutting back on spending on clothes , holidays and fuel .
But the Mental Health Foundation said restricting social activities could be detrimental Celia Richardson , a spokeswoman for the charity , said : " As the economic slump begins to affect everything from food prices to mortgage repayments , this research shows that financial worries are a source of stress for many .
" But people are making changes to the way they live - like growing their own fruit and vegetables , and walking and cycling more .
Frisbee in the park " Not only is this evidence that people are adapting well to change , but some of their altered habits are actually good for mental health . "
" For many people , particularly the younger generations , this may be the first time they 've been surrounded by worrying talk of serious recession .
" By spending less , people can help themselves avoid serious debt , which can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety .
" But they need to replace shopping and spending with other activities they enjoy and should n't isolate themselves from friends . "
She advised people to find cheaper ways of socialising , such as playing games with family and friends like charades in the living room or Frisbee in the park .

Steele v. Mengelkoch , 2008 WL 2966529 ( Minn ..App. Ct. Aug. 5 , 2008 )
A professor at Bemidji State University wrote a story saying some putatively unflattering things about a local journalist , who did n’t take kindly to the allegations and brought a lawsuit alleging defamation and related torts against a number of defendants , including seeking $ 50 BILLION from Google .
( GOBOGH ! )
This opinion is unclear exactly how the plaintiff alleged that Google was involved in the defamation , but it would n’t matter because we know that 47 USC 230 fully protects Google in all cases .
The trial court knew this too , and granted a dismissal per 230 .
The trial court went further and sanctioned the pro se in pauperis defendant under the state law equivalent of Rule 11 by sua sponte ordering him to pay Google ’s attorney ’s fees of over $ 12 k .
As far as I know , this was the first time a judge issued Rule 11 sanction for filing a lawsuit preempted by 47 USC 230 .
The appellate court glibly upholds the 230 dismissal , but it reverses Google ’s attorney ’s fees award on a technicality –Google did n’t ask for the sanctions and the plaintiff did n’t have the chance to withdraw the filing before being punished , which precluded Rule 11 sanctions in this case .
However , even though this plaintiff dodged the bullet here , make no mistake–courts are getting tired of lawsuits that are plainly preempted by 230 , and I expect judges to become increasingly willing to do more than just kick out a lawsuit quickly .
Even if the sanction award did n’t stick this time , it ’s only a matter of time before it will .
Just one more reminder for plaintiffs to pick the right defendants to try to hold responsible for their alleged wrongs .
Dick Durbin noted John McCain ’s temper is “ well documented . \ "
Democrats take aim at McCain ’s temper
DENVER — John McCain ’s Democratic colleagues in the Senate are zeroing in on his oft - discussed temper , questioning whether the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is too volatile to be commander in chief .
In separate interviews with Politico on Tuesday , Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill . ) and Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) said they have seen McCain “ explode . ”

“ He has a huge anger problem , ” Boxer said .
“ And he never hid that .
... I have seen it happen on the Senate floor many , many times . …
He has exploded at me a couple times . ”
Boxer said McCain has always apologized after the dust - ups .
Nonetheless , she insinuated that McCain ’s temperament makes him unfit for the White House .
“ It ’s all well and good to apologize , ” Boxer added , “ but if you are in charge of that black box , I worry about that . ”
Durbin noted McCain ’s temper is “ well documented , ” saying that he had been on the receiving end of it for what he considered “ minor things . ”
“ I was in a confrontation with him … and he was quick to explode , ” said Durbin .
“ It simmered for a long time . ”
Republicans have accused Democrats of inventing the temper line of attack to knock the Arizona senator .
But Durbin called it “ an important issue . ”
Boxer pointed out that many of McCain ’s GOP colleagues have also spoken out about his volatility , highlighting an incident told to the Biloxi Sun Herald by Sen.
Thad Cochran ( R - Miss . ) .
Cochran told the newspaper that he watched McCain get involved in a physical confrontation with a Nicaraguan government official during a 1987 trip there .
According to Cochran , McCain grabbed the official by the shirt collar and “ snatched him up like he was throwing him up out of the chair . ”
McCain has said the account was “ simply not true . ”
NEW YORK ( Billboard ) -
It may have seemed like a fad at first , but the resurgence of vinyl is now turning into a nice niche business for the major labels .
With EMI ’s announcement that it would reissue eight classic albums in the format , all four majors are now onboard the vinyl bandwagon .
Members of Coldplay pose at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards in Los Angeles , June 1 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
EMI will release two Coldplay albums , four Radiohead titles and Steve Miller ’s “ Greatest Hits ” on August 19 .
Universal Music Enterprises will release 20 albums on vinyl this month and an additional 20 at the end of August , while Warner Music Group will issue 24 to 30 albums from its catalogue and 10 to 12 new releases from September through the end of the year , according to executives at those companies .
In the independent camp , RED labels will have several hundred vinyl titles by the end of the year , half of which are new releases , RED vice president of indie sales / marketing Doug Wiley said .
One of RED ’s labels , Metal Blade , is reissuing its classic Slayer catalogue in deluxe versions , all on coloured vinyl with hand - designed blood splatterings on it , Wiley said .
Indie retail started the party , but now some of the chains are carrying vinyl too .
In addition to Fred Meyer and Borders , Best Buy has said publicly that it will experiment with carrying LPs .
EMI Music Catalogue vice president of A&R and creative Jane Ventom said that the company has always been into vinyl , “ but we are getting more into it . ”
She said the move is in response to consumer demand from the iPod generation , baby boomers and audiophiles .
“ Music is becoming a social action again , ” Ventom said .
“ The kids are now listening to music with their mates instead of on headphones . ”
She added that vinyl allows them to “ hear music in its true form . ”
“ People are going back to reliving the way they used to listen to music and they realize that they missed the ( album cover ) artwork and what a pleasurable listening experience it is , ” Ventom said .
SOUND MATTERS
One of the most important elements to issuing vinyl is sound quality , especially in the MP3 age .
That ’s why Warner Bros. will relaunch its becausesoundmatters.com
Web site , which touts and sells vinyl and may start offering high - resolution MP3s , according to Warner Bros. / Reprise Records executive VP
Tom Biery , who heads the label ’s radio promotion team and oversees its vinyl initiative .
Warner Bros. reissued the first two Metallica albums -- “ Kill ‘ Em All ” and “ Ride the Lighting ” -- on vinyl , and both have passed the 4,000 - unit sales mark , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
On July 15 , the company released “ Master of Puppets ” on vinyl in two versions .
In September , the label plans to issue a 50th anniversary archive series of vinyl releases , including James Taylor ’s “ Mud Slide Slim , ” a Rickie Lee Jones album , a Marty Paich album and the Red Hot Chili Peppers ’ “ Blood Sugar Sex Magik . ”
Most of the albums that are issued on vinyl also come with an enclosed CD , Biery said .
The increased interest in vinyl is putting a strain on the handful of pressing plants still left from the format ’s heyday .
“ Our vinyl is always late because it gets bumped , ” Redeye co-owner Tor Hansen said .
“ I still have eight machines , and I am currently running at about 75 percent capacity , ” said plant manager Dave Jump of Nashville ’s United Records .
The limited pressing network often makes it hard to get vinyl out on the same release date as the CD , but when the stars align , sales can be significant .
Warner Bros. offered vinyl and CD on the same day when issuing the Raconteurs ’ “ Consolers of the Lonely ” in March ; the album sold 42,000 units in its first week , and 3 percent of sales came from the vinyl version .
Looking forward , executives said they want to be aggressive and practical with their vinyl campaigns .
“ Everything should n’t be released on vinyl , ” WEA ( Warner - Elektra - Atlantic ) vice president of catalogue sales Steve Corbin said .
“ We want to be selective and smart about what we put out .
( But ) it ’s interesting that the consumer sees the value and is willing to pay for vinyl . ”

Some might not recognize it , but Yes Virginia , There Is A Credit Crunch .
Let 's look at a few examples of the credit crunch in action .
Bloomberg is reporting MGM , Dubai Fall Behind on $ 3.5 Billion Loan for Las Vegas Plan .
MGM Mirage and Dubai World are late in raising as much as $ 3.5 billion for their $ 11.2 billion CityCenter project in Las Vegas because banks saddled with debt to casinos and hotels are wary of making new loans .
Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group , the Zurich - based bank that advised Dubai World last year when it invested $ 5.1 billion in MGM , are among the holdouts , bankers with knowledge of the matter said .
Funding was supposed to be completed by the end of June , MGM Chief Financial Officer Daniel D'Arrigo told analysts in May .
President James Murren said Frankfurt - based Deutsche Bank has been part of every MGM loan since 1998 .
" Wall Street firms are scrutinizing their extension of credit , particularly to the gaming industry , where the sentiment is pretty weak , " said Michael Paladino , an analyst at Fitch Ratings in New York .
Building the 76 - acre " city - within -a- city , " designed by architects , including Norman Foster and Daniel Liebeskind , is costing Las Vegas - based MGM and Dubai about $ 100 million each per month , D'Arrigo said in May .
MGM and Dubai World will raise at least $ 3 billion and may increase that to $ 3.5 billion to fund construction , MGM's Murren said on July 14 .
Murren , 46 , declined to comment on which banks have signed on for the deal or on its terms .
Title Companies Complain " Banks Deprived Us Of Cash "
United Title of Texas has closed all its offices around the state , including six in the Houston area , because of financial troubles related to its Colorado - based parent company .
" This decision was precipitated by an unexpected , and in our opinion , unwarranted and unjustified act by our syndicate of banks , which deprived us of the cash we needed to sustain and to continue those operations , " the Colorado company said in a memo to employees today .
United Title is a subsidiary of Mercury Cos. , which owns title agencies in California , Colorado , Texas , Oregon , Nevada and Arizona .
Mercury stopped funding operations in Arizona and California , as well .
" We have a lot of closings that are supposed to occur , " Hilbun said .
" If people miss closing dates , they can lose their loans .
The ones today could be in jeopardy . "
" Financial Title Co. , the largest real - estate title agent in Silicon Valley , has shut its doors as part of a closure of multiple offices and title companies by its parent , Mercury Cos. of Colorado .
The decision follows a move by Mercury 's lenders to pull their line of credit after Mercury failed to meet loan requirements . "
We ’re Saying No To Almost Everybody
What Credit Crunch ?
Japanese Exports Hit By US Credit Crunch
Japan 's factory output dropped 2 percent from May , surpassing a decline of 1.7 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of economists and the jobless rate climbed to 4.1 percent .
The economy probably contracted an annualized 0.4 percent last quarter ended June 30 , economists estimate a report to show next month .
Japan 's biggest export markets have been hit by the credit crunch stemming from the U.S. housing recession , while higher prices at home have made consumers reluctant to spend .
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. , the nation 's two largest automakers , this month cut sales forecasts for 2008 as global demand cools .
Mervyn's Seeks Bankruptcy
Mervyn's LLC , the 59 - year - old department - store chain , joined more than a dozen U.S. retailers that have filed for bankruptcy this year as consumers cut spending in the face of the credit crunch and higher oil prices .
It 's the sixth bankruptcy in the past 12 months by a company owned by Sun Capital Partners Inc. , a Florida - based investment firm .
Retailers that have sought court protection over the past year include Steve & Barry 's LLC , Sharper Image Corp. , Shoe Pavilion Inc. , Levitz Furniture Inc. and Linens 'n Things Inc .
Declining home values , tightening credit and rising energy costs have left U.S. consumers " tapped out , " said Martin Bienenstock , a bankruptcy lawyer with Dewey & LeBoeuf in New York .
Sun Capital was part of a private - equity group that bought Mervyn's from Minneapolis - based Target for $ 1.65 billion in 2004 .
The Sun Capital holdings that have sought bankruptcy protection are Lillian Vernon Corp. , Powermate Corp. , Crafts Retail Holding Corp. , Wickes Furniture Co. and Jevic Transportation Inc .
One Hell Of String For Sun Capital
Falling Demand For Credit Ratings
McGraw - Hill Cos. , the owner of Standard & Poor 's , said second - quarter profit fell 23 percent as a slump in demand for new debt ratings overshadowed revenue gains in the education and investment services units .
Moody 's Corp.'s second - quarter profit fell less than analysts ' estimated after the world 's second - largest credit - rating company reduced the workforce and cut compensation to overcome a drop in demand for bond rankings .
Moody 's Chief Executive Officer Raymond McDaniel sliced expenses 10 percent by eliminating more than 7.5 percent of the workforce and reducing compensation .
Moody 's and larger rival Standard & Poor 's are finding ways to cut costs as the yearlong credit crunch stifles demand for credit ratings .
" The debt capital market , which is really our core business segment , is going through a very , very difficult time , " said Mark Almeida , president of Moody 's Analytics , on a management conference call today .
" We have a number of customers who are exiting segments of the business and we have had some very large customers go completely out of business . "
Credit Crunch Reaches Critical Mass
Forged passports may seem like the stuff of spy novels , but they have appeared in the real world , having been used by individuals who went on to take part in terrorist attacks .
To add a layer of security that goes beyond what 's printed on the page , many nations are adopting passports with an RFID chip that contains a duplicate of the printed information , secured by encryption .
A security researcher hired by a British newspaper has now shown that it 's possible to replace the data in the RFID chip , and the lack of international cooperation in the sharing of encryption information may mean the hack goes undetected in many places .
The basics behind the RFID scheme are pretty simple .
Passports contain printed copies of a personal photo and key biometric information , such as height , date of birth , etc .
With the right equipment and blank passports , it 's possible to forge these printed materials .
RFID chips embedded in the passports are intended to help detect these forgeries , as they carry a duplicate of this information — if the two do n't match , then the forgery should be obvious .
( The US State Department maintains an FAQ addressing this technology . )
Of course , it 's entirely possible to forge an RFID chip , which is precisely what a security researcher in Amsterdam did at the request of The Times .
Jeroen van Beek of the University of Amsterdam was given two valid passports that contained RFID chips .
Using an $ 80 RFID reader , van Beek was able to obtain a copy of all the biometric data , substitute arbitrary values for each of the fields , then write the modified data back out to a separate $ 40 RFID chip .
The Times reports that the process took about an hour .
In an amusing twist — and to avoid charges that they were actually engaged in illegal forgery — van Beek uploaded Osama bin Laden 's vitals onto the blank RFID chip .
There 's still the matter of forging the printed material to match , but the fact that this was already being done was the justification for the RFID chip in the first place .
Those who created the RFID scheme apparently recognized the danger of this hacking and included some sort of encrypted hash value that could verify that the data had not been tampered with ; van Beek 's method does nothing to compensate for this , and thus leaves the forgeries at risk of detection .
Unfortunately , a lack of international cooperation has meant that the risk of detection remains minimal and easily avoided .
The forgery detection scheme relies on a Public Key Directory maintained by the International Civil Aviation Organization .
Each country issuing RFID - equipped passports can upload public signature information to the directory , which would allow changes to the biometric information to be detected .
As of last year , only seven countries had signed up for the directory .
According to The Times , over 45 are now issuing RFID passports .
Germany appears to be one of the laggards , but it appears to be hesitating because it 's unsure whether the method by which passport issuers submit their certificates to the directory is itself secure .
All a hacker would have to do is figure out which countries are not part of the directory and target forgeries to those nations .
The story is a disturbing reminder that the best security system in the world is only useful if it 's actually put into practice .
Federal Reserve finds deepening credit crisis
More banks are tightening lending standards on home mortgages and other consumer and business loans as a deepening credit crisis exerts a heavier toll on the economy .
The Federal Reserve said Monday the percentage of banks reporting tighter lending standards rose across various loan types in its July survey .
In April , the central bank had found that the percentage of banks reporting tighter lending standards was already near historic highs .
The new survey , conducted in early July , found that about 75 percent of the banks surveyed indicated they had tightened their lending standards for prime mortgages .
That was up from about 60 percent in the previous survey .
The Fed's July survey covered 50 banks which hold about 80 percent of the residential mortgages on the books of all commercial banks .
Out of this group of 50 banks , 32 said they were still originating so - called nontraditional home mortgages .
Among these 32 banks , about 85 percent said they had tightened their lending standards , up from 75 percent who said they were tightening lending standards for nontraditional mortgages in the April survey .
The Fed defines nontraditional mortgages as interest - only loans and " Alt - A " mortgages that required limited verification of income .
The survey found that many banks had reported tightening their lending standards and terms on all major categories of consumer and business loans over the past three months .
About 65 percent of domestic banks - more than double the roughly 30 percent in the April survey - reported that they had tightened lending standards on credit card loans .
The current credit crisis hit with force a year ago with rising defaults in the market for subprime mortgage loans .
The credit problems have since spread from subprime loans , mortgages provided to borrowers with weak credit histories , to other types of mortgages and other kinds of loans .
Niantic Labs is scheduled to introduce the highly anticipated Generation 3 Pokemon during the upcoming future and it looks some new creatures from the Hoenn region will be among the first ones to make an appearance .
The game developer already published the APK ( Android Package Kit ) for its next update and tech savvy fans datamined two Hoenn based Pokemon .
Deoxys
The first Pokemon that the dataminers managed to find is Deoxys .
This is a Mythical Pokemon that ’s based in Hoenn .
Moreover , Deoxys fits in the physic - type category and it comes with the following forms : Speed , Defense and Attack form .
Castform
The second Pokemon is Castform .
What ’s interesting about this one is that its heavily influenced by the current weather .
Therefore , Castform changes in Normal , Sunny , Rainy and Snowy .
This feature will make Castform quite an interesting pocket monster to own and it will be interesting to see how its powers change according to the weather .
Weather Condition Castform
Even though there are n’t any Pokemon which adapt to their weather conditions right now , this was to be expected from Generation 3 since it advertised this new feature a while ago .
As an example , the Pokemon will turn into fire - type when its Sunny and it will change to ice - type when it starts Snowing .
The folks at The Slip Road who are responsible for the datamining stated the following in regard to this new weather affected Pokemon : “ We may be as close as 1 client - side update away from Gen III , travelers .
At any rate , we ’re excited these updates are coming so closely together ( only 4 days since the last APK mine ) !
I have a feeling it ’s going to be a good month on the Road . ”
With that being said , Pokemon
Go fans should be getting ready to receive a new update during the upcoming month which is going feature a bunch of new playable pocket monsters .

On this date in 1881 , Chester A. Arthur was sworn in as President of the United States .
Our friend Thomas Sonnenschein is here to honor the underappreciated , overnamed twenty - first president .
Many years ago , in a college trivia tournament , a moderator asked a question :
Who is the least - known American president ?
The question itself invited more questions .
Least known by whom ?
American historians ?
The general public ?
Nepalese monarchs ?
And , of course , if the least - known president is well known enough to be the answer of a trivia question , how little known could he be ?
It was a conundrum .
The answer the questioner was looking for was Millard Fillmore .
But Fillmore , even then , was better known than probably a half - dozen U.S. presidents .
The great journalist H.L. Mencken had seized on Fillmore 's semi-anonymous mediocrity to give him credit for having installed the first White House bathtub " “ a canard that , more than 80 years after Mencken invented it , is still considered the highlight of the Fillmore administration .
But if any president should have the title " least known , "  it should be Chester Alan Arthur ( pictured ) , the 21st president , as an extremely informal 2007 Mother Jones survey observed .
Whether this survey is accurate or not " “ on a different day with a different polling pool , the conclusion could have favored Zachary Taylor , Benjamin Harrison or even the beloved Franklin Pierce , described by a recent biographer as ( yes ) " the nation 's least - known president "  " “ the results make more sense .
For Chester Alan Arthur , a man with some stunning muttonchop whiskers , may truly be the most anonymous man ever to hold the United States ' highest office .
Consider his unlikely career .
Most presidents rise to the office through military fame ( Andrew Jackson , Ulysses S. Grant , Dwight Eisenhower ) , Cabinet distinction ( John Quincy Adams , Herbert Hoover ) or previous election to high office ( most everyone else ) .
Prior to his election as vice - president , Arthur was " ¦ the former Collector of the Port of New York .
Indeed , at the time he was nominated , he had returned to practicing law , as he'd been forced out of the Collector 's position by President Rutherford B. Hayes in an attempt at reform .
( In Arthur 's defense , he apparently ran the Customs House more honorably than his often corrupt predecessors . )
He was selected as the vice - presidential nominee during a particularly bitter Republican convention .
The party was divided between three groups : the Stalwarts , the Half - Breeds and the Reformers .
The Stalwarts were in favor of the post - Civil War Republican hard line and led by Roscoe Conkling , the New York senator and Republican kingmaker with the unbelievably perfect politician 's name .
The Half - Breeds were the less - radical followers of presidential candidate and senator James G. " The Plumed Knight , "  " The Man from Maine "  Blaine .
The Reformers were in favor of ending the spoils system then in force " “ a system favored by the Stalwarts and the Half - Breeds .
Oh , and Conkling and Blaine did n't like each other .
The convention went to 36 ballots before finally picking James A. Garfield " “ who started the convention as the campaign manager for another candidate -- as its presidential standard - bearer .
After Garfield 's selection , party regulars offered the vice - presidential nomination to Arthur , largely because he was Conkling 's right - hand man .
Conkling actually urged Arthur to decline the nomination " as you would a red - hot shoe from the forge , "  since he thought Garfield was a sure loser , but Arthur was adamant : " This is a higher honor than I have ever dreamt of attaining .
I shall accept ! " 
So , who was this mysterious man with the three first names ?
Chester Alan Arthur was born in Fairfield , Vermont , on October 5 , 1829 , the son of a preacher man .
( Sources are not entirely clear on his birth ; he may have been born in 1830 , and he may have been born in Canada , but that 's a discussion for another time . )
He grew up in Perry , New York , and graduated from that Schenectady 's Union College in 1848 .
After a few years as a school principal , he earned his law degree and moved to New York City .
Among his cases was a lawsuit that ended desegregation of public transit in New York .
During the Civil War , he was quartermaster of the State of New York , and after another stint practicing law , President Grant " “ who Arthur had supported strongly in 1868 -- appointed him Collector in 1871 , a position Arthur held for seven years .
Despite Arthur 's bona fides , he was viewed as Conkling 's man .
Garfield did n't think much of his running mate .
( Apparently , neither did the news media of the time ; The New York Times said Arthur was " about the last man who would be considered eligible " for the presidency . )
However , Arthur " “ or , more precisely , Conkling " “ may have made a difference in November , as Garfield won the presidency by less than 10,000 votes in the popular count , and 214 to 155 in the Electoral College .
Had New York gone Democratic " “ it favored Garfield by just 20,000 votes -- we'd be talking about the administration of Winfield Scott Hancock .
Garfield was inaugurated on March 4 , 1881 .
He spent his first months in office trying to find a middle ground between the Republican forces that had helped put him there .
( Among his moves : naming Blaine Secretary of State . )
And then , tragedy .
Or , if your name was Chester Alan Arthur , opportunity .
Garfield 's first months in office turned out to be his only months in office .
On July 2 , 1881 , only four months after beginning his term , he was shot by the most famous disgruntled office - seeker in American history , Charles J. Guiteau .
Garfield died 10 weeks later , and Arthur was sworn in as president on September 20 , 1881 .
He was 51 years old .
Legend has it that a Republican friend , upon hearing the news , said , " Chet Arthur ?
President of the United States ?
Good God ! " 
[ Image courtesy of Slags House of Stats . ]
No doubt , Conkling thought he'd now control the presidency .
Moreover , Conkling 's opponents , the Half - Breeds , probably thought the same thing .
Instead , Arthur managed to rise above both factions , firing Garfield 's entire cabinet , including Blaine ( only secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln kept his job ) and coming out in favor of ending the spoils system , which he 'd previously supported .
In 1883 , Congress passed the Pendleton Act , which established the bipartisan Civil Service Commission .
Arthur was also key in helping to establish the modern American navy .
He did have his faults , however .
A dandy " “ he was known as both " the Gentleman Boss "  and " Elegant Arthur , "  which was saying something in Gilded Age America " “ he asked Louis Tiffany to redecorate the White House in the style to which he was accustomed , which resulted in previous generations of White House furniture being sold or destroyed .
( Arthur , a widower who had lost his wife in 1880 , requested Tiffany 's work himself ; it cost $ 30,000 , quite a sum in 1881 . )
He also signed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 , an anti-immigrant law that was n't repealed until World War II .
In general , however , Arthur was thought of highly .
Even the cynical Mark Twain observed , " It would be hard indeed to better President Arthur 's administration . " 
( He was n't joking . )
But the Republicans remained mistrustful , and though Arthur did n't campaign actively for the 1884 nomination " “ he was suffering from Bright 's Disease , a kidney ailment that would kill him two years later " “ the party nominated his old rival Blaine instead .
To this day , Arthur is the last sitting president pursuing re-election to be denied his party 's nomination .
Nevertheless , his place in American history is secure .
Perhaps the next time someone asks the name of the least - known president in American history , the answer wo n't be Chester Alan Arthur .
He 'll have earned far too much distinction for that .
One could do worse than the president with three first names .

Come back Monday for an extra special Chester A. Quiz .
The map allows users to manipulate turnout and voting patterns to predict the results of the 2008 election .
Using 2004 exit polls , the map establishes a baseline for demographic behavior .
Combining this information with data from the Census Bureau and other sources , users are also able to predict what would happen if turnout increased or decreased in these groups .
The Census does n't collect data for religion .
However , using a combination of data from Pew ( which recorded voting patterns from 2004 ) and the CUNY American Religious Identification Survey we can establish a similar snapshot .
2006 levels are based upon exit polls for House of Representatives voting .
There is one significant limitation to the map .
Each voter falls within multiple demographic groups ( gender , race , religion ) , but we do n't have enough data to link the results .
This allows the user to create paradoxical results ; like what would happen if 100 % of blacks voted for Democrats , but 100 % of men voted Republican ( what does that mean for black men ? ) .
This is not an ironclad data analysis application , but a tool meant to examine the effect these groups have on the electoral map .
McClatchy says that one inmate , Mohammed Akhtiar , was known as pro-American to everybody but the American soldiers who battered him .
Some of his militant fellow inmates spit on him , beat him and called him “ infidel , ” all because of his anti-Taliban record .
These abuses happened partly because , for several years after 9/11 , many of our national institutions did n’t do their jobs .
The Democratic Party rolled over rather than serving as loyal opposition .
We in the press were often lap dogs rather than watchdogs , and we let the public down .
Yet there were heroes , including civil liberties groups and lawyers for detainees .
Some judges bucked the mood , and a few conservatives inside the administration spoke out forcefully .
The Times ’s Eric Lichtblau writes in his terrific new book , “ Bush ’s Law , ” that the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner , James Ziglar , pushed back against plans for door - to - door sweeps of Arab - American neighborhoods .
The book recounts that in one meeting , Mr. Ziglar bluntly declared , “ We do have this thing called the Constitution , ” adding that such sweeps would be illegal and “ I ’m not going to be part of it . ”
Among those I admire most are the military lawyers who risked their careers , defied the Pentagon and antagonized their drinking buddies  all for the sake of Muslim terror suspects in circumstances where the evidence was often ambiguous .
At a time when we as a nation took the expedient path , these military officers took the honorable one , and they deserve medals for their courage .
The Truth Commission investigating these issues ideally would be a non-partisan group heavily weighted with respected military and security officials , including generals , admirals and top intelligence figures .
Such backgrounds would give their findings credibility across the political spectrum  and I do n’t think they would pull punches .
The military and intelligence officials I know are as appalled by our abuses as any other group , in part because they realize that if our people waterboard , then our people will also be waterboarded .
Both Barack Obama and John McCain should commit to impaneling a Truth Commission early in the next administration .
This commission would issue a report to help us absorb the lessons of our failings , the better to avoid them during the next crisis .
As for what to do with Guantánamo itself , the best suggestion comes from an obscure medical journal , PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases .
It suggests that the prison camp would be an ideal research facility for tropical diseases that afflict so many of the world ’s people .
An excellent suggestion : the U.S. should close the prison and turn it into a research base to fight the diseases of global poverty , and maybe then we could eventually say the word “ Guantánamo ” without pangs of shame .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Big U.S. multinationals riding high on revenue from overseas operations may find that wave is about to break .
Workers pack shoes at a Nike factory in Tangerang in West Java province , Indonesia , August 2 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Crack Palinggi
For the past year , the stock market has rewarded those companies that have been able to offset subpar U.S. performance with stellar overseas profits .
But recently , that has not been enough to keep investors happy .
Nike 's NKE.N shares tumbled last week after reporting its quarterly earnings when investors focused on its U.S. weakness rather than strong international results by the world 's largest shoe and apparel maker .
So why the shift in focus ?
The multinational play was based on a combination of strong global growth and a weak U.S. dollar .
But now with Europe slowing sharply , a cyclical economic slowdown in emerging markets and inflation rearing its head across the world economy , continued strong global demand is anything but certain .
“ Disappointing guidance from U.S. multinationals regarding global earnings could be the next shoe to drop on the U.S. equity markets , ” Joseph Quinlan , chief market strategist of global wealth and investment management at Bank of America , wrote in a note to clients .
“ While there remains an investor bias toward large - cap U.S. equities , this asset class could be in for some difficult times ahead if the global economic slowdown ... gathers pace in the second half of this year , ” he added .
Earnings estimates for the S&P 500 are already falling fast .
For the second quarter , analysts polled by Thomson Reuters now expect earnings to fall by 11.1 percent -- compared with expectations of a fall of 2 percent at the beginning of April .
The biggest contributor to that drop in earnings expectations are financials and consumer discretionaries .
But analysts are also beginning to scale back expectations for some of the sectors which have been doing relatively well .
Earnings growth expectations for industrial companies have been cut nearly in half -- to 5 percent from 9 percent , according to Thomson Reuters data .
Technology sector profit growth estimates have slipped to 17 percent , from an April estimate of 18 percent growth .
While U.S. domestic profits declined 3 percent in 2007 , overseas earnings rose 17 percent , making up the only real strength in corporate profits over the past year , said Bank of America ’s Quinlan .
GLOBAL ECONOMY SLOWS
But that may be about to change .
The global economy only expanded by a 3 percent annual rate in the first half of 2008 compared to a 5 percent rate a year ago , according to Bank of America .
U.S. foreign affiliate income , a proxy for global earnings , declined 4.5 percent year - over - year in the first quarter , the bank ’s data showed .
This deceleration in growth will ultimately take some wind out of the sails for U.S. global earnings , Quinlan wrote .
This view is beginning to be echoed across U.S. equity markets .
“ International business trends may no longer provide an incremental benefit , ” said Tobias Levkovich , Citigroup ’s chief U.S. equity strategist .
“ Weakening trends in Europe likely will weigh on profits earned abroad which had been a key area of strength over the last six to nine months , with clear problems also increasing in some developing countries , such as Turkey and Vietnam , ” Levkovich said .
But that does not mean that one should throw the global earnings story out with the bathwater , said Subodh Kumar , chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates .
The companies that have been benefiting from global earnings are often also bigger and “ best in class ” companies , and therefore more likely to weather economic storms than their smaller competitors .
Aside from Nike , package delivery services Federal Express FDX.N and United Parcel Service UPS.N -- both with hefty overseas exposure -- warned on profits due to soaring fuel prices .
Many analysts expect more earnings revisions to come .
Citi ’s Levkovich said earnings revisions look risky for capital goods and tech hardware & equipment , based on the view that capital expenditure trends are likely to slow .
Earnings estimates for areas within the industrial and technology sectors “ look excessive , ” he said .
Lightweight GNOME alternative emerges Aug. 06 , 2008
A fast , fast - booting , implementation of GNOME aimed at netbooks and older hardware has emerged , and shows " a lot of promise . "
LXDE has already stacked up a heap of distribution partners .
( Click for larger view of main LXDE desktop )
Spread the word :
digg this story The LXDE project has released its lightweight Linux desktop for general use .
Built into the latest gOS 3 Gadget distro , LXDE is touted as being fast , fast - booting , compatible with old computers , and designed so that " every component can be used without LXDE , " say the developers .
The GTK + 2 - based LXDE ( Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment ) first emerged in late 2006 when two Taiwanese Linux distributions adopted an early version .
First came B2D Linux , which apparently no longer uses LXDE , and then came the Ubuntu - based PUD GNU / Linux , which does .
Since then , the group , which appears to also be based in Taiwan , has been pretty quiet , but behind the scenes , they have been racking up bundling deals with a number of small Linux distributions that use all or parts of the LXDE code .
LXDE was catapulted into the spotlight in the latest gOS release , announced this week at LinuxWorld .
gOS 3 Gadget swapped out Enlightenment E17 in favor of the LXDE desktop .
It is not clear that the release will see commercial use , as LXDE is a young project that is not yet complete .
However , gOS Founder David Liu said he believes the project has " a lot of promise , " describing it as a " scaled - down version of GNOME . "

Explains a LXDE web page : " We do n't tightly integrate every component .
Instead , we tried to make all components independent , and each of them can be used independently with few dependencies . "

Children with autism struggle to communicate with those around them Caring for children with developmental problems such as autism or Down 's syndrome can weaken parents ' immune systems , research suggests .
Researchers at Birmingham University found they had a poorer immune response to a vaccine against pneumonia .
It appears that stress causes the immune system to function less efficiently , the team wrote in the journal Brain , Behavior , and Immunity .
Charities called for better support for parents struggling to cope .
Previous work has shown negative effects in elderly people caring for a spouse - but this is the first time that a similar result has been seen in a younger , healthier group providing round - the - clock care , the researchers pointed out .
This is a good indication that their immune systems are not functioning efficiently
Stephen Gallagher , study leader A total of 60 parents received the pneumococcal vaccine as part of the study - half of whom had children with developmental disabilities .
Blood tests showed that those caring for a child with developmental disability had lower levels of antibodies to the vaccine than those whose children did not have such difficulties .
After one month , 20 % of parents providing long - term care had an ineffective immune response , compared to 4 % of the control group .
At six months this had risen to 48 % while the levels in the control group remained the same .
Stress Study leader Stephen Gallagher said low levels of antibodies suggested parents ' ability to fight infection was weaker : " This is a good indication that their immune systems are not functioning efficiently . "
Stress was likely to be responsible for the immune deficiency , he added .
" These parents are sometimes extremely stressed and what they need is appropriate help and training . "
Co-author Dr Anna Phillips said parents caring for these children are " incredibly dedicated " and not in a position to take time off .
" However , knowing the effects that providing round - the - clock care can have on their health may help raise awareness that these parents need help to manage their burden of care . "
She said the parents should be added to the list of vulnerable groups eligible for vaccinations such as the flu jab .
" We are continuing this work by looking at how sleep patterns affect the rates of infection in these parents , " she added .
Amanda Batten , head of policy and campaigns at the National Autistic Society , said : " Carers often display great strength and resilience whilst coping with this complex disability , but many receive very little help and support , and are under considerable stress as a result .
" It is imperative that carers are given access to services such as short break schemes to help them before they reach a crisis point . "
Carol Boys , chief executive of the Down 's Syndrome Association , added that caring for a child with Down 's syndrome can be very rewarding but for some families it can be an extremely stressful experience .
" I am not surprised at the results of this study .
It just confirms what we already suspected might be one of the consequences of the constant stress that families have to endure . "

Bush to relax protected species rules The Associated Press
Published : Monday August 11 , 2008
Print This Email This By DINA CAPPIELLO WASHINGTON  Parts of the Endangered Species Act may soon be extinct .
The Bush administration wants federal agencies to decide for themselves whether highways , dams , mines and other construction projects might harm endangered animals and plants .
New regulations , which do n't require the approval of Congress , would reduce the mandatory , independent reviews government scientists have been performing for 35 years , according to a draft obtained by The Associated Press .
The draft rules also would bar federal agencies from assessing the emissions from projects that contribute to global warming and its effect on species and habitats .
If approved , the changes would represent the biggest overhaul of the Endangered Species Act since 1988 .
They would accomplish through regulations what conservative Republicans have been unable to achieve in Congress : ending some environmental reviews that developers and other federal agencies blame for delays and cost increases on many projects .
The changes would apply to any project a federal agency would fund , build or authorize .
Government wildlife experts currently perform tens of thousands of such reviews each year .
" If adopted , these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish , wildlife and plants for the past 35 years , " said John Kostyack , executive director of the National Wildlife Federation 's Wildlife Conservation and Global Warming initiative .
Under current law , federal agencies must consult with experts at the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to determine whether a project is likely to jeopardize any endangered species or to damage habitat , even if no harm seems likely .
This initial review usually results in accommodations that better protect the 1,353 animals and plants in the U.S. listed as threatened or endangered and determines whether a more formal analysis is warranted .
The Interior Department said such consultations are no longer necessary because federal agencies have developed expertise to review their own construction and development projects , according to the 30 - page draft obtained by the AP .
" We believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations , " the proposal said .
The director of the Fish and Wildlife Service , H. Dale Hall , in an interview with the AP Monday , said the changes will help focus expertise on projects that have serious repercussions for species .
" We are trying to be more efficient , which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species , " Hall said .
A National Marine Fisheries Service spokeswoman declined Monday to discuss the draft proposal since it had yet to be published .
The new rules are expected to be proposed formally in coming weeks .
They would be subject to a 60 - day public comment period before being finalized by the Interior Department , giving the administration enough time to impose them before November 's presidential election .
A new administration could freeze any pending regulations or reverse them , a process that could take months .
Congress could also overturn the rules through legislation , but that could take even longer .
The proposal was drafted largely by attorneys in the general counsel 's offices of the Commerce Department 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department , according to an official with the National Marine Fisheries Service , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan had n't yet been circulated publicly .
The two agencies ' experts were not consulted until last week , the official said .
Between 1998 and 2002 , the Fish and Wildlife Service conducted 300,000 consultations .
The National Marine Fisheries Service , which evaluates projects affecting marine species , conducts about 1,300 reviews each year .
The reviews have helped safeguard protected species such as bald eagles , Florida panthers and whooping cranes .
A federal government handbook from 1998 described the consultations as " some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species . "
In recent years , however , some federal agencies and private developers have complained that the process results in delays and increased construction costs .
" We have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process , " said Joe Nelson , a lawyer for the National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition , a trade group for home builders and the paper and farming industry .
Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee , called the proposed changes illegal .
" This proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door , " she said .
" If this proposed regulation had been in place , it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle , the grizzly bear and the gray whale . "
The Bush administration and Congress have attempted with mixed success to change the law .
In 2003 , the administration imposed similar rules that would have allowed agencies to approve new pesticides and projects to reduce wildfire risks without asking the opinion of government scientists about whether threatened or endangered species and habitats might be affected .
The pesticide rule was later overturned in court .
The Interior Department , along with the Forest Service , is currently being sued over the rule governing wildfire prevention .
In 2005 , the House passed a bill that would have made similar changes to the Endangered Species Act , but the bill died in the Senate .
The sponsor of that bill , then - House Resources chairman Richard Pombo , R - Calif. , told the AP Monday that allowing agencies to judge for themselves the effects of a project will not harm species or habitat .
" There is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision , " he said .
But internal reviews by the National Marine Fisheries Service and Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that about half the unilateral evaluations by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management that determined wildfire prevention projects were unlikely to harm protected species were not legally or scientifically valid .
Those had been permitted under the 2003 rule changes .
" This is the fox guarding the hen house .
The interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests , " said Eric Glitzenstein , the attorney representing environmental groups in the lawsuit over the wildfire prevention regulations .
" What they are talking about doing is eviscerating the Endangered Species Act . "
THE MISTAKE DEPARTMENT
One Example of Why American Foreign Policy is a Disaster
by
J. Michael Springmann
After airplanes flew into the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon , The Los Angeles Times reported that 15 of the 19 alleged hijackers got their U.S. visas from the American Consulate General at Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , a consulate where I had served as chief of the Visa Section .
What The Los Angeles Times did not report was what I had told their Washington , D.C. bureau after reading the story : ( 1 ) that the Jeddah Consulate was not a State Department post but an intelligence services operation ; ( 2 ) that the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) routinely demanded ( and got ) visas for sleazy characters with no ties to either their home country or Saudi Arabia ; ( 3 ) that these vile people were terrorists recruited by U.S. intelligence officers along with Osama bin Laden , then a CIA asset .
With the help of non-State Department officials , i.e. , Consul General , Jay Philip Freres ( retired and living in Clearwater , Fla. ) , the head of the Political / Economic Section , Eric L. Qualkenbush ( retired and living in Findlay , Ohio ) , the Political Officer , Henry Ensher ( currently assigned to D.C. and living in McLean , Va. ) , a Commercial Officer , Paul Arvid Tveit ( retired and also living in McLean , Va. ) , the Chief of the Consular Section , Justice ( given name ) Stevens ( whereabouts unknown ) , and a " part - time " Consular officer , Andy Weber ( last seen on the PBS program " Bio - Terror " ) , they were sent to America for training in blowing things up and shooting things down .
Afterwards , they were sent on to Afghanistan to murder Soviet soldiers .
It seems pretty clear that they and people that they had trained are now pursuing their own goals ( and most likely U.S. foreign policy interests ) in helping destabilize Lebanon , Iraq , and Afghanistan .
Their next target may be Iran .
Having been Commercial Attaché at the American Embassy in New Delhi , India ( a post with a goodly number of CIA and National Security Agency , NSA , staff ) and twice in Stuttgart , Germany , a Consulate with successive Consuls General sent out by the intelligence services , Douglas Jones and Day Olin Mount ( both now retired , whereabouts unknown ) , I was still flabbergasted at the blatant disregard ( and wholehearted contempt ) for the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Foreign Affairs Manual ( the State Department 's Holy Book governing , inter alia , visa issuance ) .
And it was n't until I was fired for questioning these spurious visa practices that I learned what was really going on and how the system worked -- to America 's detriment .
Despite being given ample notice , I still did not , in fact , could not , see the coming disaster -- because I trusted my government .
Consider :
-- My predecessor at Jeddah ( Greta C. Holtz , now assigned to Washington ) simply did not answer my letters asking about the situation at the Consulate , later telling me that she was " too upset " to respond .
( Once there , I learned that she had been repeatedly threatened with losing her job over visa refusals , but , later , was apparently " wised - up " about the situation since she then stopped her complaining . )
-- The then - American Ambassador to Saudi Arabia , Walter Cutler ( who went on to head the Meridian International Center in Washington , D.C. for 17 years , promoting U.S. ties with Iran ) , spent 45 minutes with me before I left the U.S.
In the meeting , he told me about all the problems my predecessor had caused him in refusing visas to unqualified people .
When I asked the State Department Desk Officer for Saudi Arabia about this , he replied that he did n't know , " Cutler was just a queer duck " .
-- Again , while still in D.C. , I had a chance conversation with a staff member ( Ellen Goff ) at the Executive Office of the - then Bureau for Near East / South Asia , learning that there were serious but unspecified problems connected with visa issuances at Jeddah .
But , when I said " fraud " to people charge with investigating it , I was told I had a personality conflict .
And I became unemployed .
There you have it .
The United States of America , whose diplomatic posts are too often outposts of the CIA and NSA , was running ( and , from what I can see ) is likely still running a visas for terrorists program , while blaming the rest of the world for causing disasters of its own making .
According to a former CIA Station Chief and a member of State 's Inspector General 's office , both of whom I wish to protect , at least one - third of the people who claim to work for the Department of State in reality work for one of the many U.S. intelligence agencies .
In my limited experience , I would be inclined to raise that proportion which , I am inclined to believe , is increasing .
( In Jeddah , all but three of the 20 or so U.S. staff worked for intelligence offices . )
Despite my best efforts , no other agency of the United States government ever wanted to deal with this matter .
My Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit about the reasons for my dismissal was sealed ( and shut down ) as a threat to national security .
The Government Accountability Office took no interest in what I told them about the issue .
The FBI ignored my calls , even the ones after September 11 , 2001 .
Congress then and later also took an ostrich's view of my charges with a staffer on the House Foreign Affairs Committee once telling me that we needed the CIA .

Trivia
The story for this film came about from several conversations during production of Der dunkle Kristall ( 1982 ) between Jim Henson David Odell and ' Brian Froud ' about a possible sequel .
When the original film proved only a modest success in theaters , Henson drifted from the idea of producing a follow - up .
Years later , when the original proved a huge success on DVD and generated a large cult following , Henson and Froud 's notes were re-discovered , and The Henson Company decided to move ahead with a sequel .

Washington Manipulation of GDP Data to Hide Recessions
I continue where I left off – discussing just a few of the ways Washington tries to fool us by its misuse and manipulation of data .
Washington likes to remind critics that Americans enjoy the highest living standard in the world .
As evidence of this , government “ experts ” discuss statistics such as GDP growth , employment , wealth , income and wage growth , and other economic data without defining exactly what they are referring to or explaining all the assumptions used .
In Part 1 of this series , we saw how hedonics can alter GDP and inflation data .
Here we look at some additional problems with GDP .
After you read this piece , I hope you will agree that the misuse of GDP data as an indicator of economic strength has been one of the biggest errors made in the field of U.S. economics .
I can make a strong case that over the past three years there has been virtually no GDP growth other than maybe three quarters .
After adjusting for hedonics , the use of debt and the other gimmicks , it 's clear the U.S. economy has grown little since 2005 .
Sound crazy ?
Sure it does – but only if you 've accepted the data from Washington at face value , as the media always does .
But this grand illusion cannot remain hidden much longer .
Already , we are seeing just some of the effects of Washington 's deception – the real estate meltdown and banking crisis .
Bernanke is trying to wipe it all under the table by passing out over $ 1.2 trillion to the banking system , with much more to come .
This has caused the further devaluation of the dollar and soaring oil prices .
But the real effects still linger in the background , waiting to surface .
When , I cannot say for certain , but I will guarantee you they will surface .
Soon , the junk bond market will overshadow all other worries .
And this could easily lead to a huge problem for the $ 40 trillion global credit default swaps market .
Since the stock market fallout in early 2000 , Washington has been desperate to keep consumers spending at any cost .
They like the fact that consumers are spending , even if it has been for imported goods and even though these purchases have been made using credit .
As far as they 're concerned , strong consumer activity keeps GDP numbers high , pointing to the illusion of economic growth .
After the Internet meltdown , Greenspan smashed rates down to 1 % because consumers had no real money to spend .
But even that was n't enough , so Bush issued rebate checks hoping consumers would head for the stores to buy more of what they really did n't need – more electronic gadgets and other imports .
In 2008 , Bush issued an even larger rebate for consumers to inflate GDP .
Now there is talk from Congress of another rebate check .
These irresponsible actions by the Fed and Washington are creating more damaging consequences in exchange for superficial , short - term gains .
Americans need good jobs and affordable basic necessities – food , energy , and healthcare .
A few hundred dollars passed out by Bush is n't going to do much .
It wo n't even pay for the increases in gasoline costs consumers have faced in 2008 .
What it will do however , is precisely what Bush intended it to do – boost GDP data so economists can claim that there is no recession .
Never mind this money has to be borrowed .
It 's all a game of numbers to Washington .
Many politicians ( mostly republicans , including Bush ) extinguish any criticisms of large federal and trade deficits , insisting they have no real meaning .
Rather than point to deficits as an indicator of economic vulnerability , many of our elected officials highlight GDP as a direct measure of economic growth and thus living standards .
These misguided souls believe debt ( and therefore deficits ) is good for the economy because it helps add to GDP growth .
In reality , the massive trade deficits created under the Bush administration have been responsible for the acquisition of critical U.S. assets by China and the Middle East .
Meanwhile , the U.S. economy remains highly leveraged and now faces a situation whereby its creditors may soon refuse to hold onto U.S. Treasuries due to their rapidly diminishing value and credit quality .
The gross domestic product is a measure of the value of all goods and services produced in the national economy available for consumption .
But GDP numbers say nothing about the source of consumption , whether it 's from cash on hand or mounting debt .
As well , GDP numbers include government spending , such as that for Katrina and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It does n't take a genius to realize that these expenditures have n't led to better living standards for most .
Just ask victims of Katrina if their living standards have improved .
And how can anyone claim that spending up to $ 2.4 trillion ( over the next few years ) in Iraq to blow up buildings and rebuild them will improve the living standards of Americans ?
Even worse , this is money that is added to America 's ballooning record debt .
Meanwhile , America 's own infrastructure continues to be neglected – bridges and highways have collapsed , underground water pipes have broken , drinking water is toxic and contains , among other things , numerous pharmaceutical drugs , from sex hormones to anti-depressants .
Even Washington 's U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has estimated it will take at least $ 2 trillion to restore America 's infrastructure to “ good condition . ”
Other groups have stated these estimates to be much higher .
Of course , if America does receive these needed funds , they will count toward the GDP data , although living conditions will only be restored , not improved .
Besides the loose assumptions of GDP , the methods of calculation are also flawed .
For instance , the nominal GDP is deflated using a chain - type inflation metric which significantly understates the real inflation rate .
This leads to inflated GDP data .
And of course Washington fails to adjust GDP growth to the annual population increase , which once again results in a higher GDP .
Finally , GDP can be calculated using constant or current dollars ; the former does n't consider the effects of inflation while the later does .
When making comparisons of GDP data over time , investors should only use constant dollar GDP data .
Unfortunately , when GDP data is plastered throughout the media , rarely is the source of this calculation been mentioned , leaving investors to assume constant dollar GDP data has been reported , adjustments for population growth have been made , and realistic adjustments for inflation are included .

Problems Measuring Living Standards
The importance of GDP as an economic indicator is reflected by its frequent use as a measure of living standards within an economy or nation .
However , there are many weaknesses in the use of GDP as a measure of a nation 's living standard .
In short , GDP only provides an overall measure of economic output of a given nation , but speaks nothing of individual living standards or the overall well - being of a population .
As an example , consider that a nation which exports 100 percent of its production ( Iraq for instance , due to oil exports ) might have a high GDP but not necessarily a high standard of living .
As it turns out , many other factors are involved in determination of living standards , such as employment and wage data , inflation , interest rates , currency exchange rates , debt levels , fiscal and monetary policy , and government benefits .
Finally , quality of life ( which is a significant component of living standards ) is determined by other factors unrelated to finances such as life span , work week , minimum required vacation days , social factors , and many other variables .
The counterargument is that while GDP may not provide an accurate measure of living standards , trends in living conditions tend to move in the direction of changing GDP data .
While that may be true over a long time frame , in my opinion that cannot be said necessarily for less than a five - year period .
Yet , when GDP figures are released each quarter , the stock and bond markets react as if this number has provided an accurate picture of the economy .
In reality , this is rarely the case .
And when Washington wants to assure consumers that the economy is strong , officials remind us that the U.S. has the world 's largest GDP , and thus highest living standards .
What they fail to mention however , is that the methods used to calculate GDP are flawed .
As well , the productivity gains have not been equally distributed to all Americans .
If in fact GDP data serves as an accurate measure of improvement in living standards , it only applies to the top 10 % of wage earners .
Failure to Account for Deficits
Because consumer spending accounts for about 66 percent of the GDP , and since the majority of goods purchased in the U.S. are produced overseas in full or in part , GDP growth indicates the extent of exportation of America 's asset base when it 's running large annual deficits .
In order to better understand this rationale , recall that each federal budget deficit is added to the national debt , which is financed by selling U.S. Treasury securities .
Foreign nations have financed 50 percent of this debt , so America has been trading ownership rights for imported goods .
Thus , even if GDP data indicates net productivity , this data does not factor in the deficit incurred as a result of government spending or the trade imbalance — all of which adds to the national debt and decreases America 's net worth or wealth .
As well , consider that the annual deficits have been financed by foreign nations to the tune of 99 percent in 2004 , and by 81 percent between 2003 and 2005 .
If you were selling your goods and services to a customer who could n't afford to pay using cash , would n't you extend them credit ?
Sure you would ; you 'd benefit two - fold in receiving profits from sales and financing charges .
But there 's credit risk involved based upon the debtor 's ability to repay the principal with interest .
Along with the weak dollar , the increased credit risk of U.S. Treasuries threatens to increase the global push for dethroning the dollar as the universal currency .
For many years , America has maintained the highest credit status in the world .
Its high standing as a debtor is directly tied to its perceived ability to repay debt obligations .
But if the dollar loses its position as the universal currency , this perceived repayment ability would falter , causing foreign holders to dump dollar - denominated assets .
And U.S. Treasury securities would be the first to go .
This would easily trigger a global catastrophe .
Understand that most nations already want out of the weak dollar .
If one or more large holders of U.S. Treasury securities begin to sell , such as China , this could cause other nations to do the same in anticipation of a price drop .
Thus , what might have been intended as a benign and gradual liquidation of U.S. debt by one nation could snowball into a collapse quickly .
Many point to America 's annual 5.0 percent GDP growth rate over the past decade as a sign of its continued stability and economic dominance .
During that same time period , America 's trade deficit has grown by over 25 percent per year , household debt as a percentage of disposable income has doubled , and household savings has declined by 75 percent .
What does that tell you ?
To me it says America 's “ growth ” has been fueled by credit spending that 's been grossly disproportionate to this “ growth . ”
Credit spending is certainly no indicator of wealth , but lack thereof .
America has been consuming much more than it produces for three decades .
Early on , this excess consumption was buffered by the enormous wealth surplus generated after WWII .
But now America 's dangerous consumption trends from the past 15 years have surfaced due to the depletion of its post - war wealth .
As a result , it faces a huge debt burden financed largely by foreign central banks and financial institutions .
In fact , America 's global competitors have been transformed into its bankers and suppliers , providing financing for its undisciplined government and consumer spending practices .
This chronic behavior has allowed foreign nations to gain more influence over America , both economically and politically .
And when they decide to no longer lend the U.S. government money , interest rates will skyrocket to double digits and the dollar will nose dive .
That 's right .
The real dollar crisis is ahead of us .
You might have noticed as of late , several nations are telling Washington how they should be running things - nations with a huge financial stake in the U.S. economy .
The U.S. is now dependent on these nations for economic sustenance .
Therefore , America can no longer push other nations around .
Failure to Account for Savings and Debt
Calculation of GDP also neglects to factor in the external effects of saving versus spending .
Japan 's case is particularly illustrative of this point .
The savings rate in Japan has been high ever since the NIKKEI collapsed nearly twenty years ago .
As a result , while the GDP is not as high if Japanese had spent more of what they earned , they are not slaves to debt .
As well , Japanese companies have been investing large amounts of capital overseas ( e.g. auto facilities , insurance and media in the U.S. ) resulting in a much lower GDP than one might expect .
In the case of America , decades of declining savings and increased debt burdens are not factored into GDP data .
But borrowed money falsely inflates this data .
Likewise , economies experiencing asset bubbles ( eg. real estate , credit , and the stock market ) tend to show higher GDP figures than in reality since consumption is higher than can be maintained over an extended period .
And during these asset bubbles the total credit bubble grows along with the GDP .
This is the current state of America .
In fact , it appears as if the Federal Reserve will continue creating bubbles as its only way to prop up GDP data .
But we all know what happens to bubbles .
They eventually burst .
A few years ago , we experienced unthinkable devastation as a result of Greenspan 's Internet bubble .
Today , we are seeing the early stages of the implosion of Greenspan 's real estate - driven credit bubble .
And since Bernanke refuses to let events run their normal course , we will no doubt experience a more catastrophic correction down the road as a result of his misuse of the printing presses .
Failure to Adjust for Net Output
Another shortcoming of GDP is that it measures output that produces no net change or productivity , such as that seen for reconstruction of New Orleans after hurricane Katrina .
While capital was pumped into the region to help restore living standards , no net improvement was made relative to before the disaster ( unless you count the estimated $ 1.5 billion stolen from FEMA by some ) .
Yet , GDP data assumes these expenditures resulted in improvements .
In fact , one could argue that living conditions are worse now .
I 'm sure those who have been exposed to the formaldehyde - laden mobile homes would agree .
GDP counts government spending at all levels , from the war in Iraq and hurricane Katrina to homeland security .
And despite President Bush 's enormous spending spree , tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have n't been this low in many years .
What does that tell you ?
The government has been borrowing money to pump up into the economy without registering commensurate returns .
If these investments had been successful , America would have net job and real wage growth , and a strong dollar which would provide affordable energy , utilities , and healthcare .
But we see a much different picture despite record federal and trade deficits , as well as record consumer and national debt .
The overall impact of these trends can be seen by the weakness of the dollar .
Thus , it 's easy to see that a nation that is increasing its debt can show healthy GDP numbers when in fact the picture is n't as rosy as reported .
This is especially true when credit spending has accounted for a large amount of the GDP growth , as in America 's case .
Therefore , when examining GDP data , one should investigate where and how the productivity occurred , whether there was net improvement to the majority of Americans , and what costs ( debt or deficit ) were incurred , rather than focusing on the magnitude of the number .
Failure to Account for Resource Depletion
Growth sustainability cannot be predicted by looking at GDP .
Upon initial examination it appears that some nations ( eg. in the Middle East ) are able to maintain high GDP numbers despite the lack of industrialization .
In the Middle East , productivity is almost exclusively dependent upon the amount of fossil fuels remaining as well as the cost and efficiency of crude production .
Since oil reserves are limited , some nations disregard environmental protection laws in favor of increasing production ( United States , China , Europe , and Canada ) .
However , in the long run huge expenses could be incurred for cleaning the environmental mess that was made decades earlier .
Accordingly , short - term gains in GDP are inflated since the economic activities that have led to GDP data have created future liabilities that have not been reflected in a nation 's financial statements .
In America 's case , the massive liabilities for mandatory expenditures ( the $ 51 to $ 72 trillion shortfall ) are not shown in its financial statements .
GDP data should be adjusted for estimates of contingent liabilities that may be incurred as a result of say , a nation 's disregard for maintaining a clean environment and government benefits that have been promised or guaranteed - similar to the practice required by all publicly traded corporations .
Failing to Adjust GDP for Real Inflation
How can Washington calculate GDP without proper adjustments for inflation ?
That is precisely what they do .
They select the most modest inflation measures ( chain - type inflation ) to adjust for the nominal GDP data .
Michael Pento lays out a very nice illustration of this in his recent article “ Getting Real with GDP . ”
Failure to Adjust for Annual Population Growth
Since GDP growth is a measure of productivity , and productivity is influenced by population growth , does n't it seem reasonable that GDP should be adjusted to the annual population growth rate ?
From 1990 to 2002 , the annual growth in the U.S. population was 1.2 % .
Since 2002 , it has slowed a bit down to around 1.0 to 1.1 % .
If we subtract this from the GDP data , the “ economic growth ” over the past few years does not appear to have been so robust .
And if more accurate measures of inflation were used to adjust nominal GDP , it paints a very worrisome picture .
Failure to Report Year - over - year Changes
When the Commerce Department reports GDP figures each quarter , the data is n't reported like a U.S. corporation .
When a corporation provides an earnings statement , it shows comparisons of revenue , earnings , etc. from the same quarter of the previous year ( called year - over - year reporting ) .
In contrast , the U.S. government reports changes in GDP relative to the previous quarter .
In addition , each quarterly GDP figure is annualized or multiplied by a factor of four , which implies this quarterly figure will continue over the next three quarters .
Why do corporations report year - over - year numbers but the U.S. government reports a rolling , highly inaccurate , annualized number ?
According to Washington , GDP can be used to compare living standards with other nations .
This would imply that all nations calculate GDP in a similar manner .
As far as I am aware , all other developed nations report GDP changes as year - over - year .
Why does this matter anyway ?
Consider that year - over - year numbers minimize the effects of business and economic cycles .
The fact is that all businesses ( and therefore government operations ) experience changes in business health and earnings due to seasonal or business cycle fluctuations inherent to their industry , the dynamics of the company , and the economic cycle .
Therefore , in order to minimize the effects of these variables , companies report the year - over - year changes .
For instance , let 's take a look at Mattel , a toy manufacturer that 's known to generate the majority of its revenues during the month of December .
Let 's assume the fourth quarter is responsible for 70 percent of the firm 's annual earnings ( an accurate assumption ) , while subsequent quarters contribute 10 percent equally to earnings .
If Mattel reported fourth quarter earnings like the U.S. government , it would appear as if its growth was exploding during the first quarter of earnings announcements .
In conclusion , because each quarterly GDP figure is extrapolated over 12 months , it 's virtually impossible to detect GDP trends accurately even if the numbers , when reported were accurate .
But as we shall see next , accurate reporting is rare .
GDP is Inaccurate for up to Five Years
If the previous considerations have n't been enough for you to question the accuracy of GDP data , you should keep in mind that Washington provides GDP revisions for up to five years after the data was first reported .
That 's why you often hear adjustments to GDP numbers long after they were first made public .
It 's also why the government often changes the dates of recessions several months and sometimes many years later .
While these adjustments might be a valuable exercise for historians , they do nothing to alert consumers and investors of the current and future expected economic environment .
There 's no way to consistently and accurately predict future growth trends using GDP data due to these inaccuracies .
Washington 's official definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth , as measured by GDP data .
As a recent example of the inaccuracy of GDP numbers , on July 30 , 2004 , the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) issued its revised GDP data for 2001 .
According to the definition of a recession , we now know that there was none during 2001 since the latest numbers do not show two consecutive quarters of declining GDP growth .
Looking back at that period , I leave it you to determine if the U.S. was in a recession .
So take note all you journalists out there , including the Associated Press - STOP referring to the “ recession of 2001 ” because according to the economic “ Gods ” you so highly worship , it DID NOT EXIST !
The reality is that we did indeed have a recession in 2001 ; a severe recession in my view .
As the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) points out , recessions can be defined by data other than looking at GDP .
A recession is defined by a decline in economic activity .
In many cases GDP says nothing of this , especially when much of the GDP has been due to a war , cash - back financings ( home equity loans and cash - back mortgages ) during a real estate bubble , and the overall increased economic activity fueled by this bubble .
In fact , according to the Federal Reserve , 40 % of the GDP growth during the 2005 - 2006 period came from cash - back financings from homes that were greatly overvalued .
This same “ follow the leader ” mentality by pundits and journalists has led them to believe that America is not in a recession as of July 2008 .
Anyone with a brain knows we are in a recession that most likely began in early 2008 .
But if we adhere to Washington 's very restricted definition of recession , it is possible that these economists missed numerous recessions in the past .
Relying solely on GDP data that is subject to revision for up to five years is too inaccurate to provide a reliable measure of economic activity .
But when you consider how poorly GDP data reflects real economic activity for consumers , it becomes even more dubious .
In conclusion , the basic rules of reasoning never change .
When one tries to paint an accurate picture of a complex variable such as the health of the economy or living standards by looking at one number , they 're fooling themselves and those they represent .
The best way to measure economic growth and changes in living standards is to examine other macroeconomic indicators in addition to GDP , such as interest rate ( yield curve ) and inflation trends ( the CPI and PPI , core and non-core ) , trade imbalances , currency exchange rate trends , job loss and recovery , underemployment , real wage and benefit growth , debt and money flow trends .
And if you do elect to use GDP as a measure of economic activity , at least measure it accurately and make the appropriate adjustments .
With thousands of economists working for the government or in academia serving on government committees or as consultants for government agencies , it seems strange they 're unwilling or unable to provide a comprehensive analysis of the economy based on other data .
Then again , the current system of illusion and confusion serves Washington just fine .
Most serve as parrots , mimicking the same lines they hear from myopic economists in their ivory towers .
Consumers do n't need economists to tell them what the data of the day means based upon flawed calculations .
They need economists to report realistic data .
Only then will they stand a chance to come up with accurate forecasts .
If they cannot achieve this then they are only serving as record - keepers at best and partners in deception at worst .
With all the forecasts economists make , I know of not a single one who has made a fortune in the stock market as a result of these “ timely and valuable ” forecasts .

Hey gabz2133 .
I read your comment and I 'd like to help you understand this better .
RFID is incapable of doing what you 're describing .
I 'll try to explain .
An RFID reader works by sending electronic energy at whatever object holds the RFID tag .
When the tag ' receives ' this energy , it provides power to the teeny tiny embedded microchip that holds the information .
If you look closely at images of RFID tags online , you 'll notice they look like spirals of metal strips .
This length of metal is used as an ' antenna ' of sorts for the energy I mentioned before .
If you were to peel apart a public transit pass , you would see an RFID tag embedded in it , and the reader on the turnstile works exactly how I described before .
Here 's the thing - RFID tags do n't hold very much information .
Almost all RFID tags sold today are pre-programmed at the factory , and can't be reprogrammed at all .
Often times they only hold numbers , about 16 characters in length .
Some security companies use tags for door access , and those tags will often have a mixture of letters and numbers programmed for that specific building or company .
It is possible to reprogram RFID tags , but it 's very rare indeed .
What does n't happen is the chip being reprogrammed and beaming to someone a great distance away .
If they were reading your thoughts , they would need a device that 's writing that information to the teeny tiny tag , and they would need a reader that 's very very close .
After they receive your thoughts , they would need to erase what 's on the tag and rewrite it , constantly .
That 's the work of a computer , not something the size of a grain of rice .
RFID is a very low - power technology and as such , you often can't get reliable readings at distances more than a foot or two , without having a reader that 's so big you would easily notice someone pointing it at you .
And even then , if they had a gigantic reader , it almost definitely would n't be able to read through walls .
There are lots of people who have chosen to have RFID tags implanted in them as science experiments or as part of their hobby in technology .
They 've uploaded videos of the process and I can safely say , it does n't look pain - free at all .
If someone put a tag inside you , you would absolutely notice an open wound in the area they implanted it .
There are also no RFID tags that contain a microphone , recording device , and transmitter .
Technology just has n't had the need to make that possible yet .
If you were hearing the people who did this , that would require yet another device to be tied into this whole system , a speaker that would broadcast the sound .
And if all of this is implanted inside your body , the sounds they would receive would be muffled noise , and you definitely could n't hear them from a microscopic speaker inside your skin .
The only way for this to even be conceivable is using technology that does n't exist .
There has never been anything invented that allows one person to hear or read the thoughts of another person .
We can measure activity of the brain , but all that tells us is you 're thinking hard or excited or aroused , not specific thoughts .
There has also never been an invention that forces thoughts into someone else 's mind .
All we have are our five sense which meet and mix in the brain .
If it is n't possible to do that , but you still hear someone else 's thoughts , it could be an indication of a health issue .
It could n't hurt to talk to your doctor about it and get her or his opinion .
If you are n't comfortable with that ( I hate going to the doctor , lol ) , you should mention it to a family member or someone you trust , just to see what they think .
I sure ca n't say I 'm the # 1 expert in the world , your family or friends might be able to explain it better than I can .
To summarize , what you 're describing does n't sound absurd .
It 's technologically impossible , but I do n't doubt your honesty for a second .
If you 'd like to find out for yourself if there is , in fact , an RFID tag inside you , you can always buy a reader online and scan every inch of your body .
You can easily find them for very little money on eBay .
If you like the idea of being sure there is n't anything in your home taking your picture or listening to you , look into buying a ' bug detector ' .
Spies use them all the time for that exact reason .
If you have any questions that you think I could answer , please feel free to contact me and we can talk .
I hope my comment helps ease your mind a little .
Students for a Free Tibet tells Boing Boing they learned of Graffitti Research Lab founder James Powderly 's detention by Chinese authorities in Beijing via a Twitter direct message that read " held since 3 am . "
I just spoke to the SFT representative who has been Powderly 's closest contact , and this person says Powderly has now been held for more than 19 hours with no further word .
So far there 's no acknowledgment from officials in Beijing that Powderly is being held .
Here 's SFT 's announcement about the L.A.S.E.R. Stencil art protest project Powderly was planning — he was also writing an " instructable " about it yesterday :
Internationally known artist , technologist and co-founder of the Graffiti Research Lab , James Powderly , was detained in Beijing early this morning while preparing to debut a new work and technology of protest , the L.A.S.E.R. Stencil .
According to a " twitter " message received today by Students for a Free Tibet at approximately 5 pm Beijing Standard Time , Powderly had been detained by Chinese authorities at 3 am .
His current whereabouts remain unknown .
" James is a unique voice in the world , who lives and breathes art and technology for the purpose of promoting and enabling freedom of expression for all , " said Nathan Dorjee , Director of Technology for Students for a Free Tibet .
" His trip to Beijing , in support of the Tibetan people and all people around the world whose voices have been silenced by their governments , is a small piece of his portfolio as an artist who wo n't back down in the face of authority . "
The work , " The Green Chinese Lantern , " uses a 400 milliwatt handheld green laser with micro-stencils to beam simple messages and images up to three stories high on surfaces such as billboards , buildings , and bridges .
The Laser Stencil technology was developed in conjunction with Students for a Free Tibet .
Powderly 's direct experience with censorship by Chinese authorities furthered his commitment to highlighting the Tibetan cause during the Beijing Games , in partnership with the efforts of Students for a Free Tibet .
Powderly and other members of the Graffiti Research Lab were dis-invited from Synthetic Times , a new media art exhibition at Beijing 's National Media Art Museum of China , due to their uncompromising stance on freedom of expression .
Students for a Free Tibet has staged six protests in Beijing over the last two weeks , placing the issue of Tibet 's occupation front and centre as China hosts the Olympic Games .
The protests have included a dramatic banner hang near the Bird 's Nest Stadium ; a display of Tibetan flags near the Bird's Nest just before the opening ceremony began ; a symbolic die - in at Tiananmen Square ; a protest by a Tibetan woman with flags outside Tiananmen Square ; a blockade of the Chinese Ethnic Culture Park ; and " Free Tibet " banner hang outside the CCTV headquarters .
Thirty - seven members and supporters have been detained and deported , not including those detained today .
More on the story at SFT 's website .
More about GRL's LASER stencil here .
Here 's a statement from Powderly :
James is proud to have been kicked out of the Synthetic Times new media art exhibition in Beijing because he would n't censor his little art project .
James wonders why organizations like the MoMA , Parsons , Eyebeam , Ars Electronica and many other arts and cultural institutions around the world who claim to support free speech and expression would participate in a show like this .
But they did !
It was after being kicked to the curb by the show 's curator that James connected with Students for a Free Tibet and decided he would go to China anyway and do what he though was right in support of Tibet , Taiwan , free speech and the people of China .
James lives , if indeed he is alive , in the County of Kings , Brooklyn , and teaches at the Communication Design and Technology program at Parsons the New School for Design .
I am James Powderly and I approve of this message .
Previously : Boing Boing tv – Graffiti Research Lab , the movie
I thought it would be a good idea to write a sample application in wxPython to show how to put all the pieces together and make something useful .
At my day job , I created a little program to send emails because we had a lot of users that missed the mailto functionality that we lost when we switched from Exchange / Outlook to Zimbra .
It should be noted that this is a Windows only application currently , but it should n’t be too hard to make it more OS - agnostic .
I ’ll split this article into three pieces :
First is creating the interface ; second is setting up the data handling and third will be creating a Windows executable and connecting it to the mailto handler .
When we ’re done , the GUI will look something like this :
To follow along , you ’ll need the following :
Creating the Interface
Let ’s go over the code below .
As you can see , I am basing this application on the wx .
Frame object and an instance of wx .
PySimpleApp to make the application run .
import os import sys import urllib import wx import mail_ico class SendMailWx ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx .Frame.__init__(self , None , - 1 , ' New Email Message ( Plain Text ) ' , size = ( 600,400 ) ) self .

Show ( ) app.MainLoop ( )
I ’ve already explained how to create toolbars , menus and sizers in previous posts , so I ’m going to focus on the new stuff here .
I import the urllib module to help in parsing the data sent from the mailto link on a web page .
I currently support the To , Subject and Body fields of the mailto protocol .
The respective textboxes are set depending on the number of sections that are passed into the parseURL ( ) method .
You could easily extend this is need be .
I also grab the directory where the script is running from by using this line of code :
self.currentDir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[ 0 ] ) )
Finally , there are three event handler stubs : “ onAttach ” , “ onAttachEdit ” , and “ onSend ” .
Let ’s go ahead and flesh these out a bit .
Attaching an Email
The first method , onAttach ( ) , allows the user to attach files to their email message .
I use the wx .
FileDialog to get the user ’s choice .
Here is where the “ filepaths ” property comes in .
I also call the new method , getFileSize , which will calculate the file ’s size .
See the code below :
def onAttach ( self , event ) : ''' Displays a File Dialog to allow the user to choose a file and then attach it to the email . ''' attachments = self.attachTxt.GetLabel( ) filepath = '' # create a file dialog wildcard =
" All files ( *.* ) |*.* " dialog = wx .FileDialog ( None , ' Choose a file ' , self.currentDir , '' , wildcard , wx. OPEN ) # if the user presses OK , get the path if dialog .
ShowModal ( ) == wx .
ID_OK : self.attachTxt.Show ( ) self.editAttachBtn.Show ( ) filepath = dialog .
GetPath ( ) print filepath #
Change the current directory to reflect the last dir opened os.chdir( os.path.dirname( filepath ) ) self.currentDir = os.getcwd ( ) # add the user 's file to the filepath list if filepath != '' : self.filepaths.append( filepath ) # get file size fSize = self.getFileSize( filepath ) # modify the attachment 's label based on it's current contents if attachments == '' : attachments = ' %s ( %s ) ' % ( os.path.basename( filepath ) , fSize ) else : temp = ' %s ( %s ) ' % ( os.path.basename( filepath ) , fSize ) attachments = attachments + '; ' + temp self.attachTxt.SetLabel(attachments ) dialog .
Destroy ( ) def getFileSize ( self , f ) : '''
Get the file 's approx .
size ''' fSize = os.stat(f ) .st_size if fSize >= 1073741824 : # gigabyte fSize = int(math.ceil( fSize/1073741824.0 ) ) size = ' %s GB ' % fSize elif fSize >= 1048576 : # megabyte fSize = int(math.ceil( fSize/1048576.0 ) ) size = ' %s MB ' % fSize elif fSize >= 1024 : # kilobyte fSize = int(math.ceil( fSize/1024.0 ) ) size = ' %s KB ' % fSize else : size = ' %s bytes ' % fSize return size
You ’ll also notice that I save the last directory the user goes into .
I still come across programs that do n’t do this or do n’t do it consistently .
Hopefully my implementation will work in the majority of cases .
The getFileSize ( ) method is supposed to calculate the size of the attached file .
This only displays the nearest size and does n’t show fractions .
Other than that , I think it ’s pretty self - explanatory .
Editing Your Attachments
The onAttachEdit ( ) method is pretty similar , except that it calls a custom dialog to allow the user to edit what files are included in case they chose one erroneously .
def onAttachEdit ( self , event ) : '''
Allow the editing of the attached files list ''' print ' in onAttachEdit ... ' attachments = '' dialog = EditDialog( self.filepaths ) dialog .
ShowModal ( ) self .
filepaths = dialog .
filepaths print ' Edited paths :
' , self.filepaths dialog .
Destroy ( ) if self .
filepaths == [ ] : # hide the attachment controls self.attachTxt.Hide ( ) self.editAttachBtn.Hide ( ) else : for path in self .
filepaths : # get file size fSize = self.getFileSize( path ) #
Edit the attachments listed if attachments == '' : attachments = ' %s ( %s ) ' % ( os.path.basename( path ) , fSize ) else : temp = ' %s ( %s ) ' % ( os.path.basename( path ) , fSize ) attachments = attachments + '; ' + temp self.attachTxt.SetLabel(attachments ) class EditDialog ( wx.Dialog ) : def __init__ ( self , filepaths ) : wx.Dialog.__init__(self , None , - 1 , ' Edit Attachments ' , size = ( 190,150 ) ) self .
filepaths = filepaths instructions =
' Check the items below that you no longer wish to attach to the email ' lbl = wx. StaticText ( self , wx. ID_ANY , instructions ) deleteBtn = wx .
Button ( self , wx .
ID_ANY , ' Delete Items ' ) cancelBtn = wx .
Button ( self , wx .
ID_ANY , ' Cancel ' ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self.onDelete , deleteBtn ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self.onCancel , cancelBtn ) mainSizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL ) btnSizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.HORIZONTAL ) mainSizer .
Add(lbl , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) self.chkList = wx.CheckListBox( self , wx. ID_ANY , choices=self.filepaths ) mainSizer.Add(self.chkList , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) btnSizer.Add(deleteBtn , 0 , wx.ALL|wx.CENTER , 5 ) btnSizer.Add(cancelBtn , 0 , wx.ALL|wx.CENTER , 5 ) mainSizer .
Add( btnSizer , 0 , wx.ALL|wx.CENTER , 5 ) self . SetSizer( mainSizer ) self .
Fit ( ) self .
Layout ( ) def onCancel ( self , event ) : self .
Close ( ) def onDelete ( self , event ) : print ' in onDelete ' numberOfPaths = len( self.filepaths ) for item in range ( numberOfPaths ) : val = self.chkList.IsChecked ( item ) if val == True : path = self.chkList.GetString(item ) print path for i in range ( len( self.filepaths ) - 1, -1, -1 ) : if path in self .
filepaths [i ] : del self.
filepaths [i ] print ' new list => ' , self .
filepaths self .
Close ( )
The main thing to notice in the code above is that the EditDialog is sub-classing wx .
Dialog .
The reason I chose this over a wx .
Frame is because I wanted my dialog to be non-modal and I think using the wx .
Dialog class makes the most sense for this .
Probably the most interesting part of this class is my onDelete method , in which I loop over the paths backwards .
I do this so I can delete the items in any order without comprising the integrity of the list .
For example , if I had deleted element 2 repeatedly , I would probably end up deleting an element I did n’t mean to .
Sending an Email
My last method is the onSend ( ) one .
I think it is probably the most complex and the one that will need refactoring the most .
In this implementation , all the SMTP elements are hard coded .
Let ’s take a look and see how it works :
def OnSend ( self , event ) : '''
Send the email using the filled out textboxes .
Warn the user if they forget to fill part of it out . ''' From = self.fromTxt.GetValue ()
To = self .
toTxt.GetValue ( ) Subject = self.subjectTxt.GetValue( ) text = self.messageTxt.GetValue( ) colon = To.find (' ;') period = To.find ( ' , ' ) if colon != - 1 : temp = To.split(' ; ') To = self.sendStrip( temp ) #' ; '. join ( temp ) elif period != - 1 : temp = To.split( ' , ') To = self.sendStrip( temp ) #' ; '. join ( temp ) else : pass if To == '' : print ' add an address to the " To " field ! ' dlg = wx .MessageDialog ( None , ' Please add an address to the " To " field and try again ' , ' Error ' , wx.OK|wx.ICON_EXCLAMATION ) dlg.ShowModal( ) dlg.Destroy ( ) elif Subject == '' : dlg = wx.MessageDialog ( None , ' Please add a " Subject " and try again ' , ' Error ' , wx.OK|wx.ICON_EXCLAMATION ) dlg.ShowModal( ) dlg.Destroy ( ) elif From == '' : lg = wx .
MessageDialog ( None , ' Please add an address to the " From " field and try again ' , ' Error ' , wx.OK|wx.ICON_EXCLAMATION ) dlg.ShowModal ( ) dlg .

Most of this you ’ve seen before , so I ’m only going to talk about the email module calls .
Tha main part to noice is that to create an email message with attachments , you ’ll want to use the MIMEMultipart czll .
I used it to add the “ From ” , “ To ” , “ Subject ” and “ Date ” fields .
To attach files , you ’ll need to use MIMEBase .
Finally , to send the email , you ’ll need to set the SMTP server , which I did using the smptlib library and login , which is what the LoginDlg is for .
I ’ll go over that next , but before I do I would like to recommend reading both module ’s respective documentation for full details as they much more functionality that I do not use in this example .
Logging In
I noticed that my code did n’t work outside my organization and it took me a while to figure out why .
It turns out that when I ’m logged in at work , I ’m also logged into our webmail system , so I do n’t need to authenticate with it .
When I ’m outside , I do .
Since this is actually pretty normal procedure for SMTP servers , I included a fairly simple login dialog .
Let ’s take a look at the code :
class LoginDlg( wx.Dialog ) : def __init__( self , server ) : wx.Dialog.__init__(self , None , - 1 , ' Login ' , size = ( 190,150 ) ) self . server = server self .
loggedIn = False # widgets userLbl = wx.StaticText ( self , wx .
ID_ANY , ' Username : ' , size = ( 50 , - 1 ) ) self.userTxt = wx .
TextCtrl(self , wx. ID_ANY , '') passwordLbl = wx.StaticText ( self , wx .
ID_ANY , ' Password : ' , size = ( 50 , - 1 ) ) self.passwordTxt = wx .
TextCtrl(self , wx. ID_ANY , '' , size = ( 150 , - 1 ) , style=wx.TE_PROCESS_ENTER|wx.TE_PASSWORD ) loginBtn = wx .
Button ( self , wx .
ID_YES , ' Login ' ) cancelBtn = wx .
Button ( self , wx .
ID_ANY , ' Cancel ' ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self .
OnLogin , loginBtn ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_TEXT_ENTER , self .OnTextEnter , self.passwordTxt ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self .
OnClose , cancelBtn ) # sizer / layout userSizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.HORIZONTAL ) passwordSizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.HORIZONTAL ) btnSizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.HORIZONTAL ) mainSizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL ) userSizer.Add(userLbl , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) userSizer.Add(self.userTxt , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) passwordSizer .
Add(passwordLbl , 0 , wx.LEFT|wx.RIGHT , 5 ) passwordSizer.Add(self.passwordTxt , 0 , wx .
LEFT , 5 ) btnSizer.Add(loginBtn , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) btnSizer.Add(cancelBtn , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) mainSizer.Add(userSizer , 0 , wx .ALL , 0 ) mainSizer.Add(passwordSizer , 0 , wx .ALL , 0 ) mainSizer .
Add( btnSizer , 0 , wx.ALL|wx.CENTER , 5 ) self . SetSizer( mainSizer ) self .
Fit ( ) self .
Layout ( ) def OnTextEnter ( self , event ) : '''
When enter is pressed , login method is run . ''' self .
OnLogin ( ' event ' ) def OnLogin( self , event ) : '''
When the " Login " button is pressed , the credentials are authenticated .
If correct , the email will attempt to be sent .
If incorrect , the user will be notified . ''' try : user = self.userTxt.GetValue( ) pw = self.passwordTxt.GetValue( ) res = self.server.login(user , pw ) self.loggedIn = True self .
OnClose ('') except : message =
' Your username or password is incorrect .
Please try again . ' dlg = wx.MessageDialog ( None , message , ' Login Error ' , wx.OK|wx.ICON_EXCLAMATION ) dlg.ShowModal( ) dlg.Destroy ( ) def OnClose ( self , event ) : self .
Close ( )
For the most part , we ’ve seen this before .
The primary part to notice is that I have added two styles to my password TextCtrl : wx .TE_PROCESS_ENTER and wx .TE_PASSWORD .
The first will allow you to press enter to login rather than pressing the Login button explicitly .
The TE_PASSWORD style obscures the text typed into the TextCtrl with black circles or asterisks .
Also you should note that your username may include your email ’s url too .
For example , rather than just username , it may be username@hotmail.com .
Fortunately , if the login is incorrect , the program will throw an error and display a dialog letting the user know .
Hacking the Registry
The final thing to do on Windows is to set it to use this script when the user clicks on a mailto link .
To do this , you ’ll need to mess with the Windows Registry .
Before you do anything with the registry , be sure to back it up as there ’s always a chance that you may break something , including the OS .
To begin , go to Start , Run and type regedit .
Now navigate to the following location :
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto\shell\open\command
Just expand the tree on the right to navigate the tree .
One there , you ’ll need to edit the ( Default ) key on the right .
It should be of type REG_SZ .
Just double - click it to edit it .
Here ’s what you ’ll want to put in there :
cmd /C “ SET PYTHONHOME=c:\path\to\Python24&&c:\path\to\python24\python.exe c:\path\to\wxPyMail.py %1 ”
Basically , this tells Windows to set Python ’s home directory and the path to the python.exe as an environmental variable , which I think is only temporary .
It then passes the wxPyMail .py script we created to the python.exe specified .
The “ % 1 ” are the arguments passed by the mailto link .
Once you hit the OK button , it ’s saved and should just start working .
Wrapping Up
Now you know how to make a fully functional application with wxPython .
In my next post , I will show how to package it up as an executable so you can distribute it .
Some possible improvements that you could add :
Store profile information ( i.e .
Your name , email , signature , etc )
Store email addresses in SQLite
Create a wizard for setting up the profile(s )
Add encryption to the emails .

The existence of a secret , CIA - run prison on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean has long been a leaky secret in the “ War on Terror , ” and yesterday ’s revelations in Time  based on disclosures by a “ senior American official ” ( now retired ) , who was “ a frequent participant in White House Situation Room meetings ” after the 9/11 attacks , and who reported that “ a CIA counter - terrorism official twice said that a high - value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island ”  will come as no surprise to those who have been studying the story closely .
The news will , however , be an embarrassment to the U.S. government , which has persistently denied claims that it operated a secret “ War on Terror ” prison on Diego Garcia , and will be a source of even more consternation to the British government , which is more closely bound than its law - shredding Transatlantic neighbor to international laws and treaties preventing any kind of involvement whatsoever in kidnapping , “ extraordinary rendition ” and the practice of torture .
This is not the first time that Time has exposed the existence of a secret prison on Diego Garcia .
In 2003 , the magazine broke the story that Hambali , one of 14 “ high - value detainees ” transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 , was being held there , and in the years since confirmation has also come from other sources .
Twice , in 2004 and 2006 , Barry McCaffrey , a retired four - star US general , who is now professor of international security studies at the West Point military academy , revealed the prison ’s existence .
In May 2004 , he blithely declared on MSNBC ’s Deborah Norville Tonight , “ We ’re probably holding around 3,000 people , you know , Bagram air field , Diego Garcia , Guantánamo , 16 camps throughout Iraq , ” and in December 2006 he spoke out again , saying , in an NPR interview with Robert Siegel , “ They ’re behind bars we ’ve got them on Diego Garcia , in Bagram air field , in Guantánamo . ”
The prison ’s existence was also confirmed by Dick Marty , a Swiss senator who produced a detailed report on “ extraordinary rendition ” for the Council of Europe in June 2007 ( PDF ) and by Manfred Novak , the UN ’s Special Rapporteur on Torture , in March this year .
Having spoken to senior CIA officers during his research , Marty told the European Parliament , “ We have received concurring confirmations that United States agencies have used Diego Garcia , which is the international legal responsibility of the UK , in the  processing ’ of high - value detainees , ” and Manfred Novak explained to the Observer that “ he had received credible evidence from well - placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on Diego Garcia between 2002 and 2003 . ”
The penultimate piece of the jigsaw puzzle came in May , when El País broke the story that “ ghost prisoner ” Mustafa Setmariam Nasar , whose current whereabouts are unknown , was imprisoned on the island in 2005 , shortly after his capture in Pakistan  although the English - speaking press failed to notice .
Despite these previous disclosures , yesterday ’s article , by Adam Zagorin , is particularly striking because of the high - level nature of the source , and his admission that “ the CIA officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information , apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence . ”
In addition , the source noted that “ the U.S. may also have kept prisoners on ships within Diego Garcia ’s territorial waters , a contention the U.S. has long denied . ”
Zagorin also spoke to Richard Clarke ( at the time the National Security Council ’s Special Advisor to President Bush regarding counter - terrorism ) , who explained , “ In my presence , in the White House , the possibility of using Diego Garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed . ”
Although Clarke “ did not witness a final resolution of the issue , ” he added , “ Given everything that we know about the administration ’s approach to the law on these matters , I find the report that the U.S. did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible , ” and he also pointed out that using the island for interrogations or detentions without British permission “ is a violation of UK law , as well as of the bi-lateral agreement governing the island . ”
Zagorin ’s source did not name the prisoners , but it seems clear that the period he was referring to ( “ 2002 and possibly 2003 ” ) was when three particular “ high - value detainees ” 
Abu Zubaydah , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al - Shibh  are reported to have been held on the island , and it seems entirely plausible , therefore , that after these three were transferred to another secret CIA facility in Poland , the prison was used not only to hold Hambali , but also to hold the two other “ high - value detainees ” captured with him  Mohammed bin Lep ( aka Lillie ) and Mohd Farik bin Amin ( aka Zubair ) .
The addition of Mustafa Setmariam Nasar , who , it seems , may have been held into 2006 , not only confirms that a secret prison existed , but that it was possibly in use for four years straight .
These damaging revelations seal Diego Garcia ’s reputation as a quagmire of injustice .
A British sovereign territory  albeit one that was leased to the United States nearly 40 years ago , when the islanders were shamefully discarded by the British government and exiled to face destitution and death by misery in Mauritius  Diego Garcia has long been a source of shame to opponents of modern colonial activity .
Until now , however , the only admission that any activities connected with the “ War on Terror ” had taken place on the island came in February , when , after years of denials on the part of the British government , David Miliband , the Foreign Secretary , finally conceded that requests for information from his U.S. counterparts had revealed that , in 2002 , two rendition flights had refuelled on the island .
“ In both cases , ” Miliband stated with confidence , “ a U.S. plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the U.S. facility in Diego Garcia .
The detainees did not leave the plane , and the U.S. Government has assured us that no U.S. detainees have ever been held on Diego Garcia . ”
The British government had been provoked to action by critics within the UK , in particular the All - Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition , led by the Tory MP Andrew Tyrie , and the legal action charity Reprieve , which represents 30 prisoners in Guantánamo , but the story appeared to grind to a halt when Michael Hayden , the CIA ’s director , stepped forward to deny that Diego Garcia had ever been used as a “ War on Terror ” prison .
“ That is false , ” Gen .
Hayden said when asked if a secret prison had existed on Diego Garcia , adding , as the New York Times put it , that “ neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at Diego Garcia was ever part of the CIA ’s high - value terrorist interrogation program . ' ”
He also explained that one of the detainees “ was ultimately transferred to Guantánamo , ” while the other “ was returned to his home country , ” which was identified by State Department officials as Morocco .
“ These were rendition operations , ” he added , “ nothing more . ”
Four weeks ago , however , the story resurfaced once more , as David Miliband reported the results of his latest request for information from his U.S. counterparts .
This concerned a list of rendition flights , which , in the opinion of Reprieve and the All - Party Parliamentary Group , may also have passed through British territory , but the Foreign Secretary was confident that there was no further evidence to be mined , stating , “ The United States Government confirmed that , with the exception of two cases related to Diego Garcia in 2002 , there have been no other instances in which U.S. intelligence flights landed in the United Kingdom , our Overseas Territories , or the Crown Dependencies , with a detainee on board since 11 September 2001 . ”
Yet again , the assurances of his U.S. colleagues did nothing to assuage the critics .
Reprieve noted that the British government “ intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the U.S. , and accepted implausible U.S. assurances at face value , ” and added , presciently , “ This remains a transatlantic cover - up of epic proportions .
While the British government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its U.S. allies , the sordid truth about Diego Garcia ’s central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so - called  War on Terror ’ can not be hidden forever . ”
Just three days after David Miliband ’s last attempt to draw a line under the story , the British Foreign Affairs Select Committee published its latest report on the British Overseas Territories ( PDF ) , and was scathing about Diego Garcia , declaring that “ it is deplorable that previous U.S. assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false .
The failure of the United States Administration to tell the truth resulted in the UK Government inadvertently misleading our Select Committee and the House of Commons .
We intend to examine further the extent of UK supervision of U.S. activities on Diego Garcia , including all flights and ships serviced from Diego Garcia . ”
These new revelations , of course , leave the U.S. administration looking like bald - faced liars and the British government looking like myopic dupes .
Whether Michael Hayden was also duped is not known , but his strenuous denial , just five months ago , that a secret prison existed , which was manned by his own employees , will do nothing for the credibility of the U.S. administration , which likes to pretend that it does not torture and has nothing to conceal , but is persistently discovered not only being economical with the truth , but also behaving exactly as though it has guilty secrets to hide .
Whether this scandal will awaken much indignation in the American public remains to be seen , but it is hugely damaging to the British government , which is legally responsible for the activities that take place on its territory , however much it likes to hide behind “ assurances ” from its leaseholders that they have done nothing wrong .
It scarcely seems possible , but Diego Garcia ’s dark history has suddenly grown even darker .
The prisoners held on Diego Garcia
Abu Zubaydah ( Zayn al - Abidin Muhammad Husayn ) .
Saudi , b. 1971 .
Seized in Faisalabad , Pakistan in a joint operation by Pakistani forces and the FBI on 28 March 2002 , he is regarded by the administration as a senior al - Qaeda operative and training camp facilitator , although this has been disputed by former FBI interrogator Dan Coleman , who has described him as a minor logistician with a split personality .
In February 2008 , Gen. Michael Hayden , the director of the CIA , admitted that Abu Zubaydah was one of three prisoners who had been subjected to waterboarding ( an ancient torture technique that involves controlled drowning ) in CIA custody .
Held initially in Thailand , and later in Poland , he is one of 14 “ high - value detainees ” transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 .
At his tribunal in 2007 , he denied being a member of al - Qaeda , and made a point of mentioning that he had been tortured .
He has not yet been put forward for trial by Military Commission .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Kuwaiti / Pakistani , b. 1964 or 1965 .
The supposed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , Mohammed ( commonly known as KSM ) was seized in Rawalpindi , Pakistan on March 1 , 2003 .
Like Abu Zubaydah , he was subjected to waterboarding , and is also presumed to have been held initially in Thailand , and later in Poland .
Transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 , he confessed to being “ responsible for the 9/11 operation , from A to Z ” at his tribunal in 2007 , but also made a point of mentioning that he had been tortured .
He was put forward for trial by Military Commission in February , and will face the death penalty if convicted .
Rumors that KSM was held on Diego Garcia have surfaced sporadically over the years , one example being an article in the Toronto Star on July 2 , 2005 ( mirrored here ) , in which Lynda Hurst spoke to John Pike , a U.S. defense analyst .
Pike , who told Hurst that he believed that KSM had been held on Diego Garcia , explained , “ Diego Garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility .
They want somewhere that ’s difficult to escape from , difficult to attack , not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on .
Diego Garcia is ideal . ”
Ramzi bin al - Shibh .
Yemeni , b. 1972 .
A friend of the Hamburg cell that led the 9/11 attacks , bin al - Shibh was seized in a raid in Karachi , Pakistan on September 11 , 2002 .
He was reportedly intended as the 20th hijacker , but was unable to obtain a visa to enter the United States , and subsequently worked closely with KSM in planning the attacks .
Transferred to Guantanamo in September 2006 , he is also presumed to have been held initially in Thailand , and later in Poland , but his presence on Diego Garcia has long been suspected , because analyses of flight records have revealed that a plane flew from Pakistan to Diego Garcia immediately after his capture .
He refused to take part in his tribunal in 2007 , but was put forward for trial by Military Commission in February , and will face the death penalty if convicted .
Hambali ( Riduan Isamuddin ) .
Indonesian , b. 1966 .
Seized in Ayutthaya , Thailand in a joint operation by Thai forces and the CIA on 11 August 2003 , he is regarded as the main link between al - Qaeda and its Indonesian counterpart , Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) .
He is alleged to have been one of the planners of the Bali bombings in October 2002 , which killed over 200 people , and was transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 .
At his tribunal in 2007 , he said that he resigned from JI in 2000 , and was not involved with al - Qaeda or with any bombings or plots .
He has not yet been put forward for trial by Military Commission .
Lillie ( Mohammed Nazir bin Lep ) and Zubair ( Mohd Farik bin Amin ) .
Malaysians , seized with Hambali , little is known of these two men , beyond claims by the administration that they worked closely with Hambali , although they were both discussed in another TIME article , in October 2003 , which examined Hambali ’s interrogation logs .
They were transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 , but have not yet been put forward for trial by Military Commission .
Mustafa Setmariam Nasar ( Abu Musab al - Suri ) .
Syrian / Spanish , b. 1958 .
Seized in Quetta , Pakistan in October 2005 and handed over to U.S. forces a month later , he is not accused of being involved in direct attacks on U.S. forces , but is wanted in Spain as a witness in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings .
Regarded as one of the most significant proponents of universal jihad , his writings include a 1600 - page book , The Global Islamic Resistance Call , which was published on the internet in 2004 .
A critic of al - Qaeda , he reportedly fell out with Osama bin Laden in 1998 , and has stated that the 9/11 attacks were catastrophic for the jihadi cause .
Unlike the six prisoners mentioned above , he was not transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 , and it is not known , therefore , whether he is being held in a secret CIA prison or if he has been rendered to a third country .

These days , the relationship between Moscow and Washington is turning frosty again , over a number of issues .
But , quietly , American and Russian spies continue to collaborate to combat drug trafficking and organized crime , and to secure nuclear arsenals .
The relationship between the C.I.A. and the I.S.I. was far less complicated when the United States and Pakistan were intently focused on one common goal : kicking the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan .
For years in the 1980s , the C.I.A. used the I.S.I. as the conduit to funnel arms and money to Afghan rebels fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan .
But even in those good old days , the two spy services were far from trusting of each other  in particular over Pakistan ’s quest for nuclear weapons .
In his book “ Ghost Wars , ” the journalist Steve Coll recounts how the I.S.I. chief in the early 1980s , Gen. Akhtar Abdur Rahman , banned all social contact between his I.S.I. officers and C.I.A. operatives in Pakistan .
He was also convinced that the C.I.A. had set up an elaborate bugging network , so he had his officers speak in code on the telephone .
When the general and his aides were invited by the C.I.A. to visit agency training sites in the United States , the Pakistanis were forced to wear blindfolds on the flights into the facilities .

Since the Sept. 11 attacks , C.I.A. officers have arrived in Islamabad knowing they will probably depend on the I.S.I. at least as much as they have depended on any liaison spy service in the past .
Unlike spying in the capitals of Europe , where agency operatives can blend in to develop a network of informants , only a tiny fraction of C.I.A. officers can walk the streets of Peshawar unnoticed .
And an even smaller fraction could move freely through the tribal areas to scoop up useful information about militant networks there .
Bush , Obama statements reflect those of democratically elected world leaders , while McCain takes more aggressive approach .
‘ Invasion of Georgia ’ a ‘ 3 a.m. moment ’
When the North Caucasus slid into war Thursday night , it presented John McCain and Barack Obama with a true “ 3 a.m. moment , ” and their responses to the crisis suggested dramatic differences in how each candidate , as president , would lead America in moments of international crisis .
While Obama offered a response largely in line with statements issued by democratically elected world leaders , including President Bush , first calling on both sides to negotiate , John McCain took a remarkably — and uniquely — more aggressive stance , siding clearly with Georgia ’s pro-Western leaders and placing the blame for the conflict entirely on Russia .

The abrupt crisis in an obscure hotspot had the features of the real foreign policy situations presidents face — not the clean hypotheticals of candidates ’ white papers and debating points .
Russia has long attempted to reclaim now - sovereign parts of the former Soviet Union , stoking conflicts in the enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , which are universally recognized to be Georgian soil .
Russia has also used the ensuing military tensions to set back Georgia ’s bid to enter NATO .
But Georgia appears to have sparked the conflict by marching on the South Ossetian capital as Russia ’s powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin headed to Beijing for the Olympic Games .
Russia , in turn , welcomed the conflict , launching a large - scale attack on its smaller neighbor and sending tanks across its border .
Both American candidates back Georgia ’s sovereignty and its turn toward the West .
But their first statements on the crisis revealed differences of substance and style .
Obama ’s statement put him in line with the White House , the European Union , NATO and a series of European powers , while McCain ’s initial statement — which he delivered in Iowa and ran on a blog on his Web site under the title “ McCain Statement on Russian Invasion of Georgia ” — put him more closely in line with the moral clarity and American exceptionalism projected by President Bush ’s first term .
A McCain adviser suggested that Obama ’s statement constituted appeasement , while Obama ’s camp suggested that McCain was being needlessly belligerent and dangerously quick to judge a complicated situation .
“ I strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in Georgia , and urge an immediate end to armed conflict , ” Obama said in a written statement .
“ Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full - scale war .
Georgia ’s territorial integrity must be respected . ”
Obama added briefly that the international community should get involved .
More than an hour later , as more details of Russia ’s incursion into Georgia emerged , he cited Russia more directly : “ What is clear is that Russia has invaded Georgia ’s sovereign — has encroached on Georgia ’s sovereignty , ” he told reporters in Sacramento .
McCain ’s statement was longer , more detailed and more confrontational .
" [ T ] he news reports indicate that Russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia .
Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory .
“ The government of Georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on South Ossetia with international mediators .
The U.S. should immediately work with the EU and the OSCE to put diplomatic pressure on Russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen . ”
John McCain ’s top foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , defended McCain ’s direct criticism of Russia in the early hours of the crisis .
" Sen . McCain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here , ” he said , dismissing the notion that Georgia ’s move into its renegade province had precipitated the crisis .
" I do n't think you can excuse , defend , explain or make allowance for Russian behavior because of what is going on in Georgia . ”
He also criticized Obama for calling on both sides to show “ restraint , ” and suggested the Democrat was putting too much blame on the conflict ’s clear victim .
“ That 's kind of like saying after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , that Kuwait and Iraq need to show restraint , or like saying in 1968 [ when the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia ] ... that the Czechoslovaks should show restraint , ” he said .
A foreign policy adviser for Obama , Ben Rhodes , said Obama was deliberately measured in response to the conflict , balancing his disapproval of Russia ’s “ troubling behavior in its near - abroad region ” with “ the fact that we have to deal with Russia to deal with our most important national security challenges . ”
Rhodes declined to discuss McCain ’s statement directly , but did indirectly criticize it .
" The temperature of your rhetoric is n't a measure of your commitment to Georgian sovereignty , ” he said , noting that the two candidates ’ statements shared a substantive commitment to Georgia ’s borders .
“ You do n't want to get so far in front of a situation that you 're feeding the momentum of an escalation . ”
Critics of McCain ’s stance said he ’d imposed ideology on a complicated situation in which both sides bear some blame .
“ McCain took an inflexible approach to addressing this issue by focusing heavily on one side , without a pragmatic assessment of the situation , ” said Mark Brzezinski , a former Clinton White House official and an informal adviser to Obama .
“ It ’s both sides ’ fault — both have been somewhat provocative with each other , ” he said .
A fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation , Ariel Cohen , praised McCain ’s statement as “ robust and tough . ”
The candidates ’ stances also reflected their broader goals in the region .
Obama , Rhodes noted , has argued that the American interest in controlling nuclear material in the former Soviet Union and in other national security concerns means that the country should maintain a constructive relationship with Russia , even when Russia mistreats its population and threatens its neighbors .
McCain , meanwhile , has offered more sticks than carrots , and suggested that Russia will respond primarily to American toughness and resolve .
He ’s also called for Russia to be expelled from the Group of Eight industrial nations , a move unlikely to be supported by its other members , but one that makes his disapproval of Russia ’s conduct very clear .
Friday , as the crisis unfolded , he reiterated that stance .
The conflict in Georgia also brought attention to another complicating feature of McCain ’s campaign :
His ties to Republican operatives with extensive lobbying practices .
Scheunemann was , until earlier this year , registered to lobby for the government of Georgia .
A public relations firm working for the Russian Federation pointed out Scheunemann ’s lobbying past to reporters — a sign that McCain ’s stance is not , for better or worse , being welcomed in Moscow — as did Obama ’s campaign .
“ John McCain ’s top foreign policy adviser lobbied for , and has a vested interest in , the Republic of Georgia and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government , ” said Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan , noting that the “ appearance of a conflict of interest ” was a consequence of McCain ’s too - close ties to lobbyists .
Scheunemann dismissed the criticism , saying he severed his ties to his firm and to his client on March 1 and noting that McCain has been a firm supporter of Georgia ’s move toward the West , and away from Russia , since the Arizona senator ’s first visit there in 1997 .
September 11 , 2001 came after a “ summer of threat ” in which George W. Bush ( and Condoleeza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld and other Bush Administration principals ) , the FBI , CIA and Secret Service received increasingly dire warnings from counterterrorism experts .
These included the August 6 PDB , which warned of “ patterns of suspicious activity in [ the US ] consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks , including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York . ”
The Secret Service necessarily has the best communications systems and most up to date information , given that they are tasked with the security of the President of the USA .
As documented in “ Crossing the Rubicon ” by Michael Ruppert and summarized in the linked article by Michael Kane , “ It is the Secret Service who has the legal mandate to take supreme command in case of a scheduled major event - or an unplanned major emergency - on American soil ; these are designated " National Special Security Events . "
The Atlanta Olympic Games and the Republican & Democratic National Conventions are notable examples of NSSE's .
In preparation , the Secret Service runs training initiatives of simulated attacks and field exercises for such events .
The Secret Service works with state and local authorities as well as the military to coordinate security efforts ; it has the best communication system of any agency in the country ; and its personnel are always present with both the President and Vice President - making it the perfect agency to take supreme command in case of a major emergency on American soil .
When 9/11 occurred , the legal framework was in place to allow the Secret Service to take supreme command over any and all American agencies , including the Air Force . ”
According to former Counterterrorism Tsar Richard Clarke in his book Against All Enemies , " Secret Service had a system that allowed them to see what FAA 's radar was seeing . "
Also , Cheney admitted the Secret Service was in the loop to Tim Russert on Meet The Press September 16 ; “ The Secret Service has an arrangement with the F.A.A .
They had open lines after the World Trade Center was ... ” .
When DCI George Tenet was informed about the first tower being hit at 8:50 am , he immediately connected it to Bin Laden , and speculated “ I wonder if this has something to do with [ Zacharias Moussaoui ] who trained for a pilot ’s license ” .
The 9/11 Commission Report does n’t address these reports , or Tenet ’s actions that morning .
The claim that the Secret Service was unaware that a plane had crashed into World Trade Center 1 is simply not credible .
Even so , they allowed Bush to continue on to his heavily publicized photo op in support of the “ No Child Left Behind Act ” ; reading “ My Pet Goat ” with an elementary school class .
He sat in the classroom for 7 minutes after Andrew Card whispered in his ear about 9:05 am , “ The nation is under attack ” .
After leaving the classroom , they still did n’t leave ; he gave his first post - attack press conference at the school .
The Secret Service allowed the President of the United States to remain at his publicized location for half an hour after the 2nd tower was hit , exposing himself and the children to danger ; did they know he was n’t a target ?
They did n’t leave until about 9:35 am , at which time they made a mad dash for the airport 4 miles away , and took off in Air Force One - without fighter escort .
The 9/11 Commission Report explained this half - hour delay after Bush and the Secret Service had admitted they knew they nation was under attack by saying , “ The President told us his instinct was to project calm , not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis , " and that the Secret service " told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location , but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door . "
( for half an hour after they knew the nation was under attack )

Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) have set a world record in solar cell efficiency with a photovoltaic device that converts 40.8 percent of the light that hits it into electricity .
This is the highest confirmed efficiency of any photovoltaic device to date .
The inverted metamorphic triple - junction solar cell was designed , fabricated and independently measured at NREL .
The 40.8 percent efficiency was measured under concentrated light of 326 suns .
One sun is about the amount of light that typically hits Earth on a sunny day .
The new cell is a natural candidate for the space satellite market and for terrestrial concentrated photovoltaic arrays , which use lenses or mirrors to focus sunlight onto the solar cells .
The new solar cell differs significantly from the previous record holder – also based on a NREL design .
Instead of using a germanium wafer as the bottom junction of the device , the new design uses compositions of gallium indium phosphide and gallium indium arsenide to split the solar spectrum into three equal parts that are absorbed by each of the cell 's three junctions for higher potential efficiencies .
This is accomplished by growing the solar cell on a gallium arsenide wafer , flipping it over , then removing the wafer .
The resulting device is extremely thin and light and represents a new class of solar cells with advantages in performance , design , operation and cost .
NREL 's Mark Wanlass invented the original inverted cell , which recently won a R&D 100 award .
His design was modified by a team led by John Geisz that further optimized the junction energies by making the middle junction metamorphic as well as the bottom junction .
Metamorphic junctions are lattice mismatched – their atoms do n't line up .
The material properties of the mismatched semiconductors allows for greater potential conversion of sunlight .
NREL is the U.S. Department of Energy 's primary national laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development .
NREL is operated for DOE by Midwest Research Institute and Battelle .
Arava arrived in Jerusalem a few months ago from a petting zoo in southern Israel with the unexplained handicap .
She had not found love before the wheels were fitted .
The concept was imported from Europe and Asia in the 1980s as an alternative marketing and financing arrangement to help combat the often prohibitive costs of small - scale farming .
But until recently , it was slow to take root .
There were fewer than 100 such farms in the early 1990s , but in the last several years the numbers have grown to close to 1,500 , according to academic experts who have followed the trend .
“ I think people are becoming more local - minded , and this fits right into that , ” said Nichole D. Nazelrod , program coordinator at the Fulton Center for Sustainable Living at Wilson College in Chambersburg , Pa. , a national clearinghouse for community - supported farms .
“ People are seeing ways to come together and work together to make this successful . ”
The shareholders of Erehwon Farm have open access to the land and a guaranteed percentage of the season ’s harvest of fruit and vegetables for packages that range from about $ 300 to $ 900 .
Arrangements of fresh - cut blossoms twice a month can be included for an extra $ 120  or for the deluxe package , $ 220 will “ feed the soul ” with weekly bouquets of lilies and sunflowers and other local blooms .
Shareholders are not required to work the fields , but they can if they want , and many do .
Mr. Trisko said his family knows that without his volunteer labor and agreement to share in the financial risk of raising crops , the small organic farm might not survive .
“ It ’s very hard for them to make ends meet , ” he said , “ so I decided to go out and help .
We harvest , water , pull weeds , whatever they need doing . ”
Are you an activist , an author , a journalist , a patriot , or maybe a scholar who speaks out his or her mind in the defense of democracy ?
If you are , then , the chance of having your boarding pass stamped with the ominous symbol of “ SSSS ” on your next flight from the United States is very high .
SSSS stands for “ selectee for enhanced security screening . ”
That means that Home Land Security and TSA have labeled you as a US citizen - security risk , and used your tax money to transform themselves into your dictators .
According to a tally maintained by the ACLU , the nation ’s terrorist watch list has hit one million names and is still growing by the minute .
That is based upon the government ’s own reported numbers for the size of the list .
Members of congress , nuns , war heroes , reverends , former assistant attorney general , ACLU administrator , people with difficult names and all American names like Robert Johnson and Gary Smith , have become caught in the vast tentacle of this list . [ 1 ] .
Once you are on it , a rigorous procedure short of a divine intervention would become necessary to have you taken off this list .
Many are wary of raising this issue in fear of additional fascist strategies like harassment , retaliation , and intimidation would be used against them .
The ACLU also announced on July 14th , 2008 the creation of an online form where victims of the watch list can tell them their stories .
The link to the form is www.aclu.org/watchlist or directly at www.aclu.org/watchlistform. [ 1 ] .
It appears that the watch list is designed to ensnare innocent citizens , intimidate and silence the voice of dissent , crush activism , and pave the way for a robotized , frightened , fascist , and military society .
The key questions to ask are the following :
How could this happen in our great republic ?
Why would a democracy prepare itself for martial law if it is a true democracy ?
Have sadism , and bullying replaced civility and constitutional rights ?
Has fear transformed our free society into a nation of prisoners who are helpless , dependent , and frightened ?
Has the alleged war on terror become a domestic war on US citizens that is tailored to control , subdue , and microchip everyone ?
Have the citizens of the United States fallen asleep at the wheel ?
Or have they simply become so brainwashed and consumed with fear , apathy , self - alienation , and desperation that they have given up their hopes and dreams , and abandoned the greatest gift of liberty that the framers of this nation have given to them ?
Finally , I would like to add that it is always difficult to believe the stories that are told by others , until they happen to you .
By then , it is too late !
Do n’t be fooled with party rhetoric , or false political promises , because both parties have equally collaborated and conspired to create the neo- America .
Our leaders are supposed to be public servants who answer to the people , but in actuality these leaders are pre-chosen slaves who answer only to their global corporate masters .
Therefore , I would like to urge citizens to learn and to practice their civic duty as well to learn their constitutional rights , awaken from their deep trance of political illusions and propaganda , and hold accountable the charlatans they elected into office who are the true highjackers of our democracy , in order to save this great land !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A dispute over U.S. enforcement actions against European Union online gambling companies could be headed to the World Trade Organization soon , an European industry group said on Wednesday .

A dispute over U.S. enforcement actions against European Union online gambling companies could be headed to the World Trade Organization soon , an European industry group said on Wednesday .

“ It looks very much as if this matter will ... be sent to the WTO at the end of the commission ’s investigation , ” Lode Van Den Hende , outside counsel for the Remote Gambling Association , told reporters as EU officials were in Washington to probe U.S. Justice Department enforcement actions .
That would open the door for possible European sanctions on the United States , although it could take years for any case to make its way through the WTO litigation system .
An EU trade official , who briefed reporters on condition he not be identified , said he expected the European Commission to decide by the end of the year whether to start a WTO case .
The EU team , which met on Tuesday with representatives of the U.S. Trade Representative ’s office , the Justice Department and other U.S. agencies , will make its recommendations in a publicly available report in November , he said .
European Internet gambling companies lost billions of euros in market value after the U.S. Congress moved in 2006 to shut down the U.S. market by making it illegal for banks and credit card companies to make payments to online gambling sites .
Many publicly traded European companies , like PartyGaming and 888.com , withdrew from the United States after Congress passed the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act , but they face possible criminal prosecution for activities before then .
The European Commission , acting on industry petition , began a formal investigation in March into whether Washington was singling out EU companies for enforcement actions while allowing U.S. online companies to operate freely .
The dispute arose out of an earlier case in which the Caribbean country of Antigua and Barbuda challenged U.S. restrictions on Internet gambling as a violation of the services market - opening commitments Washington made in the 1994 Uruguay Round world trade pact .
The United States initially said it never intended to allow online gambling services as part of that pact .
But after that argument failed , it announced it would exercise a rarely used right under WTO rules to change its commitments .
That required it to negotiate a compensation package with other WTO members with online gambling interests -- such as the EU .
Washington struck a deal with Brussels last year , but details have not been made public .
In the U.S. view , that ended the matter .
“ We conducted negotiations with the EU which resulted in a mutually acceptable agreement last December to facilitate the U.S. amending its ( services ) schedule to clarify that we do not have WTO obligations with respect to gambling , ” said Gretchen Hamel , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative ’s office .
Prior to the deal , the United States was obligated by its WTO commitments to allow online gambling , so it is wrong for EU companies to face prosecution now , van Den Hende said .
Rep. Robert Wexler , a Florida Democrat who chairs the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe , said the United States should take the EU ’s concerns seriously .
“ I am increasingly concerned that if these disputes are not able to be resolved , it will likely mean costly retaliatory measures will be taken against U.S. economic interests , ” Wexler said in a statement before meeting the EU delegation .

A development company controlled by Osama bin Laden ’s half brother revealed last year that it wants to build a bridge that will span the Bab el Mandeb , the outlet of the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean .
If this ambitious project is ever realized , the throngs of African pilgrims who traverse one of the longest bridges in the world on a journey to Mecca would pass hundreds of feet above the probable route of the most memorable journey in human history .
Fifty or sixty thousand years ago a small band of Africans — a few hundred or even several thousand — crossed the strait in tiny boats , never to return .
For all of us , certain moments are precious in our life .
They might pertain to birthday , excursions , or kids , each one is unique and needs to be cherished !
Photographs have emerged as a means to capture and record such precious moments .
Their evolution from print to digital has made them even more sought after !
Now , any individual having a digital camera can click photos .
But the question that arises is how to click photos for different and specific moments ?
To throw more light on the above question , if you wish to shoot a landscape or scenery , how would you click and edit the snaps as compared to shooting in a moving bus or a car ?
How would you click and edit the photos of your family get together or your baby ’s first steps ?
Well , I guess it could be because of lack of knowledge of basic photography techniques , tips , etc .
So this made me curious and I started scrolled through the web for best and professional photography techniques , tips , tutorials etc and came up with the following set of Photography Techniques , Tips , Tutorials , Sites , Blogs and a set of Resources to help u become a professional with your camera in a simple and easy way !.. Note : Even though you might have a professional camera in hand but it so happens that many of you might fail to take the best photograph or even grab the shot which you are really think about .
But before you start with the camera , how many really read the instruction manual ?
Very few to be candid ! :)
Every one has a desire to take a good photograph of their own event , party , occasion etc .
The same happens to me every time I try to click a snap in a professional manner !
I fail even after taking the same shot again and again .

Mum freezes her OWN eggs to give her infertile daughter the chance of having a baby
The mother : ' Impossible situation '
A mother whose young daughter will never be able to conceive naturally has frozen her own eggs to give the girl a chance of starting a family when she grows up .
The girl , aged ten , was born with a rare genetic condition which means she is infertile .
Her mother had several eggs frozen in 2005 which could be used by her daughter for IVF treatment .
Under the procedure , which is legal and has been approved by Government ethics committees , the girl could use her mother 's eggs to give birth to her own half - sister or half - brother .
But legislation limiting the amount of time eggs can be frozen means Mollie - not her real name - will have to decide before her 18th birthday whether to use the eggs .
They were harvested from her mother in 2005 when Mollie was seven .
They can be stored for a maximum of ten years , so she will be only 17 when the time limit expires .
If she does not use them by the end of 2015 then , by law , all the eggs would have to be destroyed .
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority does allow for the ten - year limit to be extended , but only if the eggs are intended for the donor 's own treatment .
Now Mollie 's mother is campaigning for a reform in the law which would give her daughter more time to make the life - changing decision .
The mother , from Hazel Grove , Stockport , said : ' We only want to give Mollie the same chances as everyone else to have a child of her own .
' I do n't want to put my daughter under pressure and I do n't think she should be having to make that choice at that age .
' We feel real sadness that for no particularly justifiable reason our daughter is going to be put in an impossible situation . '
Mollie has Turner 's syndrome , a chromosome abnormality which affects around one in 2,500 girls born every year .
The condition causes growth problems , heart defects and physical abnormalities including infertility , a higher risk of diabetes , and ear and urinary infections .
The eggs , which are stored in liquid nitrogen at minus 196c , do not deteriorate and can be stored indefinitely because they are in a state of suspended animation at the temperature - at which all cellular activityceases .
Mollie 's mother said : ' She already knows that she is different .
We have tried to keep her as informed as we can .
' We have talked to her about how when she has children it might be different .
We just want our daughter to have the same chances as our son .
' People might think there is something strange about it but really it is no different from people who donate to their sisters .
' It is to ensure the closest possible genetic match .
It has been considered by ethics committees and they have no objection to it . '
Andrew Stunell , the LibDem MP for Hazel Grove , has raised the issue in Parliament and joined calls for reform .
He said the family was in a ' Catch - 22 ' situation and has called for an increase in the length of time eggs can be stored to allow the proposed recipient of the eggs to make an informed and sensible decision rather than one unduly influenced by a time limit .
Embryology rules state that only women under the age of 36 can freeze eggs because after that the risk of birth defects increases .
At least half a dozen British mothers have frozen their eggs to allow their infertile daughters to conceive at a later date .

This one is true .
Really .
It was January 2001 and I was training students to teach English as a foreign language .
The year before , when I 'd arrived in Bangkok , the newspaper headlines were full of reports about Eric Rosser , a convicted paedophile from America .
He was due to stand trial for child molestation , rape and pornography , but had jumped bail and escaped .
I 'd like to say it was easy to spot something strange about Peter Hill when he showed up in my class .
But it was n't like that at all .
He was quiet at first ; he 'd sit alone , reading the Bangkok Post , and never went outside during breaks like my other pupils .
But once he got into the swing of class , everyone liked him .
He was personable , an average - looking guy in his 40s .
He was clean , neat and did his homework on time .
On the first day of class , I asked my 10 students to pair up , interview each other and introduce their partner .
Peter 's partner told us that Peter was a musician .
He wanted to help Thai people , and the best way to do that was to teach English to children .
Next morning , I sat next to Peter during break to chat .
He said he was a British citizen .
I asked why he did n't have a British accent and he said he'd moved to the US aged five .
I asked if he had a green card and he said he did n't need one .
I knew that he did , but I changed the subject by asking the class to go upstairs .
Soon after , I asked the trainees what classes they wanted to teach .
I could always guess what they 'd choose : men preferred adult conversation and business classes ; women enjoyed teaching children .
I was right about all the trainees , except Peter - he wanted to teach 10 - to 12 - year - old children .
At this point , I felt uneasy , but nothing more - until one Sunday evening a few weeks later .
I was watching the TV show America 's Most Wanted , and halfway through was the story of Eric Rosser , one of the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted .
There he was , on television .
I was in shock ; I could n't believe it .
This man was in my classroom every day , hoping to get a job teaching young children .
Worse still , I knew I could n't tell anyone .
I had to act on my own .
If " Peter " thought anyone knew who he really was , he would run .
I had to gather more information .
I did n't want to go straight to the FBI unless I was sure I had the right man .
I could n't bear the idea of making a mistake and ruining someone 's life .
All my life , I 'd been a detective fan and read so many whodunits , so I spent a long time thinking about how I 'd get the right information .
I told the trainees I needed copies of their passports for my files .
They all brought them in , except Peter , who had only a photocopy .
His British passport showed that his birthday was July 8 , but he'd told me it was January 17 .
The FBI 's wanted poster had the same birthday : January 17 1958 .
I started a special file on him .
I even brought my camera and told my class that I kept photos of each group I trained .
I got his fingerprints , a tape of his voice and handwriting samples .
Then I called the FBI .
We arranged to meet and they asked me to bring everything I had .
When I showed Agent Robson the passport copy , she gasped , " It 's him .
It 's him . "
She went to see Agent Cahill , who was also on the case .
He called me later and asked about Peter .
" What does he usually wear ?
What time does he usually arrive at the college ?
What direction does he come from ? "
Rosser arrived at 9.45 am the next morning .
I knew the police would turn up any minute and I was nervous .
How would he react ?
Would he try to run away ?
Soon enough , six policemen came , along with the FBI .
As they took him away , he turned and shouted , " It 's all lies !
I 'm really a good person ! "
I 'll remember those words for the rest of my life .
Especially the way he looked .
He was shouting but pleading at the same time .
It was spooky .
I felt sorry for him in a way - there were so many mixed emotions I still find difficult to explain .
Of course , I never saw him again .
A month later I found out that Rosser had been convicted of all the charges against him in Thailand and the US .
He 'll be out in 2018 , something I try not to think about too much .
The police told me that Rosser thought his Thai wife had shopped him to the FBI .
I think he probably knows by now that it was n't .
I just wonder if he knows it was me .

OAK BROOK , Ill . -- McDonald 's Corp. is testing modifications to its popular $ 1 double cheeseburger , and higher prices for the sandwich , as it prepares to change its Dollar Menu by next year .
In an interview , Don Thompson , president of McDonald 's U.S. business , said the company has tested ways to make the burger less expensive to make .
Some restaurants are selling it with one slice of cheese instead of two , and billing it as a " double hamburger with cheese . "

Obama 's ' emergency ' economic plan
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) on Friday announced an “ Emergency Economic Plan ” that would give families a stimulus check of $ 1,000 each , funded in part by what his presidential campaign calls “ windfall profits from Big Oil . ”
Details are in this six - page policy paper .
Advertisement
The first part of Obama ’s plan is an emergency energy rebate ( $ 500 to individual workers , $ 1,000 to families ) as soon as this fall .
“ This rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months , ” Obama said .
“ Or , if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter , it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills .
Or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
Separately , Obama ’s plan includes a $ 50 billion stimulus package that his campaign claims would save more than 1 million jobs .
Half of the money would go to state governments , which are facing big budget shortfalls , and half would be used for national infrastructure , including replenishing the Highway Trust Fund , rebuilding roads and bridges , and repairing schools .
Obama announced his plan 27 minutes after a Labor Department report showed unemployment hit a four - year high of 5.7 percent in July — the highest rate since March 2004 , when it was 5.8 percent .
“ We need to do more , ” Obama said in a statement .
“ That ’s why today I ’m announcing a two - part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track .
McCain reacted to the surprisingly dour jobs report with a two - paragraph statement : " Across this country , Americans are hurting and today 's job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face .
... Unlike Sen. Obama , I do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems .
There is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses . ”
Obama announced his plan for a windfall profits tax on oil companies on June 9 in Raleigh , N.C. , as he launched a two - week economic tour after clinching the Democratic nomination .
Friday ’s proposal says Obama “ is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies . ”
“ Obama simply asks that big oil companies contribute a reasonable share of the windfall profits they receive from high oil prices over the next five years to pay for emergency assistance for families right now , ” the campaign says .
Der Norddeutsche Rundfunk ( NDR ) will gegen das am vergangenen Dienstag gefällte Urteil zur Gebührenerhebung auf beruflich genutzte PCs die Zulassung zur Berufung beantragen .
Das Verwaltungsgericht
Braunschweig hatte entschieden , dass eine separate Rundfunkgebühr für einen beruflich genutzten PC in der Wohnung rechtswidrig ist , wenn in den Räumlichkeiten herkömmliche Empfangsgeräte zur privaten Nutzung bereitgehalten und für diese bereits Gebühren entrichtet werden .
Auch der in einer
Wohnung beruflich genutzte PC falle unter die Gebührenbefreiung für Zweitgeräte , begründete das Gericht die Entscheidung unter Hinweis auf den Wortlaut der entsprechenden Vorschrift im Rundfunkgebührenstaatsvertrag ( RGebStV ) .
Der in dem Verfahren beklagte NDR hatte hingegen argumentiert , die Befreiung für Zweitgeräte gelte erst dann , wenn bereits ein " nicht ausschließlich privat " genutztes Gerät angemeldet sei .
Das hatte der alleine entscheidende Richter als Interpretation zurückgewiesen , die der Wortlaut des Gesetzes nicht hergebe .
Der NDR bleibt bei seiner Auslegung des § 5 Abs. 3 RGebStV . Die Entscheidung des Richters gehe " leider von einer unzutreffenden Auslegung der maßgeblichen Vorschrift " aus , teilte der Sender dazu auf Anfrage mit .
Entgegen der Auffassung des Gerichtes bestehe eine Rundfunkgebührenpflicht für ein sogenanntes " neuartiges Rundfunkempfangsgerät im nicht ausschließlich privaten Bereich dann , wenn im nicht ausschließlich privaten Bereich nicht schon ein sogenanntes herkömmliches Rundfunkempfangsgerät zum Empfang bereit gehalten wird " – also zum Beispiel ein beruflich genutzter und separat angemeldeter Fernseher .
Der NDR will nun Antrag auf Zulassung zur Berufung beim Niedersächsischen Oberverwaltungsgericht in Lüneburg stellen .
Dafür hat der Sender einen Monat Zeit , innerhalb eines weiteren Monats muss er den Antrag begründen .
Bis dahin ist das Urteil nicht rechtskräftig .
Der Berufung sieht Kläger Norbert Simon gelassen entgegen .
Der Braunschweiger
Richter habe sein Urteil wohlüberlegt gefällt , erklärte Simon gegenüber heise online .
Nun sei erst einmal abzuwarten , ob der Antrag überhaupt Erfolg habe .

This morning at the Leipzig Games Convention , Sony Computer Entertainment Europe announced it would release a new 160 GB PlayStation 3 in Europe for € 449 ( $ 660 ) .
Within minutes , Sony Computer Entertainment America announced the model - - which boasts twice the hard drive space as the current 80 GB SKU - - would also be making its way to North America , albeit in a different form .
$ 499 gets you all this .
While the European model will come with € 70 ( $ 102 ) in downloadable content localized to the user 's territory , the US and Canadian model will be introduced November via a limited edition bundle .
Costing $ 499 in both territories , the package will include the 160GB PS3 , a DualShock 3 controller , Naughty Dog 's acclaimed adventure game Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune , and a voucher for the downloadable game Pain .
In a statement , SCEA president and CEO Jack Tretton explained the rationale behind the new PS3 model .
" As [ the ] PlayStation Network continues to evolve with our recently launched video delivery service and more exclusive games , PS3 owners are demanding more storage capacity , " he said .
" Consumers also are utilizing PS3 as an entertainment hub for their digital media , placing content such as their entire music collection on the hard drive .
The 160 GB PS3 system addresses this growing consumer demand . "
Sony also had news today for those unswayed by the 160 GB PS3 package 's offerings -- or those simply unable to afford it or wait until November .
The company said that this week , the new $ 399 80 GB PS3 had begun shipping to stores .
Announced at the E3 Media & Business Summit last month , the console is $ 100 cheaper than the previous 80 GB PS3 SKU , but no longer offers software - based backward compatibility for PlayStation 2 games .
SCEA reps confirmed for GameSpot that the 160 GB model would also be bereft of PS2 game support .
In an army base in Baghdad , in functional wooden booths in a white - walled room , a row of young men in uniform stare at computer screens .
Many are emailing , instant messaging or playing online card games with their wives and girlfriends seven or more time zones away .
There is a background hum from others talking on a bank of phones .
One soldier can be heard protesting : ' You have no idea what I 'm going through out here . '
With the Iraq war in its sixth year , some of these American soldiers are on their third or fourth combat tour - 15 months away from home with just 18 days ' leave .
The strain is showing on their relationships and many will return home , exhausted , to find a disenchanted wife has walked out .
Divorce rates among the US military are soaring .
Corporal Leonard Allen , 33 , is missing his son's first year of life .
A member of the 2 - 4 Infantry ' Warrior ' Battalion , 10th Mountain Division , Allen served a nine - month stint in Afghanistan in 2006 .
Normally he could then have expected at least a year at home .
But eight months later he and his comrades were training in Kuwait , then deploying for a long tour in Baghdad .
' There were a lot of deployment babies after Afghanistan , ' Allen joked .
His son Colton is eight months old .
' I 've seen two and a half months of his life .
My wife Andrea gives me daily progress reports - he 's learning to crawl - but it's a shame when a father has to miss being there .
Six or nine months here would n't be so bad , but these 15 - month tours are killing everybody . '
Allen , a former bill collector now regularly on patrol in the streets of Baghdad , married two years ago in Las Vegas .
' We knew there was a chance I 'd be sent to Iraq .
She was pretty down for a while , quite sad , and she worries about me here .
She knows why I 'm here and she 's glad , but she wants me to come home . '
Andrea , 33 , keeps in touch with her husband via the internet .
In an email from their home at Fort Polk , Louisiana , she told The Observer : ' I miss him every minute of every day .
It helps to think about that first hug I 'll get when I see him next and all the things we 'll do when he comes home .
' When he left for this deployment , Colton was only two and a half months old .
It 's so hard that my husband is missing most of our son's " firsts " and that Colton only gets to see his daddy on pictures or videos .
I tell Leonard about everything and send him tons of pictures , but a picture can't capture everything , like Colton 's funny sense of humour or how sweet it is to listen to him babbling in his crib when he 's waking up in the morning .
Fifteen months is just way too long . '
Iraq , which has seen husbands return home with mental scars or missing limbs , preys on her mind .
' I worry about him all the time ; even if I 'm not consciously thinking about it , the fear is always there .
Any time someone rings the doorbell , my heart starts beating faster and I say a prayer that it 's not someone coming to tell me something happened to him . '
The couple have rules for their long - distance marriage .
' It 's impossible to explain how hard it is to be separated from your spouse for such a long time .
You really need to have good communication and a strong commitment to make it work .
We 're really careful to never actually fight on the phone , but if we have any kind of disagreement we make sure it 's resolved before we hang up , and always end our calls with an " I love you " . '
The pressure of deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq have become too much for some .
There were about 8,700 divorces involving American soldiers last year , compared to an estimated 5,500 in 2001 .
Research shows that career soldiers are much more likely to contemplate divorce than in the past .
The anguish is exemplified by John Callahan , 42 , a corporal who was away from home for nearly two years .
In November 2006 , Callahan 's machine - gun malfunctioned during a firefight , wounding him in the groin and leg .
Recovering from an operation in hospital , he spoke to his wife by phone and could hear a male voice in the background .
' Have n't you told him it's over ? ' , said his wife 's boyfriend .
' That you are n't wearing his wedding ring any more ? '
Some couples face reunions in which the returning soldier has been disfigured , paralysed or lost one or more limbs or suffered a life - changing brain injury .
US marine Ty Ziegel suffered horrific burns in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq but returned home and married his childhood sweetheart - only to separate just before their first wedding anniversary .
Last year suicides among military personnel reached their highest level since 1990 when 108 soldiers took their lives , compared with 102 in 2006 and 85 in 2005 .
Combat stress is growing , with one study finding that one in five personnel returns from Iraq and Afghanistan with symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder or major depression .
Unlike during the Second World War and the Vietnam War , when many more people were directly touched by the conflict , today 's military families can feel isolated from the rest of society .
Separation can be particularly difficult for young couples with little worldly experience .
Specialist Chris Haun , 21 , from Louisville , Kentucky , married his girlfriend , Jess , just before he was deployed to Baghdad , but said they have already hit problems .
' We 've had many nights when we wanted to separate , ' he said .
' We 've had downs as well as ups and we 've talked about divorce . '
He continued : ' She was a very dependent woman and now she 's becoming more independent .
She is 20 and in college and getting ready to hit that age with new freedoms , new friends and alcohol .
It 's a time of life when things change .
It 's a day - to - day game .
You always have the question in your head , " What 's going on ? " , but that 's where the trust comes in . '
The US army has sought to address the issue with counselling and chaplain - led programmes such as Strong Bonds , which includes weekend retreats for couples .
At military bases there are television slots and leaflets offering advice on ' How to keep a marriage strong during a deployment ' , with tips including ' Read a relationship book together ' , ' Communicate ' , ' Pray for each other ' and ' Avoid arguments ' .
James Pritchard , a chaplain at Loyalty base in east Baghdad , said that 38 soldiers had come to him to discuss marital problems since the start of the year .
' Probably 10 of them had found out or got evidence that their wife was leaving them or seeing somebody else , ' he said .
' It 's a big issue , especially with younger soldiers who 've married somebody they have n't known very long .
They suddenly have extra money coming in and the lifestyle of the spouse at home lends itself to extra-marital affairs .
We 've had soldiers go home and find the house empty , the wife and kids gone . '
He added : ' I tell soldiers that , if she was a topless dancer before you met her , when you come home do n't be surprised if she 's no longer your wife . '
Sergeant Larry Driscoll , 42 , who has been married twice , said : ' One deployment has a profound effect on a marriage .
If the marriage is on shaky ground , you think distance will make it better , but it exacerbates the problems three times over .
To get through a second or third deployment , that 's a miracle . '
The massive digital attacks that drove some of the government of Georgia 's websites offline during the Russian invasion are being called the first overt act of " cyberwarfare " -- or at least the most overt to date .
The Russian government denies responsibility , and it got some reputable defenders today .
The ShadowServer Foundation , a nonprofit group that tracks criminal activity on the Net , said that ordinary Russian citizens were helping attack the Georgian government websites with the aid of programs distributed through friendly sites .
Top security expert Gadi Evron went further , saying all of the blame might lie with a bunch of kids .
The most discussed of the recent technological assaults have been denial - of - service attacks that overwhelmed the government sites with constant requests for information and rendered them unavailable to people in Georgia seeking information .
Researchers in touch with network administrators in Georgia said a lot of the malicious traffic has been coming from servers controlled by the Russian Business Network , a notorious group out of St. Petersburg that has been linked to child pornography and major phishing and identity - theft scams .
Some researchers have pointed out , correctly , that the Russian Business Network is not the Russian government .
In fact , some say the network is just a hosting company that specializes in having criminal clients .
Anyone can use its resources , the argument goes .
But researcher Don Jackson of SecureWorks has devoted a fair amount of time to the question , and in an interview he made a convincing argument that the Russian government , despite its denials , is indeed involved .
To begin with , whether the Russian Business Network is a major organization or merely a helper for a variety of other groups is beside the point .
Criminals pay the bills :
It is a criminal outfit .
On the main issue , the computers issuing commands to the computers that are , in turn , attacking Georgian sites are n't all on Russian Business Network servers .
Some are better - hidden but reside on Internet addresses belonging to state - owned telecommunications companies in Russia .
Both are using MachBot , which is a software attack tool favored by Russian Business Network clients .
And it 's not just denial - of - service attacks : People are also infiltrating Georgia 's government networks to steal information , and websites are being defaced with propaganda .
Most crucially , there is the question of where and when .
Many of the most serious attacks began just as the tanks began to roll , although the networks had been set up beforehand .
And the choice of targets is especially telling .
Official sites in Gori , along with local news sites , were shut down by denial - of - service attacks before the Russian planes got there .
" How did they know that they were going to drop bombs on Gori and not the capital ? "
Jackson asked .
" I would say that from what I 've seen firsthand , there was at some level actual coordination and / or direction [ by the Russian government ] , especially in regard to the timing and the targets of some of the attacks . "

Ron Paul : Let 's shake the rafters
Dear friends ,
Tuesday 's Rally for the Republic is just days away !
This is the biggest event I have ever put on in my political career , and I hope to see you there by my side .
A few things to announce :
1 ) Today , 638 various premium seats will be released at Ticketmaster.com in sections 130 , 131 , 113 , 112 , and 111 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time .
Here 's an opportunity to get some excellent seats .
Any leftover premium seats will be offered at the Ron Paul Nation Celebration on Monday night .
2) At 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning , the day of the Rally , 400 wristbands will be handed out at the Target Center on a first - come , first - served basis .
These wristbands will provide ticket holders access to the standing - room - only space on the floor .
As you can see on the seating chart below , this is the closest you can get to the stage .
These wristbands will go fast , so be sure you 're in line early Tuesday morning !
3 ) Volunteers will be a big part of making these next few days a success .
All volunteers will be offered a free premium ticket to the Rally in exchange for your efforts .
Please sign up here
If you 're a student , please fill out the form at our Facebook page .
Can we make a big push as we head into our great week ?
The situation our country faces is as dangerous as ever .
A certain Democratic senator , recently passed over for the Republican vice - presidential nod , is likely to be our next secretary of state .
Both major parties remain committed to militarism and reckless spending - and inflationism to fund it all .
At their convention the Democrats uttered barely a peep about the surveillance state , the police state , and the Bush administration 's disastrous foreign policy .
Needless to say , there was not a word about the Fed and what it 's done to our economy .
We can only imagine what the GOP Convention will have in store for us .
The Rally for the Republic is the first step in alerting our countrymen to these dangers , and holding out the message of freedom as the only remedy .
We must resist the false choices the two major parties are giving us .
Help me spread our great ideas far and wide .
Join me in Minneapolis , and let 's shake the rafters .
In liberty ,
Ron Paul

WASHINGTON --
There 's no room at the Xcel Energy Center for maverick Ron Paul , so his acolytes have packed their cars , hitched rides on " Ronvoys " and will pitch tents at Ronstock '08 in Minneapolis in defiance of next week 's Republican convention in St. Paul , Minn .
More than 9,700 tickets had been sold for the Rally for the Republic , which seeks to bring together activists who are anti-war , anti-government regulation , anti-immigration , anti-taxes , anti-Federal Reserve , anti-outsourcing , pro-individual liberty , pro-civil liberties , and pro-Paul .
The Ronvoys -- fleets of buses and vans carrying Paul 's loyalists -- were to begin arriving Saturday .
A few rally - goers planned to walk from Green Bay , Wis. , and join up with Paul for the final miles of their Walk4 Freedom .
Other attendees are driving , carpooling or flying in for the convention alternative .
Paul , a Texas congressman who failed in a bid for the Republican presidential nomination , considers the rally a celebration of traditional Republican values of limited government -- and a poke in the eye of the GOP .
They do n't plan to crash the Republican party , but to show they and their Campaign for Liberty are not going away .
" No matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed , as was done in the campaign , no matter how much they did to us , it only energized our grass roots , " Paul said .
The rally builds on Paul 's presidential bid , in which he set a record for single - day fundraising on the Web and touched a nerve with some disaffected voters , largely in the Republican Party .
In a few Western states , Paul was a serious contender for votes , placing second ahead of Republican John McCain in Nevada and Montana .
He drew 14 percent from McCain in New Mexico , a battleground state .
But Paul has no speaking role at the GOP convention .
He said his staff made overtures to the party , but nothing came of its efforts .
Republican Party spokeswoman Joanna Burgos said she had to research whether Paul was invited to speak when asked about a convention role for Paul .
" Our focus is really on this side of the river , " Burgos said .
" We think there 's enough excitement and energy on this side . "
McCain 's campaign spokesman did not return a phone message .
Paul 's faithful still hope to permeate the ranks of the establishment by winning local and state races and pulling in disenchanted party members .
There are a couple dozen Paul delegates attending the GOP convention , though some loyalists say there are more delegates who support Paul .
Meanwhile , their focus is on their own political convergence in Minneapolis .
" We only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in , " said Kathleen Buchholz , 28 , of Denver .
Unable to take time off from school for the rally , Buchholz is attending Tuesday 's events , when Paul will speak .
She 's bypassing sleep to save on hotel costs and flying out early Wednesday .
Rally organizers reported last week they sold all 500 tickets priced at $ 85 each for their Real Politics Training School scheduled for Sunday .
Attendees will learn political - organizing skills and " how to compete and win at the political game , " organizers said on the rally Web site .
Speakers at the Paul rally include former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura , tax activist Grover Norquist , former California Rep. Barry Goldwater Jr. , political commentator Tucker Carlson , former two - term New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson , and the baby - delivering doctor supporters call Dr. Paul .
A few entertainers also are joining in , such as country star Sara Evans ; pop singer Aimee Allen , known for the song " Cooties " from Hairspray but whose favorite song among rally - goers is " Ron Paul Anthem " ; and Texas blues guitarist Jimmie Vaughan .
Paul backers who are n't staying at the Minneapolis hotel or a budget motel planned to bunk in group cabins at Camp Ihduhapi on Lake Independence , park RVs or pitch tents at campgrounds or head to a Goodhue , Minn. , dairy farm for Ronstock ' 08 , an imitation of the 1960s Woodstock counterculture festival .
Organizers there say a neighbor of the farm 's owner is donating a cow to feed the flock .
Sonny Thomas of Springboro , Ohio , plans to drive 12 hours to attend the rally , leaving Sunday .
He was offering in a Web posting to fit one or two others in his car .
" I feel as one person who stands up , I have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment , " said Thomas , a gas station manager who was laid off a previous job .

Plaque can damage the teeth and gums Scientists have developed a mouthwash that allows plaque - causing bacteria to be destroyed using nothing more than a bright light .
It works using the same principles as some skin cancer treatments .
Leeds Dental
Institute say it may be available inside three years for home use - perhaps with the light attached to the head of a toothbrush .
The same team is also working on a " repair solution " to help the body grow new enamel .
They believe this could reduce the need for " drilling and filling " .
In our experiments , we 've been using standard white light - I 've been using a conventional security light
Dr Simon Wood
Leeds Dental Institute Both projects are being spearheaded by Professor Jennifer Kirkham , who believes they could make a big difference to dental care .
The mouthwash uses " photodynamic therapy " , and Professor Kirkham sees it as a way to help people who find it hard to use a toothbrush .
Antibacterial molecules in the liquid are absorbed only by plaque - causing bacteria , and activated when a bright light is shone into the mouth , killing them .
Cancer application
The same technique is used in certain types of skin cancer , with the substance painted on the target area , taken up by cancer cells , then exposed to light of a certain wavelength , which activates it to kill the cancer cell .
Although the molecule is known to be safe for human consumption , full trials have yet to be completed .
Prof Kirkham said : " The laboratory is looking to find safe new ways to control plaque which do not rely on toothpaste .
" We see patients in the clinic who are not able to brush effectively - the shape of the mouth may not allow sufficient access , the patient could be disabled or just not a proficient brusher . "
Machines offering photodynamic therapy in dental clinics already exist , but another researcher , Dr Simon Wood , said that the aim was to find a way the mouthwash could be used at home .
He said : " In our experiments , we 've been using standard white light - I 've been using a conventional security light .
" While you 'd need a bright light to make it work , you could in theory have something in the head of a toothbrush . "
Self - repair
The " repair solution " is made from a protein which encourages the laying down of new enamel over microscopic holes in teeth , including those caused by acid produced by plaque bacteria .
The liquid is painted on , enters the holes , then attracts the calcium needed to patch them .
Prof Kirkham said it could help people with early damage which could eventually lead to dental decay , or who have tiny holes in their teeth which make consuming hot or cold food or drink painful .
The repair solution will not eliminate the need for the dentist 's drill - bigger cavities filled with decay would still have to be treated in the conventional way .
It is hoped that it will enter trials next year , and gain a licence for wider use within five years .

What are these ?
Cells rely on calcium as a universal means of communication .
For example , a sudden rush of calcium can trigger nerve cells to convey thoughts in the brain or cause a heart cell to beat .
A longstanding mystery has been how cells and molecules manage to appropriately sense and respond to the variety of calcium fluctuations within cells .
Reporting in the June 27 issue of Cell , a team of biomedical engineers at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has discovered how the calcium sensor protein calmodulin can gauge both the local flow of calcium , in through the closest channel , as well as the global calcium flow entering the many channels across the entire cell .
" It 's like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you , but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room , " says David Yue , M.D. , Ph.D. , a professor of biomedical engineering at Hopkins .
" It turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing , sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear ' listens ' to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell . "
Normally , calmodulin is positioned right near each calcium channel .
Several years ago , scientists discovered that calmodulin somehow can switch its sensory focus between local calcium and global calcium entering the cell through channels at a distance .
The calmodulin protein , explains
Yue , is made of two ball - like lobes , and it's these two lobes that act as the different calcium - sensing " ears . "
The C lobe listens locally and the N lobe listens globally , across the whole cell .
To figure out how calmodulin's two lobes can sense different sources of calcium , the team took a two - pronged approach .
First , they used computers to perform mathematical simulations that tested different potential calcium detection mechanisms of the calmodulin lobes .
Others have shown that the C lobe of calmodulin hangs onto calcium for a long time , whereas the N lobe lets go rapidly .
Their simulations suggested that these slight differences in calcium holding time might play a role in calmodulin 's ability to sense both local and global calcium levels .
" Once a local calcium ion sticks to the C lobe , it seldom lets go , and so the local calcium dominates , " says Yue .
By contrast , the N lobe would rapidly let go of calcium and then be empty and available to bind calcium entering the cell from distant calcium channels , allowing reception of global calcium .
Similar to the cocktail party , it 's easiest to catch other conversations during the pauses in your own conversation .
The research team then verified their mathematical predictions by testing real calmodulin proteins attached to calcium channels .
Using a new approach , they precisely controlled calcium pulses through single calcium channels and watched how calmodulin responded .
They were able to confirm the mathematical models .
Understanding the language of calcium is critical for understanding how cells communicate , says Yue , and also important for understanding neural diseases .
For instance , early antipsychotic drugs may work by blocking calmodulin action .
" Now that we are learning how these drugs actually work , " Yue says , " we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next - generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects . "
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health .
Authors on the paper are Michael Tadross , Ivy Dick and Yue , all of Hopkins .
When I worked with Travis Illig ( who is the origin of the term " Hanselminute , " by the way ) and Stuart Thompson at Corillian / CheckFree , we had a project manager who did n't totally " get " stuff .
What I mean is that we'd be in a meeting , perhaps a feature meeting or something , and we'd be firing on all cylinders .
Everyone was working well together , communicating clearly , finishing each other 's sentences , just an all around great day .
Designs become clear , backlog items were created at a furious pace , and it was generally felt that everyone in the meeting " grokked " what we needed to do .
At this point this particular project manager , who had been quiet until this point , would ask something like
" Now , wait , are you saying that Java replaces XML ? "
... and silence .
Crickets .
We were hearing English * words * , but not a cohesive sentence .
After all that , the last hour of banging through stuff , he had not just a disconnect , but a total fundamental misunderstanding of some aspect of computers and systems design .
I do n't remember who originally said it , it might have been me or Travis , but at some point after one of these uncomfortable moments , someone broke the silence with the non sequitur :
" I LIKE CAKE ! "
... and the room exploded .
From that point on , any time anyone in any meeting said something that was far enough off topic or sufficiently non-sequiturial , someone would declare " I LIKE CAKE ! "
All off - topic email responses are now declared " Cakemail " as in , " Man , I got some Cakemail from Fred this morning .
Made no sense . "
I still use this to this day and it still makes me smile .
Jesse asked me how I was doing yesterday and I replied " Ninjas on fire , man . "
Four years ago when Halo 2 was coming out it was described like this .
" Halo 2 is alot like Halo 1 , except it 's Halo 1 on fire going 120 miles per hour through a hospital zone chased by helicopters and ninjas .
And the ninjas are all on fire too . "
- Jason Jones
For me and some of my compatriots , it also become a phrase that referred to our current workload , like :
" How 's work ? " " I 'm being chased by ninjas . "
" Are they on fire ? " " Not yet . "
" Oh , so it 's Tuesday .
You wait . "
The short - hand just became " ninjas on fire , man " as a response to when you 're totally overwhelmed with deadlines and work .

My Mom Hand - Knit An iPhone
My mom was insanely cool even before she knitted an iPhone .
Last week , as the hype was peaking , I braced for reports of kids across the country grabbing for their parents ' new iPhones ; it was a drool - soaked disaster waiting to happen , like all those people who flung their Wii controllers into their flatscreens because they did n't think they really needed that wrist strap .
Obviously , I thought , a kid needs his own iPhone so he wo n't play with his dad's .
So I asked my mom if she could knit one .
And she did .
Frankly , I think it 's cooler than the Steve Jobs version .
Here is her knitting saga , and the tips and details to help other knit - happy folks save $ 800 .
Because it looked similar , I had forwarded a link to BitterSweet 's instructions for knitting a Pop Tart cell phone cozy .
Just change the colors , put buttons on instead of bead sprinkles , and you 're done !
I thought .
She tested a variety of yarns to get the best gauge .
Some yarns that did n't work included a metallic silver and a fat , furry chenille .
The frosting - as - screen never looked quite right , though , so she settled on making icons on an all - black face , and a black - and - grey back , using a slightly heavy gauge of wool .
Her iPhone is the same size as the original : 2.5 x 4.5 inches .
She made it with # 6 needles , and had 15 stitches , 6 per inch .
The body is made using a stocking knit stitch , knit 1 purl 1 , with 6 " of black , and 3 " of grey added to the end .
This ends up being much easier than setting in a separate screen section .
The icons are sewn on with 2 - ply tapestry yarn .
Some little details are stitched using a single ply of the yarn ; others are made using a 2 - ply French knot .
If you 're giving this to a teeth - equipped kid , it 's possible that the knots and icon stitches could get gnawed off .
If anyone has another idea for icons and the screen -- like recreating an image or wallpaper on it , for example -- definitely share it below .
It 's important to block the body flat before adding the icons ; use a steam iron and cloth and press on the wrong / purl side .
That makes the icons much easier to sew .
[ On the last test version , my mom sewed up three sides of the phone , then started embroidering the buttons .
This was all insane and backwards .
But the buttons on before you assemble the phone .
[ And double check the placement and orientation ; you know the old saying , measure twice , knit once .
Though she asked me about it a couple of times , I could n't see exactly where the fold would be ; as a result , the buttons are upside down .
Moral : Listen to your mothers , especially on the subject of knitting . ]
To assemble it , fold the body strip in half and sew around three edges .
[ In order to give it a consistent edge , she even sewed across the end where it 's folded . ]
I cut a piece of slightly dense foam just larger than the dimensions and stuffed it into the knitted pocket .
I thought of putting a rattle inside it , but it seemed annoying .
Then she sewed it closed .
She used the same grey yarn to sew it together .
In order to create the chromey edge , she chain - stitched around the black edges of the face .
I think it really stood out nicely .
The PopTart , she figures , would take just 30 - 45 minutes to make .
The iPhone was considerably longer .
Not counting the various tests and unpicking , the time requirement breaks down as follows :
knitting : 0.5 hours
buttons : 3 hours
sewing , stuffing , edging : 1 hour - plus
Total : 4 - 5 hours
Did I mention my mom is really cool ?
Enlarge By Chris O'Meara , AP Garmin GPS units , similar to this one shown in Tampa , Fla. , can be used in court cases to pinpoint the places defendants have been and help jurors make judgements from the technological evidence .
Like millions of motorists , Eric Hanson used a GPS unit in his Chevrolet TrailBlazer to find his way around .
He probably did n't expect that prosecutors would eventually use it too — to help convict him of killing four family members .
Prosecutors in suburban Chicago analyzed data from the Garmin GPS device to pinpoint where Hanson had been on the morning after his parents were fatally shot and his sister and brother - in - law bludgeoned to death in 2005 .
He was convicted of the killings earlier this year and sentenced to death .
Hanson 's trial was among recent criminal cases around the country in which authorities used GPS navigation devices to help establish a defendant 's whereabouts .
Experts say such evidence will almost certainly become more common in court as GPS systems become more affordable and show up in more vehicles .
" There 's no real doubt , " said Alan Brill , a Minnesota - based computer forensics expert who has worked with the FBI and Secret Service .
" This follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value .
I think what we 're seeing is evolutionary . "
Using technology to track a person 's location is nothing new .
For years , police have been able to trace cellphone signals and use other dashboard devices such as automatic toll - collection systems to confirm a driver 's whereabouts .
But the growing popularity of GPS systems — in cars , cellphones and other handheld devices — gives authorities another powerful tool to track suspects .
Among recent cases : • In September , a man in Butte , Mont. , pleaded guilty to rape shortly after a judge ruled that evidence from the GPS unit in his car could be used against him at trial .
Prosecutors planned to use it to show that Brian D. Adolf " prowled " through town looking for a victim .
• In New Brighton , Pa. , a trucker 's GPS system led police to charge him with setting his own home on fire .
GPS records showed his rig was parked about 100 yards from his house at the time of the fire .
•
In the case of a missing Chicago - area woman named Stacy Peterson , investigators sought GPS records from the SUV owned by her husband , former police officer Drew Peterson .
She still has n't been found , and no one has been charged .
Developed for the military , GPS navigation systems started showing up in cars in the 1990s .
Prices have dropped sharply in the past few years , and many units are now available for less than $ 150 .
The Consumer Electronics Association estimates 20 % of American households own a portable GPS system and 9 % have vehicles equipped with in - dash systems .
A GPS unit receives signals from satellites to determine its position on the ground .
That data can be used by mapping software to display the device 's location to within a few yards .
Detectives are often able to extract map searches and desired destinations that have been entered into a GPS unit by the user .
Some devices are equipped with a " track back " feature that can show where the unit was at a particular time .
" What we 're dealing with here is a use of the technology that I do n't think the good people at Magellan or Garmin or TomTom really thought about when they were developing it , " said Brill , referring to manufacturers of GPS devices .
Law enforcement sometimes uses secretly planted GPS devices to monitor suspects .
The practice , often done without a warrant or court order , has been criticized by privacy advocates who argue that it is unconstitutional .
The GPS feature on a cellphone has already helped solve at least one crime .
In 2006 , police in Virginia Beach used the GPS on a homicide victim 's cellphone to find the phone and her purse in a garbage can behind a home .
The home was linked to the man who was eventually charged with killing her .
Jon Price , a trainer at Garmin , the leading maker of commercial GPS units in the U.S. , started getting calls five years ago to work with law enforcement in cases involving GPS data from the company 's units was being used as evidence .
Price estimates he 's helped with about 25 criminal cases , some of them involving GPS - equipped boats running drugs out of South America .
He 's testified as an expert witness in a half - dozen cases , including the Hanson murder trial .
" Typically the GPS data being used is for the purpose of contradicting ( defendants ' ) alibis , " Price said .
GPS data is usually just one part of the criminal case because attorneys also have to prove the defendant possessed the unit and entered the information into it .
But Renee Hutchins , a University of Maryland law professor and former defense attorney , recently wrote an article suggesting GPS data is protected under the Fourth Amendment .
She said police should only be allowed to acquire it by showing probable cause and getting a warrant signed by a judge .
" I think that in the last couple of years , people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car , people can keep track of you , " Hutchins said .
" I think it 's a growing public awareness .
The problem is ... that most people feel like , ' I 'm not doing anything wrong , so who cares ? '
But I think that 's the wrong way of looking at it . "

Senator Chuck Hagel could be influential with independent voters Senior Republican Senator Chuck Hagel has voiced doubts about Sarah Palin 's qualifications for the vice - presidency .
John McCain 's running mate " does n't have any foreign policy credentials " , Mr Hagel told the Omaha World - Herald .
Mr Hagel was a prominent supporter of Mr McCain during his 2000 bid for the US presidency , but has declined to endorse either candidate this year .
He was opposed to the Iraq War , and recently joined Mr McCain 's rival Barack Obama on a Middle East trip .
' Stop the nonsense ' " I think it 's a stretch to , in any way , to say that she 's got the experience to be president of the United States , " Mr Hagel told the Omaha World - Herald newspaper .
And he was dismissive of the fact that Mrs Palin , the governor of Alaska , has made few trips abroad .
" You get a passport for the first time in your life last year ?
I mean , I do n't know what you can say .
You ca n't say anything . "
This kind of thing will have an effect on independents
BBC North America editor Justin Webb
Justin Webb's America Mr Hagel also criticised the McCain campaign for its suggestion that the proximity of Alaska to Russia gave Mrs Palin foreign policy experience .
" I think they ought to be just honest about it and stop the nonsense about , ' I look out my window and I see Russia and so therefore I know something about Russia ' , " he said .
" That kind of thing is insulting to the American people . "
BBC North America editor Justin Webb says Mr Hagel 's opinion of Mrs Palin will have an effect on independent voters .
A senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Mr Hagel was a close ally of Mr McCain , but the two men parted company over the decision to go to war in Iraq .
Mr Hagel skipped this year 's Republican National Convention in favour of a visit to Latin America .
Mr Hagel 's decision to accompany Mr Obama this summer on a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan , as part of a US Congressional delegation , led to speculation that he would throw his support behind the Democratic nominee .
However , a spokesman for the Nebraska senator insisted in August that " Senator Hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate " .

What are these ?
The FBI is saying Bruce Ivins sent the anthrax that wound up killing five and terrorizing the whole country .
The deadly attack was aimed at some of our top politicians and media figures .
If ever there was a terrorist attack , this was it .
So , how come no one is calling Ivins a terrorist ?
Let 's get real .
You know what the answer is .
It 's because he is white .
It 's also because he is Christian and right - wing , but I 'll get to that in a second .
Now , if you do n't believe that they 're not calling him a terrorist because he's white , let me ask you this question :
What if his name was Sheik al - Abdullah Muhammad ?
What if Sheik Abdullah had sent weaponized anthrax that killed people all across the country and targeted our top officials ?
Do you think they would have called him a terrorist then ?
You know they would have , you know it for a fact .
The FBI says one possible motivation Ivins had was that he was Catholic and fervently pro-life , so he hated Senator Leahy and Daschle because they were Catholic and pro-choice .
Now , if Ivins was Muslim and sent Christian Right senators anthrax because of their religious beliefs , do you think he would have been called a terrorist ?
Not one news story that I have seen has referred to Ivins as an alleged terrorist .
Back when the government was pushing the idea that Iraq might have been responsible , there were plenty of news stories that said this was a terrorist attack .
Since we found out the alleged killer was a white Republican , not one news story has called this an act of terrorism .
I know this is partly due to government propaganda .
If the government calls it terrorism , so does the press .
If the government does n't , neither does the press .
And this fact might be even more damning .
Look at how much the press is affected by government press releases .
But that 's not the only answer .
The media has to look in the mirror on this one .
There is no good answer for why they have treated this story differently than other stories of terrorism .
This blatant double standard makes a mockery of the whole concept of terrorism .

MoveOn attacks AP writer for biased analysis of Biden pick Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday August 24 , 2008
Print This Email This MoveOn.org , a political action group , has denounced an Associated Press analysis of Barack Obama 's vice presidential pick , saying the article is more similar to " FOX than an unbiased news organization . "
A statement from MoveOn.org asks its readers to email AP and demand the writer be fired .
The piece , titled " Analysis : Biden pick shows lack of confidence " , suggests that Obama 's choice of Sen .
Joe Biden as his running mate is the " next logistical step in an Obama campaign that has become more negative . "
The following is an excerpt from the article :
###
The candidate of change went with the status quo .
In picking Sen . Joe Biden to be his running mate , Barack Obama sought to shore up his weakness -- inexperience in office and on foreign policy .
... He picked a 35 - year veteran of the Senate -- the ultimate insider .
###
The author , Ron Fournier , has several connections to conservative leaders .
Politico reported that before returning to the Associated Press in March 2007 , the writer considered working for the John McCain presidential campaign , frequently talking about the possibility to coworkers .
Media Matters has written that Fournier has " consistently smeared Democrats and favored John McCain " and tied him to Karl Rove .
Rove and Fournier exchanged a series of emails after the 2004 death of Cpl. Pat Tillman , a former football player who regarded as a hero by the White House until it was discovered that he had actually been killed by friendly fire .
In one email , Rove asked , " How does our country continue to produce men and women like this ? "
Fournier responded : " The Lord creates men and women like this all over the world .
But only the great and free countries allow them to flourish .
Keep up the fight . "
Fournier was named chief of the AP's Washington bureau on August 1 , effectively making him responsible for directing the wire service 's coverage of the presidential campaign .
" There are few places in all of journalism more respected or closely watched than the Washington bureau of the Associated Press .
And there are few moments in history when the AP 's coverage of Washington has mattered more , " said Mike Oreskes , the AP 's managing editor for U.S. news .
" Fortunately , we have the perfect candidate at hand . "
The article criticizing Obama 's VP choice is not the first time Fournier has been accused of a conservative bias in his writing .
The following is a list compiled by MoveOn.org of other examples of his work during the election cycle that have drawn negative attention .
###
Headline : " Sen. Hillary Clinton an Artful Dodger " Excerpt : " Slick Hillary ?
Former President Clinton earned the nickname ' Slick Willy ' for his mastery in the political arts of ducking and dodging ...
His wife may not be as smooth , but Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is doing a passable impression of the ever - parsing former president . "
Headline : " Obama walks arrogance line " Excerpt : " There 's a line smart politicians do n't cross -- somewhere between " I 'm qualified to be president " and " I 'm born to be president . "
Wherever it lies , Barack Obama better watch his step .
He 's bordering on arrogance . "
Headline : " Clinton 's Politics of Pity " Excerpt : " Poor Hillary .
After trying to save her sinking candidacy with awkward turns of flattery and sarcasm , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton resorted to a new tactic in Tuesday night 's debate : self - pity . "
###
Fournier has covered politics for the Associated Press for 20 years , but Media Matters found only one negative piece about Republicans written by him .
The main point of the article was slamming Mitt Romney for having beaten John McCain in Michigan , calling McCain 's loss " a defeat for authenticity in politics " and McCain a " man who spoke hard truths . "
Drinking buckets of coffee a day — up to six cups — may reduce your risk of death from heart disease , if ever so slightly , according to a new report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine .
Or not .
Analyzing data culled from 84,214 women enrolled in the Nurses ’ Health Study from 1980 to 2004 and 41,736 men in the Health Professionals Follow - up Study from 1986 to 2004 , researchers found that :
Women who consumed two to three cups of caffeinated coffee a day had a 25 % lower risk of death from heart disease .
Women who consumed two to three cups of caffeinated coffee a day had an 18 % lower risk of death caused by something other than heart disease or cancer .
Men who consumed two to three cups of caffeinated coffee a day had no change in risk .
There was no association between coffee and cancer deaths .
Interestingly , people who drank decaffeinated coffee had death rates similar to those who drank caffeinated coffee .
This suggests that there may be some other factor at work — something unrelated to coffee that coffee drinkers share .
[ * Note , readers rightly pointed out that other constituents in the coffee could be responsible for the results . ]
Among the women in the study :
2,368 died of heart disease
5,011 of cancer
3,716 of another cause
Among the men :
2,049 died of heart disease
2,491 of cancer
2,348 of another cause .

This song is not a rebel song …
The greatest concert in rock history happened 25 years ago tonight in an amphitheater just west of Denver , Colorado .
Everybody ’s seen the footage , but most probably do n’t realize that it was filmed in June .
Barry Fey , who promoted the show , did an incredible interview with NPR affiliate KCFR yesterday .
( Even if you do n’t like U2 , you probably want to give this a listen . )
As it turned out , the show almost did n’t happen .
U2 ’s now - legendary Red Rocks show on June 5 , 1983 , had all the makings for a classic disaster .
The weather bordered on sleet and rain all day â€ ” hardly idyllic conditions for a video shoot that included countless cameras and three giant torches sitting atop the rocks .
The promoters were in California until the afternoon of the show , and when they flew into a blustery Stapleton Airport , they called the mountain amphitheater ’s backstage to see where the show had been moved .
But the band was n’t about to move the concert .
“ I asked them why they did n’t call me , and the people said , ‘ The band would n’t let us , because they knew you ’d want to move the show , ’ ” retired promoter Barry Fey remembered .
“ Then Paul McGuinness , their manager , got on the phone , and then Bono got on the phone , and then Chuck ( Morris ) and I headed home to change out of our sunny California gear into something much heavier before heading up to Red Rocks . ”
I once posed this question over at Lullaby Pit :
If your fairy godmother appeared and offered to send you on a trip to any place humans have ever been at any moment that has occurred in your lifetime , what moment would you choose ?
I began my own answer this way :
If I could go back to one event that occurred in my lifetime , I ’d set the dial on the time machine to June 5 , 1983 , and point it toward Morrison , Colorado , the site of U2 ’s famous Red Rocks concert .
I ’ve seen footage from just about all of the legendary concerts ever staged , and while I guess you could never know for sure without being there , I ’ve always imagined that U2 at Red Rocks might well have been the greatest rock show in history .
And ended this way :
You had the right band in the right venue before the right crowd at the precise second that all the gods of art and earth and sky leaned in and infused the moment with transcendence and immortality .
Those who were there â€ “ and this number includes one of my former roommates â€ “ they were blessed , and I will envy them until I die .
According to promoter Barry Fey , thanks to the conditions Red Rocks was only about half full – 4,400 people .
And that roommate …
I was in my first semester of grad school at Iowa State , and the roomie was a former military guy .
We got to talking music one evening , U2 came up ( being one of my favorite bands ) , and he says “ Yeah , I saw them live . ”
Turns out he ’d been stationed at Fort Carson down in the Springs .
One of his buddies comes in and said he had a spare ticket .
My roomie initially balked because the weather did n’t look so great and , oh by the way , he ’d never heard of U2 .
But he got talked into it .
And wound up seeing the greatest show ever .
By accident .
I think he enjoyed the look on my face .
If they ever invent time travel , I ’ll pay whatever it takes to revisit June 5 , 1983 .
Meantime , I have seen U2 three other times ( the ZooTV tour remains the best show I ’ve ever been to ) and at least we have video .

Last Friday , Italian ISPs started to prevent their customers from accessing the Pirate Bay .
Strangely enough , Pirate Bay traffic is not redirected to Italian authorities , but to the IFPI , the infamous anti-piracy lobby of the music industry .
Pirate Bay's Peter Sunde is not happy , and says it 's a scandal .
For now , potential Italian Pirate Bay users are denied access to the BitTorrent tracker , and Italian authorities are investigating whether the site should be blocked indefinitely .
The block totally missed its purpose though , as The Pirate Bay saw an increase in traffic from Italy instead of a decline .
The Pirate Bay has already taken several countermeasures to make sure Italians can access the site .
These do n’t work across all ISPs yet , and those users are redirected to the following page by their ISP .
Interestingly , this page is hosted on a server that belongs to IFPI – a reverse IP lookup shows that the page is linked to www.pro-music.org, IFPI ’s legal music site .
“ I think it ’s a scandal , ” Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde told Torrent Freak in response to this remarkable finding .
“ I hope that people start noticing that IFPI gets more and more into bed with the police .
It ’s really disturbing that one side of an ongoing fight gets more authority without a legal basis . ”
Peter finds it hard to believe that the IFPI now gets all the traffic destined for the Pirate Bay , without any legal grounds , and he urges Italian users to clear their cookies before the IFPI decides to steal them .
We have to agree with Peter here , it is indeed very disturbing that the traffic is redirected to a site which belongs to an anti-piracy lobby , instead of diverting neutrally to the ISP or local authorities .
The IFPI was contacted for a response several days ago , but has n’t replied so far .
It ’s not the first time that they ’ve “ hijacked ” traffic from a torrent site .
Last October they did the same thing with the OiNK domain .
That instance was even worse , as they used the opportunity to threaten members of the BitTorrent tracker , in advance of any trial .
Last October , the IFPI lost their .com domain , which was mysteriously transferred to the Pirate Bay , who started International Federation of Pirate Interests .
Even though the IFPI managed to get the domain back in their possession , the incident marked an increase in efforts from the organization to take out The Pirate Bay .
Thus far , only John Kennedy , chairman and chief executive of the IFPI , has responded to the Italian move against The Pirate Bay stating : “ This decision sends out a clear message that The Pirate Bay ’s activities are illegal under Italian law .
The Pirate Bay facilitates the mass infringement of copyright across music , film , television and games .
Its very name shows the contempt its operators hold for the creators of legitimate content . ”
Italy is trying hard to get rid of their fascist label , and some Italians were quite upset about the Pirate Bay calling their country a fascist state , but scandals like this do n’t help to improve this image .
Things get even worse if you take into account that the IFPI covered up the fact that the organization was founded in Rome , Italy , under the watch of Mussolini , one of the greatest fascist dictators .
Enough said .

You must ask yourself what Social Network do I choose ?
This is the most important question .
If you ’re a blogger and own a self hosted blog , social networks can be great traffic drivers to your site .
Social Network Humor :
I Ask , and I find myself doing a Backflip over my decision .
I grow hungry and begin to Feed Me Links and Squidoo on the side .
It was so Del.icio.us I had to Mixx up another batch .
I have so many Fave foods to choose from , but I am so undecided on what to choose .
I than ask my girlfriend to share Co.mments on what to eat .
I than Digg through the refrigerator to decide what I want .
I than StumbleUpon some leftover pasta my girlfriend made .
I start to eat it and enjoy it so much I gave my girlfriend a big Hugg .
I am still not satisfied yet , so I begin to look through the Yellow Pages and order Mister Wong Chinese .
The door bell rings 30 minutes later and it ’s the delivery guy , Yahoo ! .
Social Network Tips :
It took a while to decide what social network I wanted to participant in .
It ’s important not to over extend yourself by participating in too many social networks .
Keep it simple by selecting no more than 3 , so you can put more time and focus , thus getting better results .
In 2005 , Col. Lawrence Franklin was indicted alongside two executives of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) for allegedly violating the 1917 Espionage Act.
Franklin later pled guilty to passing AIPAC a classified presidential directive and other secrets concerning America 's Iran policy .
AIPAC then allegedly forwarded the highly sensitive information to Israeli government officials and selected members of Washington 's media establishment .
This covert leaking appears to be just one of many AIPAC programs designed to encourage tougher U.S. policies toward Iran , from financial boycotts to naval blockades and possibly even military strikes .
It has n't worked out very well for Franklin .
He was sentenced to 12 years in prison .
Curiously , Franklin remains free pending the outcome of the repeatedly postponed criminal trial against AIPAC's Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman .
On Oct. 28 , 2008 , the prosecution is scheduled to appeal the ruling judge 's order that it prove the alleged leaks harmed the United States .
This is a far tougher standard of proof than the Espionage Act actually requires .
Nevertheless , observers and critics hope the trial will provide insight into Middle East policy formulation — but there is diminished reason for this hope .
A passel of musty documents from an earlier , long - secret Department of Justice attempt to hold the Israel lobby accountable was declassified on June 10 , 2008 .
The files reveal that stalling tactics — and most critically , regime change in Washington — provide ample opportunity for the Israel lobby to subvert due process .
In 1962 , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigated foreign lobbyists active in the United States .
The committee hired tough investigators , including Walter Haskell Pincus , now the Washington Post 's national security journalist .
These investigators played hardball with the American Zionist Council ( AZC ) by going after its hidden financial flows .
The Senate investigators rifled through the filing cabinets of the Israeli government 's colonization and charitable fundraising partner , the Jewish Agency , American Section , based in New York .
This raised howls of protest from Isaiah L. Kenen , then editor of a lobbying newsletter , the Near East Report .
The Senate investigation forced the Jewish Agency , American Section , regulated since 1938 under the Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) , to file more detailed biannual activity declarations .
FARA is a disclosure law requiring all agents of foreign principals to detail their activities in reports filed at a public office within the U.S. Department of Justice .
The Jewish Agency functioned as a quasi - governmental organization whose executive board was composed of Israelis ( including government officials ) and Americans .
It not only received government funding , but had influence over internal policy and legal matters before they went to the Knesset under a 1953 " covenant " agreement with the Israeli government .
Sen .
Fulbright , who led the investigation , was outraged at the idea that U.S. foreign aid and tax - preferential charitable funds were being funneled back into the U.S. to multiply foreign aid through lobbying and a massive stealth public relations campaign .
At the time , Israel was far from the only violator .
The Senate committee also caught the Philippines playing the same game through Washington lobbyists doling out campaign contributions in exchange for enormous WWII reparations payments funded by U.S. taxpayers .
But Israel 's covert lobbying and public relations venture was truly massive .
By the time Fulbright 's public Senate hearings ended in 1963 , it had been established that the Jewish Agency laundered over $ 5 million ( around $ 35 million today ) into U.S. public relations and lobbying initiatives over a two - year period .
The true scope of the campaign was never revealed , in spite of diligent attempts at law enforcement .
As in the Rosen and Weissman espionage incident , the FBI and Justice Department initially pressed the case forward .
Their law enforcement efforts and internal deliberations work were largely invisible to the American public , but many sent letters urging that the American Zionist Council be registered as a foreign agent .
On Nov. 21 , 1962 , before the full extent of the stealth PR and lobbying campaign was publicly exposed in Senate hearings , the head of the DOJ's Internal Security Section , J. Walter Yeagley sent a two - page letter and foreign agent registration forms [ .pdf ] to the American Zionist Council by certified mail .
The DOJ formally demanded that the Israel lobby 's top umbrella organization openly register and disclose all of its U.S. activities as an agent of influence .
The AZC at the time — as the nonprofit umbrella corporation for the Zionist Organization of America , Hadassah , and other elite Zionist organizations in the United States – was the Israel lobby .
It was almost completely dependent upon Jewish Agency - directed funds , some with special earmarks from the executive in Jerusalem to AIPAC founder Isaiah L. Kenen .
Other recipients of the funding included New York Times media personalities , exiles from the shah 's regime in Iran living in the U.S. , tenured professors at Harvard , and authors active in churning out hundreds of " scholarly " books about Arab terrorism and Israel 's special role as an ally to the U.S. in the Cold War .
The Justice Department , directed by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ( RFK ) , insisted that the AZC register as the Jewish Agency 's American foreign agent .
RFK and his top advisers felt the documented funding flows had " compromised " the lobby so much that they would quietly agree to file registration statements and disclosures .
They did not count on the lobby 's response .
The lobby saw the registration demand as an " extinction - level event , " like one of Hollywood 's massive asteroids cinematically falling toward Earth .
The lobby 's outside lead counsel , Simon Rifkind of the firm Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison , was apoplectic : FARA registration would be a " noose around the neck of his client " and " choke the very life out of it .
The lobby 's response was quiet , asymmetrical , and successful .
The parallels with the 2005 - 2008 AIPAC espionage saga are uncanny .
In 2005 , the Department of Justice 's chief prosecutor on the espionage case , Paul McNulty , was suddenly and inexplicably promoted within the DOJ after he backed off on criminally indicting AIPAC as a corporation .
That would have led to AIPAC 's immediate demise as a going concern , just as earlier indictments doomed Enron and Arthur Andersen .
A February 16 , 2005 defense team communication between Rosen 's lawyer , Abbe Lowell , and Nathan Lewin , AIPAC 's legal counsel , revealed that U.S. Attorney Paul McNulty " would like to end it with minimal damage to AIPAC . "
Lewin further told Lowell that McNulty was now on AIPAC 's side " fighting with the FBI to limit the investigation to Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman and to avoid expanding it .
After discussing restricting the scope of the prosecution with AIPAC 's lawyer and shortly after handing down only individual indictments ( Aug. 4 , 2005 ) , McNulty was nominated to the position of deputy attorney general on Oct. 20 , 2005 .
He was sworn into office on March 17 , 2006 .
Why McNulty fought so hard to restrict the scope of the FBI 's investigation is now less of a mystery .
He was simply following the successful career path first blazed by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach 40 years earlier .
Back in the 1960s , Katzenbach had also suddenly risen within the DOJ , becoming attorney general on Jan. 26 , 1965 , after he helped unwind the Israel lobby FARA registration demand within the DOJ .
During the calamitous period after the Cuban missile crisis and John F. Kennedy 's assassination , Katzenbach brokered an unprecedented deal .
The American Zionist Council could register a " sample " Foreign Agent Registration
Act declaration for a " representative " time period of its own choosing .
Unlike every other filing open for public inspection at the FARA section , the AZC 's would be kept in a special folder , with a secret name key linking the individuals and entities receiving Jewish Agency funding kept separate from the disbursement filing .
This deal was derisively referred to as " the caveat " within the FARA section .
It was the DOJ's and America 's first and only " nonpublic " FARA disclosure .
Many dedicated members of the FARA section , such as Nathan Lenvin and Irene Bowman , fought hard against this corruption of their transparency mandate .
They lost .
The Israel lobby 's meager disclosure and internal files about the incident were classified and kept secret , only released under the Freedom of Information Act on June 10 , 2008 .
This subversion of the very essence of FARA heralded its subsequent demise as a serious buffer between Congress , the executive , and the American people and Israel 's stealth lobbying campaigns .
Analysis of the core documents related to the case reveals how seriously the Israel lobby managed to compromise the U.S. Department of Justice 's enforcement efforts while it was vulnerable – during the Johnson administration 's 1964 reelection campaign .
FARA now serves only to pick off the most tangential of foreign schemers out of favor with the administration , such as those laundering Venezuelan " campaign contributions " through the U.S. to Argentina .
The showdown with the Israel lobby and subsequent lobby - driven amendments gutted serious FARA enforcement in the early 1970s .
This calamity also produced an unprecedented career opportunity for Isaiah L. Kenen .
Until the FARA battle , he was a long - term public relations operator for the nascent Israel lobby .
The investigation traumatized Hadassah and the ZOA and exposed them to serious legal risks ; it necessitated a corporate reshuffling because the need for an elite organization to spearhead Israel lobbying was still acute .
Folding the AZC would leave a power vacuum in Washington .
The AZC 's stealth lobbying programs and public relations activities were subsequently transferred to a fledgling organization originally established as a unit within the AZC that was internally referred to as " the Kenen Committee .
This became the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
Its prerogatives have expanded such that in light of history , trade secrets theft and eventual run-ins with election law , not to mention the Espionage Act , now seem all but inevitable .
The Justice Department 's reticence to prosecute AIPAC , given its painful but secret FARA experience , seems understandable , though not necessarily forgivable .
The approaching criminal prosecution of Rosen and Weissman is no doubt again considered an extinction - level event by AIPAC and the rest of the Israel lobby , even in its highly robust present configuration .
The lobby will have little time in 2009 for another cumbersome reorganization to rebuild credibility , not with soaring military aid demands , concerns over Iran , and its need to secure a semi- permanent U.S. military presence in the heart of the Middle East .
But there is one problem .
As years pass , it has become more difficult to score any viable legal strategy for dismissing the criminal case against Rosen and Weissman that would appear legitimate to the American public .
The case docket [ . pdf ] reveals many defense team attempts to throw the case out on technical quibbling and how much classified U.S. national security information Rosen and Weissman may expose in their defense .
Time also reveals that presiding Judge T.S. Ellis has been neither cowed by the potential graymail that typically plagues cases involving classified information nor intimidated by the lobby 's allies in the news media .
Both the Republican and Democratic parties desperately need this case to go away long before the next president is sworn in .
From their standpoint , it would be unseemly to have U.S. officials subpoenaed and actually put on the witness stand to reveal how Middle East policy is really crafted in the height of an election season dominated by narratives of hope , change , and restoring integrity .
But hiring away the U.S. attorneys prosecuting the case , always a viable strategy , is now pretty much exhausted .
One key member of the government 's prosecution team has already left for the private sector .
The Jewish Telegraphic Agency , formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of the Jewish Agency , recently called out for a popular uprising in Rosen and Weissman 's defense .
But like the Wall Street Journal 's own earlier editorial page clemency plea directly to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , it has produced no tangible results .
It is now up to the president himself to pardon Rosen and Weissman and end the trial before it can begin .
If President George W. Bush waits to pardon Weissman and Rosen until shortly before leaving office , it would be too late for AIPAC 's most precious asset : its reputation as an entity engaged in lawful activities .
The administration also has an overriding self - preservation interest in seeing this case vanish : it is the singular judicial process for determining whether AIPAC goes too far in agitating for wars – whether in Iraq , Lebanon , or Iran .
For Americans a trial would be a very healthy process for determining whether powerful Washington think tanks and corporate news personalities blithely trafficking in our most sensitive national defense information for their own profit should ever be held accountable .
But in the waning days of the Bush administration , short - circuiting public accountability for war decisions and the system that produces them is now the overriding doctrine .
The pressure is on .
Judge Ellis approved subpoenas for Douglas Feith and Paul Wolfowitz as well as National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , and Richard Armitage to appear as witnesses for the defense .
Pardoning AIPAC would mean that Col. Lawrence Franklin , a member of Douglas Feith 's infamous Pentagon policy shop and a crucial witness for the prosecution , walks free .
The decision to let the Israel lobby walk in 1965 was three years in the making .
The initiative quietly gained momentum through similar appeals , stalling , and law enforcement delays .
It was finalized during regime change in Washington .
The calendar 's pages are now inevitably turning toward a brief , singular moment for another special Israel lobby deal from a sitting U.S. president , a president who has little to gain by such public exercises in justice , and much to lose .
However , unlike the secret Foreign Agents Registration
Act deal of the 1960s , a presidential pardon will be impossible to keep secret .
The possibility that a pardon could at last mass - mobilize the American people out of their unknowing tolerance for the lobby 's dangerous foreign subversions may even be reason to welcome it .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - American consumers ’ confidence fell in the latest week to just one point away from its all - time low , helped by a historical low in positive views on the buying climate , a survey showed on Tuesday .
The ABC News Consumer Comfort Index fell to - 50 in the week to August 10 from - 49 in the previous week .
Its all - time low was - 51 , reached in May .
The index components were mixed , with positive views on personal finances down 1 percentage point to 47 percent and those on the buying climate down 1 percentage point to a record 18 percent .
Views on the national economy were unchanged at 10 percent .
Earlier on Tuesday , Investor ’s Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence said their IBD / TIPP Economic Optimism Index climbed to 42.8 in August from July ’s 37.4 , which was the lowest reading in the seven - year - old survey ’s history .
Confidence measures are generally viewed as a barometer of consumer spending , which accounts for two - thirds of the U.S. economy .
However , economists note that consumers do not always act in accordance with their statements to surveys .
The ABC News consumer confidence survey was based on a sample of about 1,000 interviews conducted in the four weeks ending August 10 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
John McCain , calling himself a man of action like his hero Teddy Roosevelt , told a raucous crowd here Monday that he had helped lead the charge to pass the Wall Street rescue plan .
“ I ’ve never been afraid of stepping in to solve problems for the American people , ” McCain said to cheers and applause .
Two hours later , the bailout plan that McCain had boasted of working for was defeated in the House , with McCain ’s fellow Republicans siding solidly against it .
As the stock market plummeted on the news , McCain was forced to make a second and far more somber statement defending his work on the plan .
“ I worked hard to play a constructive role in bringing everyone to the table , ” he told reporters gathered at his next campaign stop , in Iowa .
He said he had helped shape the bill to lessen the risk to taxpayers .

The spectacular failure of the rescue plan in the House , and the stock market losses that followed , presented a challenge to both major presidential candidates , who had cautiously supported the plan and had attended a high - profile meeting with President Bush last week designed to advance a deal on the legislation .
After the plan failed , each candidate urged Congress to try again and called for a renewed spirit of bipartisanship -- even while the campaigns traded blame and barbs .
Though Obama said no one person was at fault in the financial crisis and that there was a “ lot of blame to spread around , ” he urged voters to consider McCain ’s record of favoring deregulation of the nation ’s financial markets as they weighed which candidate would best steer the nation ’s economic “ ship into port . ”
“ With so much at stake -- with our economy at risk , our children ’s future in the balance -- the greatest risk in this election is to repeat the same mistakes of the past , ” Obama said .
“ We ca n’t take a chance on that same losing game . ”

McCain also called for bipartisanship , yet he likewise criticized his rival .
“ Sen . Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary partisanship into the process , ” McCain said , referring to the failed House vote .
He continued : “ Now is not the time to fix the blame ; it ’s time to fix the problem . ”
McCain ’s campaign went further , with senior policy advisor Doug Holtz - Eakin placing the blame squarely on the Democratic presidential candidate and his party .
“ This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country , ” he said .

Obama spokesman Bill Burton characterized the statements as “ angry and hyper - partisan ” and said they were “ exactly why the American people are disgusted with Washington . ”
The candidates spent Monday rallying voters in the battleground states of Ohio and Colorado , which have a combined 29 electoral votes .
President Bush carried both in 2004 , but polls show they will be tight races in November .
McCain ’s running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , accompanied him to the Columbus rally before traveling to Arizona , where she will prepare for Thursday ’s vice presidential debate in St. Louis .
Palin said that she looked forward to debating Obama ’s running mate , Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware .
The two have never met .
“ But I ’ve been hearing about his speeches since I was in the second grade , ” she quipped .

2003 Programming Challenges Audio
At its best , computer science is an exciting blend of programming , mathematics , and problem solving .
This course will introduce an interesting variety of subjects in programming , algorithms , and discrete mathematics though puzzles and problems which have appeared in the International ACM Programming Contest and similar venues .
These audio lectures are derived from my course Programming Challenges taught at Stony Brook and based on the book Programming Challenges : The Programming Contest Training Manual by Steven S. Skiena and Miguel A. Revilla , Springer - Verlag , New York , 2003 .
Full lecture video from the 2009 version of the course is now available online !
You probably want that instead of the page you are looking at .
Lecture notes and audio for the 2003 version of the course :
GORI , Georgia 
In retreat , the Georgian soldiers were so tired they could not keep from stumbling .
Their arms were loaded with rucksacks and ammunition boxes ; they had dark circles under their eyes .
Officers ran up and down the line , barking for them to go faster .
All along the road was grief .
Old men pushed wheelbarrows loaded with bags or led cows by tethers .
They drove tractors and rickety Ladas packed with suitcases and televisions .
As a column of soldiers passed through Gori , a black - robed priest came out of his church and made the sign of the cross again and again .
One soldier , his face a mask of exhaustion , cradled a Kalashnikov .
“ We killed as many of them as we could , ” he said .
“ But where are our friends ? ”
It might be a geek thing , but since I was a teen and started playing with computers I have always admired the box of video cards .
They always had some beautiful graphic art .
Dragons , knights and other creatures that inspired my fantasies about the games I would play .
Thinking about that I decided to create a collection with pictures of video card boxes .

Neanderthals were not as stupid as they have been portrayed , according to a study showing their stone tools were just as good as those made by the early ancestors of modern humans , Homo sapiens .
Scientists who spent years learning how to make replicas of the stone instruments used by Neanderthals and Homo sapiens have found the Neanderthal tools were just as efficient as anything made by Stone Age man .
And researchers believe that the demise of the Neanderthals – which has often been explained by the supposed inferiority of their technology – could not have come about solely as a result of their stone tools being worse than those of their rivals .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long - held assumption that Homo sapiens were more advanced than Neanderthals .
It is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why Neanderthals became extinct , " said Metin Eren , a graduate student at Exeter University .
" Technologically speaking , there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other .
When we think of Neanderthals , we need to stop thinking in terms of ' stupid ' or ' less advanced ' but more in terms of ' different ' . "
Neanderthal man lived in Europe for about 300,000 years , surviving a number of ice ages before disappearing completely about 25,000 years ago , about 10,000 years after the arrival of modern humans in Europe .
Why the Neanderthals disappeared has been an enduring mystery but studies on DNA extracted from ancient bones suggest they died out without interbreeding with the new arrivals to Europe .
It is likely that the two species of humans competed against each other for limited resources in the same habitat , with Homo sapiens being the victor .
However , the study on the stone tools used by both species suggests that the competition was not as one - sided as some anthropologists had believed .
The Neanderthal flint tools were broader and thicker than the somewhat smaller and finer - bladed tools of Homo sapiens but they have turned out to be no less efficient , Mr Eren said .
The scientists , from Exeter University , the Southern Methodist University in Dallas , Texas State University and the Think Computer Corporation , analysed museum specimens of stone tools and learnt how to make exact replicas by knocking flakes off flint stone .
" After many years of learning how to do it , we did a number of analyses of efficiency and found that Neanderthal tools are no less efficient , and indeed in some respects were more efficient than the tools of Homo sapiens , " Mr Eren said .
" It was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings . "
The study , published in the Journal of Human Evolution , measured how long it took to make the tool by the process of flint knapping , how much waste was produced in making it , the sharpness of its cutting edge and for how long it lasted .
One problem still remains – why did Homo sapiens switch from the type of tool technology used by the Neanderthals to something that was different but no more efficient ?
Mr Eren said that the switch to a more streamlined technology during the time that Homo sapiens began colonising Europe may have played a role of social cohesion by giving the tool makers a shared identity .
" Colonising a continent is n't easy .
Colonising a continent during the Ice Age is even harder .
So , for early Homo sapiens colonising Ice Age Europe , a new shared and flashy - looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded , " Mr Eren explained .
" Thus , during hard times these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance , ensuring exchange and trade among members of the same team , " he said .
Phew , what a scorcher :
The world 's hottest chilli pepper - the Dorset Naga - comes to Tesco
Its lethal effects include burning eyes , streaming nose , uncontrollable hiccups and much , much worse .
And it is about to be sold at Tesco .
The world 's hottest chilli pepper , the Dorset Naga , will be available in 10g sachets containing up to three tiny fruits , at a price of 89 p .
Red hot :
The notorious Dorset Naga , which is being launched across the UK by Tesco
‘ The Dorset Chilli is something only absolute connoisseurs of very hot food and those with asbestos - lined stomachs should even consider trying .
‘ However , that said , there are an increasing number of chilli heads as they are officially known , that not only savour but endorse these tiny vegetables as being beneficial in helping sweat out the body ’s toxins .
‘ We trialled them in our test kitchens and even the hardest blokes in our team were brought to their knees .
‘ Anyone brave enough to try the Dorset Chilli will definitely be yelling " Ooh argh " . ’
The tiny ingredient was recently used to make the world ’s hottest curry , a Bollywood Burner in a London restaurant .
In the last year , brave Brits have splashed out £ 9 million on chillies , ranging from the fiery Scotch Bonnet and Bird ’s Eye to the milder green , red and Orange Topaz varieties .
Mr Corbett added : ‘ Chilli pepper culture in the UK has really come on in the last few years and they are no longer thought of as a culinary novelty .
‘ In the past we used to primarily stock chilli peppers in areas where there was a large Afro- Caribbean or Asian community but nowadays we sell them in stores right across Britain . ’
The Dorset Naga will be sold in 10g sachets which contain up to three chillis .
They cost 89 p per sachet .

KABUL , Afghanistan — American soldiers herded the prisoners into holding pens of razor - sharp concertina wire , the kind that ’s used to corral livestock .
The guards kicked , kneed and punched many of the men until they collapsed in pain .
U.S. troops shackled and dragged other prisoners to small isolation rooms , then hung them by their wrists from chains dangling from the wire mesh ceiling .
Former guards and prisoners whom McClatchy interviewed said Bagram was a center of systematic brutality for at least 20 months , starting in late 2001 .
Yet the soldiers responsible have escaped serious punishment .
The public outcry in the U.S. and abroad has focused on prisoner abuse at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , but sadistic violence first appeared at Bagram , north of Kabul , and at a similar U.S. internment camp at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan .
Pattern of abuse
The eight - month McClatchy investigation found a pattern of abuse that continued for years .
The abuse of prisoners at Bagram has been reported by U.S. media organizations , in particular the New York Times , which broke several developments in the story .
But the extent of the mistreatment , and that it eclipsed the alleged abuse at Guantanamo , has n’t previously been revealed .
Guards said they routinely beat their prisoners to retaliate for al - Qaeda ’s Sept. 11 attacks , unaware that the vast majority of the prisoners had little or no connection to al - Qaeda .

One person on Long Island just bought a ticket to heaven – by anonymously donating a $ 3 million winning lottery ticket to his or her church .
The mystery miracle worker handed the scratch - off ticket to Pastor Bert Crabbe at the True North Community Church in Port Jefferson Station last month , with the intention the cash be used for the benefit of the congregation .
Crabbe said the massive windfall was truly manna from heaven , since the church had become too small and desperately needed to be expanded .
During a sermon last month , Crabbe recalled , “ I said that unless God drops a couple million dollars on us , we ’re going to have to rent somewhere else .
I actually said that . ”
The church will now get $ 102,000 per year – after taxes – for the next 20 years .
Crabbe said his lawyers will be looking for a way to get some of the money withheld by the lottery refunded , because the church is a nonprofit .
“ It ’s a miracle , ” Crabbe said .
“ When someone gives away $ 3 million , that ’s a miracle . ”
He said he was stunned when the donor called him over for a visit in late July and told him about the winning Bada Bling game scratch - off ticket , which was purchased at a store in Middle Island .
Like Doubting Thomas , the 34 - year - old pastor would n’t believe it until he saw it .
Then the person – Crabbe would n’t say if it was a man or a woman – retrieved the ticket from a safe deposit box and handed it over .
“ Seeing the actual ticket added some finality to it , ” Crabbe said .
“ I was just amazed by their generosity .
I think this person really believed in what we ’re doing at this church . ”
After getting the ticket validated by the lottery , Crabbe told the congregation of its good fortune at services this past Sunday .
The church ’s current building on Terryville Road only holds about 200 people .
Now the church can erect a building big enough to hold the whole 650 - person congregation .
Crabbe said that the church will also give some of the money to charity .
He said that some of the dough will go to a group called Love 146 , which works to fight human trafficking .
True North is the sort of hip , new church where the pastor keeps a blog and sermons are available for downloading on its Web site .
Crabbe even talks about what ’s on his iPod ( “ Breakfast in America ” by Supertramp ) .
Despite this , Crabbe did say he had to assure congregants the church had not plunged into betting as a way to raise money .
“ Obviously we do not endorse gambling , ” he said .

The first bit of “ Fusion ” that AMD is releasing today is an in - house designed software utility that was described to us as being able to “ turn a mainstream PC into a lean , mean gaming machine . ”
Essentially , this Fusion Gaming tool is a utility that automates many of the tweaks that hardcore enthusiasts carry out in order to free up system resources for the purpose of maximizing gaming performance .
The utility works by temporarily disabling background services and processes , freeing up memory and CPU cycles in an effort to make games run more smoothly .
AMD demonstrated the application to us clicking the gigantic “ Fusion ” button on a Windows Vista desktop , which immediately shut down usually active applications such as Skype , Google Talk , as well as many other background services .
The utility will not , however , override any applications that have a shutdown or save dialog , meaning that clicking the button will still allow Microsoft Word to prompt if you wish to save before closing .
This utility would be of great use to those who use shared computers , whose family members may have installed many unwanted , useless programs that clog up the system .
Those with prebuilt machines with preloaded bloatware may also find that the Fusion button does wonders to free up system resources .
AMD told us that the software is careful not to disable any crucial services that might make the system unstable , but does carry with it a disclaimer that it may disable security and antivirus software – though the utility setting does allow for custom settings so that the user may fine tune to his or her liking .
Besides just reducing system overhead , the Fusion tool also helps to boost performance by incorporating other tweaking tools , such as Auto - Tune for both CPU and ATI GPU , overclocking with AMD Overdrive .
AMD also introduced a “ Hard Drive Acceleration ” setting , which enables the SATA mode of performance over quiet .
The AMD Phenom X4 9550 Black Edition processor used as part of the demo went from a stock 2.6 GHz to 2.8 GHz , which is a conservative and safe measure for mainstream users .
Those wanting to go a bit more hardcore can set more aggressive settings .
The enthusiast user , however , likely wo n’t find as many advantages in using the tuning utility .
The extreme PC gamer will already run a tight ship with tweaked settings and a lean OS free of excess processes .
While not being marketed as such , the tuning tool may also be applied in the other applications when pure speed is n’t the main goal .
AMD said that users can set up profiles where the goal is to achieve low power consumption or decreased noise output for applications such as a home theater PC .
Regardless , the AMD Fusion tool makes isolating the full power of the system easier than ever , and is the first demonstration of the chipmaker ’s new company direction .
Those with AMD and ATI systems can download a beta version of the utility here , found on the new AMD Fusion site .

My wife and I were thumbing through our first quarter financial statements recently and like many people experienced a rough first quarter .
In our 401 ( k ) accounts , we each have our share of investments that are in the red for the year .
For my wife , one of those investments is a mutual fund that she just bought recently .
She ’s a bit of an emotional investor and like a lot of people who have experienced an immediate loss in one of their investments , she ’s ready to sell .
What she said to me was representative of what I think too many people in this situation feel – “ Once it gets back to what I paid for it , I ’m going to sell it . ”
So let me get this straight .
She does n’t like the investment , does n’t want to be in it , but is willing to hang on to it long enough to get back to the point where she bought in ( which could take weeks , years , or may never even get back to the original purchase price ) .
Why would she do this ?
It ’s what psychologists refer to as “ loss aversion ” .
The concept is that individuals will much more strongly prefer to avoid losses than achieve gains .
In the mind of the investor in this circumstance , selling at a loss is the equivalent of admitting a mistake and for many admitting they made a mistake is a difficult thing to do .
For my wife , the aversion to loss is so strong that she would rather hold on to an investment that she dislikes ( and could consequently be accepting inferior returns for ) than sell and move that money to a different investment .
Traditional finance theory would argue that my wife should base her decisions in the context of our entire portfolio as well as our current circumstances and goals and ignore cognitive biases such as loss aversion .
After all , if the fund she wants to sell is still a logical fit in our overall portfolio and is still considered a quality investment , why would n’t she contemplate hanging on to it despite its recent losses ?
The answer , of course , is that people are not logical .
They make emotional decisions that can potentially derail a good long - term plan .
It ’s only when people can understand and overcome these biases that they truly can become better investors .

Today ’s Denver Post / Politico Convention Conversation between House Majority Whip James Clyburn , former Virginia governor Douglas Wilder , Illinois Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. , media commentator Tavis Smiley , and author Dr. Cornel West can be summed up in four words : caution , hope , anger , and pain .
Caution
Is the country ready for a black president ?
Yes , according to every member of the panel .
But blacks in particular and America in general have to be cautious .
Barak Obama being smeared by friends and enemies alike .
Expectations for Obama ’s presidency been elevated to such a level that , in the words of Smiley , “ Jesus Christ himself ” could n’t meet them .
And the election of a black man born of privilege who has chosen to identify with the trials and tribulations of blacks will not end the era of “ black politics ” .
West and Smiley both pointed out – repeatedly – that an Obama presidency gets black communities one step closer to an equitable America .
But only one step .
Thus caution by blacks and all opponents of racial inequality is warranted .
But there was another kind of caution being espoused by Jackson , a type of caution for the panelists and others in their position : the world is watching , and all the careful , articulate language in the world might not be enough to undo the damage done by the rhetoric of anger .
Anger
And both West and Smiley in particular are very angry .
Given the history of blacks in the United States , they have a right to be .
There ’s no doubt that they ’ll continue being angry after the election whomever wins .
And that ’s a good thing , because when West talks of “ niggerizing ” brown people throughout the United States , or calls Jim Crow laws “ American terrorism ” , or when Smiley talks about how the so - called “ Bradley effect ” has resulted in good black candidates losing their elections , the anger in their voices lends strength to their convictions .
You know that , come Hell or high water , these men will fight on until they win or die trying .
We cannot ignore them , or allow others to ignore their ire however they might try , because the anger of West , Smiley , and millions of others like them is based in a history of slavery , racism , and segregation that has left too many blacks with anger as the only outlet for their anguish .
Pain
Jackson said it twice during the panel , and it deserves to be repeated again – let no one misunderstand the panelists ’ anger for hatred of whites , but rather as an outlet for generations of pain – Jim Crow , Jena , Louisiana , Hurricane Katrina , Jackie Robinson facing jeering fans .
Hope
Obama ’s stock in trade has , until recently , been hope .
But Jackson pointed out that Obama can run his campaign focused on hope and winning the next state instead of winning his delegates because of the black candidates who went before him .
Obama , like all of us , stands upon the shoulders of those who came before – Rev. Jesse Jackson , Ref. Al Sharpton , Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , and countless others including at least two of the panel members ( Wilder and Clyborn ) .
Wilder suggested that an Obama presidency could ultimately create a new era of politics not just for blacks , but for America as well .
And Jackson pointed out that the evolution of the Democratic party – the party that once supported segregation and slavery – shows that America is a place where “ we can create the America we ought to be . ”
Environmentalists , LGBT activists , blacks , latinos and latinas , and other progressive activists have pinned their hopes to Barak Obama , and he may yet deliver upon those hopes .
I certainly hope so .
But in the words of Dr. West , Obama represents “ the last , best hope for America – at the moment . ”
UPDATE : Link is fixed .
Grrr .
Good to know bigotry is alive and well in the Democratic party in Kansas .
This is rather disgusting .
I hope we ’ll be hearing soon from the DNC and Kansas Democratic governor Kathleen Sibelius .
Democrats do n’t gay - bait .
And when they do , like Kanasas ’ Gail Finney , they need to be shown the door , loudly and publicly .
The DNC and Governor Sibelius would n’t stand for Democratic candidates , let alone party officials , using race - baiting or attacks on Jews or other minorities , and we assume they ’ll be just as vocal in defending gay and lesbian Democrats ( and considering the other stories circulating right now , this does n’t help ) .
I sincerely hope this woman Gail Finney is n’t credentialed to attend the Democratic convention .
Feel free to contact the local Democratic party here .
Have you eve wondered what goes behind the scene , before a car actually goes into production ?
What are the steps in the design process ?
How is it done ?
Each time I see a video showing the making of a car , I become fascinated with the whole process and to me , this behind the scene documentary is more exciting than the actual official launch .
Continue Reading Below
With this being said , would n’t you love to see what went behind the scene of the all new 2009 BMW 7 Series ?
Behind the design of the BMW 7 Series
7 Series Interior designer Nader Faghihzadeh seen here taping
The design of the new BMW 7 Series : the result of keen competition among the best creative designers .
The BMW Group ’s process of designing a new vehicle and finding the ideal shape is based on a concept of keen competition .
In the development of each new model , several design teams compete with one another in their design of the exterior and interior in a truly creative contest .
Made up of designers and modellers , the teams then , in the second phase of the design process , complete models in original , 1:1 size clearly showing the aesthetic harmony of the car ’s proportions and surfaces .
To do this they use a simple but very important material in the design process – clay .
It is indeed fair to say that only a few car makers attach such great significance to 1:1 models and refine them in such a unique , highly detailed manner .
To conclude this phase in the design process where intuitive and creative design interacts with a straightforward , methodical approach , the clay models are covered with a special film similar to the subsequent paintwork of the final car .
This allows the beholder to realistically consider and judge not only the car ’s proportions and dividing lines , but also and in particular the surface of the modelled sculpture under all kinds of different light conditions , ultimately choosing the model which fulfils all requirements and complies with the target vision in every respect .
Following the verification of technical requirements already completed by this time , the decision - makers are able to focus in full on aesthetic and emotional aspects in judging and appraising the design models .
On the successful design of the new BMW 7 Series , the model which ulti-mately won the contest , the concepts of natural presence , superior sportiness and precise elegance , as defined in advance , were all implemented in ideal harmony .
The most significant and striking expression of the car ’s presence
is the extra-large , upright and particularly low - slung kidney grille dominating the front end of the car and seemingly standing upright within the body .
The elegant character of the saloon is accentuated above all by the shoulder - line at the side stretching from the headlights via the door openers all the way to the rear light clusters .
The rear view , in turn , emanates a combination of power , sportiness and supremacy , the rooflines flowing down dynamically along the flanks of the car to the bumpers and horizontal light edges emphasising the sheer width of the car .
The interior design likewise follows the philosophy of inviting , modern style and charming function , the structure of the cockpit , the choice of materials , the lines themselves and the colour scheme all interacting to give the new BMW 7 Series its characteristic overall look .
The result of this consistently applied design concept is an ambience focusing on generosity , superior command of the car , and modern luxury all in one .
The final design phase : optimisation at the highest level .
Enhancing the design chosen into a series production car is an equally demanding and challenging task .
After all , a sculpture refined by human skill and style is converted in the third and final phase of the design process into a product reproducible by machines in the production process .
The first step in this case is to convert the clay model in a CAD design process by laser scanning into a three - dimensional feasibility model serving from now on as the technical reference point for ongoing development .
From now on the final phase of the design process means optimisation at the highest conceivable level .
Each and every detail is fine - tuned to the last millimetre in a constant exchange among designers , engineers , modellers and production specialists in order to ensure perfect implementation of the premium standard on the final product in each and every detail .
At this point the designers and modellers show all their creative passion on both the exterior and interior , searching for perfection and proving their finesse in the refinement of all surfaces and lines .
Such refinement of the original design not only enhances individual details to the highest standard following the concepts of specialised design teams , but also serves to perfect the overall impression of the new vehicle so crucial to the car ’s design and its emotional impact .
Like every other BMW , the new BMW 7 Series owes its unmistakable character clearly recognisable at very first sight from every perspective to this process of ongoing enhancement and refinement .
The front end :
clear structures and generous surfaces ensuring natural presence .
Seen from the front , the new BMW 7 Series offers a clear , calm and collected appearance through its large and smoothly designed engine compartment lid .
The contour lines on the engine compartment merge into one another at the front , pointing towards the BMW kidney grille just like the headlight units peaked towards the inside .
The kidney grille itself sticks out far to the front , ensures a precise and clear - cut look , and is integrated in the front air dam without any seams or openings in between .
At the same time the kidney grille , through its upright bars , accentuates the vertical stance of the front end as an essential element giving this new luxury performance saloon particular presence and calibre .
The wide air scoop at the bottom extends across the entire front air dam all the way to the sides .
Foglamps in clear glass look positioned far to the outside at the edge of the air intakes serve to additionally emphasise the wide track of the car .
This special look is further accentuated by a chrome band bordering on the air intake at the top .
Generously designed dual round headlights , as yet a further feature , ensure that concentrated look again so typical of BMW .
Indeed , this particular look is outstandingly striking on the new BMW 7 Series , resulting , first , from the corona rings for the daytime driving lights and , second , from an additional lights bar positioned on top of the dual round headlights like an eyelid to provide a particular optical effect at the top .
Yet another new design feature is the direction indicators formed by eight LEDs on each side and arranged in two upright rows at the outside next to the cylindrical light units .
Sculptural surfaces and precise lines at the side .
Modern design of the various surfaces giving this luxury performance saloon truly unmistakable character is yet another feature characteristic of BMW in general and the new BMW 7 Series in particular .
The combination of skilled craftsmanship , precise technology and a perfect feeling for the unique flair of a BMW creates a truly unique sculptural effect .
The interplay of concave and convex surfaces so typical of BMW generates highly effective light and shade lines accentuating both the powerful and dynamic expression and the refined elegance of the car in every respect and from every angle .
A good example is the side area appearing to grow out smoothly and gently towards the rear wheel of the car , without a typical wheel arch in the conventional sense of the word .
The subtle enlargement of the side area created in this way is a particular result of the work done on the clay model and therefore a product of the close and highly effective cooperation of designers and modellers practised within the BMW Group .
Design features and refinement of this calibre call for decades of experience and supreme competence in finding the right design and in the subsequent production of the car ’s body .
The long shoulder line adds further elegance to the side view of the car .
Directly beneath this precisely chiselled line the side surface is carefully modelled in a highly attractive convex look , while further down on the doors the side surfaces take on a concave curvature .
Again even further down , this surface borders on the high - rising doorsill line .
Interacting with one another , the shoulder and doorsill lines give the car a particularly sleek and stretched look from the side .
And at the same time the high - rising doorsill line adds the impression of a particularly slender and athletic body .
A chrome - plated gill insert complete with fully integrated side direction indicators between the front side panel and the driver ’s and , respectively , front passenger ’s door adds a further visual effect and touch of style .
The character line of the wheel arch merging gently and smoothly into the doorsill line starts at the front edge of the side gill which , as a particular proportional feature on sporting cars , accentuates the long distance between the front axle and the instrument panel .
Many other details confirm the clear focus of BMW ’s designers on precision and individual variability , thus highlighting selected design features in particularly subtle style .
The headlight units and rear light clusters of the new BMW 7 Series , for example , just like the side window graphics , are surrounded by frames literally chiselled into the surface of the body .
This again confirms the high standard of craftsmanship and the perfect command of even the most complex production processes BMW has achieved over the years .
In particular , this effect emphasises the reverse line at the bottom of the C - pillar well - known as the BMW “ Hofmeisterknick ” .
The window graphics are exceptionally elaborate and , at the same time smooth and sleek thanks to the particular design and look of the chrome bar surrounding the glass surfaces and made in one piece .
The side view of the BMW 750Li and the BMW 740 Li again boasts all these particular design features .
With their wheelbase extended by 240 millimetres or almost 9.5 ″ , these long - wheelbase models give even greater emphasis to the superior comfort and , indeed , sheer luxury offered on the rear seats .
The extra body length is provided entirely along the rear doors , thus ensuring particularly comfortable and convenient access to the car .
Both long - wheelbase models furthermore feature a uniquely designed roofline and C - pillar contours giving the car a side view clearly related to that of the standard - wheelbase saloon and combined with extra headroom on the rear seats .
Horizontal lines at the rear for a particular touch of power and supremacy .
The sculptural design of the car ’s surfaces also ensures smooth transition of the side panels into the rear end of the new BMW 7 Series .
The striking character line , for example , continues into the lights cover on the rear - light clusters where this particular design is taken up by the graphic design structure .
The rooflines flow across the flanks of the car right down to the bumper , encompassing the rear end by dynamic lines again providing a particularly sporting touch .
Horizontal lines and light edges , in turn , help to give the rear end a particularly powerful and superior overall look .
The chrome band positioned above the numberplate support and connecting the entire width of the bootlid from one light cluster to the other is a particularly striking feature .
The light edges on the luggage compartment lid and the rear bumper then run parallel to the chrome band , which also surrounds the rear light clusters .
The sheer width of the rear end is highlighted and accentuated both by this additional structural design of the rear bumper and by the two reflectors positioned far to the outside .
The two - piece rear light clusters on the new BMW 7 Series again boast the L - shaped contours so typical of the BMW brand .
Inside , the rear lights are dominated by wide , horizontally arranged light bars in a three dimensional look rising up from the inside to the outside and thus following the contours of the light units .
Fed by LEDs , the light bars generate a warm and homogeneous lighting effect .
The direction indicators also feature LED technology , just as the third brake light positioned on the upper edge of the rear window and the numberplate illumination use light - emitting diodes .
Modern , luxurious , inviting : the interior .
The interior design and configuration of the new BMW 7 Series combines all features and characteristics destined to make both active motoring and the shortest or longest ride in this outstanding saloon a truly impressive and highly enjoyable experience .
Gently flowing contours , high - class materials and stylish colour combinations create an aura of generosity and seductive , modern style in a truly unique ambience .
The clear , driver - oriented structure of the cockpit offers ideal conditions for a truly superior experience in the car .
Intuitive arrangement of the controls and instruments , in turn , makes it even easier for the driver to mastermind all functions easily , smoothly , and without the slightest confusion .
The new BMW 7 Series expresses its individual character also through its modern interpretation of luxury , appropriate use of high - class materials in conjunction with excellent quality of finish enhancing both the exclusive flair of the car and the charming function of the interior .
Apart from the car ’s unique space and grace with more than generous kneeroom , headroom and elbow room meeting the highest standards at both front and rear , the particular design of the interior in the new BMW 7 Series conveys the impression of luxury in truly convincing and modern style .
The entire ambience is exclusive and sophisticated – and , in particular , very inviting .
Clear horizontal and vertical arrangement of all controls and instruments again serves to optimise the orientation towards the driver , successfully integrating highly complex technology and a wide range of functions within the car .
The controls and instruments required directly for motoring are clear and well - known to the driver right from the start , with intuitive control also of elementary comfort functions such as the ventilation , air conditioning and audio system .
The very positive initial impression conveyed by the car ’s interior is immediately enhanced by the high - quality , sophisticated materials used throughout the passenger compartment as well as the distinctly exclusive quality of finish .
The result is a calm , convincing and , indeed , overwhelming ambience making it easier for the driver and the passengers alike to find their orientation and feel pleasantly at home .
Right from the start , the driver encountering the new BMW 7 Series will be thrilled by the feeling of controlling the most sophisticated high - performance technology in a truly exclusive ambience .
The instrument panel is split up into several levels one above the other , separated by horizontal lines running parallel across the entire width of the interior .
Both the instrument cluster and the Control Display come on one level , just below the decorative trim likewise extending across the entire width of the instrument panel and comprising the controls and buttons for all major functions .
The controls border at the bottom on a chrome bar , again providing a touch
of class emphasising the horizontal orientation of the cockpit .
Thanks to the use of innovative display and surface technology , the Control Display does not require the usual binnacle protecting the instrument
from sunglare – yet another touch promoting the clear tranquillity and smooth structure of the cockpit .
Cockpit design for more superior motoring .
The horizontal subdivision of the instrument panel makes a significant contribution to the ease of control and safety at the wheel the driver will enjoy so much .
This effect is then further enhanced by the sensible and there - fore easy - to - remember vertical arrangement of the instruments and control units .
All information and controls relevant to the process of driving the car are on the side facing the driver , while all displays , controls and switches serving to provide comfort functions are positioned more to the middle of
the car .
The arrangement of control units on the multifunction steering wheel follows the same logic , again giving the driver supreme security and ease of control at the wheel .
In order to take up information or activate a function , the driver is required – if at all – to only briefly take his eyes off the road .
On the other hand there is no need to spend a long time looking for buttons and switches used only rarely , since all controls are positioned clearly where they should be in logical arrangement .
As an important example in this context , the driver assistance controls suppor - ting the driver in his perception of traffic conditions and his awareness at the wheel are positioned appropriately on a control panel in the immediate vicinity of the lights switch centre .
This clear structural arrangement of the cockpit gives the driver superior routine within a very short time also in the use of additional functions not required under all conditions .
Hence , the wide range of technical features and options offered by the new BMW 7 Series is experienced as an enrichment of the driving experience , immediately giving the driver supremacy at the wheel of the BMW 7 Series without the slightest effort or learning process .
Ideal combination of ergonomics and aesthetic design .
The driver - oriented design and configuration of the centre console is yet another feature typical of BMW .
Slightly inclined towards the driver , the centre console houses the control units for , among other features , the air condi-tioning , the audio system volume control , and the iDrive favourite buttons .
In their design and configuration , the Controller and its direct selection buttons were influenced by both aesthetic and ergonomic considerations .
When using the Controller , the driver ’s arm is in a similar position as when operating the selector lever on the automatic transmission , the comfortable position on the armrest enhancing the standard of motoring comfort and facilitating precise operation of the Controller .
Being smaller in diameter than on the first generation of iDrive , the Controller , together with the direct selection buttons arranged in the immediate vicinity , enables the driver of the new BMW 7 Series to set and mastermind the functions desired with minimum movements of his arm or hand .
Black panel technology : well - known feeling , new options .
The innovative – if not to say , revolutionary – design of the instrument cluster offers new and extremely versatile options in presenting information important to the driver :
For the first time the entire instrument cluster incorporates black panel technology as a high - resolution colour display presenting status and function data , navigation data , information from the Check / Control , feedback from the various control switches and Service Interval information in four circular dials arranged in the traditional style of a sports car .
When not in use , the display forms a smooth , homogeneous , black and stylishly glowing surface where only the chrome - coloured surrounds open to the bottom , the needles and scales on the circular instruments as well as the red warning zone in the instrument panel are constantly in place and there - fore permanently in sight .
The needles on the circular dials , in turn , together with the integrated displays for current fuel consumption and the car ’s range , are presented electronically and therefore only become visible , like all other symbols on the display , when activated .
In developing this solution absolutely unique in the world of motoring , BMW ’s designers were inspired by high - tech products in entertainment electronics .
The result is an ideal combination of mechanical and electronic data feedback .
The circular dials providing information on road and engine speed as well as the fuel supply and engine oil temperature all come in the style and look of a classic cockpit and , as styling elements , form an analogy to the corona rings on the headlights now so typical of BMW .
Through their well - known structure and arrangement , the scales facilitate the uptake of information , while the indicator needles moving in the rev counter and speedometer provide direct feedback on the driver ’s actions .
And with their surrounds and indicator needles being positioned as three - dimensional elements on the otherwise flat display surface , their significance to the design of the overall concept receives particular emphasis .
Black panel technology also featured in the air conditioning display on the centre console serves to present a wide range of information in clearly legible and visually attractive form .
The superior function of the instrument panel is furthermore enhanced by the variable use of the individual zones in the display , with the driver thus being able to focus consistently on information and data particularly relevant in each specific situation , concentrating even more than usual on road and traffic conditions .
Colours and trim : harmonious , puristic , finished in perfect craftsmanship .
The configuration of the cockpit is further enhanced by the design of the individual elements , the colour scheme , and the choice of materials .
The horizontally arranged colour and trim scheme on the dashboard continues into the doors and from there on throughout the interior .
The door panels are also finished in decorative trim bordering on a chrome bar at the bottom .
The upper door panel forms a sweeping line along the bottom edge reaching its lowest point at the B - pillar and then rising again gently towards the rear .
In combination with the armrests hinting exactly the opposite orientation , the complete door section forms an elegant combination of exciting surfaces and features .
The interior of the new BMW 7 Series combines the most sophisticated materials and excellent quality of finish in supreme craftsmanship and ultimate precision .
Visible seams along the instrument panel and the doorsills , as well as the central air vents in dual surrounds , again bear testimony to the great attention given to each and every detail .
The instrument panel comes as standard in a newly developed soft skin material featuring an extra - soft surface reminiscent of the grain otherwise to be found only on the very best leather .
This exclusive touch is further accentuated by the black colour scheme and the double seam finish .
Special nappa leather on the instrument panel is available as an option .
The perfect blend of design and function is also borne out , by way of example , by the integration of the door openers in the chrome trim on the door panels .
And forming part of the decorative trim , the door closing handle on the door panel combines superior elegance with practical function .
Unique : controls and switches made of high - tech ceramics .
The wide range of interior colours , trim surfaces and seat upholstery available offers the customer absolute freedom of choice in living out his – or her – personal style in customising the car .
Through an appropriate combination of colours and trim , the customer is able , for example , to accentuate the classic , sporting , elegant or prestigious character of BMW ’s new luxury performance saloon .
And regardless of the material chosen , the chrome bar serving as a particular highlight on the lower edge of the trim surfaces adds a further touch of sophisticated style .
BMW is the first car maker in the world to use high - tech ceramics as a particu - larly sophisticated material for selected control units .
Replacing the galvanised metal otherwise used on such components , this special ceramics material is available as an option on the iDrive Controller , the electronic gear selection lever , as well as the rotary knob on the automatic air conditioning and audio system .
This special material so far used only on particularly exclusive mobile phones or other high - tech appliances , is not only particularly strong and massive , but also conspicuously cool and , at the same time , pleasant to feel and touch .
The paintwork on the new BMW 7 Series is available in no less than twelve colours , four of which were developed especially for BMW ’s new luxury performance saloon .
New colours in the range are Mineral White Metallic and Milano Beige Metallic as well as Sophisto Grey and Imperial Blue in brilliant effect finish generating a constantly changing play of colours under direct light .
BMW 750Li and BMW 740Li : setting a new standard in rear - seat motoring comfort .
The interior of the BMW 750Li and BMW 740 Li offers ideal conditions for an even higher standard of long - distance touring comfort .
The extra space provided by the longer wheelbase benefits the rear - seat passengers in full , while the uniquely styled roofline provides additional headroom at the rear .
Clearly , this enhances the Sheer Driving Pleasure so typical of BMW by the further special luxury of being chauffeured whenever the customer wishes or , alternatively , still enjoying the actual driving experience itself .
The pleasure of being driven in a chauffeured saloon is enhanced to an even higher standard by the option to choose the rear passenger area with two single seats and a console in between .
These single seats adjust up to 79 millimetres or 3.1 ″ in length and provide individual seat bottom and backrest angle adjustment as well as individual adjustment of the headrests .
And to provide the final touch , the roof lining on the long - wheelbase version of the new BMW 7 Series comes with two vanity mirrors featured as standard .
Further optional features are automatic air conditioning at the rear with separate control , additional air vents in the roof lining with their own control elements , seat ventilation and massage seats as well as two different versions of BMW ’s high - end entertainment system for the rear complete with a DVD player and two monitors integrated in the front seat backrests .
The entertainment functions are masterminded either by remote control or by an additional iDrive Controller in the centre console at the rear , enabling the rear - seat passengers to actively contribute to their personal enjoyment and motoring experience .

After having worked with Java ( and earlier C++ ) for a number of years , I have been working with Python for the last few months .
Since I came to Python from Java , I thought it might be useful to share my experiences , which might be of interest to many programmers .
This is not intended to be a language or feature comparison or something that contrasts the various advantages or disadvantages , but is intended to reflect on the softer aspects of how it feels to write Python programs .
Hence I have refrained from including code snippets and other programming constructs in this post , but if you believe I am unclear in some of the comments I am making , do let me know and I shall be glad to update the post or write a new one as required .
Programming is Easier and Enjoyable
I think the most dominant impression from the last few months is that python does make programming feel a lot more easier and often more enjoyable .
The feeling is not very different between riding a bicycle without gears then riding one with gears .
In the latter case one just feels one can cover a lot more distance much more easily though any physicist will tell you the actual effort is not particularly different .
It just feels like one has a much bigger toolbox ( ie a wider assortment of tools ) to work with and therefore the task seems simpler .
Why do I think that way ?
I believe the following features of python do help ( in no particular order ) :
Concise Coding style :
The code typically is much more concise , with much lesser verbosity
Dynamic typing :
You really do not need to worry about declaring data types and making sure the inheritance hierarchies especially for all the interfaces and implementations well laid out .
The various objects do not even need to be in the same inheritance hierarchy - so long as they can respond to the method , you can call it .
This is a double edge sword , but that does n't take away the fact that programming under dynamic types environment does seem a lot easier .
Easier runtime reflection : Java seems to have all the reflection capabilities but I think these are just way too painful to use as compared to python .
In python the entire set of constructs ( classes , sequences etc. ) are available for easy reflection .
In case you need to use metaprogramming constructs , python really rocks .
More built in language capabilities :
Items such a list comprehensions , ability to deal with functions as first class objects etc. give you a broader vocabulary to work with .
Clean indentation requirement :
It took me about 2 - 3 days to get over it but , it seems that python code is much easier to read since if you do not indent it correctly it will be rejected .
Need to spend time on understanding how to write code in Python
One of the statements I have heard in different contexts is that Java programmers when they start using python write it as if they are writing a java program using python syntax ( unpythonic in python parlance ) .
This actually took me a fair amount of time to understand .
I did look at a lot of other python code to attempt to understand this in greater detail .
I realised that python offers many more capabilities than java and that as a person who had written java code earlier , I was able to be immediately productive using the constructs in python which mapped onto the equivalent constructs in java easily .
However it did take a long time to be able to start using the other constructs .
One of the exercises that did help was to get away from the problem at hand and try to work on something entirely different ( especially a program which had a strong algorithms element to it with complex data structures ) , and slowly review each line with how it might be better done in python .
I realised it is easy to start coding in python but it takes some effort and time to start using the entire python toolbox effectively .
While I reviewed other programs written in python , I did think there was one area where the prior exposure to java helped .
Class design .
I am not sure if this was an issue with the programs I read and thus there was an issue with the sample references I used .
However while these helped me understand how to write code in python differently , I have a strong feeling that the programs I wrote were much stronger in terms of class design .
There are many situations especially given the fact that python supports both function oriented programming and object oriented programming , where one wonders what is a better way to design the logic in a particular context .
I thought it generally made sense to use proper class based design and use the functional constructs in situations which started getting a little loopy or algorithmic .
No Compile Cycle
Another thing I really enjoy about python is - no compile cycle ( its implicit ) .
So while in the middle of my editor , I could exit to the shell prompt , run the source immediately without trying to deal with an ant script in between which compiles java code and then recycles the web application .
This has boosted my net productivity quite a bit .
Productivity
So are the statements that one can be 5 to 10 times more productive in python supported by my experience .
While I have n't gotten through the full life - cycle yet , prima facie I do believe 5 times does seem like a good number .
However I would introduce the following caveats .
It will not happen for your first project .. more like your second project onwards , primarily since it does require a lot of effort to start understand how to write pythonic code and that does take away a lot of those benefits initially .
Secondly it does not factor in refactoring .
Point refactoring is much much easier in python , but bulk refactoring is much much more difficult since automatic refactoring is tough .
Thus when I am refactoring , I sometimes feel I was able to get it done faster in python , but in many other cases I thought I ended up taking a lot more time .
Switched to python completely ?
Not really .
But I feel happy I have more options available to me .
One thing that really sucks is the poor refactoring capabilities .
This is unlikely to be an issue with python alone and is likely to be an issue with all dynamically typed languages .
However if you want to use dynamic languages , be prepared to spend some more effort during refactoring since many of the automatic refactoring capabilities you may have gotten used to , may not be available .
The other issue is performance .
Java wins hands down on performance by a big margin .
If I have to ever get back to another project where performance was particularly important and the primary constraint in performance was not network or disk IO but was likely to be the CPU , and it would be acceptable to substantially reduce development productivity in order to get the performance gains , I shall be found to be writing Java code for certain .
The next project I work on , I am likely to " first " evaluate whether python fits the bill and switch to other languages if I do not find it appropriate enough .

SAN FRANCISCO  Dark green chard plucked from a makeshift garden in front of City Hall ; soft cheeses spread on freshly baked whole - grain bread and served in exhibition halls ; farm - raised free - range chickens carved , seasoned and roasted .
Mix together .
Yield : one revolution .
At least that is the hope of organizers of this weekend 's inaugural " Slow Food Nation " convention , so named to represent the spectrum opposite fast foods .
HEALTH BLOG :
The skinny on fitness and nutrition
That means foods that are " delicious , wholesome , fresh " — and sustainably grown , says Alice Waters , owner of the world - famous Chez Panisse Restaurant in Berkeley and founder of Slow Food Nation .
About 50,000 people are expected to gather throughout the city for three days of lectures , concerts and , of course , meals .
Events range from the free organic demonstration garden planted temporarily in front of City Hall to paid lectures by top authors and foodies to a demonstration on how to properly carve a chicken .
Many sessions will be filmed and uploaded in a few weeks to YouTube , Waters says .
" This is going to be a coming of age of American food , " Waters says .
With epidemic rates of obesity , diabetes , global warming and ecological degradation , " we need a new food system in America .
We need a new food system that supports the people who are taking care of the land , supports the small farmers , that feeds the children something that 's nourishing . "
Waters hopes many such events will spread to other American cities .
The promoted foods are organic , wholesome and often a lot more expensive than processed fast food — a fact that has caused some to criticize the movement as elitist .
But people need to reprioritize food — much as they did in the 1940s before processed fast foods took over , says Slow Food Nation executive director Anya Fernald .
" This is an event to birth a more political food movement .
We 're operating in a context where it 's become blatantly obvious that we 're eating ourselves to death in America . "
But , she says , reprioritizing our food — putting it ahead of luxuries like cellphones and expensive shoes , perhaps — will not only be healthy .
It also will be " joyous . "
" We pay upfront to eat food that 's good for us , " Waters says , " or we pay out back in our health costs . "
This is a really old k5 diary that I ’m proud of .
The original post is here .
I made some minor edits .
The bratty and unhelpful HR troglodyte just called and said she forgot to mention earlier that I ’ve gotta take a pre-employment drug screening .
Now I gotta go and piss in a goddamn cup .
She ’s unhelpful because so far , she ’s been unable to answer even one of my questions about vacation , benefits , health insurance or retirement without putting me on hold and asking somebody else first .
She ’s bratty because she does n’t like how I ask her to explain the nonsensical corporate jargon she throws out ; I think she ’d prefer that I just trust her judgement about my options rather than try to comprehend them myself .
Anyway , she should have told me about the drug test two weeks ago when I got the offer .
Now I gotta get to the new city a few days ahead of my original time so I can excrete urine for these fuckers .
Dogs urinate as a sign of submission .
Maybe that ’s how this drug - testing thing got started ; it ’s just a way to break the worker ’s spirit right off the bat .
I tend to glaze over when libertarians fuss about stuff like grocery store club cards , or Radio Shack asking for my address .
I agree with them , but I do n’t really get upset about it .
But pre-employment drug tests really make me mad .
It ’s not what you ’re thinking .
I ’m clean , man .
Just like our president , I can pass the FBI background check that examines the last seven years .
And I doubt these tests really accomplish anything , anyway .
It ’s not as if American productivity shot up after employers started screening new hires .
Almost any of the tests can be easily circumvented .
They ’re just another sign that we ’re slowly giving our dignity away .
I ’m not mad because I think drugs ought to be legal .
I do n’t really care anymore about whether they should or should n’t be illegal ; they are illegal , and most likely , they ’re going to be illegal for a really long time .
People might as well rant about bad weather .
Furthermore , I would n’t touch them anyway .
I do n’t like being treated like a criminal .
Drug screening places are always shitty hellhole offices , with employees that are unhappy at the fact that they handle piss all day , so they take it out on the poor saps that need work bad enough to submit to this degradation .
This job did n’t perform a credit check ( well , at least not to my knowledge ) but I ’ve been asked to grant permission for those for other jobs .
My sister had to take a lie detector test in order to get a promotion at one job .
Where does it fucking end ?
Will firms send out investigators to root around houses of job applicants and look for anything that might mark them as a bad employee ?
Why not profile family members and find out if any of them indicate a family predisposition towards deviance ?
Maybe future junior partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers will have to go out and kill some nameless victim in order to make it to full partner ; that way , the company always has something on them .
It ’s days like this that make me want to cash out my retirement and head out of town , buy a farm , and live off the grid .
But that ’s not really very safe anymore either , right ?
A bunch of bored ATF assholes would probably come after me .
A friend warned me not to eat any poppy - seed muffins before the test .
That got me thinking .
In some other parallel universe , I ’m gonna look up every drug analog possible and eat all of them : poppy seeds , cough syrup , cranberry juice , etc , and try to grand - slam that drug test .
I want a goddamn siren to go off because of everything I ( falsely ) test positive for .
Based on the results , doctors will want to know how I can remain standing .
But in this universe , I figured out what I ’m gonna do .
I ’m going on an all - asparagus diet the week before my test .
My piss is gonna stink so bad , lab techs will have to wear masks or risk losing consciousness .
They ’ll have to close the place down to fumigate .

Sixty three years ago today , on August 6 , 1945 , at 8:15 in the morning , the American B - 29 bomber Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb over the center of the city of Hiroshima , Japan .
Hiroshima was the first target ever attacked with nuclear weapons in the history of the world .
The bomb exploded about 200 yards over the city , creating a 13 kiloton explosion , a fireball , a shock - wave , and a burst of radiation .
On the day that the bomb was dropped , there were about 255,000 people living in Hiroshima .
The explosion completely incinerated everything within a one mile radius of the city center .
The shock - wave and the fires ignited by the explosion damaged or completely destroyed about nine - tenths of the buildings in the city .
Somewhere between 70,000 and 80,000 people–about one third of the population of the city–immediately died .
The heat of the explosion vaporized or burned alive many of those closest to ground zero .
Others were killed by the force of the shock - wave or crushed under collapsing buildings .
Many more died from acute radiation poisoning – that is , from the effects of having their internal organs being burned away in the intense radiation from the blast .
By December 1945 , thousands more had died from their injuries , from radiation poisoning , or from cancers related to the radioactive burst or the fallout .
It is estimated that the atomic bombing killed about 140,000 people , and left thousands more with permanent disabilities .
Almost all of the people maimed and killed were civilians .
Although there were some minor military bases near Hiroshima , the bomb was dropped on the city center , several miles away from the military bases on the edge of town .
Hiroshima was chosen as a target , even though it had little military importance , because
It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged .
There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focussing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage .
1 . Hiroshima was also one of the largest Japanese cities not yet damaged by the American firebombing campaign .
Military planners believed it strategically important to demonstrate as much destruction as possible from the blast .
Thomas Ferebee , a bombadier for the United States Army , was the man who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima .
His commanding officer was the pilot of the Enola Gay , Paul Tibbets .
Tibbets and Ferebee were part of the XXI Bomber Command , directed by Curtis LeMay .
LeMay planned and executed the atomic bombings at the behest of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and President Harry Truman .
Kengo Nikawa died on August 22nd , 1945 because of the bombing .
This is his pocket watch .
We will never know the names of many of the 140,000 other residents of Hiroshima who were killed by the bombing .
We have only estimates because the Japanese government was in a shambles by this point in the war , and countless records , of those that were successfully kept , were consumed by the flames , along with the people whose lives they recorded .
The late , great Utah Phillips called this one of the first songs he ever wrote that ever made any sense .
It ’s certainly one of his best .
Enola Gay Look out , look out
from your school room window
Look up young children from your play
Wave your hand
at the shining airplane
Such a beautiful sight is Enola Gay
It ’s many a mile
from the Utah desert
To Tinian Island far away
A standing guard
by the barbed wire fences
That hide the secret of Enola Gay High above the clouds
in the sunlit silence
So peaceful here I ’d like to stay
There ’s many a pilot
who ’d swap his pension
For a chance to fly Enola Gay What is that sound
high above my city
I rush outside and search the sky
Now we are running
to find our shelter
The air raid sirens start to cry What will I say
when my children ask me
Where was I flying upon that day ?
With trembling voice
I gave the order
To the bombardier of Enola Gay Look out , look out
from your school room window
Look up young children from your play
Your bright young eyes
will turn to ashes
In the blinding light of Enola Gay I turn to see
the fireball rising
My god , my god all I can say
I hear a voice
within me crying
My mother ’s name was Enola Gay Look out , look out
from your school room window
Look up young children from your play
Oh when you see
the war planes flying
Each one is named Enola Gay .
– U. Utah Phillips ( 1994 ) , on I ’ve Got To Know
As far as I am aware , the atomic bombing of the Hiroshima city center , in which forces acting on behalf of the United States government deliberately targeted a civilian center and killed over half of all the people living in the city at the time , remains the deadliest act of terrorism in the history of the world .

If you 're new to the Loom , you may not be aware that I have a thing for science tattoos .
It 's been exactly a year since I noticed a tattoo on the shoulder of a friend who 's a geneticist at Columbia .
The tattoo was DNA , and it spelled his wife 's initials in the genetic code .
So I wondered aloud if there were other scientists who had inked themselves with science , and the answer was a shockingly loud yes .
In fact , I was soon inundated with so many pictures of tattoos ( and enlightening stories behind them ) that I had to separate them from my old blog to keep them organized .
The tattoos have become fodder for stories in places like New Scientist and Wired .
Now that the Loom has arrived at Discover , I 'm bringing them back into the fold .
Right now you can look at them here as a gallery , or as a category of blog posts .
We 'll be fine - tuning the interfaces , and all comments on them are welcome .
I 've got a backlog of tattoos that I 'll be posting here , but if you 've got one , please send it along with some explanation .

Bill O'Reilly has officially lost it .
In his warped little mind , bloggers who organize and engage in public advocacy for causes they believe in like universal healthcare and an end to unnecessary and dumb wars are the same as Klansmen who used to lynch black people .
Seriously .
How can you logically make that connection ?

WASHINGTON , Sept. 29 ( UPI ) -- GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin will be at what a campaign aide called debate camp this week to prepare for a debate with Sen.
Joe Biden , D - Del .
The Alaska governor will spend two and a half days at Republican presidential nominee John McCain 's home near Sedona , Ariz. , preparing for Thursday 's debate in St. Louis with Barack Obama 's running mate , CNN reported Sunday .
Plans had called for Palin to be in St. Louis for her debate preparation .

The aide who called Palin 's debate preparation a debate camp told CNN the campaign decided to take the candidate to Arizona because it is an " invigorating and enjoyable place to prepare " for the vice presidential debate .
The aide said it was McCain 's idea .
Palin has been preparing for the past four days in Philadelphia .
Plans call for Palin to take a break from debate preparation Monday so she can attend a rally with McCain in Ohio , CNN said .

The mighty Starbucks coffee empire has been handed a heavy defeat by thousands of small Australian cafes in the fight for a nation 's taste buds .
Not all Starbucks in Australia have failed Eight years after it began selling its espressos and frappucinos in Australia , the US giant has succumbed to powerful financial and cultural pressures and has closed 61 of its 85 shops across the country .
Savouring a morning cup of coffee has become a ritual for millions of Australians - yet one that Starbucks failed to capitalise on , in spite of the way the chain had become a global cultural phenomenon during the 1990s .
" It was maybe too standardised , " says Michael Edwardson , a consumer psychologist in Melbourne .
" Early on it was unique and different , but as it became a global chain the standardisation made it lose some of that coolness and edginess .
It was quickly copied and lost its lustre . 
Not unique
In America , Starbucks became an icon very early on .
There , it represents this " third place " , which is not home and not work , but somewhere to hang out , according to Mr Edwardson .
" Towns would want to have a Starbucks , " he says .
" Australia was never like that .
We were curious about it .
We 'd read about it .
It was something to try .
" But once tried I do n't know that it offered a particularly fantastic or unique experience that was n't offered by other chains . 
In the end , Starbucks ' Australian adventure was undermined by countless High Street cafes , each striving to carve out a sustainable niche .
We have the most cosmopolitan society in the world
Barry Urquhart , retail consultant
Soon it became clear that the US coffee juggernaut , with its frothy , milky brew , was unable to meet the challenge of the local stores ' homespun hospitality and boutique qualities .
" The coffee experience is two things , " says John Roberts from the University of New South Wales .
" Firstly , it 's the product and the taste and secondly the place and the service .
" It 's much easier for the local store to differentiate itself as being local whereas Starbucks had this slightly schizophrenic positioning where it wanted to be the global , local store ,  he said .
Starbucks management said it is refocusing its business in Australia 's three biggest cities ; Sydney , Melbourne and Brisbane .
Cosmopolitan society
While the company is blaming underperforming stores , analysts say it expanded its operations in Australia too quickly and accumulated too much debt .
There 's no question Starbucks in many ways is an admirable company
John Roberts
University of New South Wales Hence , Starbucks never managed to build solid foundations in a cut - throat trade , according to Barry Urquhart , a retail consultant based in the Western Australian state capital Perth .
" It is a competitive marketplace , " he points out .
" The American , Seattle - based coffee of Starbucks was never going to resonate and penetrate Australia 's very big coffee drinking community .
" We have the most cosmopolitan society in the world . "
With more than 235 ethnicities speaking more than 270 languages and dialects , companies wanting to get ahead in Australia should be aware that they are not dealing with one monolithic block , Mr Urquhart explains .
" You have to recognise that and service differing needs . 
Success for some Starbucks may be on the retreat in Australia but marketing experts see a brighter future elsewhere .
Starbucks is one of the nicest coffees that I 've tried
British backpacker Gemma Morris
" There 's no question Starbucks in many ways is an admirable company , " says Mr Roberts .
" Starbucks has done very well in international markets where there has not traditionally been a coffee drinking culture , " he adds , pointing to how it has done well in Japan and China .
" Starbucks has shown its skill at developing new markets , " Mr Roberts says .
And even in Australia , there are those who will miss it when it is gone .
" Starbucks is one of the nicest coffees that I 've tried , " says British backpacker Gemma Morris .
" It 's a stronger taste , which I like .
It 's a unique experience and it's renowned for being good which is why people love it . "
Others though felt somewhat underwhelmed by Starbucks .
" It 's okay , but there are privately owned cafes that I 'd rather go to , " says Peter , 32 , who works for a landscape design company in Sydney .
" This whole big chain thing does n't really do it for me .
The coffee 's pretty ordinary . "

What are these ?
Aboriginal children who lack words for numbers above two can still count the number of objects in a set , and can even perform basic arithmetic , according to a new study .
Previous studies had suggested that words for specific numbers are needed for children to develop the concepts of numbers above three .
But the new research suggests that humans may have an innate " number competency . "
Says lead researcher Brian Butterworth : " We 're born with the ability to see the world numerically just as we 're born to see the world in colour "
[ BBC News ] .
The researchers tested Aboriginal children between the ages of 4 and 7 , as well as a control group of English - speaking children from Melbourne .
The Aboriginal children spoke the languages Warlpiri and Anindilyakwa , which lack a vocabulary for numbers beyond words for one , two , few , and many .
" It 's not just that these cultures lack the words for numbers : they just do n't count things , " said Butterworth .
Nevertheless , the kids counted just as well -- and often better -- than their English - speaking counterparts ....
" I see it as part of a larger issue , " said Butterworth .
" What kinds of cognitive tools are provided by culture , and what is provided by us when we come into the world ? " [ Wired News ]
In the experiment , which was reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [ subscription required ] , the
children were asked to " copy " the number of objects the researchers placed on a mat .
They then had to repeat the exercise when objects were added under a cover - so they could not see how many objects were now there but had to work it out .
In the most complex task , the children had to match the right number of counters to the number of times the researcher banged two sticks together [ BBC News ] .
Study co-author Robert Reeve says the results may indicate that humans are born with a " number sense " that allows them to intuitively understand the basic rules of counting , addition , and subtraction .
Reeve adds that the study also has implications for the way numeracy is taught to very young children .
" Much of our education is currently based on language , " he says .
" We need to ensure that there is a mapping between these basic concepts and the concepts you 're trying to teach " [ ABC Science ] .
Take a look at earlier findings on the relation between counting and language among Amazonian people in the DISCOVER article , " Counting Without Numbers . "

Today , The Pirate Bay reached a new milestone , as they now have more than 3 million registered users .
On top of that , they track close to 15 million unique peers .
The largest BitTorrent tracker just keeps growing and growing , and there is no sign that this will be put to a halt anytime soon .
When this article is published , The Pirate Bay now tracks nearly 1,288,514 torrents and 14,786,539 unique peers .
As a comparison , in December 2006 they tracked 576,080 torrents and 4,274,698 peers , so today ’s figures represent quite an increase .
TiAMO , one of Pirate Bay ’s co-founders and the one responsible for keeping the hardware up and running , is happy with the traffic increase , and writes :
“ A big thanks to all our users helping to make the site what it is .
We ’ll keep growing for as long as you keep using the site , filing it with content , sharing . ”
This traffic increase is apparently placing quite a lot of stress on their server park .
In July , the site went offline for more than a day , as the server setup had trouble keeping up with the ever - growing demand .
It is estimated that The Pirate Bay currently returns results to between 7 and 8 million searches per day , roughly 230 million a month .
The popularity of The Pirate Bay has n’t gone unnoticed with artists either .
Timbuktu , a well known Swedish rapper released his latest single exclusively on The Pirate Bay earlier today .
Free of DRM , high quality and free to share and remix of course .

SAN FRANCISCO  Alex Payne , a 24 - year - old Internet engineer here , has devised a way to answer a commonly asked question of the digital age : Is my favorite Web site working today ?
In March , Mr. Payne created downforeveryoneorjustme.com , as in , “ Down for everyone , or just me ? ”
It lets visitors type in a Web address and see whether a site is generally inaccessible or whether the problem is with their own connection .
“ I had seen that question posed so often , ” said Mr. Payne , who perhaps not coincidentally works at Twitter , a Web messaging and social networking site that is itself known for frequent downtime .
“ Technology companies have branded the Internet as a place that is always on and where information is always available .
People are disappointed and looking for answers when it turns out not to be true . ”
There is plenty of disappointment to go around these days .
Such technology stalwarts as Yahoo , Amazon.com and Research in Motion , the company behind the BlackBerry , have all suffered embarrassing technical problems in the last few months .

Your Music & Audio Professionals
Welcome to Solomon ’s Music , your source for information on all things music .
From the home recording studio and learning various instruments , to audio production and engineering – we cover it all !
Solomon ’s Music offers helpful insights on all aspects of audio production and musical instruments .
With all the many musical tools available , we are here to help you accomplish the task at hand and make it sound fantastic .
We provide detailed product reviews and comparisons , so that you can make an informed decision when you decide to make a purchase .
Musical Instruments
The heart of any music begins and ends with a musical instrument of some sort .
This is where it all starts .
Granted , the advent of digital audio has allowed for many instruments to be played through a different medium .
Whether that is a blessing or a curse will depend on the musician .
Whether you look at an electronic drum set or a synth , digital instruments have come a long way .
Nonetheless , making an interesting sound , and maybe even an iconic sound , is the goal .
The guitar is almost certainly the most popular musical instrument , and is widely distributed throughout the world .
Guitars come in an amazing variety of styles , shapes and sizes .
Nearly every type of guitar can be divided into smaller subcategories that will have varying appeal to particular musicians .
These subcategories dictate the features like the guitar ’s tuning and build quality .
Two of the most well - known subcategories are electric guitar and acoustic guitar .
One of the most popular designs is the acoustic electric , which takes advantage of acoustic volume and presence while also being capable of plugging into a sound system and sending direct signal to an amplifier .
You do n’t need to spend a fortune , and a good quality acoustic electric guitar for beginners can sound surprisingly good .
For more advanced musicians , taking a step up to the best acoustic electric guitar under $ 500 will make a big difference .
In the typical band ensemble , bass guitar is another essential instrument that fills out the lower sound frequencies and serves to reinforce the rhythm along with the drum set .
Bass guitar does not grab the spotlight like lead guitar , but is no less critical to carrying the melody and musical progression .
While one guitar might be popular for use as a rock guitar or blues guitar , most models are fairly interchangeable from one genre to the next .
It really depends on what the artists desires .
And for those airy sprinklings of unique sound , adding a taste of mandolin , ukulele , or even sitar can add layers that bring unique variety and contrast to your music .
More often than not , synthesizers are used both on stage and in the studio to generate a tremendous variety of sounds .
Modern synths can reproduce everything from stunning grand piano sounds , to strings and orchestral pads that fill the mix and provide depth with ambient sounds .
A full size 88 key keyboard will provide all the versatility and octaves a serious musician might need .
Of course nothing beats the real thing , and seeing your kids learn to play is invigorating .
Getting you child started with a beginner violin or any other instrument can lead to a lifetime of musical exploration .
Amplifiers
Amplifiers are the primary means by which musicians project sound from their instruments throughout the concert hall as well as their studio spaces .
Certain amplifier models possess sound characteristics that have become iconic .
Guitar amps and bass guitar amps are particularly well - known for their beneficial characteristics as touring stage amplifiers or studio amplifiers for recording purposes .
When it comes to on - stage amplifiers , keyboard amps are a different animal .
Offering many of the features common to instrument amplifiers , keyboard amplifiers also differ in offering multiple inputs for additional synths , vocals , or even drum sounds .
In this sense they are much like a beefed - up portable PA system .
Guitar amplifiers are n’t only for electric and bass guitar .
Some of the most popular amplifier models are those which offer specific features that tailor to acoustic guitars .
Of course without an acoustic guitar pickup you ’ll have a hard time running your guitar through an amp , so that ’s a good place to start .
A good number of amplifiers have almost become standard options in professional studio recording .
Names like Marshall and Ampeg have been staples in studio recording for decades .
But instruments amplifiers are not the only amps used in the studio .
Small amps can make a huge difference as well .
A quality mic preamp is a fitting example .
Nearfield monitors like the Yamaha HS Series have been gracing studio desks and appeasing the demanding ears of producers and engineers since the 70’s .
Aside from power amplifiers for live sound , amplifiers are used in a huge number of other applications .
From amusement parks to shopping malls and churches , nearly any modern building is designed with sound systems like in ceiling speakers to provide music and announcements throughout the facilities .
Home theater power amplifiers bring entertainment to life in the comfort of your home .
Whether you love sports , a good movie , or a heated online gaming session , a quality arrangement of in wall speakers can make all the difference .
If you need an economical upgrade , the very best budget subwoofer can add a lot to your audio experience without costing a fortune .
And impressing guests with a good night of entertainment is always enjoyable for all .
Add a quality karaoke machine into the mix and you can almost make magic happen !
Modern wireless sound systems have also changed many of the dynamics of a good sound system .
In the old days , quality sound was only possible by running wires from some type of amplifier to a speaker , but that has all changed .
Investing in the best bass Bluetooth speaker for your audio affections will allow you to bring the music and entertainment with you whether you are in the home theater , beside the pool , or in the car .
And a Bluetooth car amplifier can connect to your smart phone so your playlist follows you along whenever you need it .
Recording
As much as I love the sound of the old 2 inch tape , even I will admit that the world of music has seen incredible benefit from modern recording software .
Aside from professional uses , anyone with a decent pair of ears who wants to learn can acquire inexpensive , or even free recording software .
But you ’ll still need some essential home recording studio equipment like a suitable music production computer , and something to listen back with , like studio monitor speakers or a quality set of studio headphones .
When it comes to digital audio workstations , everyone knows Pro Tools .
But some of today ’s best DAW software can be found in studios running Reason , Fl Studio , Audacity , or even REAPER .
All of these are entirely capable of pumping out very high quality recordings as well , and even from the comforts of your parent ’s basement .
Just ask Billy Eilish and Owl City .
You ’ll definitely need an audio interface to record on your computer , but a quality home recording studio kit can take you further than you might initially think .
Add a quality midi keyboard controller into your production tool belt and you are ready to rock .
The days of the iconic recording studio might seem to be limited , as artists write , and even record their next hits from the tour bus .
But that ’s not to say that certain elements of the high - end recording studio are anywhere near obsolete .
Dialing in some sounds with software plugins simply cannot match the quality and capability of hardware .
Professional recording studios invest in considerable funding to make top tier hardware available .
A trip to the studio can save you from spending a fortune on the best microphone for recording vocals , among other very expensive hardware .
But for those assembling a home recording studio , investing in some of the basics like a large diaphragm condenser mic and a USB mic will help you cover a variety of needs , such as a acoustic guitar mic , tracking strings , percussion , among many others .
A reputable kick drum mic can just as easy double for micing a bass guitar cab .
Beyond capability , essential studio hardware is vital for experimentation .
Testing a variety of mics , amps , guitars , etc. wo n’t offer the same level of variety in the tour bus , or even the home studio .
And large spaces open up possibilities like orchestral arrangements , and recording large groups in rooms that have optimal sound quality with acoustic treatments built into the structure and properly applied throughout .
Not to mention , people with expertise who know how to extract specific sound frequencies from very expensive hardware .
Rather than spending several thousands on the very best mic preamp for vocals , you can rent the studio to track your vocals and save a ton .
Audio Gear
There is a vast ocean of accessories that find their niche within every tiny corner of the musical and audio needs of everyday life .
By nature , artists and music lovers seem predisposed to exploring new songs and technologies that enhance the overall listening experience .
For homeowners and business entrepreneurs looking for easy installation , outdoor wireless speakers are perfect for providing a warm listening environment for visitors and guests .
discovering the next intriguing sound that might become the signature of a hit song or an entire album .
Effects pedals like a bass DI box are one of the most common avenues to explore new and exciting sounds .
Readily available technology has provided the ability to produce video and audio projects from home , and reach millions of people through online venues .
Anyone with a driving interest can soon fond their self gathering accessories that are vital to accomplish the task they enjoy .
Its amazing what can be accomplished today and with very little startup money invested upfront .
If you are serious about music or audio production for any variety of media projects , then investing in home recording studio equipment is a process worth working at .
There are all sorts of essential accessories that you ’ll need to prioritize for your needs .
Getting your hands on the best laptop for music production and installing some good recording software is definitely the best place to start .
Of course , you ’ll need to listen back to your projects , so studio monitors and studio monitor stands are another vital piece of the puzzle .
For most home studios , reliable recording studio headphones are another essential piece of gear .
We look at those vital pieces of audio gear in more detail .
Anyone who has delved into the world of producing audio and video will tell you the demands it places on your computer .
You might be surprised to see how audio tracks can add up .
Mixing a large project can quite easily lead to tracks that number over one hundred .
After all , running side chain compression , or adding some low growl to the bass line is as easy as a few clicks of the mouse .
But all that need for processing power requires finding the best digital audio workstation for your application , so your hard work can reach it ’s fullest potential .
Often called a ‘ DAW ’ for short , any quality audio or video computer should be optimized for audio and video processing in order to track and edit reliably .
Keeping your expensive investments safe while touring from city to city is vital .
Risking damage to sensitive EQs , compressors , or video equipment is a real risk while traveling or loading gear .
A protective rack mount case can save your rack mount effects processor from suffering damage , and make moving your entire live sound system easier and safer for all involved .
And nothing brings the sense of freedom and expression to a live vocal performance like a wireless microphone .
But vocal quality is pivotal , so dependable vocal mics with a reputation for durability should be your primary focus .
Audio equipment is n’t dedicated only to the studio , or stage .
Smartphones are likely the most popular means of keeping your playlist close at hand .
Thankfully , even a cheap car stereo can provide a wireless connection via Bluetooth , so you can listen to your favorite songs and have hands - free calling while you are driving .
Intel has gained the upper hand once again in its continuing battle with Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) by launching a new line of chips specifically designed for laptop computers .
Intel promises that its new batch of chips will have better graphics - enabling abilities and a longer battery life .
Manufacturing chips that require less power and offer crisper high - definition video playback has proved to be a difficult balancing act for most processing companies in the past , especially since many new notebook computers are being released in smaller models .
The new chips will be packaged as part of Intel 's new Centrino 2 platform ; a bundle that includes a processor , a related chipset and a new wireless communication chip .
Intel has stated that those computers fitted with the new Centrino 2 bundle will have enough power to play a complete Blu-ray DVD movie on a single battery charge .
The chip company also hopes that the advancements made in these new chips will significantly improve the wireless connectivity of all notebook computers in the future .
( Source : theglobeandmail.com )
But what about desktop PC's ?
Analysts believe that the revenue generated from the sale of laptop computers will far surpass those of desktop computers by early next year .
Intel has now shifted their focus to bringing more power to mobile computing while conserving as much battery power as possible , given the size of the computer model the chips will be working with .
Initial efforts are proving to be highly successful for Intel .
Of the five new processors the company plans to roll out , three of them function using only 25 watts of energy .
While this may seem like only a small reduction ( considering the previous processors used 30 watts of energy ) the ability to conserve power at any level is a step in the right direction .
( Source : globetechnology.com )
Intel also plans to introduce a new long - range wireless technology called WiMax in the very near future .
The current plan is to introduce WiMax into the Centrino 2 bundle later this year .
As it stands , the release of the Centrino 2 will follow Intel 's launch of the Atom ; a chip designed specifically for smart phones and other mobile Internet devices .
With two new chipsets set for a mid -to - late 2008 debut , Intel is confident that their recent efforts will keep them ahead of the processing pack for quite some time .
Updated : The Factor has turned their attention away from attacking Daily Kos over and over again so that Bill O'Reilly could embark on a sick crusade against the Huffington Post over anonymous comments posted on Arianna 's blog .
BillO had his team of producers harassing her at the Take Back America conference yesterday before she went on a panel .
You know , coming after her , yelling , " why do you allow these to appear on the HuffPo ? "

Jan L. nailed it right on the head !
Reparations ?
I ’m waiting for my thank you !
You blacks would be naked and eating bugs if it were n’t for white people .
Name ONE successful society started by blacks .
Any sign of civilization in Africa was started by Europeans .
Any city in America with predominately black leaders is a cesspool .
Look at New Orleans , Philadelphia , D.C. , Detroit … Comment by David Tucker
I am sooo tired of hearing how the black man has been mistreated since he was shipped over here to help build America !
All I hear is them groveling over being victims .
They are the ones making themselves the victims with their attitude that whites owe them something for bringing their ancestors to the best country that has ever existed .
All my life I have only witnessed the blacks with their hands out to the government expecting it to give them everything they want and shouting racist if they do n’t get it !
No wonder most whites have the opinion that blacks are worthless , lazy sloths who know only how to make more babies and steal everything not nailed down .
Barak Lenin Obama , the big eared Muslim , is only fostering this “ wo is me ” attitude with his obvious prejudices .
I , for one , like my white race over that of any other , so does that make me a racist ?
I do n’t thing so .
The black man will not break free from his self - imposed shackles until he picks himself up , dusts himself off and begins to provide for himself just like every other race has done who came to this country .
Before the blacks can do this , however , they have to rid themselves of the likes of Jesse Jackson , Al Sharpton , Farakan , and the good reverend Wright .
Pretty insane comments .
H/t to Mike who alerted me to this and as he pointed out from FOX 's rules :
please note that all comments are moderated and therefore may not appear immediately after submission .
So these were deemed acceptable ?
Most liberal bloggers with open comments try their best to weed out horrible anonymous comments , but we miss some .
If we had millions of dollars at our fingertips to hire a huge staff to make sure outrageous stuff never appeared then they probably would n't .
Now that FOX News is sanctioning them , I guess the media will consider it a non-issue .
What say you , BillO ?
When painkillers became a common prescription for people who were suffering from an injury or medical condition , everyone in the medical community thought they were the best treatment available .
Although painkillers are quite effective with numbing pain and discomfort , they can also become a person ’s recreational drug of choice .
There are over 15,000 people that die on an annual basis by overdosing on painkillers , with over 12 million people in the United States abusing their use .
A painkiller addiction is a serious problem , and learning how to prevent one is essential .
Saying ‘ No ’ to Painkillers
The first thing that you can do to stop yourself from becoming addicted to an opioid or other types of pain medications is to deny prescriptions for them in the first place .
Consider the amount of pain that you are in , is it something that can be conquered by over the counter medication ?
If so , tell your doctor that you would prefer to be prescribed a non - habit forming painkiller .
You might even find that once you receive surgery or medical intervention , pain medications wo n’t be necessary at all .
Using Painkillers Sparingly
In the event that your pain truly is too strong to deal with by using over the counter medications or no medications at all , make sure that you sparingly use your painkillers .
Do n’t assume that your discomfort is going to get worse first thing in the morning so you begin taking a pill as soon as you wake up .
Wait until the pain is at the point where it ’s affecting your daily tasks and then take the medication as it is prescribed .
By using them sparingly , you are not giving your body a consistent dose of numbing , which helps to prevent addictions from happening .
It goes without saying that you should always follow your doctors advice as far as dosage is concerned .
Of course , there comes a point when painkillers like co-codamol are essential .
Co-codamol benefits from two painkillers in one tablet .
30 mg/500mg is the usual ratio of paracetamol to codeine .
You can buy co-codamol 30/500 in the UK with no prescription .
Following the Dosage
With popular media surrounding the use of pharmaceutical drugs among celebrities , it increases the curiosity of what painkillers can actually do .
Even though it might be tempting to take more than one pill at a time to achieve a desirable high , you may find yourself addicted overnight .
Your doctor prescribes you a certain dosage of pain medications for a reason and in most cases , the dosage you receive will help to numb most , if not all of the pain .
There ’s no need to double your daily dosage to help curb the uncomfortable feeling of your illness or injury .
If your medication does not seem to be working , talk to your doctor about a different prescription or dosage .

What exactly is a hyperbolic plane ?
David Henderson :
There are many ways of describing the hyperbolic plane .
In formal geometric terms , it is “ a simply connected Riemannian manifold with negative Gaussian curvature . “
In higher - level mathematics courses it is often defined as the geometry that is described by the upper half - plane model .
One way of understanding it is that it ’s the geometric opposite of the sphere .
On a sphere , the surface curves in on itself and is closed .
A hyperbolic plane is a surface in which the space curves away from itself at every point .
Like a Euclidean plane it is open and infinite , but it has a more complex and counterintuitive geometry .
The hyperbolic plane is sometimes described as a surface in which the space expands .
Can you explain what that means ?
DH : Actually that is true for many spaces , but it ’s true for hyperbolic space in a particular way .
Consider how circles on a surface behave .
If you think of a series of circles around a point on a regular Euclidean plane , as you draw larger circles , the length of the circumference increases linearly .
Now on a hyperbolic plane , the circumference of the circles does n’t just increase linearly , but exponentially .
The perimeter and also the area of the circles gets bigger much faster .
On a sphere , the circles get larger at first , but then as you go further they actually begin to get smaller .
On a sphere the circumference of a circle is always less than 2r , on a hyperbolic plane it is more .
A similar thing happens with the area , which also increases much faster in hyperbolic space .
So as you move away from any point on a hyperbolic surface you get exponentially more space , so to speak .
DH : Yes , and you can get an idea of that with the hyperbolic soccer ball model that was discovered by my son , Keith Henderson .
A normal soccer ball has spherical geometry and is made up of hexagons and pentagons .
Each pentagon , which has five sides , is surrounded by hexagons , which have six .
If you just stuck together a lot of hexagons you ’d get a plane , but in the soccer ball the presence of the pentagons pulls the hexagons away from flatness and the surface closes up on itself to form a sphere .
To make a hyperbolic surface , you replace the pentagons with heptagons , which have seven sides .
Now you have to put in seven hexagons for every five you had before , so instead of closing up , the surface opens out and curves away from itself .
Campaigners want China to continue cracking down on tiger poaching Illegal " tiger bone wine " is still being made and sold by some animal parks in China , say campaigners .
The Environmental Investigation Agency says staff at two parks offered to sell the drink , made from carcasses soaked in rice wine , to its researchers .
The trade in parts of the endangered species has been subject to an international ban since 1987 , and has been outlawed in China since 1989 .
Despite global conservation efforts , tiger numbers continue to decline .
There are an estimated 3,500 - 7,500 tigers left in the wild , compared with roughly 100,000 at the start of the 20th Century .
' Closed market ' sales
The UK - based NGO said its investigators found that the wine , deemed to be a health tonic to treat conditions such as arthritis and rheumatism , was being openly advertised at the parks .
Lifting the ban would increase demand and lead to a surge in poaching
Debbie Banks ,
Head of EIA 's tiger campaign Staff said the wine was made from tigers that had died after fighting with other big cats at the venues .
One park produced what they said was a government permit that allowed the sale of the tiger - derived wine on the premises , but the EIA researchers said it was not possible to verify whether the permit was genuine .
The EIA said a senior worker , when questioned by its researchers , said that she was aware that the tigers were a protected species and trading of any part of the animals " in the open market " was prohibited .
But the agency said that she went on to explain that the permit allowed " closed market " sales of the wine ; in other words , it could be sold from the park 's premises .
Debbie Banks , head of the EIA 's tiger campaign , called on the Chinese authorities to close down the illegal trade .
" We want other parks with similar tiger attractions to be investigated to see how widespread this tiger - bone wine - making practice is , " she said .
" We also want the authorities to give a clear message to the business community that this illegal trade will not be tolerated . "
Tiger farms Conservationists estimate that tigers now only occupy just 7 % of their historical range , primarily as a result of habitat loss , hunting and poaching .
End of the tiger tale ?
They believe that there are just 2,500 breeding adults left in the wild and without more resources made available to protect the animals , the cats face an uncertain future .
Since the 1980s , a number of " tiger farms " have been set up in China .
These establishments are believed to house about 5,000 captive tigers , possibly more than remain in the wild .
During last year 's high - level summit of the global Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) , the Chinese delegation raised the possibility of ending its domestic ban in order to allow the use of farmed tiger parts .
They argued that this would prove to be the most sustainable option because it would satisfy the demand from traditional medicine practitioners without threatening the wild tiger population .
Although this approach was supported by some conservation groups , others warned that it would undermine efforts by the Chinese government to curb poaching .
They said that it would be cheaper to kill a wild tiger than to rear a captive one , and it would be very difficult to tell the difference between the two .
" Lifting the ban would increase demand and lead to a surge in poaching , " said Ms Banks .
" It would be far too easy to launder their skins , bones and parts among those from legalised tiger farms .
This would effectively declare an open season on wild tigers . "

Missouri Police taser injured boy 19 times

Published : Saturday July 26 , 2008

KY 3 News ' Sara Sheffield reports on an injured teen from Ozark , Missouri who was tasered up to 19 times by police .
Passing motorists called Ozark police out of concern for the teen as he walked along the busy overpass .
When the police arrived , the young man was lying on the shoulder of the highway directly underneath the 30 foot high overpass with a broken back and foot .
Doctors believe 16 - year - old Mace Hutchinson broke his back and heel after falling , as his injuries are consistent with such a fall .
The boy 's family does not understand why police would have tasered the the teen 19 times after he was so seriously injured .
The teen 's father said that the use of the taser caused Mace to develop an elevated white blood cell count , leading to a fever that delayed the young man 's otherwise immediate surgery by two days .
Ozark Police Capt .
Thomas Rousset attempted to explain why the taser was used :
" He refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their Tasers in order to subdue him .
He is making incoherent statements ; he 's also making statements such as , ' Shoot cops , kill cops , ' things like that .
So there was cause for concern to the officers . "
Ozark police say that while there remains unanswered questions in the case , the reason for the use of the Taser is not one of them .

Thousands of DNA samples from innocent people are now retained .
DNA profiles of those not convicted of a crime should be removed from the database in England and Wales , a government - funded inquiry has said .
Control of the database should be taken from government and police and given to an independent body , the inquiry urged .
Javed Aslam , one of the 30 panel members on the Citizen 's Inquiry , said keeping the records would be " the first step towards a totalitarian state " .
But the Home Office said the database helps to secure convictions .
The UK has the largest police DNA database in the world - with more than four million people on file .
All serious offenders should be put on the database - and there must be safeguards to protect the innocent
Dominic Grieve , shadow home secretary
Q&A : National DNA database
The four - month inquiry was overseen by the Human Genetics Commission ( HGC ) , which will now make a further report incorporating those public views , expected next year .
Under current laws , the database holds DNA records from suspects arrested in England and Wales , regardless of whether they are subsequently charged or convicted .
And innocent people who volunteer to give a DNA sample during a police inquiry also have their details kept on record .
The database also contains profiles from some people detained in Northern Ireland , and in Scotland - but in Scotland records of those innocent of any crime are deleted after a time .
Among the study 's conclusions was that guilty people who have served their time should eventually have their DNA records erased because retaining the profile " continues to criminalise them " .
This is despite the fact that DNA records have been used to solve a number of " cold case " inquires in recent years .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme Sir John Sulston , chairman of the Human Genetics Commission which established the Citizens Inquiry , said it was a problem of defining the database 's purpose .
" We need to go back to the basic question - what is this database for ?
" Is it really intended as an ID database , which is perfectly arguable , and then you could use it for many purposes , including solving crime , including the identification of lost bodies .
" Or do we regard it , as I believe the police do at the moment , as a criminal database ?
" If it is the latter there is a stigma attached to being on it and we have to be absolutely clear about that purpose , " he added .
' Totalitarian state '
The inquiry was conducted by 30 members of the public in two linked panels in Birmingham and Glasgow .
Panel member Mr Aslam said : " For me , it is the first step towards a totalitarian state if we start recording these things now . "
Before 2001 , the police could take DNA samples during investigations , but had to destroy the records if the person was acquitted or charges were not proceeded with .
But the law was changed in 2001 to remove this requirement , and changed again in 2004 so that DNA samples could be taken from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and detained in a police station .
The use of the database to solve old crimes is seen as one of the major benefits of retaining the information .
The public should also be better informed of why their DNA might be taken and the consequences , the panel concluded .
The panel 's view was not unanimous - some members backed retaining all profiles indefinitely , even after a person 's death .
' Protect the innocent ' Opposition parties have criticised the use of the database .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman David Howarth said " there must be better ways of catching criminals than spending millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money adding innocent people to the DNA database " .
For the Conservatives , shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said : " All serious offenders should be put on the database - and there must be safeguards to protect the innocent . "
However , the Home Office said the database had revolutionised the way the police protect the public .
A spokeswoman said it welcomes an " open discussion on the issue of how the National DNA Database is used " .
However , she said it provides the police on average with almost 3,500 DNA matches each month and is a " key " instrument in the fight against violent crime , burglaries and rape .
She added that , in a 12 - month period between 2006 and 2007 , DNA evidence had been used in police investigations into 644 rapes , 222 other sexual offences , 1,900 violent crimes and more than 8,500 domestic burglaries .

What are these ?
Releasing balloons for orphans at the University of West England in Bristol goes not as planned .
Psychologist Bill Richards studies the medical potential of the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin , the active ingredient in ‘ magic mushrooms ’ .
He ’s part of the research team at the respected Johns Hopkins Medical School who are studying whether psilocybin - assisted psychotherapy can help people with cancer cope with the psychological impact of their condition .
The project is a hot topic at the moment , partly because the research team are looking for volunteers with a diagnosis of cancer to take part in the pioneering study , and also because several of their recent findings have made headlines .
These have included the widely - reported results from their recent studies where participants reported that some of the psilocybin experiences remained deeply and personally meaningful , even after a year .
Bill has been a clinical psychedelics researcher since the 1960s and so has a wealth of experience with these curious compounds , and he ’s also kindly agreed to talk to Mind Hacks about the current pioneering research project .
¬†
Can you say a little about the study that ’s running at the moment and what sort of volunteers you need ?
Following up on our first studies with healthy volunteers , we are reactivating research into the promising application of brief counseling assisted by psilocybin for persons with a diagnosis of cancer .
Studies in the 1960 ‚ Äôs and early 1970 ‚Äôs suggested that this intervention could decrease anxiety , depression , interpersonal isolation , fear of death , and preoccupation with pain , thus enabling persons to live whatever time remained more fully .
Volunteers for the present study need to be between the ages of 21 and 70 , without personal or family histories of schizophrenia or severe mental illness , and experiencing some degree of psychological distress .
Persons may be terminally ill , or in earlier stages of coping with cancer , though if there is no recent disease progression , one year since initial diagnosis is required .
More detailed information is available at www.cancer-insight.org.
All participants receive medical screening and , if accepted , work with skilled professional who provides preparation , guidance during two 6 - hour psilocybin sessions and assistance in the initial integration of the experiences that occur .
Clinical research with hallucinogenic drugs was effectively outlawed for many years since the 1960s .
What had to happen before research like this could start again ?
Before the recent rebirth of this type of research , studies continued at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center until 1977 when they became dormant due to administrative changes and different priorities .
It wasn ‚ Äôt really ‚ Äúoutlawed ‚Äù ; financial and institutional support on the State and local levels ceased .
Following a ‚ Äúthink tank ‚Äù sponsored by the Council on Spiritual Practices in 1999 , Roland Griffiths , Robert Jesse , Una McCann and I designed a study with psilocybin and submitted it to an FDA committee for approval .
It was approved , presumably on the basis of its scientific merits , both by the FDA and the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board and we began our first study in 2000 .
A recent study by your research group found that some psilocybin experiences were still considered deeply significant , even spiritual , after a year .
Do you think this sort of research can help us understand the neuroscience of mystical experience ?
We have demonstrated that mystical experiences indistinguishable from those recorded in the history of religions can be occasioned with the skilled and respectful use of psilocybin .
This now opens up a fascinating research frontier , not only into possible neurochemical correlates in brain activity , but also into correlations between the phenomenology of different states of consciousness and subsequent alterations of mental health , creativity and spirituality .
Many research projects await design and implementation in the years ahead , some of which may help us better understand the mysteries of our own being .
Which other hallucinogens do you think might have therapeutic potential ?
There are many molecules that appear to trigger changes in human consciousness , some that have been synthesized and catalogued by Alexander Shulgin , and in all probability many yet to be discovered .
In time each needs to be carefully investigated in terms of efficacy and safety .
We have focused on one substance , psilocybin , which has been used in religious and healing rituals by indigenous people for some two thousand years and which appears to be reasonably safe when used in medical research in accordance with the guidelines we have published .
Name three under - rated things .
1. Human consciousness
‚ Äî that there is ‚ Äúsomething , not nothing ‚Äù ( Schelling )
2 . The beauty of everyday sense perception ( without psychedelics ) .
3 . The power of individual acts of compassion
It ’s been said many a time that one way to reduce a company ’s footprint is by using web conferencing tools rather than flying everybody to meet in person .
Noble , efficient and potentially cost saving as that is , there ’s one problem :
There ’s been no way to quantify just how much of a difference it ’s actually making .
Sure , saved costs of flight , transport , accommodations are easy to calculate .
But how about reduced emissions ?
And even if you were to know that , how can that be translated into a figure meaningful to our everyday lives ?
iLinc has created the Green Meter to give concreteness and life to the abstract .
It calculates the CO2 , cost , and travel reductions accrued while using their service , down to the individual level .
When companies are required to reduce their carbon footprint , whether internally or by the government where they do business , this will prove an invaluable tool .
And in this fragile , downwardly spiraling economy , being financially prudent with your expenses will be increasingly important .
While there are many who will take the green benefits at face value , for those that need more than a simple assurance that this is the better option , the Green Meter provides that in spades .
It makes me wonder what other “ green ” products and services out there would improve sales by finding tangible ways like this to quantify the difference between their and the non green options .
Act2GreenSmart is another example I see out there now .
iLinc has clearly thought their marketing through , making such solid points as , “ Just by eliminating travel , you ’ll save enough time and money to improve or expand your online training programs . “
That ’s great , but how ’s the service ?
Flexible , from the looks of it .
iLinc can be shaped to work for conducting meetings , teaching classes , doing webinars , and even customer service .
They offer audio conferencing as a standalone option , whether for spontaneous domestic conferences to international , giving local access to those out of the US .
Their EventPlus service can be used to simplify the process of managing one to many paid virtual events .
Daily demonstrations of the iLinc system are available .
I ’d say go see for yourself how it stacks up to what you use now .
And with the added component of the Green Meter keeping precise track of your lightened impact , both ecological and economical , this just may be the best web based conferencing tool out there .
Readers :
What other ways does your company use technology or other methods to reduce its impact ?
Whether elaborate or simple and brilliant , we ’d like to hear about them !

( CNN ) --
When Barack Obama comes to London , I am certain that 50,000 people will turn out to cheer him on , '' a British executive assured me when I visited the British capital recently .
Barack Obama's
White House bid has stoked more interest among Europeans than that of his Republican rival
" Americans ? ' '
I asked .
" No , not Americans , '' he responded .
" English people .
You see , we want change , too . ''
Spend a few days in western Europe talking about American politics and you discover that you are in deepest Obamaland .
Not much different from Berkeley , California , or the South Side of Chicago .
As a woman put it to me in Paris : " We want America back . ''
" Why does that mean Obama ? ' '
I asked her .
Her response : " We think he 's the black Kennedy . ''
What 's driving Obama frenzy in Europe ?
Is it ideology ?
The educated , well - informed Europeans I met were not entirely sure what Obama stood for .
" Is he a socialist ? '' they asked .
" I do n't think he would accept that label , '' I told them .
They worried a little bit about Obama 's views on trade .
" Is he a protectionist ? '' they wondered .
" He calls himself a free trader , '' I said , " just like John McCain , although he has been more critical of trade agreements like NAFTA . ''
Europeans are not especially anti-McCain .
I asked my British informant what kind of response McCain drew when he visited London .
" Nothing , '' he responded .
" We see McCain as another old man .
Just like our politicians . ''
Europeans believe their politics has become old , tired , unexciting .
Which is , fairly or unfairly , their image of McCain .
To his European fans , Obama is the symbol of American renewal .
They know three things about him .
That he is young .
That he is African - American .
And that he has a Muslim name .
Europeans live in countries with large , unassimilated Muslim minorities .
The idea that someone with Obama 's name and background could become President of the United States astonishes and impresses them .
Europeans are thrilled by the idea that the United States can suddenly transform itself from a pariah in the world into an inspiration to the world .
Or can it ?
Everywhere I went , Europeans asked me if a black man can really be elected President of the United States .
I told them many Americans ask me the same question .
My answer ?
It looks quite possible .
We can't be certain .
People may be lying to pollsters , and possibly to themselves .
But so far , the evidence suggests that at least as many white Americans are voting for Obama because of his race as are voting against him because of his race .
Leaving Amsterdam , I was slightly alarmed when the security agent inspecting my bags asked me to step aside .
The agent , a Dutchman of African descent , leaned over the table and asked me in a lowered voice : " Do you think Barack Obama really has a chance to win the election ? ''

Over the past four decades , Republicans have dominated the outcomes of presidential races by mixing negative campaigning in public with illicit dirty tricks behind the scenes , as I 've recounted in my last two books , Secrecy & Privilege and Neck Deep .
As a party , the Republicans have not only refined the art of the political smear – with such memorable moments as the Willie Horton ads in 1988 and the “ swift - boating ” of John Kerry in 2004 – but they also have defined the concept of the October Surprise , manipulating late - breaking events to drive the electorate toward their candidate .
Much of this Republican behavior traces back to their perceived victimization at the hands of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson in the razor - thin 1960 race .
Though many historians dispute the significance of alleged voter fraud in that election , the notion that Richard Nixon was robbed became an article of faith inside the GOP .
In 1968 , Nixon and his operatives were determined that they would n’t get outmaneuvered again .
As the race entered its final weeks , their great fear was that President Johnson would negotiate a settlement to the Vietnam War and thus push Vice President Hubert Humphrey over the top to victory .
So , although a half million American soldiers were in the battle zone and the war was tearing the United States apart , Nixon ’s campaign made secret contacts with South Vietnamese leaders , allegedly offering the assurance that if they refused to cooperate with the Paris peace talks , they could expect a better deal from Nixon .
The evidence is now clear that the Nixon campaign dispatched Anna Chennault , a fiercely anti-communist Chinese - American , to carry that message to South Vietnamese president Nguyen van Thieu .
Journalist Seymour Hersh first described the initiative in his 1983 biography of Henry Kissinger , The Price of Power .
Hersh reported that U.S. intelligence “ agencies had caught on that Chennault was the go - between between Nixon and his people and President Thieu in Saigon . …
The idea was to bring things to a stop in Paris and prevent any show of progress . ”
In her own autobiography , The Education of Anna , Chennault acknowledged that she was the courier .
She quoted Nixon aide John Mitchell as calling her a few days before the 1968 election and telling her : “ I ’m speaking on behalf of Mr. Nixon .
It ’s very important that our Vietnamese friends understand our Republican position and I hope you made that clear to them . ”
Secret Cables Reporter Daniel Schorr added more details in a Washington Post article on May 28 , 1995 , citing decoded cables that U.S. intelligence had intercepted from the South Vietnamese embassy in Washington .
On Oct. 23 , 1968 , Ambassador Bui Dhien cabled Saigon with the message that “ many Republican friends have contacted me and encouraged me to stand firm . ”
On Oct. 27 , he wrote , “ The longer the present situation continues , the more favorable for us . … I am regularly in touch with the Nixon entourage . ”
On Nov. 2 , 1968 , Thieu withdrew from his tentative agreement to sit down with the Viet Cong at the Paris peace talks , destroying Johnson ’s last hope for a settlement and clearing the way for Nixon ’s narrow victory .
Though Johnson and his top advisers knew of Nixon ’s gambit , they kept it secret apparently out of concern that it could further divide the country .
Anthony Summers ’s 2000 book , The Arrogance of Power , provides the fullest examination of the Nixon - Thieu gambit , including the debate within Democratic circles about what to do with the evidence .
Both Johnson and Humphrey believed the information – if released to the public – could assure Nixon ’s defeat , according to Summers .
“ In the end , though , Johnson ’s advisers decided it was too late and too potentially damaging to U.S. interests to uncover what had been going on , ” Summers wrote .
“ If Nixon should emerge as the victor , what would the Chennault outrage do to his viability as an incoming president ?
And what effect would it have on American opinion about the war ? ”
Summers quotes Johnson ’s assistant Harry McPherson , who said , “ You could n’t surface it .
The country would be in terrible trouble . ”
The direct U.S. role in the Vietnam War continued for more than four years with additional American casualties of 20,763 dead and 111,230 wounded .
The toll among the people of Indochina was far higher .
Johnson and Humphrey went into retirement – and to their graves – keeping silent about Nixon ’s treachery .
No Political Peace The Democratic silence about Nixon 's sabotage of the Paris peace talks did not bring them political peace .
Instead , it seemed to embolden Nixon .
In the years that followed , Nixon built a clandestine apparatus designed to neutralize his political enemies and ensure his reelection in 1972 .
Nixon ’s “ plumbers unit , ” employing former CIA operatives , spied on individuals who caused Nixon difficulty – the likes of Daniel Ellsberg who exposed the Pentagon Papers history of the Vietnam War – and on the Democrats , too .
In May 1972 , the plumbers planted bugs in the Watergate offices of the Democratic National Committee , apparently gleaning information about the last - minute strategies of the Democratic establishment to block the nomination of Sen. George McGovern , whom Nixon viewed as the easiest Democrat to beat .
[ For details on what Nixon got from the bugs , see Secrecy & Privilege . ]
The next month , when the plumbers returned to plant more listening devices , they were caught by Washington police , leading to the Watergate investigation .
But Nixon was able to keep the story mostly under wraps until he won his landslide victory against McGovern .
In 1973 , with the help of such clever operatives as Republican National Chairman George H.W. Bush , Nixon tried to fend off the mounting evidence of his guilt , but he was finally forced to resign in August 1974 .
His successor , Gerald Ford , then lost Election 1976 to Jimmy Carter .
Though many political observers assumed that the Watergate debacle taught the Republicans some harsh lessons , it actually convinced them that they needed a stronger media and political infrastructure so they could protect their leaders from future scandals .
By the late 1970s , the modern right - wing media began to take shape .
The Republican hope for redemption came soon enough , in the 1980 race that pitted conservative Ronald Reagan and his running mate George H.W. Bush against President Carter .
The Reagan - Bush brain trust , especially campaign chief William Casey , saw the lingering crisis with Iran over 52 American hostages as a powerful vulnerability for Carter but also a potential game - changer if Carter succeeded in engineering their release shortly before the election .
October Surprise Vice presidential candidate Bush talked publicly about the potential for Carter pulling an “ October Surprise ” by freeing the hostages .
But the evidence is now overwhelming that the Republicans also were contacting senior Iranians behind Carter 's back to make sure that Carter failed in that effort .
Over the past 28 years , more than a score of witnesses – including senior Iranian officials , top French intelligence officers , U.S. and Israeli intelligence operatives , the Russian government and even Palestine leader Yasir Arafat – have confirmed the existence of a Republican initiative to interfere with Carter ’s efforts to free the hostages .
In 1996 , for instance , during a meeting in Gaza , Arafat personally told former President Carter that senior Republican emissaries approached the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1980 with a request that Arafat help broker a delay in the hostage release .
“ You should know that in 1980 the Republicans approached me with an arms deal if I could arrange to keep the hostages in Iran until after the elections , ” Arafat told Carter .
[ Diplomatic History , Fall 1996 ]
Arafat ’s spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said the GOP gambit pursued other channels , too .
In an interview with me in Tunis in 1990 , Bassam indicated that Arafat learned upon reaching Iran in 1980 that the Republicans and the Iranians had made other arrangements for a delay in the hostage release .
“ The offer [ to Arafat ] was , ‘ if you block the release of hostages , then the White House would be open for the PLO ’ , ” Bassam said .
“ I guess the same offer was given to others , and I believe that some accepted to do it and managed to block the release of hostages . ”
In a little - noticed letter to the U.S. Congress , dated Dec. 17 , 1992 , former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said he first learned of the Republican hostage initiative in July 1980 .
Bani -Sadr said a nephew of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , then Iran ’s supreme leader , returned from a meeting with an Iranian banker , Cyrus Hashemi , who had close ties to Casey and to Casey ’s business associate , John Shaheen .
Bani-Sadr said the message from the Khomeini emissary was clear : the Republicans were in league with pro-Republican elements of the CIA in an effort to undermine Carter and were demanding Iran ’s help .
Bani -Sadr said the emissary “ told me that if I do not accept this proposal they [ the Republicans ] would make the same offer to my rivals . ”
The emissary added that the Republicans “ have enormous influence in the CIA , ” Bani -Sadr wrote .
“ Lastly , he told me my refusal of their offer would result in my elimination . ”
Bani -Sadr said he resisted the GOP scheme , but the plan was accepted by the hard - line Khomeini faction .
Though some Carter advisers suspected Republican manipulation of the hostage crisis , the Democrats again kept silent .
Only after the Iran - Contra scandal broke in 1986 – and witnesses began talking about its origins – did the 1980 story get fleshed out enough to compel Congress to take a closer look in 1991 - 92 .
Again , however the Democrats feared that the evidence could endanger the fragile political relationships in Washington that enable governing to go forward .
Once more , they chose to ignore the GOP machinations and , in some cases , literally hid the evidence .
[ For the most detailed account of this October Surprise evidence , see Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
The Reagan campaign benefited from another surreptitious operation , the purloining of President Carter 's debate briefing book before a pivotal confrontation between the two candidates .
Though political pundits still recall Reagan ’s clever debate rejoinders , such as his famous “ there you go again , ” some members of Reagan ’s debate preparation team had the benefit of knowing what Carter was likely to say .
The Bush Years Nixon - style strategies carried over into the campaigns mounted by George H.W. Bush in 1988 and 1992 .
The elder Bush 's dark side would come out most glaringly when he was in what he called “ campaign mode . ”
The general election campaign against Michael Dukakis in 1988 stands as one of the nastiest in U.S. history , with Bush playing the race card by exploiting Willie Horton , a black inmate who raped a white woman while he was on a Massachusetts prison furlough .
Bush charted a similar course in 1992 , with the goal of destroying Bill Clinton ’s reputation and winning re-election by political default .
The strategy , managed by then - White House chief of staff James Baker , involved searching Clinton 's passport files looking for dirt to use against the Democratic candidate .
President Bush was personally involved in this " silver bullet " strategy aimed at portraying Clinton as disloyal to his country , possibly having collaborated with Soviet bloc intelligence .
In a later interview with federal prosecutors , Bush acknowledged that he was " nagging " his aides to press a sensitive investigation into Clinton 's student travels to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia .
Bush also expressed strong interest in rumors that Clinton had sought to renounce his U.S. citizenship .
Bush described himself as " indignant " that his aides failed to discover more about Clinton 's student activities .
But Bush stopped short of taking responsibility for the apparently illegal searches of Clinton 's passport records .
" Hypothetically speaking , President Bush advised that he would not have directed anyone to investigate the possibility that Clinton had renounced his citizenship because he would have relied on others to make this decision , " the FBI interview report read .
" He [ Bush ] would have said something like , ' Let 's get it out ' or ' Hope the truth gets out ' . "
The passport caper backfired in early October 1992 with disclosure of the State Department ’s improper search of Clinton ’s passport files , creating a scandal called “ Passport - gate . ”
Some inside the Bush administration , including James Baker , saw the resulting furor as an element in Bush 's defeat to Clinton a month later .
On Nov. 20 , about two weeks after the election , a distraught Baker even tried to submit a letter of resignation , but Bush refused to accept it , according to pages of Bush 's diary that I found at the National Archives .
" Jim Baker came in here this morning about 10:30 deeply disturbed and read to me a long letter of resignation all because of this stupid passport situation , " Bush wrote in his diary .
When a special prosecutor was named to investigate “ Passport - gate , ” the Bush administration was lucky because right - wing judges had just taken over the selection panel and picked Republican stalwart , Joseph diGenova , who proceeded to clear Bush and his top aides despite evidence of their guilt .
Bush - v-Gore The Republican brazenness expanded into the actual counting of votes in Election 2000 .
Though Al Gore won the national popular vote and stood to gain the presidency if a full recount of legally cast votes in Florida had been allowed , five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court sided with George W. Bush and stopped the Florida recount , effectively handing Bush the presidency .
Almost a year later , in November 2001 , a group of eight large news organizations finished a study of the uncounted Florida ballots and discovered that under any standard used for the chads – dimpled , hanging or fully punched through – Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted .
However , in the post 9/11 climate , the news organizations tried to spin their own findings so as not to undermine Bush ’s “ legitimacy . ”
The Democrats also did n’t do much .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Gore ’s Victory ” or our book , Neck Deep . ]
Again , this bipartisanship was n’t reciprocated .
In 2004 , Democrat John Kerry was badly hurt by a smear campaign against his Vietnam War heroism , led by a well - funded right - wing group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
At the GOP convention , Republican activists highlighted skepticism about the severity of Kerry ’s war wounds by passing out “ Purple Heart Band - Aids . ”
In Campaign 2004 , the power of the right - wing news media also was at its apex with a multitude of print , radio , TV and electronic outlets that could twist reality into almost any shape desired .
So , in the campaign ’s final days , when Osama bin Laden released his first video in a year to denounce President Bush , the pro-Bush media treated it as an “ endorsement ” of John Kerry .
After bin Laden ’s video , last - minute polls showed a surge of about three - percentage points toward Bush and he hung on to win by an official margin of about 2 ½ points ( although suspicions persist that Bush also benefited from voting irregularities in key states , such as Ohio ) .
Only after Election 2004 – in a book by journalist Ron Suskind – did the public learn that inside the CIA , senior analysts concluded that bin Laden had issued his 11th - hour video with the intent of tipping the election to Bush , whose belligerent policies bin Laden saw as helping al - Qaeda ’s cause .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ CIA : Osama Helped Bush in ’ 04 . ” ]
In the past four years , however , the political terrain for the Republicans has grown more treacherous .
Hurricane Katrina ’s devastation of New Orleans in 2005 revealed the cronyism near the heart of the Bush administration .
The open - ended wars in Iraq and Afghanistan sapped away the public ’s trust in Republicans as the party of national security .
Nevertheless , the Democrats and the Obama campaign should not assume that some of the old tricks wo n’t be tried .
Indeed , the Democrats probably should expect that the Republicans will pull out their old playbooks – and pull out all the stops – in a fierce determination to make sure Barack Obama never makes it to the White House .

NICE advises on which drugs should be bought by the NHS Some of the UK 's top cancer consultants warn that NHS drug " rationing " is forcing patients to remortgage their homes to pay for treatment .
The specialists accuse the government drugs advisory body of " rationing " too severely and call for a " radical change " in the way decisions are made .
Their letter to the Sunday Times also says research success is not being translated into modern treatments .
It follows a decision not to offer some drugs to NHS kidney cancer patients .
Earlier this month , the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) published its draft guidelines on treatments for patients with advanced kidney cancer .
We have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses , giving up pensions and selling cars to buy drugs
Letter signed by 26 consultants
It concluded that the drugs - bevacizumab , sorafenib , sunitinib and temsirolimus - did not offer value for money .
But in their letter , the 26 cancer specialists say the decision shows how " poorly " NICE assesses new cancer treatments .
" Its economic formulas are simply not suitable for addressing cost - effectiveness in this area of medicine , " they write .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
They continue : " It is essential that NICE gets its sums right .
We have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses , giving up pensions and selling cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth . "
The consultants , who include the directors of oncology at Britain 's two biggest cancer hospitals , the Royal Marsden in London and Christie Hospital in Manchester , say it is not right the NHS cannot find the money for the drugs .
" We now spend similar amounts to Europe on health generally and cancer care in particular , but less than two thirds of the European average on cancer drugs .
" It just ca n't be that everybody else around the world is wrong about access to innovative cancer care and the NHS right in rationing it so severely . "
There is a finite pot of money for the NHS , which is determined annually by parliament
National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence While Britain is a leading contributor to cancer research , this is not translated into " modern treatment for all our patients , " they say .
They add : " The time has come for a radical change in how the NHS makes rationing decisions for cancer . "
Professor Peter Johnson , from Cancer Research UK , earlier this month also said NICE 's decision raised " questions " about whether its system of appraisal was appropriate for all types of drugs .
Andrew Dillon , the NICE chief executive , and Sir Michael Rawlins , NICE 's chairman , told the Sunday Times the NHS did not have unlimited funds to provide all available treatments .
" There is a finite pot of money for the NHS , which is determined annually by parliament , " they said .
" If one group of patients is provided with cost - ineffective care , other groups - lacking powerful lobbyists - will be denied cost - effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia , Crohn 's disease or cystic fibrosis . "
Waste Dr Evan Harris , a Liberal Democrat MP and former hospital doctor , said rationing was inevitable unless the government increased funding or came up with a fairer way to measure what was cost - effective .
" Attacking NICE is simply shooting the messenger and letting politicians off the hook .
" The government must let NICE get its teeth into vetoing the millions of pounds the NHS spends on wasteful political initiatives - like over - paying private firms to cream off routine NHS cases - and on totally ineffective treatments , like homeopathy .
" That could save the money needed for effective but expensive cancer drugs . "
The Department of Health said investment in the NHS had risen from £ 35bn in 1997 to more than £ 110bn by 2011 .
A spokeswoman said : " We have heard from patients that one of their major concerns is the perceived postcode lottery in access to drugs and that there are too many variations around who gets access to prescribed drugs and that these variations are a lottery depending on where you live .
" The draft NHS constitution will make more transparent and consistent the process for local funding of drugs not appraised by NICE or where NICE has yet to issue guidance . "
More than 7,000 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer annually in the UK .
Of these , around 1,700 patients will be diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer .
Although none of the available treatments " cure " cancer that has spread from the initial tumour , they can help extend a patients ' life by around five to six months .

This comic is a combination of the problems Josh and I had this weekend .
Josh , for the first time ever , tried to use the HDMI cable connection on the 50 ″ 1080P Samsung LCD TV he bought over a year ago and realized it had probably been fucked all along .
I actually had a dead pixel on my Wacom Cintiq drawing tablet ( which is basically a small monitor that you draw on with a pen stylus ) .
I did some research on how to fix dead or “ stuck ” pixels and the options ranged from easy to adventurous .
The scary method involved using a screw driver and a rag to “ massage ” the pixel back into working order .
No joke .
I ’m sure if that did n’t work I would be advised to “ caress ” it with a brick wrapped in newspaper .
Luckily , the simple option was to run a Java applet that flashed every color in the rainbow on and off 100 times a second , which worked splendidly .
The seizures it produced were spectacular , though I regret biting off my tongue as that I used it frequently to speak and enjoy ice cream .

The Death Magnetic CD is compressed so it sounds louder and more forceful - at the expense of sound quality .
But do n't worry , it 'll sound better if you buy Guitar Hero ...
Audiophile fans of Metallica should n't bother buying copies of their new album , Death Magnetic .
According to one analyst , the record sounds better in the Guitar Hero video game .
" On purchasing our CD ... we gave the disc a spin and could n't help wondering if our office headphones were faulty as the kick and snare drum seemed to be audibly clipping , along with some of the palm - muted guitar parts , " wrote Chris Vinnecombe , guitar editor of music - making website MusicRadar .
The sound issues are a result of the " loudness war " - an ongoing industry effort to make recordings as loud as possible , so that on cursory listens tracks leap forcefully from the speakers .
While any album can just have its volume turned up on your stereo , records like Death Magnetic have their audio compressed , making them inherently louder at the expense of dynamic range and sound quality .
The CD version of Death Magnetic takes this to an extreme , pushing the compression past the point of distortion .
The version used on the Guitar Hero videogame , where players can solo along with James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett , has been mixed differently - with far better dynamic range .
The videogame version of the record was made available last week , as an $ 18 ( £ 9 ) download .
Mastering engineer Ian Shepherd 's analysis of the two versions - shown as graphical waveforms - makes the CD version 's hyper - compression acutely visible .
While there is no official response from the famously cantankerous Metallica camp , the engineer who mastered Death Magnetic is apparently as frustrated as the fans .
" I 'm certainly sympathetic to your reaction , " said Ted Jensen , head engineer at Sterling Sound , quoted on the Metallica forum .
" I get to slam my head against that brick wall every day .
In this case , the mixes were already brick - walled before they arrived at my place .
Suffice to say I would never be pushed to overdrive things as far as they are here . "
" Believe me I 'm not proud to be associated with this one , and we can only hope that some good will come from this in some form of backlash against volume above all else . "
According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) , Arctic sea ice cover appears to have reached its minimum extent for the year , the second - lowest extent recorded since the dawn of the satellite era .
While above the record minimum Arctic sea ice extent set on September 16 , 2007 , this year further reinforces the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent observed over the past thirty years .
Despite overall cooler summer temperatures , the 2008 minimum extent is only 390,000 square kilometers ( 150,000 square miles ) , or 9.4 % , more than the record - setting 2007 minimum .
The 2008 minimum extent is 15.0 % less than the next - lowest minimum extent set in 2005 and 33.1 % less than the average minimum extent from 1979 to 2000 .
This season further reinforces the long - term downward trend of sea ice extent .
[ social_buttons ]
Even though the sea ice did n’t retreat this year as much as last summer , “ there was no real sign of recovery , ” said Walt Meier of NSIDC .
This year was cooler and other weather conditions were n’t as bad , he said .
“ We ’re kind of in a new state of the Arctic basically , and it ’s not a good one , ” Meier said .
“ We ’re definitely sliding towards a point where the summer sea ice will be gone . ”
Scientists have predicted that the Arctic will become ice free in the summer by the year 2013 , if not sooner .
This also does not bode well for global warming , since ice reflects sunlight whereas dark oceans absorb it .
On top of that , the Arctic ice melting trend has shifted .
Normally the ice would reach its minimum extent by early September , but after the record melt of 2007 , much of the ice reformed with much less thickness , allowing it to continue to melt through mid-September this year .
The Arctic is warming at a faster rate than the rest of the planet , and can be considered a ‘ canary in the coal mine ’ .
Right now , that canary is not in good health .

Aug. 22 , 2008  -- Prostitution in Denver and Minneapolis will spike during the political conventions held there in the coming weeks , experts say , and online ads indicate sex workers are preparing themselves .
" Republican Convention Party Entertainment – Hostesses wanted , " reads the headline of one " erotic services " ad from the Minneapolis area on Craig 's List , the popular classified - ad Web site .
In the advertisement , the unnamed outfit said it was looking for " fun , outgoing " women to help entertain " High - end clients " during the convention , expected to bring tens of thousands of delegates , reporters , lobbyists and volunteers to the Twin Cities in two weeks .
The company did not respond to an emailed request for an interview .
A recorded message for the phone number listed in the ad did not allow a message to be left .
In Denver , where the Democrats will hold their convention next week , a Craig 's List " erotic services " ad titled " DNC Delight " beckoned , " Help me celebrate democracy , " and promised a tall , blue - eyed , dirty - blond " Rebecca " will come to a visitor 's room ( " I only do outcalls to hotels " ) .
In a second ad , " Rebecca " explained that she was offering a special convention rate of $ 350 for two hours – but to qualify , clients must " provide proof of dem .
Membership . "
Speaking by phone Thursday , " Rebecca " declined to give her real name and denied she performed sex acts for money .
She confirmed that responses to her online ads had increased in the days leading up to next week 's convention .
" We know it 's going to rise , " said Vednita Carter of Breaking Free , a Denver - based nonprofit which helps women and girls involved in prostitution and sex trafficking .
" That 's what we 've been hearing from women who are involved in that life . "
Crowds like those coming for the political conventions will inevitably mean a boost for the sex industry , said former prostitute Carol Leigh , a spokeswoman for the San Francisco - based sex workers - rights group Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics ( COYOTE ) .
Indeed , any convention which draws so many people boosts the prostitution business -- not just the political gatherings , said Leigh .
Police in St. Paul and Denver did not respond to requests for comment Thursday .
In earlier news accounts , police spokesmen in both cities dismissed concerns that their cities ' sex trades would flourish during the conventions .
In Denver , Breaking Free 's Carter said her group is concerned that the boom in sex business they are expecting will bring harm to underaged girls who have been coerced or forced to sell sexual services .
" There 's going to be younger girls who are going to be involved in it , " she said .
" I think there might be some [ physical ] harm that might come .
Usually the young girls have pimps .
I think they 're going to be real hard - core on them during the convention " by " demanding higher quotas , " Carter explained .
In Minnesota and in Denver , victims ' groups are planning to distribute leaflets and other material outside of convention events to educate attendees and potential victims on sex trafficking .
The Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women 's Carla Ferrucci said her group was planning to hand out its flyers at hotels and convention parties .
Democrats in particular should consider themselves warned : prostitution in Denver has caused great woes for some men .
Earlier this year , the IRS and the Denver police revealed they had linked Chief Federal Judge Edward Nottingham to a prostitution service .
Nottingham has declined to comment and remains on the bench while the investigation continues .
In 2006 , male Denver - area prostitute Mike Jones told reporters that evangelical minister and conservative star Ted Haggard had paid him to have gay sex , effectively ending Haggard 's career .
Haggard says Jones only gave him a massage .

Pope Benedict XVI has begun a nine - day visit to Australia , where he is due to apologise for decades of sexual abuse of children by priests .
As he began the longest foreign trip of his papacy , he said paedophilia was " incompatible " with being a priest .
Australian abuse victims have said they will hold protests during his visit .
Climate change will also be a leading theme at a major Catholic youth festival , World Youth Day , which the Pope is heading in Sydney .
The event is expected to draw some 200,000 young Catholics to the city .
But the six - day event has been overshadowed by the launch of an investigation into sexual abuse allegations .
The leader of Australia 's Catholics , Cardinal George Pell , has come under criticism for his handling of a 1982 case allegedly involving the sexual abuse of 29 - year - old man by a priest .
The BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney says that many victims want the Pope to directly criticise the Australian Catholic hierarchy for its handling of abuse allegations .
Lifestyle change " It is essential for the Church to reconcile , to prevent , to help and to see guilt in this problem , " Pope Benedict told reporters during his 20 - hour flight to Sydney .
We have to face up to this great challenge ... to change the situation of the environment for the good
Pope Benedict XVI
In pictures : Pope in Australia " It must be clear ... that being a real priest is incompatible with this ( sexual abuse ) because priests are in the service of our Lord , " he said .
As the Pope arrived in Sydney , Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he was " an honoured guest among us " .
During his trip , the Pope will also meet Aborigine groups , and is likely to repeat an apology made by Pope John Paul to Australia 's indigenous people for injustices carried out by Catholic missionaries .
He also told reporters he wanted to wake up consciences , to make politicians and experts respond to environmental issues .
" We have to face up to this great challenge and find the ethical capacity to change the situation of the environment for the good , " said Pope Benedict .
But he made it clear he had no intention of addressing any specific political or technical questions about climate change .
Open -air Mass
The 81 - year Pope 's medical advisers have taken elaborate steps to protect his health during the gruelling 20 - hour flight from Italy , says the BBC's David Willey in Rome .
A special sleeping compartment has been prepared on the Alitalia plane and the German pontiff will spend three full days resting at a Catholic study centre before appearing at the head of a Sydney Harbour flotilla on Thursday .
He was met by Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd on his arrival at Sydney airport .
Pope Benedict will close his trip by presiding over an open - air Mass on 20 July at Sydney 's Randwick Racecourse , which is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of pilgrims .
The Pope 's visit - his ninth outside Italy - has created controversy with demonstrators vowing to protest against the Church 's stand on homosexuality and birth control .
In response , authorities in the state of New South Wales have introduced new laws bringing the threat of heavy fines to anyone causing annoyance to pilgrims .
Civil liberty groups have denounced such sanctions as unnecessary and repugnant .

HARLINGEN , Texas ( Reuters ) - U.S. Border Patrol agent Reynaldo Zuniga was arrested last month lugging a bag of cocaine up from the Rio Grande , one of a growing number of law enforcement officers accused of taking bribes from drug gangs .
A U.S. Border Patrol agent holds a sniffer dog after inspecting a freight train near the Border Patrol traffic checkpoint in Kingsville , Texas July 1 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Tomas Bravo
Former colleagues say Zuniga used to wait until agents in the south Texas town of Harlingen were distracted with paperwork , then slip down to the river and help smuggle in drugs from Mexico .
The increasing use of bribes by Mexican drug cartels to corrupt U.S. agents comes as Washington is sending $ 400 million to help Mexico ’s army - led war on the trafficking gangs , whose brutal murders have surged to unprecedented levels .
“ Zuniga was a good agent and a hard worker .
I ca n’t understand why he would do this .
We ’re supposed to be protecting our borders , ” said Border Patrol agent Daniel Doty , a former colleague .
Data on agents convicted of graft are not made public , but the U.S. government is probing hundreds of border corruption cases where a decade ago it saw a few dozen a year .
The FBI - led Border Corruption Task Force says it is busier than ever .
“ We ’ve seen a sharp increase in investigations along the border over the past three years , ” said Andy Black , who oversees the San Diego task force , near the busy border crossing of San Ysidro .
“ We are talking about a minority of agents but they are a very significant threat , a weak link in efforts to secure the border . ”
Some put the rise in bribery down to a recent tightening of border controls and a jump in hiring new agents .
Smugglers can offer hundreds of thousands of dollars to get past the heavily policed border with drugs and immigrants -- much more than a border agent or sheriff makes in a year .
Gangs also often use attractive women as bait , setting a “ honey trap ” to entice officials .

“ I was offered sex to let a woman across the Rio Grande , but I have a family , I turned her down , ” one agent told Reuters as his sniffer dog searched a freight train for immigrants and drugs in the Texan borderlands , steamy with tropical rain .
“ BAD AGENTS ”
Corruption south of the border is a major hurdle to Mexican President Felipe Calderon ’s quest to crush drug gangs , with up to half the country ’s police thought to be crooked .
Spiraling drug violence has killed 1,700 people in Mexico this year .
U.S. anti-drug officials have pointed to higher street cocaine prices as proof of tighter border controls .
But the campaign is weakened by cases like that of a border agent and his brother in Texas who netted $ 1.5 million by letting tonnes of marijuana through checkpoint inspection lanes from 2003 to 2005 .
Trafficking drugs and people generates billions of dollars a year .
Powerful gangs use crooked officials well beyond the border to open smuggling lanes into the United States .
In one case showing the breadth of the problem , two California - based employees of Wackenhut , a contractor that transports detained illegal immigrants , were charged last month with freeing them for $ 2,500 each .
Also in June , police arrested a Los Angeles attorney for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) for allegedly accepting huge bribes to issue green cards and other papers .
“ This was an amazing compromise of our system and its integrity , ” said Paul Layman , a special agent who oversees ICE ’s corruption investigations in the western United States .
“ Smugglers are willing to do anything to get people into the country , they will move anything for a dollar . ”
U.S. Customs inspector Richard Elizalda , arrested in 2006 , was paid $ 70,000 to let through hundreds of immigrants after a persuasive female smuggler he met at the San Ysidro crossing became his lover .
A sudden influx of Border Patrol agents may have worsened the problem .
The number of agents along the border has jumped to more than 14,700 now from less than 9,000 four years ago .
Agents receive intense training and ethics courses , but some officials worry about the screening process .
“ Just given the increases , the odds are you ’ll get more bad agents , ” said Paul Charlton , a former U.S. Attorney for Arizona .

Russia is becoming increasingly authoritarian at home and aggressive abroad , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said .
In a strongly - worded speech , Ms Rice said Moscow was on a " one- way path to isolation and irrelevance " .
Diplomatic relations between the US and Russia have been strained by the recent conflict in Georgia .
Earlier , Russia 's president said the two nations should not risk established ties over " trivial matters . "
Dmitry Medvedev said it would be " politically short - sighted " if Washington and Moscow were to endanger their political and economic ties .
However , Ms Rice suggested in her speech that following the conflict in Georgia , Russia 's bid to join the World Trade Organisation had been put in doubt .
Russia 's leaders violated Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and launched a full - scale invasion
Condoleezza Rice
The US has already shelved a civilian nuclear deal with Russia , but despite tensions the two countries are maintaining diplomatic links .
Ms Rice held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov just hours before delivering her speech , says the BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington , and Russia is also due to join an international meeting on Iran 's nuclear programme on Friday .
Our correspondent says Moscow is also telling the US that its co-operation is needed over issues like Iran and North Korea , with many in Washington feeling the Russians have a point .
Several hours after Ms Rice spoke , it emerged that a Russian submarine test - fired an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads .
An official from Russia 's defence ministry is quoted as saying that the test - carried out in Russia 's far - eastern Kamchatka peninsula - went according to plan .
' Deeply disconcerting '
Speaking at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund in Washington , Ms Rice acknowledged that Georgia had fired the first shots in the breakaway region of South Ossetia .
Ms Rice said Russia had tried to dismember Georgia " The Georgian government launched a major military operation into Tskhinvali [ the capital of South Ossetia ] and other areas of that separatist region , " she said .
" Regrettably , several Russian peacekeepers were killed in the fighting , " she added .
But Ms Rice said that Russia had escalated the conflict .
" Russia 's leaders violated Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and launched a full - scale invasion across an internationally recognised border , " she said , adding that Russia had also violated the terms of a ceasefire negotiated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Ms Rice said it had been " deeply disconcerting " that Russia had tried to " dismember " Georgia by recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia , and argued that Russia 's actions were part of what she described as a " worsening pattern of behaviour " .
" I refer ... to Russia 's intimidation of its sovereign neighbours , its use of oil and gas as a political weapon ... its threat to target peaceful neighbours with nuclear weapons ... and its persecution - or worse - of Russian journalists and dissidents , " she added .
Pledging help to rebuild Georgia , Ms Rice said the US and Europe would not let Russia benefit from aggression .
' Taking the bait '
Ms Rice admitted that Georgia could have responded better to the events last month in South Ossetia .
We will not allow Russia to wield a veto over the future of our Euro - Atlantic community
Condoleezza Rice
" We warned our Georgian friends that Russia was baiting them , and that taking this bait would only play into Moscow 's hands , " she said .
However Ms Rice , an expert on the Soviet Union , also said that Russia could not blame its behaviour on the enlargement of Nato .
" Since the end of the Cold War , we and our allies have worked to transform Nato ... into a means for nurturing the growth of a Europe whole , free and at peace . "
The promise of Nato membership had been a positive incentive for states to build democratic institutions and reform their economies , she added .
And she insisted that Russia would not be allowed to dictate who joined the Nato alliance .
" We will not allow Russia to wield a veto over the future of our Euro - Atlantic community - neither what states we offer membership , nor the choice of those states to accept it , " she said " We have made this particularly clear to our friends in Ukraine . "
The secretary of state was also critical of the domestic situation inside Russia .
" What has become clear is that the legitimate goal of rebuilding Russia has taken a dark turn - with the rollback of personal freedoms , the arbitrary enforcement of the law [ and ] the pervasive corruption at various levels of Russian society , " she said .
Russia 's leaders were risking the future progress of the Russian people , she said , declaring that Russia 's leaders " are putting Russia on a one - way path to self - imposed isolation and international irrelevance " .

The Pragmatic Programmers , known for its line of programming titles in print and PDF form , have decided to shelve production of a planned book called iPhone SDK Development .
In a news item posted to its web site , the company cited the iPhone SDK 's non-disclosure agreement as the reason the book could not be published and made available to the public .
Though most developers and publishers expected Apple to lift the NDA after iPhone 2.0 firmware was release this July , Apple has yet to do so .
" We had long internal debates : publish and be damned , or hold , " founder Dave Thomas told Ars .
" In the end , it came down to a question of principle .
We expect people to honor our terms of use when they buy a PDF from us — not copy it , rip off the content , and so on — so it would be wrong of us to feel that we could ignore someone else 's terms of use . "
As many developers have already pointed out , not being able to have resources like programming books makes their task more difficult .
" But all is not lost : we are actively looking at alternative ways of getting this content to you , " reads part of the note posted yesterday on Pragmatic 's site .
" It probably wo n’t happen anytime soon , but know that we are doing what we can . "
Hopefully , developers will have access to this and other resources , despite Apple 's seeming unwillingness to lift the NDA .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Just when you think you 've heard everything in this race for the White House , along comes something truly surprising .
Such was the case on Thursday 's " American Morning . "
CNN 's John Roberts interviews former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney on Thursday .
I was speaking with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney about Sen. John McCain 's new line of attack against Sen. Barack Obama .
McCain hopes to paint Obama as a politician who puts party and self - interest above the needs of the nation , claiming that Obama has " never been a part of a bipartisan group that came together to solve a controversial issue . "
Romney faithfully repeated that charge Thursday morning .
Watch Romney talk about Obama and McCain »
When I pointed out that Obama reached across party lines to work with Sen. Richard Lugar , R - Indiana , on a nonproliferation measure , and with Sen. Gordon Smith , R - Oregon , on increasing gas mileage requirements , Romney shot back , saying that , " Actually , on both cases , you 're talking about two liberal positions , nonproliferation as well as the gasoline mileage . "
It struck me as rather odd -- having covered five years of the Bush administration as a White House correspondent -- that the governor would view nonproliferation as a " liberal " issue .
I seem to recall a little ditty called the " Proliferation Security Initiative , " launched by President Bush on May 31 , 2003 .
The aim of the initiative is to enlist the nations of the world to " stop trafficking of weapons of mass destruction , their delivery systems and related materials to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern . "
Whether the program is a success is very much in question ( though the administration claims it is ) , but I 've never heard anyone call it a " liberal " position .
So what about the Lugar - Obama measure -- conceived as an adjunct to the Proliferation Security Initiative ?
Did it qualify as " liberal ? "
Here 's how Sen .
Lugar 's office described it in a press release : " The Lugar - Obama initiative enhances U.S. efforts to destroy conventional weapons stockpiles and to detect and interdict weapons and materials of mass destruction throughout the world . "
Lugar has a bit of a middling score from the American Conservative Union ( a lifetime rating of 78.02 on a scale that goes to 100 ) and has been called a " moderate ' from time to time .
But " liberal ? "
I asked Lugar 's press secretary , Andy Fisher , about it Thursday morning .
" National security is not liberal , " he told me , " at all . "
It 's true that Democrats have passed two of the biggest nonproliferation measures -- the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and the 1978 Non-Proliferation Act -- but every president since Dwight Eisenhower has sought to curb the spread of either nuclear weapons or the missiles to deliver them .
On the Obama - Smith measure , Romney is on safer ground .
Improving gas mileage has certainly been a favorite stick with which the Democrats like to beat up Republicans .
But did n't McCain just propose new measures to increase fuel efficiency ?
Gas at 4 bucks a gallon has a way of shaping the political mind .
With so much on the line in this election , we 'll probably hear plenty of wild charges thrown back and forth .
Some , it seems , will be a little wilder than others .

( CNN ) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called President Bush " a total failure " on Thursday , among the California Democrat 's harshest assessments to date of the president .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says " I disapprove of Congress ' performance in terms of ending the war . "
" God bless him , bless his heart , president of the United States -- a total failure , losing all credibility with the American people on the economy , on the war , on energy , you name the subject , " Pelosi told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer in an exclusive interview .
The comments came two days after the president sharply criticized Congress over what he described as relative inaction over the course of the legislative term .
At the White House on Wednesday , Bush noted that there were only 26 legislative days left in the fiscal year and said Congress would need to pass a spending bill every other day to " get their fundamental job done . "
" This is not a record to be proud of , and I think the American people deserve better , " Bush said .
Watch Pelosi respond to criticism of Congress from the president »
In the interview , Pelosi said the president was in no position to criticize Congress and brushed aside the criticisms as " something to talk about because he has no ideas . "
" For him to be challenging Congress when we are trying to sweep up after his mess over and over and over again -- at the end of the day , Congress will have passed its responsibility to pass legislation , " she said .
iReport.com :
Why is n't impeachment on the table ?
But Pelosi 's comments come as a new Gallup poll registers the lowest level of congressional approval among Americans in the polling organization 's 30 - year history of conducting that survey .
That poll showed that its approval rating had reached an anemic 14 percent , while more than 70 percent of those polled said they disapproved of the job Congress is doing .
The House speaker said she does n't consider those numbers a negative referendum on the Democrats in charge , saying she thinks they stem largely from Congress ' failure to end the war in Iraq .
" Everything I see says this is about ending the war -- ' I disapprove of Congress ' performance in terms of ending the war , ' " she said .
" In the House , we , of course , have over and over , five or six times , sent to the Senate legislation for a time certain to reduce our deployment in Iraq and bring our troops home safely , honorably and soon .
We have n't been able to get it past the Senate or the president of the United States .
iReport.com :
Why have n't Democrats done more ?
" So , on the basis of that , count me among the 70 - some percent , " she continued .
" But that is one measure .
The other measure that I 'm more interested in is the one that talks about what is their view of Democrats .
And the generic , who do you prefer to run the country on all of these issues ?
We 're in double digits in any poll that you can take . "
Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant derided Pelosi 's comments as " the sort of partisan politics that Democrats once decried and promised to change . "
" Rather than personally critique others , Speaker Pelosi should reconsider her own out - of - touch stance against oil exploration , " he said .
" With Americans paying record prices at the pump and Congress in gridlock , this is no time for the speaker to only offer personal attacks . "
In the wide - ranging interview , the entirety of which will air Sunday on CNN's " Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer , " Pelosi also reiterated her longtime opposition to lifting a congressional ban on offshore drilling as well as opening up areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil exploration .
Bush and congressional Republicans have pushed for those two policy changes .
Pelosi has long opposed drilling offshore , a popular policy position among Californians , many of whom fear its environmental consequences along the state 's coastline .
But a recent CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that more than 73 percent of Americans polled approved of lifting the 1981 ban , and the move holds support among many in Pelosi 's own party , whose constituents are growing increasingly angry over rising gas prices .
Pelosi said the oil industry is not aggressively exploring large amounts of federal areas already leased to them and approved for drilling , including 33 million offshore acres and 68 million acres in the lower 48 states .
She has sponsored legislation calling on oil companies to increase their production in those areas before they are allowed to go into the offshore areas currently banned .
" Thirty - three million acres offshore are allowed for leasing , " she said .
" And we 're saying to them , use it or lose it .
You have the opportunity to drill there .
When you have exhausted those remedies , then you can talk about something else . "
She 's also calling on the president to release 10 percent of the more than 700 million barrels of oil housed in the country 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Bush said Tuesday that he is against any release from the reserve , saying that stash is for emergencies only .
He also disputed that it would have any effect on lowering gas prices .
" What we are saying is , Mr. President , free our oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , " Pelosi said .
" We 're saying , let 's take 10 percent of that , which has been paid for by the American taxpayer , and use that to put on the market so that we increase supply , reduce price . "
" And when the price comes down , we can buy back the oil at a lower price , put it in the SPR , use the spread for renewable energy resources . "
The House speaker has faced heavy criticism from House Republican leader John Boehner , who is leading a congressional delegation to ANWR this weekend and has said Pelosi 's action does not adequately address the problem .
He 's also said Pelosi is leading the moderate faction of her party " off a cliff " by refusing to allow a vote in the House on offshore drilling .
" Just because John Boehner , who is my friend , has my respect , says it does n't make it so , " she responded , reiterating that she will block any vote to allow lifting the ban .

BANK - GHICAGO
A GANG of CLOWNS breaks into a bank .
The AUDIENCE impatiently tolerates the scene , despite having already watched it in front of I Am Legend as well as thirty times when it leaked ONLINE .
RANDOM CLOWN #1
Robbing this bank was a great idea .
Anyone know why they call the guy that planned it ' The Joker ' ?
RANDOM CLOWN #2
I hear he wears clown makeup to scare people .
RANDOM CLOWN #1
What ?
How does that answer the question at all ?
I asked why they call him ' The Joker ' , not why they call him ' The Clown ' .
Nuts to this , has the real movie started yet ?
The CLOWNS gather up a bunch of money and secretly kill each other one by one .
One of the clowns pulls a gun on the OBVIOUSLY HEATH LEDGER CLOWN .
RANDOM CLOWN #3
I 'm betting the Joker told you to kill me , so rather than kill you with your back turned I 'm going to tell you how clever I am for figuring that out .
HEATH LEDGER CLOWN
No , I kill the bus driver .
RANDOM CLOWN #3
Bus driver ?
As in a person who drives a bus ?
That 's extremely confusing to me , for you see I am not aware of any bus thus far in the heist .
How strange of you to mention a vehicle that I have yet to be aware of in any capacity .
Let me just take a few steps to the left while I stand and ponder what you could possibly mean by that .
He gets run over by a BUS that drives into the bank .
BUS DRIVER CLOWN
Somehow , the bus survived crashing into the side of a building without a scratch , so let 's load it up with money !
Hey , where are all of the other gang members ?
HEATH LEDGER CLOWN
They had to go .
Something about attending a dark carnival .
Oh , and also , you 're dead .
HEATH kills the BUS DRIVER , puts a smoke grenade in WILLIAM FICHTNER'S mouth for no reason , then drives out of the building into a conveniently placed gap in a line of SCHOOLBUSES .

This is a ' Wild Draw Four ' Uno card .

Took fucking hours .
MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL
Well if you 're here for Aaron Eckhart , we had ' Old Chicago ' for dinner so he's in the bathroom shitting lava .
HEATH LEDGER

Once upon a time , I had a wife .

Maybe you should hide on some subway tracks instead .
HEATH LEDGER

Starting today , I 'm going to kill innocent people until Batman reveals his secret identity .
This plan is sure to work , since Americans are generally so willing to negotiate with terrorists .

GARY OLDMAN
You see , this was all an elaborate plan to capture you !
Including all the parts where a bunch of cops got killed !
HEATH LEDGER
That 's nothing , because MY plan included everything in your plan , but also some other stuff that gives me the upper hand after all !
Eckhart and Gyllenhaal have been placed at opposite ends of the city with bombs strapped to them .
You 'll only have time to save one .

No , it has to be me .
Nothing else would be as arbitrarily dramatic .

So let 's get this straight .
The trio of white supremacists who were holding a rifle and hollering in the vicinity of the Democratic National Convention about killing Obama wo n't face charges because they were on meth .
But Raymond Hunter Geisel , the man who was arrested in Miami for allegedly making similar threats , is faces some serious felony charges .
Two suggestions : 1 ) Geisel might want to all the sudden reveal his own struggle with a meth addiction , and 2 ) Obama might want to send Fauxbama in his place anytime he has to speak with in 10 miles of a Confederate flag .

The original pitch landed in the inbox with a whiff of medical authenticity overlaid with a snicker - inducing headline : “ Toxic Ties to ‘ New Shower Curtain Smell ’ Evident , According to Latest Laboratory Testing . ”
There was a news conference , this release said , at New York University Medical Center .
It was led by a doctor representing an obscure if official - sounding group that few people have heard of , the Center for Health , Environment and Justice .
There were revelations about how shower curtains that are “ routinely sold at multiple retail outlets ” and can “ release as many as 108 volatile chemicals into the air . ”
Thus , the Toxic Shower Curtain Story was born .
ABCNews.com picked up on it , only to debunk it .
With varying amounts of credulousness , other outlets ran with it as well , including U.S. News & World Report , The Daily News in New York , MSNBC.com and The Los Angeles Times .
The gist of some of the coverage was that it was all a tempest in a bathtub , though other reports took the information at face value .
How do stories of this ilk get such bounce from major news organizations ?
Those who make their living composing news releases say there is an art to this easily dismissed craft .
Strategic word selection can catapult an announcement about a study , a product or a “ breakthrough ” onto the evening news instead of to its usual destination  the spam folder or circular file .
As diplomatic relations with Russia plummet faster than a barrel over Niagara Falls , politicians and scientists are starting to worry about the effects the frosting relationship could have on our space program .
As 80 beats reported , the principle concern is the Russian Soyuz vehicle , which will be the U.S. 's only means of sending crew and cargo to the International Space Station once NASA retires the space shuttles in 2010 .
Replacement shuttles wo n't be available in the U.S. until 2015 , which means that right now access depends on a $ 719 million deal with Russia to purchase rides on the Soyuz through 2011 .
On a larger scale , we 're looking at a Russian monopoly on sending humans into space — a leverage point that may affect the U.S. 's ability to take action against the country in the next few years .
The biggest Cassandra foretelling space trouble is Florida Sen .
Bill Nelson , who has announced that he " fears Russia 's aggressive action against Georgia may have some serious consequences , " such as " Russia denying us rides or charging exorbitant amounts for them . "
Granted , it 's worth noting that Florida houses the massive Kennedy Space Center , and the money funneled into the state for space and research operations totaled $ 1.68 billion in 2006 .
Needless to say , a significant slowdown or axing of future missions due to political deadlock will put quite a damper on his state 's economy .
Plus , it 's worth noting that not everyone appears to be panicking .
NASA spokesman Rob Navias told CNN , " We do not have concerns ...
The Soyuz , which has been flying for decades now , is extremely reliable and is extremely capable .
We have been partnering with the Russians for decades now for space flights . "
Though to play devil 's advocate , it 's also been decades since their government and military were thumbing their noses at us .

The Pirate Bay has ambitious plans to bring end - to - end encryption to all network activity , essentially blacking out a user 's traffic from deep packet inspection gear and other prying eyes .
Interesting project , sure , and definitely ambitious , but will it work ?
We doubt it , at least in the near term , and here 's why .
NewTeeVee has a nice writeup on the proposal by Pirate Bay cofounder Fredrik Neij for a system which he calls IPETEE .
The system either replaces or sits atop the basic operating system network stack , encrypting and decrypting all communications that pass through the the computer .
Diffie - Hellman key negotiation is used to generate session keys for the computer on each end of the network connection , though the system is smart enough to revert to standard , unencrypted TCP / IP or UDP should the target computer not support the encryption scheme .
( Rudimentary information is on the project 's wiki . )
Apart from the obvious drawback of CPU and bandwidth overhead , such a project could no doubt be completed ( eventually ) by the Jolly Roger - waving lads of The Pirate Bay , but its hurdles to adoption are legion .
For one thing , there 's the practical matter of what benefit it would have .
BitTorrent and other P2P protocols already have numerous encryption options , one reason that DPI vendors have tried to identify P2P " flows " based on handshake details , packet lengths , and behavior rather than on scanning headers .
Secure connections to e-mail are widespread ; bank records and other confidential information is routinely protected on the web already through robust encryption .
Skype encrypts VoIP calls .
There are other uses , of course , such as evading traffic - watching ad products from companies like NebuAd and Phorm , but the encrypted packets would still contain the source and destination IP addresses .
While this would keep your Amazon browsing history safe from the watchful eyes of that humming gray box in your ISP 's network operations center , visiting Expedia.com at lunch every day still indicates that you 're interested in travel .
For the same reason , mere encryption is n't an effective way to avoid censorship .
But the bigger practical question is who will adopt such technology ?
After all , it 's useless unless both parties have modified their machines .
P2P downloaders might well do this without a second thought , but it 's unlikely that most popular websites and web services would adopt a such an encryption method ; just carrying the " Proudly produced by The Pirate Bay " logo alone could well be enough to keep image - conscious companies away from the tech .
Widespread encryption might well come to all network activity in the long run , but in the short term , it 's unlikely that such a standard could be widely deployed enough to be useful until a broad range of interests feels that it 's urgent .
With individual websites , application developers , and protocol designers already incorporating encryption into the specific services where the public most clamors for it , the case for total encryption of network activity has n't been made .
Governments around the world are doing their best , though , as wiretap rules give government unprecedented access to private communications .
While most people in the US , at least , do n't appear worked up over the government 's warrantless wiretapping program or the NSA 's involvement with the telcos ( see today 's lopsided Senate vote in favor of the new FISA " compromise " ) , a couple of high - profile scandals , data breaches , or even information leaks on the true extent of such program may do more to make the public clamor for widespread encryption than the RIAA 's legal campaign ever has .
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he will step down this fall , clearing the way for fresh leadership from his centrist party .
At least in the short term , Mr. Olmert 's successor is likely to keep pursuing his government 's policies , including a flurry of regional diplomacy he has spearheaded recently .
A fresh leader , unencumbered by the corruption probes that dogged Mr. Olmert 's term in office , may fare better in winning broad support among Israelis for indirect peace talks with Syria and other moves .

Horses roam aimlessly in a meadow just around the block .
There 's a Boy Scout camp about a half - mile away .
The green thicket behind the plain , ranch - style house prevents exposure to adjoining homeowners , one of whom waveswarmly at passing motorists as he mows his lawn .
In this Duncanville neighborhood , there exists a rural serenity — or at least there used to , before Jim Trulock 's home became notorious in North Texas and across America .
His house , also known as The Cherry Pit , has grabbed headlines because of what has for years transpired behind its closed doors .
" We 're swingers , " says Trulock , smiling .
" But we 're not criminals . "
Trulock , 59 , and his sweetheart Julie Norris , 30 , are avid participants in what swingers refer to as " the lifestyle , " and are overseers of this controversial party house where men are urged to make " donations " to defray expenses , women are admitted free , and anything - goes debauchery is the raison d'être .
For more than a decade before the police raids and the bad publicity , The Cherry Pit would draw 50 to 100 people each weekend ; in the last year alone , it has played host to as many as 7,000 guests .
Trulock contends his slice of this mushrooming subculture is merely a family hangout where First Amendment rights are exercised in the form of saucy games such as " Naked Twister . "
" We do n't push it on anybody .
We do n't recruit .
We teach people who want to learn , " Trulock says .
" We 're an honest , loving , extended family . "
The City of Duncanville , however , is not feeling the love .
It sees The Cherry Pit as an illegal and immoral business gobbling up unreported income and sullying the neighborhood .
City fathers could n't have been pleased that The Cherry Pit maintains a Web site that encourages others to come to Duncanville to join the fun :
" We are a group of like - minded friends who enjoy living the swinging lifestyle .
We party on weekends and enjoy meeting new friends . "
In September 2007 , acting on a traffic - related complaint from a neighbor , the Duncanville police visited the house but did not arrest Trulock .
Instead the city posted " No Parking ' ' signs in front of his home .
On November 6 , 2007 , the Duncanville City Council enacted an ordinance making it illegal to operate a " sex club " in a residential area .
A month later , Trulock received the first of five citations , each alleging three distinct charges : operating an illegal sex club , operating a sexually oriented business without a license and operating a business in a residentially zoned area .
All 15 offenses were low - grade Class C misdemeanors , punishable only by fines .
Trulock 's lawyers , Ed Klein and Garry Cantrell , wasted no time in attacking the constitutionality of Duncanville 's new sex club ordinance , filing a civil rights case in state court alleging that the new law infringed on the free association rights of their client .
" These are people who get together because they want to be with each other , " Klein says .
" It 's not a business , there is no president or stockholders — it does n't even have registered members . "
In May 2008 , the city of Duncanville again voiced its disgust with The Cherry Pit .
It amended its sex club ordinance , says Klein , in what appeared to be an attempt to cure its constitutional shortcomings .
And things were just beginning to heat up .
Two Duncanville police raids , on July 19 and July 22 , led to one arrest as well as the at - gunpoint confiscation of a variety of items inside the house .
Based on an informant 's tip , police executed search warrants , seizing thousands of dollars in " Fun Money ' ' ( vouchers used like arcade tokens ) , $ 815 in real money , volumes of porn and " Cherry Pit business cards . ''
( If it has business cards , is n't it a business ? )
Authorities also seized partygoers ' cell phones , one man 's Viagra pills and a bag of donation forms .
( If the forms say " donation , " is n't that what 's being solicited ? )
During the July 19 search , the Duncanville police allegedly found an assortment of tools of the sex trade : A stripper pole .
A bondage room .
Unclean mattresses on the floor .
Porn .
A dance floor .
Panties hanging from the ceiling .
A hot tub with an unsavory broth .
Police returned the second time to seize alcohol they had found the first time but failed to specify in their earlier warrant — 582 bottles of liquor .
In the first raid , Norris claims , she received a bruise to her forehead when she attempted to answer the door as the police broke it down with a battering ram .
" We tried to play nice , '' says Duncanville City Manager Kent Cagle , noting that over the last few years , Trulock was visited by the police chief , the fire chief and a city building official .
" They spoke to him , [ but ] he came back with a new , even more defiant attitude . ''
Cagle is leading the charge against The Cherry Pit and rattles off his city 's well - publicized list of potential allegations against Trulock : Organized criminal activity , prostitution , narcotics trafficking , money laundering .
He mentions that a home with a septic system is not equipped to handle a houseful of 100 people and that guests " walk around drunk ' ' in the front yard .
" It 's 95 percent a legal issue , '' he maintains .
" If your neighbor was raising pigs in a slaughterhouse next door , or running an auto - repair shop with junkers in the yard next door , they would be in violation .
That 's what 's happening here , and when they claim they are not a business , they are not being honest . ''
Each side accuses the other of engaging in pretense : the City of Duncanville in claiming this is not about sex but about zoning ;
The Cherry Pit in claiming theirs is not a business but a private dwelling where invited guests congregate .
Says Trulock , " This is no different from people getting together to watch the Super Bowl .
Or people parking on a street in a neighborhood so they can attend a concert at a school . ''
In a more candid moment , Cagle cuts through the legalese and gets to the heart of Duncanville 's problem with The Cherry Pit : " It 's just gross . ''
Both sides agree that this tug - of - war might have been avoided if the issue had n't become a public one .
In September 2007 , two local TV stations began reporting on the conflict , but the story entered a higher media orbit when Fox 's Bill O'Reilly aired his January 16 , 2008 , " exposé " of The Cherry Pit .
To some , the tale seemed a revelation .
In her July 25 Dallas Morning News column , Jacquielynn Floyd wrote that she was surprised to learn that a " swing club ' ' can be something more than a venue to listen to big - band music .
Truth is , the lifestyle has roots much deeper than Duncanville , reaching back to the hedonism of ancient Rome .
More modern times saw World War II pilots who , while stateside , cared for and bedded the wives of those flyboys who were in combat .
While many of those outside the lifestyle view it as immoral , harmful or downright bizarre ( the 1997 film The Ice Storm certainly painted it that way ) , 1969 's Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice gave swinging a funny and satirical twist .
Adds Trulock , " It 's going on everywhere .
In every big city and every little town .
People from all walks of life .
People come here on Saturday night and then go to church on Sunday . "
The Dallas Observer interviewed a dozen locals who agreed to speak frankly but anonymously about " swinging ' ' in the metroplex .
Many of them view The Cherry Pit as being on the low end of a subculture in Dallas that includes thousands of people who embrace the lifestyle and its unique rules , values and mores .
They describe their avocation as something akin to what 's portrayed on the freshly minted CBS show Swingtown .
The hit drama reflects on a stylish 1970s America in which cul - de- sac couples dropped their keys in a fishbowl before dropping their bellbottoms .
Locals make the case that Dallas , a reputed bastion of conservatism and the shiny buckle on the Bible Belt , has its own Swingtown .

" The schoolteachers are by far the freakiest , '' says Jerold Morgan ( not his real name ) .
" Teachers , lawyers , business owners — one guy is a district attorney .
Another 's a judge .
A minister — oh , and cops .
Lots of cops .
We used to know a mother and daughter who came out together .
Very attractive women .
And , honey , remember Doc and his son ?
Doc was a Dallas doctor with a bad toupee .
And his son was an Air Force pilot .
They were like tag - team partners . ''
Responds his wife Janet , " Yeah , that was a little over the top . ''
The Dallas couple counts themselves as part of a lifestyle whose numbers are difficult to gauge .
The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University , renowned for its research in human sexuality , maintains 4 million Americans participate in the lifestyle , but if Web traffic is any indication , that number seems understated .
AdultFriendFinder.com , the largest sex - and - swinger site ( meaning it 's not just swinger - specific ) , boasts a membership of 22,914,156 , making it the 42nd most popular Web site in the world , according to Alexa.com , an Internet traffic watcher .
Of its registered members , 1,076,158 are Texans .
In Dallas , Jerold and Janet are " VIP members " at IniQuity , which bills itself as a " couples club , " whose rules for its more than 23,000 members state , " Playful behavior is welcome . ''
While the exact number of swingers may be difficult to discern , its definition is not : " Couples engaged in non-monogamous , consensual , sexually related activities , " says marriage and family therapist Kim Hatley , the co-founder of the Coppell Counseling Center and past president of the Texas Mental Health Counselors Association .
" It is abnormal in the social sense , maybe , but it has never been abnormal in the clinical sense .
There is reason , in my position , to be an advocate of whatever helps a couple be happy and stay together . ''
The Morgans live in Lewisville , have a 17 - year - old daughter , and operate a successful construction business .
Jerold is 41 , muscular and fit , with stylishly spiked blond hair .
Janet is 39 , slim , pretty and a bit shy .
The Morgans look 10 years younger than their ages .
They 've been together for 21 years , married for 19 , and they say they are very much in love but deeply involved in the lifestyle .
They are close friends with Thomas and Tammy of Plano .
Thomas works in PR , is a long - distance runner and wears a tiny earring .
Tammy is a busty brunette with a successful career in the catering business .
Both couples stress that the bulk of their lives is as interesting , mundane and challenging as anyone else 's .
It 's the other sliver of their time , when they participate in swinging that makes them something of a curiosity .
Or an abomination .
" It 's not about sex , '' says Jerold , drawing a perplexed stare from his wife .
" I do n't know what you 're even talking about ! '' she says .
He explains that for him , the lifestyle is an opportunity to avoid monogamy without cheating , to meet friends who are not judgmental and to see the satisfaction in his wife 's eyes when she is pleased .
" If she meets Brad Pitt and wants to sleep with him , great .
My love for her , and my security in us , means that everything — even every sex act — does n't have to be about me . ''
Meanwhile , his encounters ultimately lead him once again to a realization :
" Nobody fucks me as good as my wife . ''
To which Janet says , wryly : " Right .
And that means it 's about sex . ''
The Morgans " go out ' ' once a week , to a club or private house party .
But they agree that 95 percent of the time , their activity is limited to socializing , flirting and possibly what is called " soft - swapping ' ' ( kissing , touching , possibly some oral contact ) .
As committed to swinging as they are , they say that they have had sexual intercourse with someone else just once in the last year .
Both couples say they discovered the lifestyle by accident .
Thomas and Tammy were on vacation in Mexico on a pub crawl when an attractive young woman complimented Tammy on her breasts and goofily asked her to lift up her top .
Thomas playfully encouraged her to do so , and moments later , to the couple 's surprise , the young woman plunged her face into Tammy 's cleavage .
Tammy recalls thinking , " That was weird but fun .
We should do something like that again . "
The Morgans tell a similar story .
Driving around lost in Dallas eight years ago , they pulled into the parking lot of a bar and asked the doorman about his establishment .
" Well , '' he said , " it 's very different . ''
The bar was a swingers club , Sans Souci ( French for " without a care ' ' ) .
The Morgans recognized that the large number of women dancing with one another , the absence of men hitting on Janet , and the occasional female patron strolling around wearing nothing but panties was indicative of something .... different .
" What we found , '' Jerold says , " were people — nice people , attractive people , normal people — who did n't care what sort of car I drove or what sort of watch I wore or what brand of shoes she wore .
Normally in Dallas , it 's all about status ... meat - market stuff , " he says .
" We discovered a place where you cut through all that bullshit and get straight to the fun part . ''
These couples say that one of the " fun parts ' ' is the death of infidelity .
Thomas , 43 , says he cheated on " every girlfriend I ever had '' before he and his new wife eased into swinging three years ago .
" And if not for this , I 'm sure I 'd be cheating on Tammy now too . ''
Tammy says her previous marriage was " weighed down by jealousy , distrust and , eventually , divorce .
There 's no cheating here [ in the lifestyle ] , because it 's not cheating if we both know about it , if we do it together , if we do it in control and as a choice .
And you know , that 's the biggest reason it 's OK : Because it 's our choice .
Freedom of choice .
That 's in the Constitution , right ? ''
Among the swingers interviewed , there is concern about the stigma attached to their lifestyle decisions .
But they are not at all ashamed of the decision itself or by their motivations .
Also , there is a good deal of skepticism about monogamy , perhaps as a defense to the familiar barrage of questions they field from those who are not part of the lifestyle :
Is it just about sex ?
What if your husband falls in love with somebody else 's wife ?
Are n't you worried about diseases ?
About going to hell ?
And perhaps most troubling for swingers , " What , if anything , do you tell your children ? ''
Says Janet : " I would not want to have to tell my daughter , so I am very protective of it .
Now , a couple of years ago , I was in the ' Women of IniQuity ' calendar , and one of our employees happened to see the calendar .
That created some gossip .
So now , no more photos . ''
Thomas says , " People drink too much .
Do they tell their kids ?
Dad goes on a hunting vacation and shoots Bambi .
Does he show his daughter Bambi's bloody head ?
When it comes to sensitive stuff , personal stuff , I take the same caution with my kid that you do with yours . ''
Therapist Hatley says , " Children are not equipped to handle the intimate details of their parents ' lives , no matter the nature of those details ...
Children want to see their parents be affectionate to each other .
Anything more than that could be damaging . ''
Such solid reasoning , however , provides little comfort to neighborhood parents who would prefer not having to explain to their innocents the tangled relationships between the people who party next door .
Swinging is also not without its risks for some adults .
Mimi , who is 45 and lives in Coppell , says she understands the potential damage .
The divorced mother of two had a boyfriend of five years who claimed that his busy work schedule had him based part - time in St. Louis and part - time in Dallas .
Mimi recently discovered , however , that what her boyfriend had in St. Louis was a wife and two kids .
When she confronted him , he attempted to calm her with what he said was the " appeal ' ' of having multiple relationships and even multiple families .
" He told me he is a swinger , as if suddenly that gave him a license to do what swinging really is , which is cheating on the original promise a couple makes to each other , '' she says .
" When I 'm ready to settle down with one man , I do that and I 'm monogamous .
These people want to do both .
All that means is that something very critical was missing in our relationship or in his makeup .
Everything he said is a lie , a self - indulgent lie , and eventually , I think for swingers , someone is going to get hurt .
In this case , it was me . ''
The Morgans say they are aware of these risks , which is one reason why they shun a weekly house party that is staged at a 7,500 - square - foot mansion near Lake Lewisville .
In fact , they know about dozens of homes all over the metroplex that regularly schedule private weekend swingers parties .
For the couple , some of these house parties are too " intense . ' '
Jerold says attendees often stress a " hardcore focus ' ' on sexual encounters .
He much prefers the atmosphere of the extensive couples - only club circuit in Dallas where he and Janet are allowed to participate as much or as little as they choose .

Customers quickly glean that IniQuity offers them something out of the ordinary when they walk inside the front door , where they are greeted by two comely women .
One is dressed in business attire .
The other is not dressed at all , except for the body paint that 's been used to decorate her frame with Eden - like leaves and flowers .
IniQuity , located just east of Interstate 35 and sandwiched between Old San Francisco Steakhouse and the Cabaret Royale topless bar , is a " couples club " — which is essentially code for " swingers club . ''
IniQuity promotes itself as a " members - only lifestyle club for couples and single women .
Membership is not available to single men . "
Of the 19 or so nightclubs in the metroplex that cater to the couples crowd , at least six are considered upscale , and of these , IniQuity is arguably the crown jewel .
The interior is heavy on faux - Roman décor , features dark and rich colors , and is immersed in black lighting .
Adorning the walls are silver and gold mannequin torsos , some with vaginas that are cartoonishly oversized .
Regulars at IniQuity follow the dress code rules posted on the club 's Web site .
Men are instructed to " be dashing , '' which they will not have the opportunity to do unless accompanied by a female .
Women , who come to IniQuity with dates or in groups of other females , are encouraged to " dress as wildly sexy or as tastefully elegant as you wish . ''
" We are years ahead of our time , '' says Rick Reid , 45 , one of the owners of IniQuity .
On this Saturday night IniQuity is overflowing with pretty , polished , early 30s couples who might just as well be hanging poolside at Hotel ZaZa or courtside at a Dallas Mavericks game .
Says Reid , " I do n't want to embarrass Dallas .
I do n't want to be a black eye on Dallas .
I want to protect Dallas .
And I want to clean up the reputation of the lifestyle . ''
Dallas , in turn , has been good to IniQuity where couples pay as much as $ 7,500 in annual membership dues , and the club 's four partners , according to Reid , split a net of $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 a month .
The owners have expanded their concept with new IniQuitys in Houston and Oklahoma City , and have plans to expand to Las Vegas , Chicago and Fort Lauderdale .
Civility is on display at IniQuity .
There are no drunken bar brawls ( IniQuity is bring your own bottle ) ; no wolf packs of drooling males .
There are far more women than men , and the only competition among them is for the honor of wearing the least fabric .
The setting is provocative and private , though there was a sighting of Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez that was publicized in the Dallas Observer 's blog , Unfair Park , in May 2007 .
Kelly is a steel - blue - eyed blonde who met her fiancé Scott at IniQuity but remains a weekly visitor .
" When we meet a couple , we both meet them , and we get to know them , all four of us , '' she says .
" We become friends .
It 's not , ' OK , nice to meet you , let 's go fuck . '
We go to dinner , we go to the movies .
Sex is part of it , but for us , and I think for most people , one of the rules is that it 's supposed to be for fun and friendship . ''
Owner Reid insists that IniQuity is " mostly just a regular nightclub for people to meet . ''
While it might be a social club , where a hundred people laugh , dance and flirt in the main downstairs bar , Reid also concedes " the place reeks of sex . ''
And indeed upstairs in the VIP rooms , decadence rules .
But " actual sexual activity while at IniQuity " is unwelcome , and " no illegal activity will be tolerated , " at least according to the official " rules " detailed on its
Web site , which recommends " ... a nice hotel right next door . "
And yet on this Saturday night , an all - nude girl - on - girl sexual encounter unfolds .
Reid says that recently , a police complaint was registered when a male VIP was caught receiving oral sex upstairs .
The publicity was embarrassing for the gentleman , Reid says , largely because the customer is a government official with NASA clearance .
More private :
The upstairs $ 250 - a- night sleepover rooms , which are full of gadgets , mirrors , drinking glasses and Kleenex .
( No condoms — that would be promoting intercourse , cautions Reid . )
The " Swing Room ' ' features a $ 500 mechanical swing that dangles from the ceiling .
The " Pole Room ' ' features , well , a pole .
" It actually needs to be there , '' Reid says .
" In addition to whatever else , it 's a building support . ''
Couples such as the Morgans prefer the privacy and exclusivity of IniQuity to places such as The Cherry Pit , which they feel has damaged the reputation of the lifestyle and brought scorn on those who swing .
Says Thomas , " Those sorts of places , at least by reputation , cause [ non - swinging ] people to get scared , to put labels on things .
And when people are ignorant about something , it helps them to be able to dismiss it .
It makes them feel better about themselves and better about their conventional relationships , which , the last time I checked , was n't exactly the be-all , end - all answer to happiness . ''

While sitting at an oversized kitchen island in his Duncanville home , Jim Trulock is something less than telegenic .
His appearance makes it easy to be drawn away from his conviction about The Cherry Pit ( " Sounds strange , but he is a very principled human being , '' says attorney Klein ) and toward the fact that he is a mess .
His gray crew - cut is splotchy , as if he barbered it himself .
The large bandage covering the gash on his forehead looks as if he doctored it himself .
His grin reveals that he has more fun than teeth .
Trulock has never before granted a full interview and has never before permitted media into The Cherry Pit , where a room - by - room tour reveals that it is weathered and without frills — overall more dilapidated than disturbing .
He proudly announces that his home " has five levels ' '— true , if you count the sunken living room and the upstairs loft .
He admits to being a " pack rat ' ' —
" You can't even walk through my garage , '' he says , " because both my parents died a few years ago , and all their stuff is out there , and I still have n't gone through it . ''
The house , built in 1979 , seems to have gone 29 years without an upgrade of paint , fixtures or flooring .
There is a bedroom ( nondescript but for a series of adjoining beds ) , a makeshift office , a living - room dance floor and the loft , which features an L - shaped couch .
The loft is also a snake 's nest of wires .
Trulock 's partner Julie Norris claims a chemistry degree from Baylor and a law degree from SMU ; the retired Trulock is a computer techie , which accounts for the wires .
Wires to the massive sound system , to the strobe lights , to the Christmas lights .
And one wire that runs across the ceiling from which hang dozens of panties .
The house lacks a certain feng shui , but Trulock says , " The feedback we get from our swingers is that ours is one of the cleanest places around .
It 's just like a frat house . ''
While walking around the one - acre grounds of The Cherry Pit ( valued by the Dallas County Appraisal District at $ 205,000 ) , Trulock recounts stories of his Louisiana high school days in a rock band .
He talks of how he 's been involved in parties here since the early '90s and claims that he has taken the neighborhood 's complaints to heart .
There is a tin shed that tops the infamous hot tub , which , Trulock insists , " has chlorine and meets code . "
There are curtains covering all the windows .
Only Trulock 's hilltop neighbor has any sort of a view : a yard that Trulock filled with gravel to encourage his guests to refrain from parking on the street and getting a ticket .
" We know this is not for everybody , and we respect that , '' Trulock says .
" As far as being dangerous , I 'll tell you what 's dangerous : Going to bars , getting drunk , random hookups , driving drunk .
Those are the social problems , not us . "
Trulock 's attorneys claim that the City of Duncanville — " A Wonderful Place to Raise a Family , " trumpets the city 's Web site — is carpet - bombing their client with accusations in an attempt to find The Cherry Pit guilty of something .
The extent to which Duncanville is prepared to fight is evident from the manner in which it amended its sex club ordinance in May .
Included in the amendments are 37 findings of fact — among them , " The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level . ''— which are listed to support the city 's legal argument that its compelling interest in regulating sex clubs trumps an individual 's First Amendment claims .
Duncanville won its initial skirmish regarding the constitutionality of the ordinance .
Dallas County Court at Law Judge King Fifer dismissed Trulock 's civil rights claim for lack of jurisdiction , says Klein .
The case is currently on appeal .
In August , adds Klein , prosecutors representing the city asked a Duncanville municipal court judge to dismiss five of the 15 pending Class C misdemeanors against Trulock , stating their intention to re-file them under an ordinance that makes it a Class A misdemeanor ( punishable by up to a year in the county jail ) to operate a sexually oriented business within 1,000 feet of a residence , school or church .
No arrests have yet been made — other than one on September 5 , after Duncanville police charged Trulock with violating the Texas Alcohol and Beverage Code for possessing the 582 bottles of liquor police seized during their second raid in July .
Klein estimates that Duncanville 's efforts to shut down The Cherry Pit will cost its residents around $ 500,000 .
" If I was a Duncanville taxpayer , that 's the part of this story that I would find most outrageous , '' he says .
" You can't tell what 's going on there even with night - vision goggles ...
It'd be funny if not for the fact that it 's all a very expensive civil rights fight , a very expensive moral crusade . ''
City Manager
Cagle insists that the city has spent " no more than $ 50,000 pursuing this case . ''
Trulock 's own crusade obviously appeals to some 694 people who are members of his Yahoo group .
As they await a fall court date on charges from November 2007 , the Pit partyers still visit Trulock 's home in small numbers and safely assemble at local restaurants for G- rated " meet - and - greets . ' '
Trulock calmly notes that his " extended family ' ' will play board games at the get - togethers , but then he shifts gears to suggest , as he does on his CherryPit.org Web site , that Cagle is " power mad ' ' and says the city is motivated by nothing more than wanting to land - grab his " rural upscale ' ' property for selfish financial reasons .
" Ultimately , we 're going to run out of money , '' says Klein , who has been unsuccessful at soliciting legal assistance from civil rights groups such as the ACLU .
" So it is a war of attrition .
The City of Duncanville has more money than [ Trulock ] does , more money than we do .
So we 're pushing a huge boulder up a steep hill . ''
And when it ends ?
Then what ?
If Trulock and Norris and The Cherry Pit do leave Duncanville , that wo n't end the matter or their lifestyle .
They will just relocate somewhere else in North Texas .
" Most people would 've quit , but you 've just met the world 's worst hardhead , '' Trulock says .
" I wo n't quit . ''
WASHINGTON 
The package of spending and tax cuts proposed by Senator John McCain is unlikely to achieve his goal of balancing the federal budget by 2013 , economists and fiscal experts said Monday .
“ It would be very difficult to achieve in the best of circumstances , and even more difficult under the policies that Senator McCain has proposed , ” said Robert L. Bixby , executive director of the Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan budget watchdog group .
Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , is proposing billions of dollars in tax cuts .
But advisers to Mr. McCain said those costs would be more than offset by savings from slower growth in spending .
In his proposal , Mr. McCain said he would hold overall spending growth to 2.4 percent a year .
That is a tall order because federal spending has been growing an average of more than 6 percent a year in the last five years .

Excerpt from the Merrill SEC filing –
CDO Sale :
On July 28 , 2008 , Merrill Lynch agreed to sell $ 30.6 billion gross notional amount of U.S. super senior ABS CDOs to an affiliate of Lone Star Funds for a purchase price of $ 6.7 billion .
At the end of the second quarter of 2008 , these CDOs were carried at $ 11.1 billion , and in connection with this sale Merrill Lynch will record a write - down of $ 4.4 billion pre-tax in the third quarter of 2008 .
Merrill Lynch will provide financing to the purchaser for approximately 75 % of the purchase price .
The recourse on this loan will be limited to the assets of the purchaser .
The purchaser will not own any assets other than those sold pursuant to this transaction .
The transaction is expected to close within 60 days .
My translation of the above :
Merrill sends over the CDOs to Lone Star and receives $ 6.7 billion , but Loan Star gets 75 % financing so the net to Merrill is ( 6.7 X 75 % ) $ 1.675 billion .
Thus Merrill ends up with $ 1.675 billion in cash and a loan outstanding to Lone Star in the amount of $ 5.025 billion .
Of course there is nothing to be found regarding the specific terms of the loan , but what may be important is the following :
The purchaser will not own any assets other than those sold pursuant to this transaction
My translation : Lone Star set up a separate LLC ( the purchaser ) for this transaction and Merrill ’s only recourse is those same assets that it was trying to dump .
For Lone Star this nets out to a $ 1.675 billion payment for the control AND UPSIDE on the $ 30.6 billion of assets .
Thus , Merrill received $ 1.675 billion and is still exposed to the residual $ 5.025 billion which it MAY have to take as a future write - down should the loan to the LLC go to non-perform .
Again , without the loan term sheet its impossible to tell what ’s going on in detail , but the bottom - line , in the worst case scenario Merrill just sold this $ 30.6 billion basket of dog poop for $ 1.675 billion or 5.47385 cents on the dollar , not the 22 cents as widely reported .

The financial crisis is not over .
Neither tax rebates nor low interest rates nor higher or lower exchange rates can do the job of reviving an economy that is burdened by debt loads that are too high .
On the contrary : the policy measures that the US authorities have been applying will prolong the agony .
Be prepared for the challenges of extended financial turmoil and economic stagnation .
Early this year , the US central bank decided to manage the debt crisis in the light - hearted belief that a few aggressive rate cuts would " unfreeze " the banking system .
Yet as of the end of the third quarter of 2008 , the arteries of the financial system are still cluttered , and the financial system has moved even closer to total collapse .
Those banks and brokerages that have n't yet failed have been kept alive by emergency monetary transfusions from the US central bank .
The Fed has cast away all restraints of economic rationality and is acting in a purely political way .
The Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System is pursuing the goal of getting the financial system through the mess — at least until the end of the year , no matter how high the costs will be thereafter .
The American central bank has adopted the financial equivalent of the military strategy of scorched earth .
The economic philosophy of the current chairman of the US Federal Reserve System can be summarized in the slogan , " No depression under my rule ! "
He resembles a military leader who stubbornly declares , " No defeat under my rule ! " the more the chance of victory is slipping away , and defeat can be denied no longer .
The current economic disaster is the result of the combination of negligence , hubris , and wrong economic theory .
For decades , an economic and monetary policy has been practiced based on the illusion of , " It does n't matter . "
At first it was , " Deficits do n't matter . "
From that , the policy of " it does n't matter " got extended to money creation , the credit expansion , the stock - market bubble , and the housing boom .
Now , we 're being told that buying financial junk by the central bank to beef up banks and brokerages also does n't matter .
As a byproduct of this mindless economic and monetary policy , financial market operators , too , have lost their heads .
Trusting the official cheerleaders , investors hold on in the trenches until they will have lost their last shirt .
Economic weakness is spreading around the globe .
There is no new spurt of economic growth in sight .
Yet many investors stay put because they have been conditioned to believe that government will bail them out .
The current financial crisis is not of a cyclical nature .
The financial turmoil is the symptom of the structural imbalances in the real economy .
Over decades , expansive monetary policy has gone hand in hand with implicit and explicit bailout guarantees , and this has distorted the process of capital allocation .
Under such perverted conditions , those investors will win most who cast away the restraints of prudence .
It is a game that can go on for a long time — up to the point when the irrationality has become systemic .
The behavior of the investment community reflects the incentive structure that has been put in place by the authorities .
Investors have learnt to dance to the tunes of the pied pipers at high places .
After all , the individual market player could see from those who were ahead of him in the abandonment of prudence how money is being made .
In the wake of this , financial companies have become overextended and are now in need of deleveraging .
Yet the core problem lies in the imbalances of the real economy .
In the Austrian theory of the business cycle , the distinction is made between the " primary " and " secondary " depression .
The secondary depression is what catches the eye : the turmoil in the financial markets .
Yet the underlying cause is the distortion of the economy 's capital structure : the primary depression .
The simple fact is that the US economy is burdened with a highly lopsided capital structure as the consequence of a wide discrepancy between consumption and production , which , in turn , is the result of monetary policy .
Persistent trade imbalances are the symptoms of this discrepancy .
This means for the US economy that lower interest rates and government incentives aimed at boosting consumption work as pure poison .
Instead of more consumption , more savings , less consumption and fewer imports are needed .
The current financial crisis reflects that many debtors have reached their debt limit and that creditors are lowering that limit .
From now on , business and consumers , governments and investors must work under the restraints of lowered debt ceilings .
Economic policy as it is currently practiced is in a fix : lower interest rates may temporarily help to alleviate the financial crisis , but they exacerbate the fundamentals that are the cause of the financial crisis .
Equally , a lower dollar would make imports costlier for the United States , while a strong dollar comes with lower import prices .
But while a low dollar would help to expand exports , a strong dollar impedes export growth .
Therefore , the United States will have high trade deficits as long as the economy does not fall deeper into recession .
Without an adaptation that would increase savings , decrease consumption , and reduce imports , the US economy can only go on in the old fashion with ever more debt accumulation .
But the limit of debt expansion has been reached .
The financial crisis has reduced the willingness of domestic and foreign creditors to extend loans .
Foreign creditors are getting ready to reduce their holding of US debt in a more drastic way .
The governmental takeover of the mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailed out the monetary authorities of China , Japan , Russia , and other foreign countries that hold agency debt .
As a result of the socialization of the so - called government - sponsored enterprises , the Treasury opened a window of opportunity for these countries to unload their US assets at subsidized prices , all at the cost of the US taxpayer .
A profound restructuring of global capital has become unavoidable .
Such a process is quite different from a recession in the traditional sense .
In contrast to a sharp and typically short - lived recession , when , after the rupture , business as usual can go on , the restructuring of a distorted capital structure will require time to play out .
Rebalancing the distorted capital structure of an economy requires enduring nitty - gritty entrepreneurial piecemeal work .
This can only be done under the guidance of the discovery process of competition , as it is inherent in the workings of the price system of the unhampered market .
Anticyclical fiscal and monetary policies are of no help when it comes to the daily toil in business to work towards reestablishing a balanced capital structure .
The so - called income multiplier wo n't work , and lower interest rates wo n't stimulate spending .
On the contrary : these policy measures only make the task of the entrepreneur harder .
The difficulties ahead arise from the problem that business as usual cannot go on under conditions of a credit crunch , which has its roots in the distortions of the economy 's capital structure .
Thus , even if the financial market turmoil were to settle , there wo n't be the simple resumption of the old ways of doing business .
The belief that , after the financial crisis is over , the real economy can reemerge unscathed , is probably the greatest error that many investors share with the policymakers .
As a result of the bailouts and the socialization of the mortgage agencies , the financial system is now fully infected with moral hazard .
The disastrous effects of these government interventions will show up soon .
The major task of bringing the capital structure in order is still ahead and more pain is in the waiting .
As long as governments and central banks continue to focus on the monetary symptoms of the " secondary depression " and continue to ignore the structural aspects of the " primary depression , " they act like quacks .
Ignorant of the lessons of the Austrian School , the authorities will most likely continue with their disastrous policies .
The Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport is the quintessential personification of the Galactic Empire 's design philosophy for military vehicles .
It 's huge , lumbering , obscenely powerful , and as close to invulnerable as it was possible to build it .
The intention was obviously to minimize Imperial losses while demoralizing the enemy with an unstoppable , relentless , beastial , all - terrain walking tank .
But for all its strengths , as was typical with single - minded Imperial designs , it had obvious flaws that were compensated for with heavy armor and support vehicles .
While the AT - AT did have massively powerful forward - mounted blasters that could devastate enemy buildings and ground vehicles with ease , it was slow , had poor maneuverability , and most glaringly , an approximately 300° blind spot .
It could neither see nor attack anything that was n't almost directly in front of it , limited by a " neck " that gave the cockpit a limited ability to look around in a narrow cone in front of it .
Besides the forward - mounted heavy blasters , its only other attack was a stomp , which , while undoubtedly devastating due to the incredible weight of the 75 foot tall walker , was impractical against anything other than fixed emplacements or immobilized vehicles which should have been destroyed before the AT - AT got that close in the first place .
Standard deployment apparently called for the AT - AT to compensate for these weaknesses with support vehicles such as the AT - ST , as seen in the Battle of Hoth .
The quicker , but less heavily armored , scout walkers could protect the AT - AT's ( in) vulnerable flank from ambushes and provide a measure of anti-aircraft and anti-personnel defense , tactics for which the AT - AT was virtually useless .
Clearly , as seen in the Battle of Hoth , these measures were not adequate to protect the lumbering giants .
The very idea that a single soldier , Jedi or no , was able to climb underneath one and toss a thermal detonator inside was inexcusable .
There can be no doubt that the AT - AT needs at least one additional weapon for anti-personnel and light vehicle defense .
To fill this role , I propose a gun turret , slung underneath and to the rear of the AT - AT , between the hind legs .
