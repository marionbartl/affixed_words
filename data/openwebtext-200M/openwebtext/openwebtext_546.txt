In aims to bring that daily simplicity to virtual worlds , on any webpage .
When you land in JLI , we want you to feel like you 're smack in the middle of a social community where you can express yourself , upload multimedia , and link to friends - not in the middle of an empty island .
And unlike other Web - delivered virtual worlds , we 're already delivering next - gen 3D graphics and physics to both Mac & PC , Firefox & IE .
Mashable 's
Take :
The concept of a virtual world in terms of a graphical , game - like environment does n’t particularly suit my interests .
Yet I find Just Leap
In , a beta release launched out of Vancouver , Canada , offers a surprisingly rich experience in terms of interaction with objects and visual detail of most everything involved .
What ’s more , all such interplay is accomplished within one 's browser .
Now , it should be said that there is a software download necessary to browse Just Leap In ’s dimensions .
But it is available for Mac and PC users , and the time it takes to install said download and begin enjoying what ’s been created is a simple matter of restarting Firefox / IE .
Gamers familiar with the mouse - plus - keyboard setup will have little trouble adjusting to the set of options shown in the controls panel .
But it ’s a bit unintuitive so far as the use of the mouse cursors is concerned .
You may find yourself wanting to change your view with your cursor , but that cannot happen .
At least it is not possible on the Mac side of the equation .
Instead , you must use your keyboard to do so .
JLI ’s creators instruct the user to complete a Ctrl+click + drag maneuver for something called “ mouselook , ” but this process is evidently disturbed by a very similar Ctrl+click trigger that brings up a Reset / Set Start / Revert Texture menu of choices .
If you ’re willing jump this hurdle , though , you will find Just Leap In an appealing alternative to Second Life and its competitors .
It ’s browser - based nature makes it something of a stunner .
The physics engine is a treat , and visual detail again is an outstanding highlight .
A look at the world in full - screen is pretty remarkable when one considers the setting in which the application is operating .

After their nationally televised acceptance speeches , some of the 2020 Emmy winners had more to say to the press .
We ’ve rounded up the best responses here .
We ’ve heard it repeated so many times that consumers and healthcare professionals , alike , assume it must be true : that the epidemic of childhood obesity has created a new epidemic among today ’s young people — of type 2 diabetes .
Once thought to be an adult disease , type 2 diabetes is said to have alarmingly increased among children and adolescents because rates of overweight and obesity have tripled in the past two decades .
But after twenty years , has anyone actually checked to see if this is really true ?
Is there really an epidemic of childhood diabetes ?
Physical assessments and blood tests are done regularly on representative samples of the American population through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ( NHANES ) , and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among U.S. children has been tracked since 1988 .
Unlike obesity statisticulations , no one even has to think or understand statistics to do a simple check of these facts , if they cared to .
Incredibly , virtually no one has .
Back when the government declared a nationwide war on obesity , with a focus ‘ on the children ’ , the public was easily convinced that obesity was deadly .
Facts to the contrary were already available to public health officials , though , and had even been published for medical professionals .
So — as young people continue to be healthier with each passing decade and the CDC estimates that today ’s children will live longer than at any other time in our nation ’s history — as every childhood obesity initiative has been unable to demonstrate effectiveness in reducing obesity rates or disease — and as even the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded , after a comprehensive review of 40 years of evidence on childhood obesity screening and interventions , there is no sound evidence to support them or that childhood ‘ overweight ’ or ‘ obesity ’ is even related to health outcomes in adults or children — the belief continues that childhood obesity is so unhealthy and epidemic , that it ’s driving increases in type 2 diabetes among young people .
These claims of dual ravages of population - wide obesity and diabetes epidemics among youngsters , and predictions of dire consequences for the health of the nation , are what ’s supporting calls for urgent nationwide public health measures , especially focused on the purported bad diets of today 's young people .
An epidemic of diabetes in children is at the core to the claim that this will be the first generation to live shorter lives than their parents .
The importance of this childhood diabetes claim and the massive federal , state and local funds being spent to address it , make it even more incredible that no one has done a simple fact check to see if is even true .
The experts tell us
So many public health officials and medical experts have repeated the same information , that , perhaps , no one has thought to or dared to question or critically examine it :
Type 2 diabetes has changed from a disease of our grandparents and parents to a disease of our children .
As more and more children and young adults develop this devastating disease , it has become apparent that we have much to learn about … how to prevent this " new epidemic " from destroying future generations of Americans .
Type 2 diabetes has been described as a new epidemic in the American pediatric population …
In 1992 , it was rare for most pediatric centers to have patients with type 2 diabetes … and by 1999 , it accounted for 8 – 45 % of new cases depending on geographic location .
— Dr. Francine Ratner Kaufman , M.D. , president of the American Diabetes Association .
( Clinical Diabetes , 2002 )
In the past 25 years , the health status of our children has deteriorated and with it , their ability to learn and become productive members of society .
The proportion of overweight children has tripled , and the number of children who suffer serious medical , psychological and social repercussions has increased .
Type 2 diabetes , also known as adult onset diabetes , has increased by a factor of ten .
— Dr. Maria Goldstein , M.D. , as chair of the New Mexico Pediatric Society and member of the Childhood Obesity Task Force and steering committee creating New Mexico ’s Strategic Action Plan , Physical Activity and Nutrition in the Schools .
( Albuquerque Tribune , February 1 , 2005 )
The prevalence of overweight among adolescents in the United States has nearly tripled in the past two decades …
Type 2 diabetes , previously considered an adult disease , has increased dramatically in children and adolescents .
Overweight and obesity are closely linked to type 2 diabetes .
— U.S. Surgeon General , Call To Action To Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity Overweight in Children and Adolescents .
The term “ diabesity ” is even a registered trademark of ShapeUp America !
During the mid-1990s , type 2 diabetes in youth increased ten - fold in the US , and mirrored the childhood obesity epidemic .
— Dr. Kaufman ( “ Childhood Obesity : The Declining Health of America ’s Next Generation , ” testimony before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Children and Families , July 16 , 2008 )
With rising cases of childhood obesity , children are now getting Type 2 diabetes , and the numbers are increasing rapidly .
— Dr. Jennifer Shine Dyer , M.D. , assistant professor of pediatrics at Nationwide Children ’s Hospital and the College of Medicine at Ohio State University .
We know that obesity and overweight are important health threats …
Another very scary fact for children .
Type 2 Diabetes , which used to be known as adult onset diabetes , is now increasingly being diagnosed and adding to the cardiovascular risk profile of our children . —
Dr. Julie Gerberding , M.D. , Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , June 2 , 2005 .
Until recently , the majority of cases of diabetes mellitus among children and adolescents were immune - mediated type 1a diabetes .
Obesity has led to a dramatic increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents over the past 2 decades .
— Dr. Tamara S. Hannon , M.D. and colleagues at the Division of Weight Management and Wellness , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine ( Pediatrics , August 2005 ) .
What we 're seeing is an alarming increase in diabetes among children .
— John M. Auerbach , MBA , Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health ( Boston Globe , 2006 ) .
The 2008 annual F as in Fat : How obesity policies are failing in America report , authored by Trust for America 's Health , and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , says that type 2 diabetes is the new epidemic among American children and now accounts for 8 to 45 percent of new pediatric diabetes cases , depending on geographic location .
In describing the trend , it states :
Although there are a number of genetic risk factors , obesity is largely driving the increase in childhood type 2 diabetes .
The problem is especially severe among children and youth of African , Hispanic , Asian , or American Indian ancestry .
In 2000 , SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth , a 5 - year , $ 22 million research project funded by CDC and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) , was launched to identify the number of children under age 20 with diabetes by type , age , sex , and race or ethnicity …
Initial results from the study show that while type 1 diabetes remains the most common form of diabetes among children and adolescents , type 2 diabetes becomes more common after the age of 10 , with minority children more affected than non - Hispanic white children .
According to Francine Ratner Kaufman , president of the American Diabetes Association , “ there is no doubt that the emergence of this epidemic in children and young adults is a major public health problem . ”
The facts are stunningly different from the assuredness of these claims .
As we look at the prevalence of diabetes among U.S. children and teens since 1988 , when type 2 diabetes began to be tracked , we ’ll also dig up the sources for these statements and the doublespeak behind them .
Population - based evidence
Dr. Joyce M. Lee , M.D. , MPH , with the division of Pediatric Endocrinology , Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , examined the soundest sources for national data on childhood diabetes and obesity and reported them in the latest July issue of Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine .
As she noted , when increased rates of childhood obesity were publicized in the mid-1990s , reports surfaced about corresponding increases in childhood diabetes .
These reports , however , were based on small studies of select , high - risk populations in clinical settings , rather than national data , and could not credibly be extrapolated to population figures to make trend claims .
On the other hand , rates of childhood diabetes in the U.S. have been assessed through larger studies , beginning with NHANES , and drawn from large population samples .
Negating concerns that NHANES may underestimate type 2 diabetes , often said to be higher among racial / ethnic minorities , she reminded readers that NHANES oversamples racial / ethnic minorities .
Between 1988 and 2000 , these population studies found rates of type 2 diabetes among adolescents had remained relatively stable , “ despite the notable increase in obesity prevalence among children ” during that same period .
The results of the five large , population - based studies that followed children and teens through 2004 , remained consistent with NHANES data .
In other words , she concluded that , “ despite significant increases in prevalence rates of childhood obesity in the United States during the past two decades , ” the medical literature shows that rates of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents at the population level have remained steady .
There is no epidemic of childhood diabetes , or any measurable change at all .
What may be most surprising is how rare type 2 diabetes is , and has consistently been , among young people .
The first large population study had been done by CDC researchers at the National Center for Health Statistics and published in a 2001 issue of Diabetes Care .
Led by Dr. Anne Fagot - Dampagna , M.D. , these researchers examined actual fasting blood glucose levels measured as part of NHANES from 1988 - 1994 on a nationally - representative sample of nearly 3,000 adolescents .
They found that 0.29 % of young people had type 1 diabetes and only 0.12 % had type 2 diabetes .
In fact , the prevalence was so low , they could n’t be precise in their estimates .
Professor Glen E. Duncan , MS , Ph.D. , at the Nutritional Sciences Program , Department of Epidemiology at the University of Washington in Seattle , then examined NHANES data from 1999 through 2002 , a general population sampling of nearly 1,500 teens , as well as fasting blood sugars among more than 4,000 self - reported diabetic teens .
As he reported , overall , only 0.35 % of U.S. teens had type 1 diabetes and 0.15 % had type 2 diabetes .
As Dr. Lee noted , although slight differences in type 2 diabetes prevalence in population - wide studies have been reported because of sampling variability and differences in classification methods , they ’ve been consistent with NHANES .
And “ similar rates were reported in a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of adolescents within an urban - suburban school district . ”
This third study was led by Dr. Lawrence M. Dolan , M.D. , a pediatric endocrinologist at Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital Medical Center .
He measured the fasting blood sugars and glucose tolerance tests in a random sampling of around 2,500 black and Caucasian teens in 2003 .
He found similarly low rates of diabetes among the teens as had been reported in NHANES 1988 - 1999 : 0.24 % had type 1 diabetes and 0.12 % had type 2 diabetes .
“ Undiagnosed diabetes mellitus was rare , ” he added .
He also found increased fasting glucoses correlated with puberty and decreased BMI z - scores .
“ Impaired fasting glucose levels , ” using the NHANES ’ definitions , were also similar : 2 % , compared to 1.7 % in NHANES .
The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study was a six - center population study based on what Dr. Lee described as the “ gold standard classification method , ” physician - diagnosed cases of diabetes .
Among a population of 3.5 million children ( 0 - 9 years old ) , and 1.7 million adolescents ( 10 - 19 years old ) , it reported even slightly lower prevalences for diabetes .
Among the young children , rates were miniscule , with 0.15 % diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and 0.02 % with type 2 diabetes .
Among the pre-teens and teens , the prevalence of type 1 diabetes was 0.23 % , with type 2 diabetes only 0.04 % .
As Dr. Lee also noted , the 2003 - 2004 National Health Examination Survey data on 102,353 young people of all ages ( 0 - 17 years ) , the parental reported cases of all types of diabetes together estimated an overall prevalence of 0.32 % .
Here ’s the ' epidemic ' of type 2 diabetes among America ’s youth :
Over the past two decades , the estimated prevalence of type 2 diabetes among U.S. teens has been :
0.12 % — 0.15 % — 0.12 % — 0.04 % .
Estimates among children as a whole ( age 0 - 19 years ) are lower , 0.02 % .
The consistency of the population findings across two decades regardless of the methodology , said Dr. Lee , clearly shows very low rates of type 2 diabetes among young people and a lack of any notable increase , “ despite increases in obesity . ”
The overall burden of type 2 diabetes remains concentrated in older adults , she said .
These findings received little media attention .
When the review was given brief mention , the findings were still spun to make doomsday predictions , largely based on beliefs that obesity is bad , so the adverse effects may be just around the corner .
Examining the facts , however , finds no support for such speculations .
There is no epidemic of diabetes destroying the lives of children .
There ’s not even a hint of an impending epidemic in the population data .
And diabetes most certainly has n’t increased among the population of American children by a factor of ten .
So , where did that oft - repeated claim of a ten - fold increase come from ?
Remember , once upon a time ...
The source of this claim turns out to be a small paper published more than 12 years ago by doctors at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine .
They had examined the medical records of 1,027 patients who had been sent to their regional pediatric diabetes referral center .
Over 12 years , from 1982 to 1994 , a total of 54 children met their clinical criteria for type 2 diabetes .
They said that the number of children who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at their clinic had gone from 4 % prior to 1982 to 16 % in 1994 .
Extrapolating the rate of heightened diagnoses made at their clinic to the entire population of teenagers in the Greater Cincinnati area , they estimated the incidence of adolescent type 2 diabetes had increased ten - fold , from 0.7/100,000 youngsters in 1982 to 7.2/100,000 youngsters in 1994 .
This is another example of the Land of Incognita fallacy of logic .
As professor Michael I. Goran , Ph.D. , at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles , cautioned in a New England Journal of Medicine letter to the editor in response to another study that had estimated population prevalence also using data on sick children referred for medical care , “ it is important to note that the study sample was derived from a clinic population that may not be the most representative sample suitable for deriving [ population ] prevalence estimates . ”
Referrals of children for type 2 diabetes evaluations can reflect selection bias of physicians , as well as clinical guidelines calling for such work - ups for the fat children — it can be a “ seek and ye shall find ” phenomenon .
The Cincinnati doctors had found no change in the average age of their patients at diagnosis .
However , nearly twice as many diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were female and in puberty , which , they said , suggests that the normal insulin resistance characteristic of puberty may contribute to the appearance of type 2 diabetes among teen girls earlier than in young men .
While they reported no change in the racial / ethnic or socioeconomic distribution of the young people referred to their clinic , they did n’t mention if more of the referrals were fat , only that there was no significant increase seen in the average BMIs among those newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , except for a slight increase in black females .
But nearly all ( 85 % ) of those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes had a first - or second - degree relative with type 2 diabetes , they said , illustrating the high genetic risks associated with this condition .
That other study addressed by professor Goran is often cited as evidence of higher rates of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance among young people who fall in the obese category .
It was conducted by researchers at Yale University School of Medicine Pediatric Obesity Clinic , who based their estimates on 55 fat children and 112 fat teens who had been referred to their medical weight loss clinic between 1999 and 2001 .
These young people were especially not representative of the general population , with 40 % of the girls having polycystic ovary syndrome , for example .
Using the American Diabetes Association definition for impaired glucose tolerance as fasting blood sugar levels under 126 mg / dl and 2 - hour glucose tolerance levels of 140 - 200 mg / dl ; and the definition of type 2 diabetes as fasting blood sugars of 126 mg / dl and higher , or 2 - hour glucose levels over 200 mg / dl , they found 25 % of the children and 21 % of the teens had impaired glucose tolerance — more were girls .
But two points suggest extra caution when extrapolating their percentages to all obese young people .
While their entire cohort was ‘ obese ’ , they reported that “ the degree of obesity was not found to be a significant risk factor [ for impaired glucose tolerance ] . ”
As doctors with the National Institute of Health in Bethesda , Maryland , led by Dr. Gabriel I. Uwaifo , M.D. , responded in the New England Journal of Medicine writing , “ we suggest that the unexpectedly high prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance in the group of children who were 4 to 10 years old may be due to referral bias in favor of extremely overweight children ” who may have had medical problems leading to the referrals .
The NIH researchers said that when they had recruited even overweight black and white children from their local community “ whose parents were not seeking treatment for weight problems , ” they found a much lower prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance .
Examining the children in their cohort with similar BMIs to those in the Yale report , they found only 3 of the 48 obese children had “ impaired glucose tolerance . ”
Definitions are everything
How many read the earlier statement that “ type 2 diabetes accounts for 8 - 45 % of new cases , depending on geographic location ” — and incorrectly thought it meant that 8 - 45 % of kids tested have type 2 diabetes ?
You would have over - estimated the incidence by up to 375 - fold !
Instead , it is simply referring to the proportion of type 1 to type 2 diabetes and that ’s flipped around a lot over the years , as definitions change and some studies and institutions place some types of diabetes in the type 1 category and others into type 2 , and some break them down into more precise detail .
We have to remember that just ten or fifteen years ago , no one even realized children got adult - type diabetes and were n’t watching for it .
There is no population - based data on type 2 diabetes in young people available prior to 1988 .
Until recent years , when diabetes was found in children , it was assumed to be type 1 juvenile , insulin - dependent diabetes .
Then , when it became apparent that young people also get non-insulin dependent diabetes , for awhile , a lot of healthcare professionals assumed that fat kids had type 2 and the thin kids had type 1 diabetes .
When that turned out to not be the case , and fat kids were also found with type 1 diabetes and that thin kids can get type 2 diabetes , the category kids were placed in became even more varied .
Even a child with other forms of non-insulin dependent diabetes may be incorrectly lumped into the type 2 diabetes category .
In other words , diabetes is not a single disease and unless you know precisely how the authors defined it , one cannot assume that they used the same definitions .
You can come away with very wrong impressions .
And , to confuse things even more , there ’s the downward migration of blood sugar cut - offs used to define diabetes and glucose intolerance .
Countless young people , as well as adults , for example , wrongly believe they have diabetes , especially if they ’re fat .
They ’ve been told they have “ mild ” diabetes , are “ at risk ” for diabetes , or have “ pre-diabetes ” if their fasting blood sugar levels are in the adult range of normal , 100 mg / dl , often in an attempt to incentivize them to lose weight .
That ’s one problem of relying on studies that use self - reported diabetes , as they can overestimate the prevalence of diabetes in these cases .
At the 68th Annual Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association , this past June , the merit of this newly proposed “ prediabetes ” label was debated , with several researchers concluding there does n’t appear to be natural thresholds for abnormal glucose levels .
Dr. Saul Genuth , M.D. , with Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , and one of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial investigators , noted that only about 25 % of patients with “ prediabetes ” actually progress to diabetes , another 25 % revert to normal blood sugar control , and the majority benignly remain in the “ prediabetic ” state .
In other words , ‘ prediabetes ’ is n’t really predictive of anything .
The risks that have been reported as being associated with diabetes are based on studies using definitions with fasting blood sugars well over 140 mg / dl and there is no evidence that these lower average blood sugars in these normal ranges carry similar risks .
Nor have there been any clinical trials to show that heart disease can be prevented by maintaining low blood sugars .
But plenty of people have been frightened by thinking they ’re at risk , after being labeled as prediabetic by their doctor or insurance company .
But the most tragic and heartbreaking result of the misinformation among the public about diabetes in children is the cruel blame and condemnation , especially towards fat kids with diabetes .
Popular culture generally thinks there ’s only two kinds of diabetes : one that ’s not the patient ’s fault and the other form that is .
Rightly , most people would never think to blame thin children with type 1 diabetes for their condition , as it ’s generally recognized that this form is from an immune disorder resulting in damage to their pancreas and can run in families .
Type 2 diabetes , on the other hand , is perceived as the person ’s fault for eating sugar and junk food , having a sedentary lifestyle and being fat ; when , in fact , type 2 diabetes has considerably stronger genetic roots .
And several other forms of non-insulin dependent diabetes also have even stronger genetic links or can be due to traumas and other syndromes beyond a child ’s control .
Lots of forms of diabetes
It ’s outside the scope of a single blog post to describe all of the different types of diabetes in detail , but just introducing the fact that there are different types and the degree to which they run in families may be of help in countering the blame and pain that misinformation has caused young patients and their parents .
No doubt these classifications will continue to evolve and change , too , but briefly , diabetes mellitus can refer to many different conditions .
Type 1 is when the pancreas does n’t produce enough insulin , often due to immune system damage to the pancreatic beta cells , and these patients always need insulin injections .
It typically presents with weight loss , leading to its common association with thinner kids .
It can also run in families and several genes have been identified associated with this condition .
There is also nonimmune forms , including “ idiopathic type 1 diabetes ” the result of auto - immune destruction to the function of pancreatic cells .
Within the type 2 diabetes category , there can be found type 2 diabetes with insulin resistance , atypical diabetes mellitus , maturity onset diabetes of youth ( MODY ) , genetic defects in insulin action , and secondary diabetes .
With type 2 diabetes with insulin resistance , a symptom can be weight gain .
It is more common among non-European populations , as is atypical diabetes mellitus , which is n’t associated with obesity and where insulin resistance is normal .
Both are found in those with strong family histories for diabetes .
MODY was first described in 1974 and , like type 1 diabetes , is often found in thinner white children .
So , for many years , MODY was misclassified and lumped in with type 1 diabetes , too .
Atypical diabetes mellitus is also sometimes classified as a kind of MODY .
People with MODY do n’t produce enough insulin , however , they do n’t always need insulin .
MODY is the result of genetic defects and is believed to be an autosomal dominant inheritance .
Each type of MODY is caused by a single gene not working correctly , whereas type 2 diabetes is caused by problems with several genes at once , explained Dr. John Porter , at Birmingham Children 's Hospital and Diabetes U.K. Clinical Research Fellow .
There are now six genes which are known to cause MODY when defective , he said .
Among young people with MODY , 85 % have a parent with diabetes , compared to only 11 % of young people with type 1 juvenile diabetes having a parent with diabetes .
Forms of MODY have now been identified among nearly every ethnic group around the world .
There ’s also a list of other genetic defects that affect the insulin action , such as Type A insulin resistance , Leprechaunism , Rabson - Mendenhall syndrome , and the Lipoatrophic syndromes .
Secondary diabetes is another type which can follow certain conditions , such as secondary diabetes as a result of cystic fibrosis or trauma to the pancreas .
A point that never seems to reach consumers is this :
Type 2 diabetes is strongly genetic , considerably moreso than type 1 .
Among identical twins , concordance rates are nearly 100 % for abnormal glucose metabolism and have been estimated as high as 70 - 90 % for type 2 diabetes .
[ To put the heritability of diabetes into perspective , 60 - 80 % of human height is attributed to genetics . ]
Siblings of a type 2 diabetic have been shown to have about a 40 % chance of developing type 2 diabetes , compared to 80 % chance for an identical twin .
The genetic component of type 2 diabetes results in multiple gene variants working together , but numerous different genes have been identified in different families and groups .
Type 2 diabetes is not all the same .
According to Dr. John E. Gerich , M.D. , professor of Medicine , Endocrine - Metabolism Unit at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York , about 5 - 10 % of type 2 diabetics have MODY , another 5 - 10 % have latent adult - onset autoimmune type 2 diabetes , and another 5 - 10 % have type 2 diabetes secondary to rare genetic disorders .
The etiology for the remaining three - quarters is still not known and “ a matter of great controversy ” but incidence patterns indicate that it too is heterogeneous , he said .
It is generally agreed upon , he said , that its inheritance is polygenic , which means several abnormal genes or polymorphisms are necessary at once for the disease to develop ; impaired insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion is also each under genetic control and are both important elements in its pathogenesis ; and obesity itself , popularly linked to the garden - variety type 2 diabetes is also under genetic control .
[ Type 2 diabetes is also a disease of aging , of course .
Forgetting this fact can lead to misperceptions of an epidemic , as many population figures do n’t adjust for age despite the fact our population is aging and elderly make up an increasing percentage of the population .
“ Almost everyone will become diabetic if they live long enough , ” said Dr. Paul Ernsberger , Ph.D. , at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland , Ohio .
“ Fasting blood sugar rises steadily with age , when it crosses the 126 mg / dL line , even just once ( or perhaps twice ) , you are considered diabetic . ” ]
Sadly , most everyone thinks a fat child with diabetes has brought the condition on himself by eating sweets or junk and not exercising .
Even thin people with type 2 diabetes can be stigmatized by beliefs that type 2 diabetes is just a lifestyle disease , rather than primarily genetic , as well as seen in aging .
“ In this day and age , I still get patients who believe that they developed diabetes from eating too much sugar , ” said Dr. Gerald Bernstein , M.D. , of New York City and former director of the Beth Israel Health Care Systems Diabetes Management Program .
“ Bad eating habits such as too much refined sugars , empty carbohydrates and fructose do not cause diabetes . ”
The next time you hear an expert claim — typically to support healthy eating and lifestyle programs to combat childhood obesity — that there ’s an epidemic of diabetes among children , check the facts .
It 's a very good place to start .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , delivered on his threat to lay off thousands of state employees on Thursday when he signed an executive order in an attempt to solve the state 's budget crisis .
The move , dismissed by critics as a gesture to force legislators to reach a compromise on how to resolve the state 's $ 15 bn budget deficit , left more than 10,000 part - time and temporary employees without work yesterday .
The order also reduced the pay of up to 200,000 state employees to the federal minimum wage of $ 6.55 an hour , below California 's minimum .
" I have a responsibility to make sure that our state has enough money to pay its bills , " the Republican governor said as he signed the order at a press conference in the state capital , Sacramento .
" It is a terrible situation to be in .
I do n't think any governor wants to be in this situation ...
But this is really the only way out at this point . "
Critics , including the state controller John Chiang , a Democrat , disagree .
Chiang , the state official who issues pay cheques , has said he will pay employees normally , arguing that Schwarzenegger does not have the legal authority to summarily reduce employees ' pay .
Referring to the employees as " the innocent victims of a political struggle " , Chiang declared : " The state of California , the elected leadership , cannot put the important public servants of California in harm 's way .
We put people first , we make sure we protect their interests , and that 's why I have to tell the governor , with all due respect , I am not going to comply with this order . "
Unions also declared their intention to challenge the order in court .
California , one of the world 's largest economies , regularly fails to agree a budget by the annual July 1 deadline .
Officials from the governor 's office claimed the lay - offs could save the state up to $ 100 m a month , while the pay cuts would save up to $ 1.2bn a month if applied to all 200,000 eligible workers .

When intelligence reorganization was proposed and then passed by Congress after 9/11 there was a great deal of resistance from the heads of the major US national intelligence agencies ; CIA , DIA , NSA , State INR , etc. President Bush was not too keen on the idea either , but , in the end he went along to get along .
The major " reform " was the creation of a leadership for the intelligence community that would be separate from the CIA .
This would be the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) .
In the process of creation of the Director of National Intelligence 's office , most of CIAs functions were taken away for redistribution either to other agencies or to the new DNI .
CIA was left with the function of heading what was subsequently referred to as the National Clandestine Service , in other words , they were left in charge of the field operations involved in recruiting and running foreign human espionage agents .
This was a much smaller role than the CIA had fulfilled in the past .
Formerly , they had controlled the apparatus that doled out the general intelligence funds to the other agencies .
They had also controlled the national estimative function in the production of national estimates , and many other functions as well .
In addition , certain functions that properly had nothing to do with the information functions of intelligence were redirected to the armed forces .
In response to this truncation of agency roles , CIA people fought back with an intensive campaign of mobilization of the agency 's friends in general and the media in particular .
As a result it was predicted or implied in the media that the DNI structure would fail and that in the end CIA would rule once again in the intelligence community .
Yesterday 's announcement of further consolidation of power and authority in the hands of the DNI is evidence that function follows form and that once having been given a theoretical mandate , the DNI 's office has proceeded to gather actual power into its grasp .
In other words CIA has failed to eliminate its rival .
Having failed , the CIA will continue its " descent " into the status of a service organization for the rest of the government rather than the alternative foreign policy establishment that it once thought it was .
Several Republican members of the House of Representatives oversight committee for intelligence walked out of the meeting in which they were briefed about the increase in the DNI 's power .
They and the Democrats on the committee were upset that the change had been made without their agreement or knowledge .
Their outrage is probably the proof of the continuing influence of CIA congressional liaison staffs .
" The king is dead .
Long live the king ! "

Annual report
Dubbed the ‘ year of protest ’ , 2019 saw millions of people take to the streets on every continent .
There was plenty to protest .
Deepening inequality , rising cost of living , autocratic governments , discrimination , and the concentration of wealth and power into fewer and fewer hands .
Many protests were met with brutal repression , but this did not quell the fight for dignity and freedom .
TNI stood alongside and in support of these movements , as we have consistently done for all 46 years of our existence .
We have provided research and logistical support and put forward proposals that can bring about social and ecological transformation .

The Open Season on John McCain and his running - mate - to - be Sarah Palin angers the McCain presidential campaign to a degree , that there is an outright defense battle going on .
The campaign strategist Steve Schmidt is livid .
The press is notching up the heat .
The Washington Post ‘s Howard Kurtz reports :
I ’ve talked to many political professionals over the years who were mad at the media , or me in particular .
But I ’ve never quite had a conversation like the one Tuesday night with Steve Schmidt .
He was absolutely furious as he unloaded on the journalistic community for , in his view , unfairly savaging Sarah Palin .
[…]
Perhaps the greatest concern to the McCain campaign is that the constant inquiries , amplified by cable television debates over whether a mother with a pregnant daughter and four other children can effectively function as vice president , will create a perception that her nomination is in trouble .
“ We are being bombarded by e-mails and phone calls from journalists asking when she will be dropping out of the race , ” Schmidt said .

John McCain has something to worry about .
With the instinct of the newsman , even Rupert Murdoch has struggled hard to get on the right side of Barack Obama .
He could achieve a tentative truce .
The report indicates to me , that Murdoch expects Obama to do well in the elections .
So the Murdoch / Fox bias , while not going away , will be sounding more muted , I expect .
Tomasky the self proclaimed amateur Murdochologist says :
The meeting had been sought for some time .
Now , in reading that sentence , you assumed that I meant Obama sought the meeting .
But it was the other way around !
Now that takes a set , no ?
Read on : Obama , on the other hand , was snubbing Murdoch .
Every time he reached out ( Murdoch executives tried to get the Kennedys to help smooth the way to an introduction ) , nothing .
The Fox stain was on Murdoch .
Eventually , it happened .
Rupert and Barack sat “ knee to knee . ”
Obama started asking Murdoch about his relationship with his father .
In due course Ailes took Rupe ’s place , and Obama basically said to him , I ’m not gonna waste my time talking to you as long as your network is just gonna slap me and my wife around .
Wolff reports that “ a tentative truce was agreed upon . ” ( read more )
Now it looks as if Obama plans to be on the O’Reilly Factor tomorrow , the day of McCain ’s acceptance speech .
Do n’t miss it .

The outgoing commander of US troops in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , has said that he will never declare victory there .
In a BBC interview , Gen Petraeus said that recent security gains were " not irreversible " and that the US still faced a " long struggle " .
When asked if US troops could withdraw from Iraqi cities by the middle of next year , he said that would be " doable " .
In his next job leading the US Central Command , Gen Petraeus will also oversee operations in Afghanistan .
This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill , plant the flag and go home to a victory parade ... it 's not war with a simple slogan
Gen David Petraeus
Profile : Gen Petraeus
He said " the trends in Afghanistan have not gone in the right direction ... and that has to be addressed " .
Afghanistan remained a " hugely important endeavour " , he said .
Earlier this week , President George W Bush announced a cut of 8,000 US troops in Iraq by February - with some 4,500 being sent to Afghanistan .
' Hard but hopeful '
Gen Petraeus took up his role in Iraq in February 2007 , as President Bush announced his " surge " plan .
He has overseen its implementation , including the deployment of nearly 30,000 additional troops to trouble spots in Iraq .
In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme , Gen Petraeus said that when he took charge in Iraq " the violence was horrific and the fabric of society was being torn apart " .
Gen Petraeus said the Iraqis were standing up as US forces stood down Leaving his post , he said there were " many storm clouds on the horizon which could develop into real problems " .
Overall he summed up the situation as " still hard but hopeful " , saying that progress in Iraq was " a bit more durable " but that the situation there remained fragile .
He said he did not know that he would ever use the word " victory " : " This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill , plant the flag and go home to a victory parade ... it 's not war with a simple slogan . "
He said al - Qaeda 's efforts to portray its jihad in Iraq as going well were " disingenuous " .
It was , in fact " going poorly " , he said .
Of his strategy of establishing joint security stations in key locations , Gen Petraeus said that " you ca n't secure the people if you do n't live with them " .
He said it was now fair to say that the Iraqis were standing up as US forces stood down .
The confidence and capability of Iraqi forces had increased substantially , he said .
Gen Petraeus did not confirm reports in the media that the US was preparing to withdraw all troops from Baghdad by next summer , but he did say that consideration was being given to removing US forces from a number of cities , including the capital .

It can be a serious chore to strip a gun down and clean it thoroughly .
For serious shooters , coming back from a long day at the range can mean a lengthy process involving disassembling and carefully cleaning multiple firearms .
Even if you ’ve drilled in field - stripping and cleaning obsessively , it can still take you hours to [… ]
After Lennart posted his summary of Linux sound APIs , the debate heated up again between ALSA and OSS zealots .
Both ALSA and OSS developers think their API is the definitive interface for sound support in Unix and like to bash each other , and tell how the other API sucks and how the others are spreading FUD .
This is not only a sterile debate , but it is completely irrelevant .
Do you know why ?
Because neither of them is a suitable sound API .
Technical constraints , functional requirements and history make the “ ideal ” sound stack on Linux look like the following :
a sound driver , consisting of a kernel module and if necessary a low - level library
if configured so , a sound daemon which brings software mixing and network support – PulseAudio finally kicking out all crappy alternatives
a high - level programming API for use by developers .
Only the last bit should be of interest to application developers .
When you develop a multimedia application or a mixer controller , why would you care of the insanely complex ALSA library or to make ioctls somewhere in / dev when GStreamer and Phonon provide you with high - level functions that can do it in a snap ?
When you want to insert sounds in your game or application , why would you care of those bits when , with SDL_Mixer or libcanberra , a single line of code is enough to decode and play the sound ?
If we want to see sound working properly under Linux , we need to keep the stack simple and to clearly separate the roles .
In the end , this boils down to very simple things :
Application developers must stop using ALSA and OSS .
Both of them are completely unsuitable for the task , and it only serves the purpose of letting ALSA and OSS developers troll .
Whichever application you are writing , there is one of the high - level frameworks – SDL , GStreamer , Phonon , libcanberra , KNotify , JACK – that is better .

Whichever application you are writing , there is one of the high - level frameworks – SDL , GStreamer , Phonon , libcanberra , KNotify , JACK – that is better .
OSS and ALSA should stop trying to be application - level APIs .
Instead of trolling about which API is better , they need to write drivers so that sound fucking works instead of asking users to use Windows to see their brand new computer output some sound .
Instead of trolling about which API is better , they need to write drivers so that instead of asking users to use Windows to see their brand new computer output some sound .
The plumbing layers ( backends for the high - level APIs and PulseAudio ) need excellent support for both ALSA and OSS .
In the end , what matters is to have a driver for your sound card and to have it usable by all applications .
Keeping the driver layer independent from the sound API is the only reliable way to keep things working over time .
If someone else starts writing yet another driver framework , we will be able to make applications use it , instead of adding yet another ton of compatibility stacks .
In the end , compatibility layers that cross layers in the stack must disappear .
ALSA emulation for PulseAudio ?
OSS emulation with a LD_PRELOAD hack ?
Seriously , WTF ?
Applications should not have used them as a sound API , and we need to trash this crap eventually .
Please , guys , hold off a minute .
You are developing drivers and you must be praised for that .
Keep doing that well , and stop trying to invade applications .
There are people who may not know how to develop a driver , but who obviously know better what a sound API should look like .
Keith Olbermann takes on John McCain and his campaign managers with another powerful Special Comment on Monday 's Countdown .
McCain has consistently voted against our troops , but he and his campaign continue to spread lies and distortions about Barack Obama , painting him as unpatriotic and anti-military , while glossing over his own betrayal of our military on the floor of the Senate .

Now as promised a Special Comment on the remarks of the Senior Senator from Arizona about Senator Obama at the VFW Convention , and about NBC News and MSNBC .
Four times in just two days , Senator McCain 's campaign managers have , simply , hung him out to dry .
First , trying to scapegoat the media , in the exact way that has spelled doom for other presidential candidates already watching from the sidelines .
Second , doing so with a petulant statement so full of holes that it virtually ** confirms * * that which was reported , and which set off this pointless temper tantrum in the first place .
Third , sending the candidate out to speak before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention , even as the millstones of a series of disastrous , anti-veteran votes , still figuratively dangled from around his neck .
And fourth , encouraging Senator McCain , while there , to address his opponent in the language of unseemly contempt , undignified calumny , and holier - than - thou persiflage unsupported by reality ... near - nonsensical bluster that -- at best -- makes the speaker look like a dyspeptic grouchy neighbor shouting " Hey you kids , get out of my yard .

Transcript below the fold .
" Though victory in Iraq is finally in sight , " you told the V- F - W today , Senator McCain , " a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president .
The hard - won gains of our troops hang in the balance .
The lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the Middle East could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines .
And this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent , Senator Obama . "
The shifting positions of Senator ** Obama * *?
Senator McCain -- on the 22nd of May , 2003 .. you said , of Iraq , **on** the Senate floor , quote :
" We won a massive victory in a few weeks , and we did so with very limited loss of American and allied lives .
We were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life , and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of Afghani and Iraqi citizens .
Senator -- you declared victory in Iraq , ** five years and nearly three months ago **.
** Today * * you say : " victory in Iraq is finally in sight " ?
The victory you already proclaimed five years ago ?
Are we going back in ** time **
Sir ?
If that had not been enough , in ** June * * of 2003 , with even ** Fox News * * noting " many argue the conflict ( in Iraq ) is n't over , " you answered :
" Well , then why was there a banner that said ' Mission Accomplished ' on the aircraft carrier ?
Look , the -- I have said a long time that reconstruction of Iraq would be a long , long , difficult process , but the conflict -- the major conflict is over , the regime change has been accomplished , and it's very appropriate . "
In 2003 , your war was won , because somebody was putting up a ... banner .
In 2008 , your war might finally ** be** won , because ** you ** are putting up ... a campaign based on the mirage that Iraq ** is ** winnable .
And yet it is ** Obama * * shifting positions on Iraq ?
Even if this country were to forget , Senator , the victory lap you and President Bush took five years ago -- just on their face , your remarks today at the V - F - W , Senator , are nonsensical .
" Senator Obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight , he would oppose the surge .
Even in retrospect , he would choose the path of retreat and failure for America over the path of success and victory . "
This construction , Senator , is extremely simple .
If your surge worked , the troops would be home from Iraq .
Or ** most ** of them , would be .
Or all of them who ** were ** surged , would be .
Or at least we'd have the same number of troops in Iraq now , as we did then .
Or ... maybe one or two guys would be out of harm 's way .
Please , Senator McCain , stop !
This is ** embarrassing **.
Whether on his own impetus or an advisor's ...
The Senator also foolishly invoked his ** opponent ** in that speech today .
Previous political ** careers ** have foundered on the rocks of the V- F - W Convention :
The Republican majority in Congress and the Senate -- the very viability of Secretary of Defense ** Rumsfeld ** -- began to unravel at this convention two years ago -- that was the venue for the first of Rumsfeld 's two references to Bush critics as Nazi Appeasers .
Prudence and judgement , demanded that Senator McCain tred lightly .
Instead he told the convention , quote :
" I suppose from my opponent 's vantage point , veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage .
This would explain why he has also taken liberties with my position on the GI Bill ....
As a political proposition , it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what I considered flawed legislation .
But the people of Arizona , and of all America , expect more from their representatives than that , and instead I sought a better bill .
I 'm proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military , better serves military families , and better serves the interests of our country . "
Senator McCain spoke out ** against * * that very bill last May -- on the asinine premise that the rewards to our heroes were so good that it did n't encourage them to stay in the service .
Or perhaps ** force * * them .
More over , Senator McCain missed 10 of the 14 Senate votes on Iraq up to the middle of last year .
This year , he has missed them ** all ** -- including one to honor the sacrifice of the fallen .
He has voted to table or oppose :
20 million dollars for veteran 's health care facilities .
322 million dollars for safety equipment for our troops in Iraq .
430 million dollars for veterans outpatient care .
One billion dollars in new equipment for the National Guard .
And , in separate votes : One billion , 500 million dollars in additional Veterans ' medical care , to be created by closing tax loopholes .
And one billion , **800 ** million dollars in additional Veterans ' medical care , to be created by closing tax loopholes .
And yet , Sir , you have the audacity to stand in front of the very Veterans you repeatedly and consistently ** sell out ** , and claim it is your ** opponent * * who has put politics first , and country second .
" Behind all of these claims and positions by Senator Obama lies the ambition to be president , " you said -- with a straight face -- today .
" What 's less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief .
And in matters of national security , good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president -- as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of Georgia . "
Senator , three points :
One -- is your increasingly extremist and reactionary language towards Senator Obama ** really * * the method by which you want to try to achieve the Presidency -- or perhaps split the country if you succeed ?
Two -- criticizing a man for having quote " the ambition to be president " ?
Seriously ?
You ** do** realize you are ** currently ** running for president , as well , right ?
That either you also have " ambition to be president " or , what ? , somebody 's ** blackmailing * * you into it ?
And three -- you might want to ask somebody -- somebody other than say , your Foreign Policy Advisor , Randy Scheunemann -- whether or not you are making a jackass out of yourself every time you bring up the conflict between Georgia and Russia .
The Georgians have paid Mr. Scheunemann and his companies 800 - thousand dollars over the last several years to ** lobby ** for them .
It 's pretty clear the Georgians have ** bought ** Mr. Scheunemann .
And , Senator McCain , it sure as hell looks like the Georgians thought they had bought ** you **.
When you had the tastelessness to paraphrase the rallying cry of 9/11 and say that we are now all Georgians , that nation 's President ** called you out **...
He said that your words were very nice , but he needed action -- not a verbal receipt from a lobbyist and his pet Senator !
Going back to the beginning of this sad 48 hours of paranoia from the McCain Campaign ...
We have manager Rick Davis 's unfortunate letter to NBC News , about Andrea Mitchell 's reporting on the possibility that Senator McCain violated the so - called " Cone of Silence " for the Rick Warren Presidential Forum over the weekend .
The coverage of this detail , and that forum in general , is , to start with , overwrought .
But Mr. Davis has elevated them to the ridiculous .
As Nate Silver at the website ' Five - Thirty - Eight - dot - com ' noted , Andrea 's reporting -- reporting of what the Obama camp claimed -- included two essential observations :
" McCain may not have been in the cone of silence " ... and that he
" May have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to Obama " .
Rick Davis writes to NBC : " The fact is that during Senator Obama 's segment at Saddleback last night , Senator McCain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed . "
As Silver astutely notes , for roughly the first half of Obama 's participation , his own campaign manager places McCain in a ** car * * -- where he could have been made aware of the questions to Senator Obama .
" In a motor vehicle , " Silver writes , " one may use the radio , a cellphone , a Blackberry , Bluetooth Wireless , a Slingbox , and perhaps a satellite TV feed .
Whether McCain actually used any of those devices , we have no idea .
But he absolutely had the ability to use them , which is all that Mitchell had reported . "
Silver also tripped over Mr. Davis 's strange observation that for roughly the second half of Obama 's participation , his own campaign places McCain , quote , " in a green room with no broadcast feed . "
Not a green room without cell service or internet , nor without a closed - circuit feed , nor , for that matter , without a guy running back from the audience with notes , written in crayon .
Rick Davis 's argument is , in short , illegitimate .
It is an attempt to pick a fight with the media , over the journalistic equivalent of chewing gum in class .
" This is irresponsible journalism and sadly , indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at NBC News this election cycle , " he writes .
" We are concerned that your News Division is following MSNBC 's lead in abandoning non-partisan coverage of the Presidential race .
We would like to request a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss our deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity at NBC . "
What Davis is ** really * * saying here , of course , is that he wants ** no** level of objectivity , that the only campaign he wants questioned is Obama , and that " partisan coverage " consists of questioning whether McCain or his campaign support the stage whispers branding Obama as somehow ' foreign , ' or whether McCain is to be inoculated from all criticism by dint of his military service .
Senator McCain -- did you pay ** any ** attention to the ** Democratic ** primaries ?
Did you notice the hair - pulling frenzy of some of Senator Clinton 's supporters who could not face the possibility that her loss might have been ** her * * fault -- or ** theirs ** -- and thus it must be ** ours **?
Do you remember the apoplexy of a washed up Republican operative named Ed Gillespie , writing a furious letter to NBC on behalf of President Bush ?
Mr. Bush 's support has since dropped .
And ** Senator Clinton 's** supporters have now relocated to such a degree that her " eighteen million voices " first re-counted themselves as " two million " and were then unable to get even 250 people to show up at a meeting .
The public sees through this nonsense , Senator -- they see through it quickly .
NBC and MSNBC do not have the power to seriously impact an election .
If we ** did ** --
Senator Pat Buchanan would already be serving ** with ** you .
Besides which , Senator , who in your camp thought it was a good idea to take a shot at NBC and MSNBC ... ** during the Olympics **on** NBC and MSNBC ?!?
** During ** the Olympics , Senator McCain , on which you have already run millions of dollars ' worth of McCain Campaign ** commercials **... on NBC and MSNBC !?!
Senator , let me wrap this up .
You -- and your campaign -- need a serious and immediate attitude adjustment .
Despite what you may think , Senator McCain , this is not a coronation .
Despite how you have acted , Senator McCain , you have no automatic excuse to politicize anything you want .
Despite how you have whined , Senator McCain , you have no entitlement to only sycophantic , deceptive , ** air - brushed ** coverage in the media .
And despite how you have strutted , Senator McCain , you have no God - given right to the Presidency .
Let 's have an adult campaign here , in other words -- and I am embarrassed to have to say this to a man who turns 72 at the end of this month -- Senator , grow up !
Good night , and good luck .
Some of the dead soldiers had been based in Kabul 's Warehouse camp Ten French soldiers have been killed in an ambush by Taleban fighters east of the Afghan capital , Kabul .
A further 21 French troops were wounded in one of the heaviest tolls suffered by the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has announced he will travel to Kabul to assure troops of his support .
The deaths come amid warnings that insurgents are closing in on the capital city .
The loss of life is thought to be the heaviest suffered by the French military since 58 paratroopers were killed in Beirut in 1983 .
The BBC's Emma -Jane Kirby , in Paris , says news of the deaths is bound to provoke anger in France , where about two - thirds of people say they are opposed to any French involvement in the conflict .
But President Sarkozy insisted France remained committed to the fight against terrorism , and that the mission in Afghanistan would continue .
See a breakdown of the Isaf deployment The French troops were caught up in fighting that started on Monday in the area of Sarobi some 50 km ( 30 miles ) east of Kabul .
French defence officials said about 100 soldiers - from France , the US and Afghanistan - were on a reconnaissance mission when bad road conditions forced them to stop their vehicles .
A group of French soldiers was sent ahead on foot to check the terrain , but they were ambushed by Taleban fighters and nine were killed .
A tenth French soldier was killed when his vehicle overturned on the road .
An Afghan intelligence officer told the BBC the troops had been ambushed from several directions .
" The Taleban and al - Qaeda forces used heavy machine guns and other weapons .
They fired from mountains and gardens , " he said .
The fighting went on for 24 hours and it is understood that reinforcements had to be called in to airlift the troops to safety .
The French recently took over control of the Kabul regional command which includes Sarobi .
Wave of attacks France has about 3,000 troops deployed in Afghanistan .
The French news agency AFP reported that Tuesday 's deaths brought to 24 the number killed since 2002 .
Leaders from countries including the UK and Italy - both of which have sizeable troop deployments in Afghanistan - paid tribute to the French soldiers .
DEADLY ATTACKS 19 August 2008 : 10 French troops killed and 21 wounded in ambush east of Kabul 13 July 2008 : Nine US soldiers killed and 15 wounded in attack on base in Kunar 28 June 2005 : Rocket - propelled grenade downs US helicopter in Kunar , killing all 16 servicemen aboard
Taleban grow more brazen " Theirs was a sacrifice not just for France but for all of us who want to help the Afghan people build a better future , " said UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said the soldiers had died " defending democracy and freedom in Afghanistan " .
The ambush came amid signs of deteriorating security in Afghanistan .
Despite increased security in Kabul , two rockets were fired on the city overnight , landing close to the Isaf headquarters .
In the southern province of Kandahar a Nato patrol was struck by a roadside bomb .
And in the south - eastern province of Khost six suicide bombers were killed while attacking a Nato military base , Camp Salerno , Nato says .
Isaf confirmed that Camp Salerno had been attacked by rockets or mortars , and that a number of suicide bombers had tried to storm the base .
On Monday , nine Afghan civilians were killed when a suicide bomber rammed a car into the gate of the same base .

First Magnus was covered here several months back when it refused , or stated it simply could n’t , send paychecks it owed to employees .
At that time , the lender was also filing for bankruptcy .
This was then :
“ First Magnus Financial Corp . still is not sending out paychecks to its former employees .
But the Tucson - based mortgage lender announced it is creating an assistance fund of more than $ 1 million to ease the burden . ”
“ In a news release , the company said paychecks have been delayed because its accounts were frozen by investors that provided capital to First Magnus to make loans .
The company was forced to shut down operations last week because it could no longer sell the loans it originates on the secondary market . ”
“ Earlier , the company told employees to expect their checks by mail rather than direct deposit .
Under both state and federal law , checks were due to employees on Monday . ”
Seems things have caught up with them .
Just released today , this is how things are looking for them now :
Defunct mortgage lender First Magnus Financial Corp. broke a federal law by providing incentive payments to mortgage brokers , according to a report .
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ’s report issued July 14 said Tucson - based First Magnus violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act by providing volume - based incentives for Federal Housing Administration - insured loans .
HUD found that First Magnus paid $ 58,571 in incentives from Jan. 1 , 2003 to Dec. 31 , 2005 to seven brokers for the origination of 169 FHA - insured mortgages totaling more than $ 24 million .
First Magnus collapsed and filed for bankruptcy during the credit crunch last August .
It is currently being liquidated .
Company executives have founded a new company , Stonewater Mortgage Corp. , that is operating out of First Magnus ’ old headquarters in Tucson .
No doubt , it likely came as a surprise to those who have been involved with the lender …
Cheney 's link to corrupt senator Stevens exposed RAW STORY
Published : Saturday August 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Vice President Dick Cheney has been linked to Alaska Senator Ted Stevens , who the Justice Department has accused of seven counts of falsely reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars , Newsweek reported .
In a conversation secretly recorded by the FBI on June 25 , 2006 , Stevens " discussed ways to get a pipeline bill through the Alaska Legislature with Bill Allen , an oil - services executive accused of providing the senator with about $ 250,000 in undisclosed financial benefits . "
Stevens told Allen : " I 'm gonna try to see if I can get some bigwigs from back here and say , ' Look you gotta get this done ' . "
Only two days later , Cheney took the unusual step of writing a letter to the Alaska legislature which pushed the members to " promptly enact " a bill that would approve the pipeline .
Stevens revealed that he asked the vice president to send such a letter .
The Justice Department 's corruption case against Stevens is trying to prove that he used his political influence to help Allen 's business in the oil and gas industry in return for large payments for renovations to his home .
But the prosecutors have not mentioned Cheney 's letter and the department spokesperson did not respond to Newsweek 's requests about it was not included or if Cheney would appear at Stevens ' trial .
Stevens is the longest - serving Republican in the Senate and a figure in Alaskan politics before statehood .

The eurozone economy is on the verge of its first - ever recession after the economies of Germany , France and Italy all shrank in the second quarter of this year .
The overall 0.2 per cent fall in activity over the three months to June in the 15 - nation single currency area was worse than the markets had anticipated , and helped to give the pound a rare boost against the euro .
Sterling also stabilised , albeit at a 22 - month low , against the dollar , following a week of dramatic falls .
The EU revised July 's rate of inflation for the eurozone down slightly , from 4.1 to 4 per cent .
The unexpectedly poor news on European growth came a day after the Bank of England hinted at the strong possibility of a recession in the UK over the next year , and added to a global round of bad news .
However , the fall in European GDP was still smaller than that revealed yesterday in the world 's second biggest economy , Japan , which shrank 0.6 per cent in April to June .
The US recorded growth of 0.5 per cent , partly driven by tax cuts .
The upshot was that sterling bounced a little against the euro , which fell 0.4 per cent to 79.52 p , and , with little movement against the dollar after the dramatic falls earlier in the week , sterling edged off an 11 - year low set the previous session , on a trade - weighted average basis .

But most focus yesterday was on the deteriorating prospects for eurozone countries .
Although less bad than a previous leak had suggested , the figure for Europe 's largest economy , Germany , was nonetheless disappointing , with a 0.5 per cent quarterly contraction in her economy , following a surge of 1.3 per cent in the first three months of this year .
The gathering strength of the euro , and the slowdown in demand for German - made capital goods in emerging markets such as China , accounted for much of the sharp decline .
Germany has for some time been highly dependent on its successful export sector to maintain its growth rate , and has benefited , compared to the Anglo - Saxon economies , from relying more on engineering and less on financial services and the appreciation of house prices to sustain itself .
However , the global slowdown has begun to hit Europe hard .
The deputy economy minister , Walther Otremba , said he could not rule out that the German economy would shrink further in the third quarter .
Most of Europe is in decline .
France also reported a reduction in its national income , with GDP down by 0.3 per cent on the previous quarter .
Spain , suffering especially severely from a property crash , grew by just 0.1 per cent , hardly sufficient to make an impact on an unemployment rate of over 10 per cent , the worst of Europe 's major economies .
The Dutch economy recorded zero growth .
Taken together with a previously reported decline of 0.3 per cent in Italian economic activity , Eurostat says the overall eurozone GDP contraction was 0.2 per cent on the quarter .
Nor are prospects for the third quarter much better .
As in the UK , forward indicators of economic growth , such as business confidence and forward orders , point to a recession over the next three months .
Matters have not been helped by a hike in the eurozone interest rate last month , though most observers now think the next moves by the European central bank will be in the opposite direction – hence the currency 's comparative weakness against sterling yesterday .
Longer term , though , analysts were more optimistic about the eurozone than the UK or the US , because of its more broadly based economy .
Jennifer McKeown , European economist at Capital Economics said : " As the economy does not suffer from the serious imbalances apparent elsewhere , we still expect the region to outperform the UK and the US over the medium term . "
MIAMI , June 26 ( UPI ) -- A Washington woman said she filed a federal lawsuit accusing a Miami hospital of " anti-gay animus " after workers refused to let her see her dying partner .
Janice Langbehn and her partner Lisa Marie Pond , both aged 39 , intended to enjoy a vacation cruise with three of their four children , marking the women's 18 years as a couple in February 2007 , the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported Thursday .

The trip abruptly ended when Pond had a massive stroke as the ship was preparing to leave port , the newspaper said .
She was taken to Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital , where Langbehn said workers would not let her see her ailing partner .
A social worker allegedly said the couple was in an " anti- gay city and state . "
Pond died about 18 hours after she arrived at Jackson 's Ryder Trauma Center .
Langbehn said she was permitted to see Pond for no more than about five minutes .
The suit , lodged in U.S. District Court in Miami , seeks at least $ 75,000 and accuses physicians Alois Zauner and Carlos Alberto Cruz and social worker Garnett Frederick of negligence and " intentional infliction of emotional distress . "

Seven years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the US government is finally getting around to installing radiation scanning devices at major airports .
The 9/11 Commission cited this as a major vulnerability four years ago , when their report was released , but we ’re just now getting ready to test the equipment at Dulles airport .
By the end of the year , four additional airports will be graced with Radiation Portal Monitors , [.pdf file ] and , according to news reports , the Department of Homeland Security has plans to " eventually " install them at 30 major US airports .
As the op editor of the New York Post said about the US government investigation of the anthrax attacks :
This is good enough for government work .
But is it good enough to keep us from being blown sky - high by a couple of suitcase nukes ?
I read an editorial today in my local newspaper , the San Francisco Examiner  which , you ’ll be surprised to learn , is a right - wing rag of the neoconnish sort  in which the editors averred :
" If the war and reconstruction of Iraq were really a dangerous diversion from the war on terrorism , as so many liberal politicians and commentators say , then why have Americans been so safe in our homeland .
Why have n’t any dirty nukes exploded ? "
Famous last words .
The smugness of this contention begs to be punctured , as it will be if our government continues to pursue a course of criminal neglect of our borders and reckless aggression abroad .
Al - Qaeda operatives have a long range time horizon : last time , it took them a period of several years  starting in 1995  to carefully plan , organize , and implement their devilish scheme .
That nothing ’s exploded  yet  is not something I would gloat about .
But , then again , neocons love to gloat and preen , in person and in print : brazen hubris underpins their personalities as well as their ideology .
The horror of it is that they ’ll still be gloating when the Big One goes off  if there are any survivors .
The naivete of our war - hawks , who believe that the " central " arena of the war on terrorism is in Iraq , is almost touching  in the way that the last flight of the Dodo bird , or the grave of the last Neanderthal , is touching .
What ’s interesting is that the smug assurance of the San Francisco Examiner editorial board is endemic among neocon types : they are , ironically , complacent about the threat of terrorism emanating from the Islamic world .
After all , have n’t we " won " in Iraq ?
Are n’t we invincible ?
Has n’t our policy of regime - change in the Middle East brought the battle home to the enemy , and snared them in their lairs ?
It would be pathetic , and tragic , if we " won " in Iraq , and lost , say , New York , Washington , or some other major city : our great " victory " will turn out to have been purely Pyrrhic .
To the War Party , however , it ’s worth the risk , and , make no mistake about it , the risk factor is high .
Seven years after the worst terrorist attack in our history , and we still have n’t sealed our borders , and set up the security wall our safety requires .
To paraphrase an old saw , what gaineth a man if he wins the whole world , and loses his own country ?
The whole point of government , or so we ’re told , is to protect us from foreign aggressors , and yet the attitude of our protectors , in this vital matter , has bordered on indifference .
They ’re just now getting around to scanning air cargo , but what about the cargo that comes in by ship , pouring into our ports unexamined and from all points on the globe ?
The invasion and occupation of Iraq will wind up costing us three trillion dollars , according to Nobel - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes , whose notable book makes clear that theirs is a conservative estimate .
Imagine if we had taken that money and used it to actually defend the United States of America , instead of traipsing off to " liberate " the downtrodden peoples of Mesopotamia .
We would already have a system in place to monitor all air and sea cargo coming into this country , and we ’d have a reasonable chance to avoid another 9/11 - style terrorist spectacular .
As it is , the chances of another attack grow by the day .
The very fact that inspires smugness in the editors of the San Francisco Examiner fills me with a growing dread .
No , we have n’t had a terrorist attack on our soil in seven very long years  and that ’s what scares me .
Because you can be sure that al - Qaeda  that amorphous yet all the more deadly network of terrorist cells inspired by Osama bin Laden and his associates  has been planning and seeking to carry out such an attack : they state this all the time .
According to their strategists and theoreticians , their chief antagonist is the " far enemy " ( i.e. the US ) , rather than the established governments in the region , which they see as American sock puppets , including even Iran : their laser - like focus on the US as their chief target defines their strategic outlook .
Al Jazeera released a video of bin Laden in November of 2004 in which he boasted of the success of his strategy of " bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy . "
In a bit of economic analysis that must , today , be seen as prescient , he jeered that every dollar spent by al - Qaeda in its terrorist campaign has cost the Americans a million .
As Lehman Brothers follows Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Bear Stearns into the abyss , one can almost hear bin Laden ’s evil laughter echoing from the depths of his cave .
On this strangely subdued anniversary , with none of the dramatics that have accompanied earlier commemorations of 9/11 , we are no closer to defeating  or even finding  bin Laden than we were on that fateful day .
As to why this is so , Michael Scheuer put it well in the opening paragraph of his book , Imperial Hubris :
“ As I complete this book , U.S. , British , and other coalition forces are trying to govern apparently ungovernable postwar states in Afghanistan and Iraq , while simultaneously fighting growing Islamist insurgencies in each  a state of affairs our leaders call victory .
In conducting these activities , and the conventional military campaigns preceding them , U.S. forces and policies are completing the radicalization of the Islamic world , something Osama bin Laden has been trying to do with substantial but incomplete success since the early 1990s .
As a result , I think it fair to conclude that the United States of America remains bin Laden ’s only indispensable ally . ”
The San Francisco Examiner and its ideological brethren complain about the " liberals " who claim the war in Iraq was a diversion , but it was far worse than that .
The neocon agenda has n’t merely diverted us away from the task of fighting bin Laden and what he represents  our Bizarro World foreign policy has actively aided his cause , providing al - Qaeda not only with plenty of recruits , but also with a training ground to turn them into hardened fighters .
No one denies we are at war with bin Laden and that the worldwide Islamic insurgency he inspires represents a deadly threat  no one , that is , but the War Party .
Oh , they talk big , and they are full of even bigger plans to supposedly bring the fight to the enemy  but , somehow , the enemy is never really al - Qaeda .
It ’s always someone who is , somehow , connected to al - Qaeda : Saddam Hussein , for one , or so they told us , and now the Iranians , who are said to be " harboring " top al - Qaeda leaders , including one of bin Laden ’s sons .
At this rate , we ’ll soon be confronted with irrefutable " evidence " that bin Laden is hiding behind the walls of the Kremlin  as good an excuse as any to underscore Putin ’s perfidy .
Seven years after 9/11 , that signal event continues to haunt us , and distort the national discourse .
As only the heroic Keith Olbermann pointed out , with appropriate outrage , the Republicans used footage of the horror  which news organizations have effectively embargoed out of respect for the dead and the still grieving  to exploit on the occasion of their convention .
As the audience was treated to the sight of those two planes plowing into the twin towers , the demagogic war - crazed rhetoric of Rudy Giuliani  this election season ’s biggest loser  rang out over the hall .
Without bin Laden , the War Party would have nothing : we ’d still be in the post - cold war era , when many conservatives were saying , along with Patrick J. Buchanan , " America , come home , " and it was the liberals who were rediscovering the joys of interventionism , in the Balkans and elsewhere .
Without the War Party , bin Laden would be a marginal figure , with no following and little hope of attracting any .
The two forces coexist in a dynamic symbiosis , each reinforcing and feeding the other  allies in all but the formal sense .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I‘ll be appearing and disappearing in this space , all week , due to my move .
Again , my apologies : I ’m not happy about it , but it seems unavoidable .
I ’ll be back , however , on a regular basis , by the middle of next week .
Until then , keep a watch on this space , because I ’m bound to make a few appearances in between .
The administration of President George W. Bush continues to expand government secrecy across a broad array of agencies and actions  and at greatly increased cost to taxpayers , according to a coalition of groups that promote greater transparency .
Dr. Patrice McDermott , director of Open the Government , a watchdog group , told IPS , " The federal government under the Bush administration has shown its commitment to secrecy by where it has put its money  more no - bid contracts , fewer government employees processing FOIA [ Freedom of Information Act ] requests , less on training on classification issues , and almost 200 dollars spent on keeping secrets to every dollar allocated to open them . "
" Given our growing deficit , the next administration faces difficult choices in restoring accountable government , " he added .
In its " Secrecy Report Card 2008 , " released Sept. 9 , the group concluded that the Bush administration " exercised unprecedented levels not only of restriction of access to information about federal government ’s policies and decisions , but also of suppression of discussion of those policies and their underpinnings and sources . "
Open the Government is a Washington - based coalition of consumer and good government groups , librarians , environmentalists , labor , journalists , and others .
It says that that classification activity remains significantly higher than before 2001 .
In 2006 , the number of original classification decisions increased to 233,639 , after dropping for the two previous years .
The government spent $ 195 maintaining the secrets already on the books for every one dollar it spent declassifying documents in 2007 , a 5 percent increase in one year .
At the same time , fewer pages were declassified than in 2006 .
The nation ’s 16 intelligence agencies , which account for a large segment of the declassification numbers , are excluded from the total reported figures .
Classified or " black " programs accounted for about $ 31.9 billion , or 18 percent of the fiscal year ( FY ) 2008 Department of Defense ( DOD ) acquisition funding requested last year .
Classified acquisition funding has more than doubled in real terms since FY 1995 .
Almost 22 million requests were received under FOIA in 2007 , an increase of almost 2 percent over the previous year .
But a 2008 study revealed that , in 2007 , FOIA spending at 25 key agencies fell by $ 7 million , to $ 233.8 million , and the agencies put 209 fewer people to work processing FOIA requests .
While the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court does not reveal much about its activities , the Department of Justice reported that , in 2007 , the court approved 2,371 orders  rejecting only three and approving two left over from the previous year .
Since 2000 , federal surveillance activity under the jurisdiction of the court has risen for the ninth year in a row  more than doubling during the Bush administration .
The court was established under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978 after revelations of the widespread wiretapping by the administration of Richard M. Nixon to spy on political and activist groups .
Recently , efforts to reform the act have been triggered by the Bush administration ’s admission that it had conducted secret surveillance programs in the U.S. without warrants from the court .
In addition , more than 25 percent ( worth $ 114.2 billion ) of all contracts awarded by the federal government last year were not subject to open competition  a proportion that has remained largely unchanged for the last eight years .
Investigations by Congress and independent government agencies of the war in Iraq have revealed billions of dollars in no -bid contracts , covering everything from delivering food and water to U.S. troops to providing armed security for U.S. officials and visiting dignitaries .
There have been widespread allegations of waste , fraud , and abuse by contractors .
Several have been convicted and prosecutions of others are pending .
During 2007 , government - wide , 64 percent of meetings of the Federal Advisory Committee were closed to the public .
Excluding groups advising three agencies that historically have accounted for the majority of closed meetings , 15 percent of the remainder were closed  a 24 percent increase over the number closed in 2006 .
These numbers do not reflect closed meetings of subcommittees and task forces .
The Federal Advisory Committee
Act was passed in 1972 to ensure that advice by the various advisory committees formed over the years is objective and accessible to the public .
The report also found that in seven years , President Bush has issued at least 156 " signing statements , " challenging over 1,000 provisions of laws passed by Congress .
In 2007 , eight were issued .
The so - called " state secrets privilege "  invoked only six times between 1953 and 1976  has been used by the Bush administration a reported 45 times , an average of 6.4 times per year in seven years .
This is more than double the average ( 2.46 ) in the previous 24 years .
The " state secrets privilege " is a legal doctrine that contends that admission of certain information into court proceedings would endanger U.S. national security .
The Bush administration has frequently invoked the privilege to dismiss lawsuits that would be embarrassing to the government , and the courts have generally been deferential to the government ’s claims .
National Security Letter ( NSL ) requests continued to rise ; the 2007 numbers are still classified , but the recently unclassified new number for 2006 shows a 4.7 percent increase in requests over 2005 .
Since enactment of the USA PATRIOT
Act in 2001 , the number of NSLs issued has seen an astronomical increase .
The NSL provision of the PATRIOT Act radically expanded the authority of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) to demand personal customer records from Internet service providers , financial institutions , and credit companies without prior court approval .
Through NSLs , the FBI is authorized to compile dossiers about innocent people and obtain sensitive information such as the Web sites a person visits and a list of e-mail addresses with which a person has corresponded , or even to unmask the identity of a person who has posted anonymous speech on a political Web site .
The provision also allows the FBI to forbid or " gag " anyone who receives an NSL from telling anyone about the record demand .

In a study published in the , medical researchers warn that anti-vaccination activists are using YouTube to get their message across and say that pro-vaccination forces need to respond in kind with an ensuing media campaign .
Researchers Kumanan Wilson and Jennifer Keelan of the University of Toronto did a search on YouTube for the terms " vaccination " or " immunization " in February 2007 and analyzed the videos based on how they presented vaccinations .
In all , 73 portrayed immunization positively , 49 negatively and 31 were classified as " ambiguous . "
Forty - five percent contained messages contradicting Canadian or U.S. vaccination recommendations .
The study and subsequent press release concluded that medical professionals need to respond to this use of YouTube .
" Health care professionals need to be aware that individuals critical of immunization are using YouTube to communicate their viewpoints and that patients may be obtaining information from these videos , " Wilson said .
" The findings also indicate that public health officials should consider how to effectively communicate their viewpoints through Internet video portals .
" Also troubling to the researchers was the finding that videos critical of vaccinations were viewed more often and ranked higher by YouTube users than pro-vaccination videos .
" Other people ... just from the view counts and the ratings , are coming on and wanting to find out more about these viewpoints , " Wilson said .
Among the videos posted were recordings of parents saying their children 's autism had been caused by specific vaccines or by the vaccine ingredient thimerosal , which contains mercury . " [ You Tube is ] the perfect venue for an anecdote , both positive or negative , " Keelan said .
Wilson said that vaccine advocates can no longer ignore or marginalize anti-vaccine advocates .
"
In the past that could work , but it 's not going to work anymore .
Now there are ways for people with these viewpoints to communicate with each other , " he said .
" These sites are now providing people with a mechanism by which they can bypass the conventional filters and get their messages out .
It can be dangerous . " " In other words , " said consumer health advocate Mike Adams , " the conventional medical industry views free speech communication as a dangerous thing .
They do n't want people to exercise their free speech rights about vaccines :
They want all words , information and even thoughts to be approved by a central controlling authority that denies any link between vaccines and autism . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Plunging auto sales , high gas prices and election year politics could help convince Congress to approve a $ 50 billion loan package to embattled U.S. automakers that Detroit 's Big Three claim is key to their future success .
On Wednesday , General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler LLC reported monthly sales declines of at least 20 % from a year ago , as American car buyers continued to turn away from SUVs and pickups and towards more fuel efficient car models .
The Big Three are now in the process of closing truck assembly lines and rushing to catch up with hybrid and other fuel efficient offerings from Toyota Motor ( TM ) and Honda Motor ( HMC ) .
But with GM and Ford saddled with junk bond debt ratings and privately - held Chrysler with the thinnest capital cushion of the three , Detroit is caught in a credit squeeze that will make such investment difficult if not impossible .
" Funding such a shift is a tough lift even under optimum circumstances , " said GM spokesman Greg Martin .
" The credit markets are suffering .
You had this seismic inversion of the market where no one wants to buy a full - size truck . "
Thus , the automakers have deployed what one industry official describes as a " surge " of lobbyists and executives at both the Democratic and Republican Party 's political conventions .
The Big Three 's hope is that if they can win speedy passage of the loan package , they can move more quickly to retool their plants to produce more smaller cars .
The $ 50 billion loan package , first proposed by the auto industry last month , has won the support of presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain as their campaigns eye key votes in Michigan and Ohio .
On Tuesday , White House Press Secretary Dana Perino signaled the outgoing Bush administration was open to approving the loans .
" It 's something we 're aware of and we 're talking to the members of Congress and also the people in the industry , and thinking about what they might think would be required from their perspective , " she said .
But as much support as the idea has , the automakers say they can't let up until the loan package is not only signed into law but also funded by Congress .
Last year 's energy bill included up to $ 25 billion in loans to the Big Three , but lacked the necessary funding to actually make the money available .
That earlier legislation would allow automakers and suppliers to borrow the money at Treasury bill rates for up to 25 years as a way to fund the conversion of plants and the development of new technology .
Because of their poor financial status , the automakers would be forced to borrow money at rates well above 10 % in the open market .
The automakers have argued this is not a bailout and point out that the estimated cost of complying with new , tougher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles is just over $ 100 billion .
" Borrowing capital at a lower cost than the double - digit rates we 're looking at will allow us to accelerate the technology , and transform the business quicker , " said Ford spokesman Mike Moran .
Will a bailout work ?
Industry experts say that while the savings from the lower interest rates would amount to billions of dollars for the automakers , the program may not necessarily save a member of the Big Three from eventual bankruptcy in the way that federal loan guarantees rescued Chrysler in the 1970's .
" I 'm not sure it 's either essential for their survival or a guarantee of their turnaround , " said Bob Schnorbus , chief economist with J.D. Power & Associates .
" They 're going to need a lot of liquidity over the next two years .
Even $ 50 billion , with a lot of strings attached , is n't going to make or break them . "
But David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research , said the loan package could be enough to keep some plants open that would otherwise be closed .
Cole added that the package is important to help keep GM , Ford and Chrysler competitive against their Asian rivals .
So far this year , the Big Three have captured only 47 % of U.S. auto sales , down from 51 % in the same period last year .
" More than anything else , [ the loan program ] would ensure the viability of the companies over the longer - term , " said Cole .
" Right now they have to invest an enormous amount of cash in new technology at a time when their cash is low . "
Under language of the bill , the loans would also be available to overseas automakers that have plants here , but industry officials say it 's unlikely any would make use of the money .
That 's because foreign - based auto companies have strong enough balance sheets to finance the investment in new technology without the U.S. government 's help .
Toyota spokeswoman Martha Voss said the company is neutral on the loan proposal at this time but that it will continue to monitor the discussions in Congress .
Cole argues the loan package could be a relatively cheap alternative to the economic harm that would take place if one of the automakers were to fall into bankruptcy .
The estimated cost of the program is less than $ 8 billion , which factors in the risk of default on the loans .
" It 's like with the Bear Stearns bailout , " he said , referring to the investment bank that was sold to JPMorgan Chase with the help of the Federal Reserve earlier this year .
" With so many jobs depending on each assembly line job , a failure could trigger a much more serious problem . "
Cole and the automakers also think winning the support for the loans will be easier now that Congress has moved to help mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) as well as home owners who borrowed more than they could afford on their mortgages .
" This is a technology partnership , it 's not a blank check like for Fannie and Freddie , " said Linda Becker , a spokeswoman for Chrysler .
" This is a critical time to improve the country 's fuel economy . "
But while Cole thinks there 's a 75 % chance the automakers will win what they 're seeking , the automakers themselves say they have a relatively small window to get what they need .
Congress is likely to be in session for about a month before the pre-election recess and winning approval in a new Congress could be difficult .
And even if a loan package is approved by Congress next year , the automakers say they need to get access to the cash sooner than later as auto sales continue to slide .
So the Big Three is likely to put more pressure on Obama and McCain as well as members of Congress in the next few weeks .

Russia is continuing to build its relationships in Latin America , according to our latest dispatch from Chris Kraul .
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela 's government has announced that his nation will carry out joint naval exercises with four Russian vessels in the Caribbean this year -- a move that will do nothing to improve strained relations between the oil - rich Latin American nation and the United States .
Writes Kraul :
Venezuela 's naval intelligence chief , Adm . Salbatore Cammarata Bastidas , said in a statement that a task force including four Russian naval vessels and 1,000 Russian military personnel would take part in mid-November exercises with Venezuelan frigates , patrol boats , submarines and aircraft .
The announcement came shortly after Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin warned that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 's deployment of several warships to the Black Sea in the aftermath of Russia 's invasion of Georgia last month would not go unanswered .
It was not immediately clear whether the two events were linked .
The Russian agreement to send ships also could be seen as part of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 's campaign to build up his military , an effort that includes arms deals , a proposed hemispheric South American Defense Council and a recent decree that gives his armed forces a greater role in carrying out his social agenda .
Last week , we reported that Russia was also showing a renewed interest in its formed Cold War ally Cuba -- read that dispatch here on La Plaza .

On July 18 , 2008 The New York Times published an article by Israeli - Jewish historian , Professor Benny Morris , advocating an Israeli nuclear - genocidal attack on Iran with the likelihood of killing 70 million Iranians  12 times the number of Jewish victims in the Nazi holocaust :
 Irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program .
Barring this , the best they could hope for is that Israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities .
To be sure , this would mean thousands of Iranian casualties and international humiliation .
But the alternative is an Iran turned into a nuclear wasteland . 
Morris is a frequent lecturer and consultant to the Israeli political and military establishment and has unique access to Israeli strategic military planners .
Morris advocacy and public support of the massive , brutal expulsion of all Palestinians is on public record .
Yet his genocidal views have not precluded his receiving numerous academic awards .
His writings and views are published in Israels leading newspapers and journals .
Morris views are not the idle ranting of a marginal psychopath , as witnessed by the recent publication of his latest op - ed article in the New York Times .
What does the publication by the New York Times of an article , which calls for the nuclear incineration of 70 million Iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the Middle East , Asia and Europe , tell us about US politics and culture ?
For it is the NYT , which informs the educated classes  in the US , its Sunday supplements , literary and editorial pages and which serves as the moral conscience of important sectors of the cultural , economic and political elite .
The New York Times provides a certain respectability to mass murder , which Morris views otherwise would not possess if say , they were published in the neo-conservative weeklies or monthlies .
The fact that the NYT considers the prospect of an Israeli mass extermination of millions of Iranians part of the policy debate in the Middle East reveals the degree to which Zionofascism has infected the higher cultural and journalist circles of the United States .
Truth to say , this is the logical outgrowth of the Times public endorsement of Israels economic blockade to starve 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza ; the Times cover -up of Israeli - Zionist - AIPAC influence in launching the US invasion of Iraq leading to over one million murdered Iraqi citizens .
The Times sets the tone for the entire New York cultural scene , which privileges Israeli interests , to the point of assimilating into the US political discourse not only its routine violations of international law , but its threats , indeed promises , to scorch vast areas of the earth in pursuit of its regional supremacy .
The willingness of the NYT to publish an Israeli genocide - ethnocide advocate tells us about the strength of the ties between a purportedly liberal establishment pro-Israel publication and the totalitarian Israeli right :
It is as if to say that for the liberal pro-Israel establishment , the nonJewish Nazis are off limits , but the views and policies of Judeo - fascists need careful consideration and possible implementation .
Morris New York Times nuclear - extermination  article did not provoke any opposition from the 52 Presidents of the Major American Jewish Organizations ( PMAJO ) because , in its daily information bulletin , Daily Alert , it has frequently published articles by Israeli and US Zionists advocating an Israeli and / or US nuclear attack on Iran .
In other words , Morris totalitarian views are part of the cultural matrix deeply embedded in the Zionist organizational networks and its extensive reach in US cultural and political circles .
What the Times did in publishing Morris lunacy has taken genocidal discourse out of the limited circulation of Zionist influentials and into the mainstream of millions of American readers .
Apart from a handful of writers ( Gentile and Jewish ) publishing in marginal web sites , there was no political or moral condemnation from the entire literary , political and journalistic world of this affront to our humanity .
No attempt was made to link Morris totalitarian genocidal policies to Israels public official threats and preparations for nuclear war .
There is no anti-nuclear campaign led by our most influential public intellectuals to repudiate the state ( Israel ) and its public intellectuals who prepare a nuclear war with the potential to exterminate more than ten times the number of Jews slaughtered by the Nazis .
A nuclear incineration of the nation of Iran is the Israeli counterpart of Hitlers gas chambers and ovens writ large .
Extermination is the last stage of Zionism : Informed by the doctrine of rule the Middle East or ruin the air and land of the world .
That is the explicit message of Benny Morris ( and his official Israeli sponsors ) , who like Hitler , issues ultimatums to the Iranians , surrender or be destroyed  and who threatens the US , join us in bombing Iran or face a world ecological and economic catastrophe .
That Morris is utterly , starkly and clinically insane is beyond question .
That the New York Times in publishing his genocidal ravings provides new signs of how power and wealth has contributed to the degeneration of Jewish intellectual and cultural life in the US .
To comprehend the dimensions of this decay we need only compare the brilliant tragic - romantic German - Jewish writer , Walter Benjamin , desperately fleeing the advance of totalitarian Nazi terror to the Israeli - Jewish writer , Benny Morris criminal advocacy of Zionist nuclear terror published in the New York Times .
The question of Zionist power in America is not merely a question of a lobby  influencing Congressional and White House decisions concerning foreign aid to Israel .
What is at stake today are the related questions of the advocacy of a nuclear war in which 70 million Iranians face extermination and the complicity of the US mass media in providing a platform , nay a certain political respectability for mass murder and global contamination .
Unlike the Nazi past , we cannot claim , as the good Germans did , that we did not know  or we werent notified , because it was written by an eminent Israeli academic and was published in the New York Times .
Professor Petras latest book : Zionism , Militarism And the Decline of U.S Power ( Clarity Press , Atlanta )
( CNN ) --
Tens of billions in taxpayer dollars have been lost , wasted or remain unaccounted for in Afghanistan and Iraq , and some of those funds -- and some missing weapons -- have landed in insurgents ' hands , a U.S. senator alleged Wednesday .
Sen . Robert Byrd says lost taxpayer dollars have found their way into insurgents ' coffers .
Sen . Robert Byrd , D - West Virginia , leveled the accusations before the Appropriations Committee he chairs .
He is calling for arrests and speedy trials for any contractors accused of bilking the U.S. and Iraqi governments .
In a statement released before Wednesday 's hearing , Byrd said the military 's inability to oversee its myriad contracts adequately has indirectly killed soldiers .
He did not elaborate except to say , " As a result of this lack of oversight , billions of dollars have been lost or wasted , bad contractors have been rewarded , and shoddy workmanship -- some of which has resulted in the deaths of our soldiers -- has gone uncorrected . "
Critics have " rightfully " blamed the Bush administration for the misconduct , Byrd said , but culpability extends beyond the executive branch .
" Army commanders , as well as those in the other services , also deserve serious criticism for failing to grasp the strategic situation in Iraq and for not properly planning to implement the massive logistical requirements associated with sustained combat and post - combat operations , " Byrd said in his opening statement .
Too few auditors and managers have been assigned to oversee contracts , and too few investigators are charged with prosecuting allegations of fraud , waste and corruption and with retrieving " these stolen billions , " Byrd said .
" It is evident that our oversight resources have been strained past the breaking point , " he said .
" Army contracting dollars and actions have increased more than 350 percent over the last 11 years , while the contracting work force has decreased by more than 50 percent . "
Gen. Benjamin Griffin , head of the U.S. Army Materiel Command , told the committee that the military is aware of the shortcomings in its audits .
The Army Contracting Command has recently filled leadership posts and is seeking to create more in hopes of addressing the problems .
Contractors are vital in an all - volunteer military force , and most contractors operate honestly because they want to continue doing business with the U.S. , added Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England .
When there is evidence that contractors have " willfully done something wrong , " they are prosecuted , England said , but information indicating intentional wrongdoing is sometimes hard to obtain .
" I will say sometimes it 's harder in a war zone , " England said .
Byrd said the neglect has emboldened those who have designs on embezzlement , bribery , providing shoddy goods and services or " just plain stealing . "
The senator from West Virginia said he would like to see more " collars and dollars " -- more arrests , indictments and recovery of lost or wasted funds .
Sen . Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , said he and Sen. Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , have introduced a bill to extend the statute of limitations for crimes involving waste , fraud or abuse of taxpayer dollars .
Leahy asked England and the Defense Department 's acting inspector general , Gordon Heddell if , given their present limitations , such legislation would provide the additional time needed to pursue such cases .
England and Hedell said it would .

If you ’ve ever set a leaf aflame with a magnifying glass , you ’ll understand the basics of the photovoltaic cells that may finally make renewable energy affordable enough for everyone .
" The world runs on cheap energy , " said Paul Sidio of Sunrgi .
" We want to be the Wal - Mart of solar power . "
Sunrgi says it developed a way to make solar energy as cheap as coal using panels that focus the sun onto photovoltaic cells equipped with innovative cooling systems .
The company claims its magnifying glasses intensify the sun ’s rays 2000 times onto photovoltaic cells , which increases the heat to 3300 degrees Fahrenheit .
While such heat will fry silicon in no time , the company says its electronics actually stay just about six degrees above ambient temperature thanks to special heat convection and generous spacing of the electronics .
Topping off the design , the units track the sun ’s trajectory to maximize energy collection throughout the day .
" We generate six or seven times greater power than flat panel , non-tracking solar panels , " Sidio said .
Sunrgi is showing off a prototype of the cell at the Wired NextFest pavilion in Chicago ’s Millennium Park , where the free future tech expo is open to the public through October 12 .
In keeping with their desire to make solar energy as cheap as possible , the company designed its electronics so that they can be built like a computer ’s motherboard – meaning its innards can be built on any PC assembly line in the world .
That leads to a projected cost of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt - hour over a twenty - year period in the American southwest .
That ’s cheaper than power created by almost all traditional energy sources .
Solar energy has always been long on hope but short on economic competitiveness .
But if Sunrgi can make good on those promises and prices once its production design is finished and UL approval is won , pulling electricity out of the sun ’s rays could become more than a well - meaning indulgence .
For those of you excited about covering your roof with Sunrgi ’s technology , you may have to wait a while .
The company says it plans to first sell to utilities and large companies .

Knight Rider :
Are you excited for more episodes of Knight Rider ?
Actually , I do n't think " episodes " is a kickin enough word — we should call them " crashisodes " or something .
In any case , the not - yet - canceled smart car show put out another big batch of script pages from the upcoming episode called " Do n't Stop The Knight . "
W00t !
This is the episode we mentioned , where Mike breaks a guy named Gunner Haas out of prison and hands him over to the " Pussycat Dolls of international assassins . "
Gunner is n't thrilled , because these are women he screwed ( metaphorically ) in a business deal .
The reason Mike has to spring Gunner from prison is because someone has kidnapped a foxy young ambassador named Olara Kumali .
She 's foxy , and she 'll get hurt unless Mike does the kidnapper 's bidding .
There 's a whole conversation about how Olara has brought peace to central Africa ... but they only care because she 's hot .
After he springs
Gunner , he has to steal a super - expensive X - ray machine for the kidnapper , getting himself tasered in the process .
The kidnapper gets Olara in an enclosed space and cuts off her air , leaving her only two hours to live .
It turns out the kidnapper is Stevens , a Pentagon weapons designer who was fired after he was suspected of selling secrets to the Russians .
It turns out Mike is collecting the elements for a SUPERBOMB that will destroy a whole city .
Mike uses KITT 's self - driving , talking superpowers to trick Stevens into thinking he 's inside the car , while Mike sneaks around and rescues the ambassador .
But then they get caught .
Stevens assembles his superbomb and puts it in KITT 's trunk .
He rigs it so that if KITT slows below 100 miles per hour , the bomb explodes , destroying everything in a 30 mile radius .
Meanwhile , Hank , a plug - in robot that Charles Graiman created years ago , is mad at him because Graiman is n't acknowledging his earliest creations .

Because it 's okay if you are , " says Graiman .

Austin Cassidy says on Conservative Pulse :
Ron Paul will appear on the ballot in Louisiana as a Presidential candidate this November , despite never expressing an interest in doing so .
It seems that there are a few states where a candidate can be placed on the ballot for President or Vice - President entirely by the actions of supporters .
Meaning , a person can be drafted onto the ballot — and if he or she does n’t object and request to have their name removed — they will appear without ever declaring a formal candidacy .
As such , supporters have created something called the Taxpayer ’s Party in Louisiana with the purpose of placing Ron Paul and former Congressman Barry Goldwater , Jr. on the ballot for President and Vice - President .
It sounds like Paul is entirely indifferent to the efforts and wo n’t request that his name be removed , while Goldwater ( son of the 1964 Republican nominee ) is actually interested in doing a little bit of campaigning .
Ron Paul is also on the ballot in Montana , as we report below .
Montana has 3 electoral votes , Louisiana 9 .
Could Paul tip those two states to Obama by taking away McCain votes ?
Here ’s Austin Cassidy ’s opinion :
While Louisiana is considered safe territory for McCain , Montana has become a surprising swing state where Barack Obama is spending a large amount of resources … .
Most hurt by this has to be Libertarian Bob Barr , who has n’t gotten much traction yet and will likely lose many votes to Paul in these two states .
And it ’s possible that Paul ’s name may wander onto the ballot in a couple of additional states as his legions of supporters refuse to give up the fight .
KDDI Corp will launch a fiber - optic communications service with upload and download speeds each of up to one gigabit per second on Oct 1 .
The new service will target people living in single - family homes and low - rise apartment buildings .
The traffic speeds will be the fastest in eastern Japan , up drastically from the current 100 megabits per second .
With the service , KDDI aims to catch up with Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp , which has a share of over 70 % in the market for fiber - optic broadband services for single - family houses .
KDDI will charge 5,985 yen in basic monthly fees for Internet and telephone services , down 1,155 yen from the current price , if a user subscribes for two consecutive years .
KDDI will start offering its fiber - optic services , which are now available only in six prefectures in the Kanto region and nearby Yamanashi Prefecture , in four cities in the northern prefecture of Hokkaido .

Note :
This post is in reference to the recent A List Apart article in which Dave Shea expands upon the classic CSS Sprites technique by using jQuery .
His technique allows for animations between the link states while still being fully degradable for visitors that do not run javascript .
Link to the original CSS Sprites2 Article .
In this post I am going to revisit the markup , css and javascript in the CSS Sprites2 article to address some of the concerns I had when viewing it .
I will also clean up the function and turn it into a handy jQuery plugin that allows for more control over the animation while requiring less initial configuration .
To start things off , here is the end product of this technique using either Dave 's method or the method described in this post .
To set the stage for my plugin writeup , it is important that I first describe how this technique works and the ways I would like to change it .
Below is a quick overview of the original technique along with some minor changes I made to the markup and css .
If you would like to jump straight to the plugin writeup , click here .
How CSS Sprites Works
CSS sprites were written up in A List Apart back in March of 2004 .
The premise behind sprites is that instead of slicing up an image into each of its states , we are able to use the background - position declaration in css to just reposition one giant image .
Background image containing all states .
There are a couple of benefits to using this technique .
First , there is no reason to worry about image preloading , since all of the states are loaded at the same time .
When you mouseover a button for the first time , there will be no flicker or pause before the hover state is shown .
Second , and perhaps more importantly , only one image is downloaded by the browser instead of as many as 4 for each button .
Had we sliced the above image and implemented the menu without sprites , there could have been as many as 16 images used .
Each of those images would have needed a separate request to the server and hurt the performance of your site .
This is such a big issue that the Yahoo developers site considers minimizing http requests the # 1 thing you can do to your content to improve page load times .
( Performance Factors , YSlow Firefox add - on )
What Changes with CSS Sprites2
CSS Sprites2 keeps all of the advantages of the original technique , and then adds animation .
Rather than relying directly on CSS styles to immediately show the different states , instead it uses javascript to animate between the different states .
Should a user not have javascript , the technique degrades gracefully .
The javascript adds animation to the technique by placing an invisible over the original link , setting its background - position to show the appropriate state , and transitioning it in and out on the appropriate mouse events .
Now that the technique has been covered , I am going to go over the quick changes I made to the original article and then walk through the creation of the plugin .
Change to the markup
A quick concern I had with the implementation was how an active list item was indicated .
Rather than giving the item itself a class , the parent unordered list is given an additional class .
Original Markup
If this seems hacky , it 's because it is .
Essentially it avoids an IE6 issue with multiple classes on a single element .
There is not a good way around this problem while maintaining semantically clean markup .
My solution was to avoid the issue by using ids instead of classes to identify the individual nav items .
This has obvious drawbacks , but the IE6 Deathmarch has begun and I consider this my small contribution to the movement .
New Markup
Change to the CSS
Since I made a change to the markup , I also needed to make a change to the css .
Below is the CSS for a single nav item using the original technique :
.nav .home a:link , .nav .home a :visited { left : 23 px ; width : 76 px ; } .nav .home a :hover , .nav .home a : focus { background : url ( blue - nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 49 px ; } .nav .home a :active { background : url ( blue - nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 98 px ; } .current - home .home a:link , .current - home .home a:visited { background : url ( blue - nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 147 px ; cursor : default ; } .nav - home , .nav - home - click { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; left : 23 px ; width : 76 px ; height : 48 px ; background : url ( blue - nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 49 px ; } .nav - home - click { background : url ( blue - nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 98 px ; }
Looking over this css , the purpose of most of it is obvious .
It covers the LVHA states and treats the : focus state the same as the : hover state .
Since the information about which state is selected is in the parent
It pollutes the namespace with another function .
All of the parameters are required , though they do n't need to be .
Passing in a selector for this purpose does n't seem very " jQuery "
The options for animation are unnecessarily limited allowClick - Allows click events to be disabled by setting this to false .
show - A hash of animation options to be used when the hover is enabled .
hide -
A hash of animation options to be used when the hover is disabled .
activeClass -
The class the plugin should use to determine which nav items are active and therefore should n't have mouse events attached .
clickClass -
The class that should be added to the placeholder div when a nav item is clicked .
By pulling declarations upwards where possible and switching to ids , the following is the CSS for the same nav item with the new markup :
. spritesnav # snhome a:link , .spritesnav # snhome a:visited , .spritesnav # snhome div{ left : 23 px ; width : 76 px ; } .spritesnav # snhome a :hover , .spritesnav # snhome a : focus , .spritesnav # snhome div{ background : url ( blue - nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 49 px ; } .spritesnav # snhome a:active , .spritesnav # snhome div.click { background : url ( blue - nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 98 px ; } .spritesnav #snhome.active a:link , .spritesnav #snhome.active a :visited { background : url ( blue - nav.gif ) no-repeat - 23 px - 147 px ; cursor : default ; }
Changes to the Javascript
The javascript code in the original article is well written and clean , but I believe it takes the wrong approach .
Rather than use jQuery 's defined plugin architecture , it is just a simple function call with a number of parameters :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { generateSprites ( " .spritesnav " , " current - " , true , 150 , " slide " ) ; } ) ;
While this solution gets the job done , it has a couple of problems :
The obvious solution to these problems is to take the code that Dave wrote and turn it into a proper jQuery plugin .
Once we are done with this , we will be able create the same sprites enabled menu using the following code :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
$ ( '.spritesnav' ).sprites ( ) ; }
By following jQuery 's plugin authoring guidelines , I am making all of the parameters optional by supplying sensible defaults .
When implementing a plugin , this is done by using the jQuery. extend ( ) function .
Additionally , I am following their animation guidelines which allows for any type of animation to be used that jQuery or its extensions support .
Below is the plugin declaration and the jQuery. extend ( ) call I use to set up defaults for all of my parameters :
jQuery.fn.sprites = function ( settings ) { settings = jQuery.extend ( { allowClick : true , show : {opacity : ' show'} , hide : {opacity : ' hide'} , activeClass : ' active ' , clickClass : ' click ' } , settings ) ;
The optional parameters above do the following :
With this set up I am ready to execute the logic of the plugin .
I followed Dave 's work pretty closely .
The only place I parted was that I used chaining and traversal where I could rather than initiating a new selection .
This probably makes the plugin ( negligibly ) faster while also making it a little bit easier to follow .
I also kept everything in one function , eliminating a few more selections .
Below is the rest of the code for my plugin with my comments stripped .
j Query ( this ) .children ().each ( function ( ) { if (! jQuery ( this ).hasClass ( settings.active ) ) { j Query ( this ) .children ('a ' ) .css ( {background : " none " } ) ; jQuery ( this ) .hover ( function ( ) { j Query ( '' ) .prependTo ( this ).animate( settings.show ) ; } , function ( ) { j Query ( this ) .children ( 'div').animate( settings.hide , function ( ) { j Query ( this ) .children ( 'div ' ) .remove( ) ; } ) ; } ) ; if ( settings.allowClick ) { j Query ( this ) .children ('a' ).mousedown(function ( ) { j Query ( this ) .prev( ).addClass ( ' click ' ) ; }).mouseup( function ( ) { j Query ( this ) .prev( ).removeClass (' click ' ) ; } ) ; } } } ) ;
As you can see it is extremely compact and nearly everything has become an option .
If you know just a little bit of jQuery , you might be wondering why the famous ' $ ' is n't being used in the code above .
When writing a plugin , it is important to be mindful of potential collisions with other libraries .
For that reason it is recommended that you use ' j Query ' instead .
If you really want to use the ' $ ' or other alias in your plugin , you can wrap your plugin in an anonymous function :
( function ( $ ) { // plugin code here , use $ as much as you like } ) ( jQuery ) ;
If you like this plugin and want to add it to your site , below is an example you check out and a zip file containing all of the files for this project .
is an easy way to freeze processor intensive applications to add more processing power to the applications you need .
If you want blacklist or application priority changing , you have to donate a minimum of $ 1.99 USD .
We got a funny email recently .
It was an " Open Letter To All Airline Customers " signed by 12 airline executives , including the CEOs of Delta ( DAL ) , American ( AMR ) , Continental ( CAL ) , US Airways ( LCC ) , and United ( UAUA ) .
We figured it was an apology to customers and shareholders for screwing up again .
Boy were we wrong :
...normal [ oil ] market forces are being dangerously amplified by poorly regulated market speculation .
... A barrel of oil may trade 20 - plus times before it is delivered and used ; the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab .
Some market experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as $ 30 to $ 60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs ....
The nation needs to pull together to reform the oil markets and solve this growing problem .
We need your help .
Get more information and contact Congress by visiting www.StopOilSpeculationNow.com.
If anyone out there is still holding onto those pieces of paper that used to represent airlines stocks , you might want to consider selling them .

Summary
In 2007 a select handful of the wealthiest countries began a treaty - making process to create a new global standard for intellectual property rights enforcement , which was called , in a piece of brilliant marketing , the " Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement " ( the agreement does not cover currency fraud ) .
ACTA is spearheaded by the United States along with the European Commission , Japan , and Switzerland — which have large intellectual property industries .
Other countries invited to participate in ACTA ’s negotiation process are Canada , Australia , Korea , Mexico and New Zealand .
Noticeably absent from ACTA ’s negotiations are leaders from developing countries who hold national policy priorities that differ from the international intellectual property industry .
A “ Discussion Paper on a Possible Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ” was reportedly provided to select lobbyists in the intellectual property industry , but not to public interest organizations concerned with the subject matter of the proposed treaty . [ 1 ]
Wikileaks has obtained the document .
The agreement covers the copying of information or ideas in a wide variety of contexts .
For example page three , paragraph one is a " Pirate Bay killer " clause designed to criminalize the non-profit facilitation of unauthorized information exchange on the internet .
This clause would also negatively affect transparency and primary source journalism sites such as Wikileaks .
The document reveals a proposal for a multi-lateral trade agreement of strict enforcement of intellectual property rights related to Internet activity and trade in information - based goods hiding behind the issue of false trademarks .
If adopted , a treaty of this form would impose a strong , top - down enforcement regime , with new cooperation requirements upon internet service providers , including perfunctionary disclosure of customer information .
The proposal also bans " anti-circumvention " measures which may affect online anonymity systems and would likely outlaw multi-region CD / DVD players .
The proposal also specifies a plan to encourage developing nations to accept the legal regime .
Trade representatives were hoping to formalize the agreement at the G - 8 summit in July 2008 .
The following summary of the trade agreement issue is from IP Justice , an international group based in San Francisco that campaigns for a just world intellectual property regime :
After the multi-lateral treaty ’s scope and priorities are negotiated by the few countries invited to participate in the early discussions , ACTA ’s text will be “ locked ” and other countries who are later “ invited ” to sign - on to the pact will not be able to re-negotiate its terms .
It is claimed that signing - on to the trade agreement will be " voluntary " , but few countries will have the muscle to refuse an “ invitation ” to join , once the rules have been set by the select few conducting the negotiations .
The US is negotiating ACTA through the Office of the US Trade Representative ( USTR ) , an office within the Bush Administration that has concluded more than 10 “ free trade ” agreements in recent years , all of which require both the US and the other country to increase intellectual property rights enforcement measures beyond the international legal norms in the WTO - TRIPS Agreement . [ 2 ]
Talking points from the European Commission , the Office of the United States Trade Representative , the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade , and others have published selected passages ostensibly from the document in response ; refer to [ 3 ] for useful links .
The ACTA push was launched on October 23 , 2007 by US Ambassador Susan C. Schwab and five U.S. members of Congress from the " Congressional Caucus on Intellectual Property and Piracy Prevention " .
A copy of her opening remarks follow :
Remarks by U.S. Trade Representative Susan C. Schwab Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) October 23 , 2007 •
Thank you all for being here .
Today we are announcing a major new initiative in the international fight against IPR counterfeiting and piracy .
•
I want to begin by thanking our host today , the Congressional Caucus on Intellectual Property and Piracy Prevention , and its co-chairs - Representatives Bono , Feeney , Wexler , and Adam Smith of Washington . •
Thank you also to the Members present , who have done so much to advance the cause of IP protection , including : - Rep. Mary Bono ( R - CA ) - Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R - VA ) - Rep. Howard Berman ( D - CA ) - Rep. Adam Schiff ( D - CA ) - Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) • I also want to acknowledge and thank the Ambassadors and representatives of our trading partners who have joined us today . [...] •
We are pleased to be working in this broader effort with a number of key trading partners , large and small , including Canada , the European Union , Japan , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , and Switzerland .
We hope and believe that others will join over time , marking an emerging consensus on stronger IP enforcement .
All who share our ambition and commitment to stronger IPR enforcement are welcome . [...] •
With that goal in mind , the U.S. Government is eager to move ahead as fast as possible with the negotiation of this important new agreement .
•
Thank you .
Who is really behind ACTA ?
Follow the money :
Rep. Howard Berman ( D - CA ) [ 4 ]
Top four campaign contributions for 2006 :
Time Warner $ 21,000 News Corp $ 15,000 Sony Corp of America $ 14,000 Walt Disney Co $ 13,550
Top two Industries : TV / Movies / Music $ 181,050 Lawyers / Law Firms $ 114,200
Other politicians listed also show significant contributions from IP industries .

IndyMac Bancorp , the third - largest banking failure in United States history , said Friday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection , less than three weeks after being seized by federal regulators following a bank run by depositors .
The company , based in Pasadena , Calif. , filed for Chapter 7 protection on Thursday with the federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles , indicating it plans to liquidate .
IndyMac said it expected the court will appoint a bankruptcy trustee promptly .
The filing was widely expected .
It does not include IndyMac Federal Bank , which is now run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and is the successor to IndyMac ’s former banking unit .
Most deposits in IndyMac Federal are insured up to $ 100,000 .
IndyMac Bancorp , the holding company , has $ 50 million to $ 100 million of assets , $ 100 million to $ 500 million of liabilities , and fewer than 50 creditors , according to the bankruptcy filing .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
By comparing the genomes of humans and five other mammals , Cornell researchers have identified 544 genes that have been shaped by positive selection over millions of years of evolution .
" To our knowledge this is the largest and most comprehensive analysis of positive selection to date , " write the researchers in the Aug. 1 issue of the journal PLoS Genetics , reporting on research mainly funded by the National Science Foundation .
Natural selection ( favorable traits becoming more common over successive generations ) that tends to favor new forms of genes is known as positive selection .
Previously , the Cornell group compared the genomes of humans , chimpanzees and the Rhesus macaque .
By extending the analysis to mice , rats and dogs , the researchers were able to find " stronger signals " of change by going back up to 80 million years on the evolutionary tree .
Other studies have found signatures of positive selection using population genetics methods -- comparing genomes across many members of the same species -- but those focus on changes over just the last tens of thousands of years .
The researchers -- including Adam Siepel , Cornell assistant professor , and Carlos Bustamante , Cornell associate professor , both of biological statistics and computational biology ; and Cornell postdoctoral researchers Carolin Kosiol and Tomas Vinar -- used a high - performance computer cluster at the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing to study 16,500 human genes that are also found , with some differences , in at least two of the other five species .
Over time , random changes can occur in the genetic code that replace one of the amino acids in a protein with another .
Sometimes these changes have no effect on the function of the protein .
But if the change alters the function of the protein and the change is beneficial -- if , for example , it protects against a disease that is common in a certain time and place -- individuals with the new version of the gene will be more likely to survive than others , and the new version will gradually replace the old one in an evolving population .
Siepel 's group used the unimportant changes as a sort of clock to show how much change would be expected over evolutionary time .
If a gene showed significantly more change than expected by random chance it was predicted to be under positive selection .
Many of the positively selected genes found in rodents involved immunity and defense , including defense against bacteria and viruses , suggesting an evolutionary " arms race " with pathogens .
Responses to wounding and inflammation were also common .
The largest group of positively selected genes in primates involved sensory inputs -- including perceptions of taste , color and pain .
" The conventional wisdom is that we should see major changes in the brain - related genes , " Siepel noted .
" We did n't find a signal for that , but did find inputs to the central nervous system . "
Perhaps , the researchers speculated , changes in sensory input drove changes in the brain .
The study supports the idea that positive selection is important in evolution , Siepel said .
Theorists have argued over the relative importance of positive selection versus " neutral drift , " where random changes simply happen with no positive or negative result .
He noted that positive selection was found mainly in genes that are not expressed in as many tissues as others .
" Genes with more specialized purposes may have more freedom for adaptation , " he explained .
The researchers also found evidence that many changes seem to have occurred in spurts over short periods of time .
For example , they found genes that were not under selection in lower mammals , then came under selection in primates , then were lost in humans .
Whether evolution has been continuous or episodic has also been a subject of much debate among biologists .

INVESTIGATORS have begun two large studies of stretching , asking about its effectiveness in much the way scientists might ask about a new drug or medical device .
They ’re actively recruiting thousands of volunteers to participate , in the United States and elsewhere , and randomly assigning participants to use the method , or not .
That is the only way , researchers say , to detect the subtle effects that most treatments and exercise interventions might be expected to evoke .
The studies are being done independently , one by researchers based in Norway and Australia and the other by a group in the United States .
The studies are not identical , reflecting perhaps the different views of stretching worldwide .
People in Norway and Australia stretch for different reasons than people in the United States and do slightly different stretches .
Yet exercisers and coaches everywhere , the researchers report , tend to have passionate convictions about the merits of stretching , or lack thereof .
Researchers say those strong feelings pro and con show in themselves that it will take a large study to see what , if anything , stretching really accomplishes .
If stretching were remarkably effective , athletes would notice its effects right away and everyone would agree on when to stretch and what stretching does .
Pakistan hotel blast kills at least 40 Agence France - Presse

ISLAMABAD ( AFP ) -
At least 40 people were killed in a massive car bombing at the Marriott Hotel in the Pakistan capital Islamabad on Saturday and many people are trapped inside the burning building , police said .
Flames were seen shooting out of the hotel , a key meeting place for foreigners and one of the most carefully guarded sites in the city , after the powerful blast , which was heard from quite far away .
Police officials said it appeared to be a car bombing but could not confirm it had been a suicide attack .
Ambulances were racing to the scene , and it was not immediately known how many people were wounded .
Another officer at the scene said many people were still trapped in the hotel , which caught fire after the bombing on Saturday night .
The bomb was so powerful that it blew out windows in buildings about one kilometre ( a half - mile ) away .
An AFP photographer saw at least 20 mutilated bodies amid the carnage at the scene .
The attack came just hours after new President Asif Ali Zardari , who faces a tough challenge in reining in a wave of Islamist militant violence , delivered his first address to parliament .
Pakistan , the world 's only Islamic nuclear power , has faced a wave of bombings and other attacks for more than a year .
Tribal areas along the Afghan border are believed to be a new stronghold for Al - Qaeda and Taliban militants .
Militants have been extending their sway over northwestern Pakistan and have increasingly targeted the heavily secured capital .
Zardari was to meet US President George W. Bush on the sidelines of the annual debate of world leaders at the United Nations in New York next week .
It was not immediately known if that trip would go ahead .
The Bush administration has accused Taliban Islamic militants and Al - Qaeda followers of using the unruly border areas as bases from which to direct a growing deadly insurgency in neighbouring Afghanistan .
Strains have emerged between Islamabad and Washington over strikes by US forces on the Pakistani tribal areas .
In private , US officials say that Pakistani leaders are not doing enough to flush out the militants and help stop the insurgency which has become the administration 's main military headache .
But strikes against Pakistani territory , the tally of civilian casualties as well as reports that the US forces even conducted a ground raid into Pakistan on September 3 have fueled anti-American feeling in the country .
Islamabad has already protested the strikes and Pakistani army chief General Ashfaq Kayani has pledged to safeguard the country 's " territorial integrity " .

Update :
Here are the results from the MythBusters NASA Moon Landing Episode .
On August 27 , 2008 , The Discovery Channel will air a new episode of MythBusters entitled “ NASA Moon Landing ” .
This episode was created to challenge the wild but persistent urban legend that NASA never really landed humans on the moon in the 1960s and 70s .
This special episode was first announced on NASA TV in February of 2008 .
To film the episode , Adam , Jamie , and the rest of the MythBusters cast chose to visit the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama .
A team of Marshall scientists helped the MythBusters with several of their tests .
Proponents of the Apollo Moon Landing hoax conspiracy theories insist that NASA and the US Government intentionally deceived the public by fabricating the manned moon landings .
Although exact details from the episode are mum , NASA has reported that the MythBusters ’ tests included a feather , a weight , a lunar soil boot print , and a flag in a vacuum .
What we are dealing with in detail I am not professionally qualified to discuss ( I 'm not Sarah Palin , I know my limits . )
But what we are dealing with in the grand scheme of things seems pretty simple .
The US has been living beyond its means .
The US has been spending and borrowing as if its economy were fiscally secure ; and the demand for more and more from below combined with signals of total laxity from the top has led to a massive over - reach in terms of personal and public debt .
In the end , gravity and reality count , whatever the Bush - Cheney propagandists want to insist .
Like the invasion of Iraq , for which the US is still paying ; like the massive Bush tax cuts , which were never matched by cuts in spending but combined with massive increases in spending ; the home - ownership - as - speculation bubble eventually hit the reality this country 's leadership has for so long denied .
Greenspan says what is obvious : that we cannot afford McCain 's continued tax cuts and minimal spending restraints .
We cannot afford Obama 's spending plans either - but at least he is n't proposing to increase the debt .
Neither candidate has been behaving with the gravity this crisis demands .
But McCain 's trivial , deceptive , distracting tactics have been by far the worse .
I wonder if Rick Davis could tell us again whether he thinks this election should be about personalities , not issues .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Sue Ralph brought a set of the underwear , which cost £ 4 for a set of five , for her granddaugher at an Asda store in Broadstairs , Kent .
She only found out what was written on them when she opened the pack at home .
At the University of Alberta , graduates are handed a diploma during a ceremony where the chancellor says the following :
“ I charge you to use [ the powers , rights , and privileges of University degrees ] for the glory of God . ”
It ’s commonly understood that the big -G “ God ” here is some variant of the monotheistic God ( or the one Jews , Christians , and Muslims live in fear of ) .
Ian Bushfield , an atheist , attends that university and has the gall to want his beliefs to be respected and included in his graduation ceremony .
Elitist .
He writes :
After discovering this issue , the University of Alberta Atheists and Agnostics ( UAAA ) drafted a letter which was sent to the President ’s Office on 14 July .
Hope for a quick move to inclusiveness was dashed when , nearly a month later , the UAAA received a brief response stating that office had discussed the issue earlier and decided against doing anything .
After the the minutes of the meeting featuring this discussion were requested , the President ’s office decided that this was an issue that required a FOIPP request .
It ’s disappointing to hear that this University wishes to remain in its dark - aged roots , and that they could n’t even provide a reason for their decision not to change the charge even with sizable opposition .
In spite of relatively little awareness of this issue , a petition has recieved over a hundred signatures from students who are outraged by this break in secular values and the separation of church and state , and a comparable number of members in a Facebook group for the same purpose .
However , their voices remain unacknowledged . …
It should n’t be unreasonable for a group of students who pay upwards of $ 25 000 to get a degree to ask to be included in a celebration of their achievements .
The President ’s disregard for such legitimate concerns is abhorrent and intolerant , and I call for a secular convocation at the University of Alberta and an end to the denigration of the hard work of all students .
For a public institution , it seems paradoxical to bring a god into a ceremony celebrating , of all things , a world class education .
Maybe if the story gets enough publicity , the school might find this issue worthy of actual response or action .
1 Too High Teahouse
Completed in Spring , 2004 , Terunobu Fujimori , a professor of architecture at the University of Tokyo , built his boyhood dream hideaway in Takasugi-an ( Chino , Nagano ) , a teahouse on stilts , in the bottom of his father ’s garden .
So said his father when he saw it : “ There goes Terunobu , making something wacky again . ”
2 World ’s Largest tree house
The halcyon days of our youth where a few 2x4s pounded into an old elm with rusty nails constituted the coolest tree house on the block are not just long dead , but now embarrassingly overshadowed by the richest kid on the street , Lord Northumberland , and his World ’s Largest tree house .
Located on the grounds of Alnwick Gardens just 95 miles south of Edinburgh ( and next to the Alnwick Castle , the very one used in the Harry Potter films ) , this 6,000 - square - foot tree house leviathan soars 56 feet above the ground and is connected with 4,000 - square - feet of suspended walkways .
It has a restaurant that seats 120 people as well as classrooms , cafes , turrets , wobbly bridges , and imported wood from all over the world .
Oh , and it cost $ 7 million .
3 Nescafé Treehouse
This amazing treehouse above was designed by Takashi Kobayashi , one of japan ’s leading treehouse creators .
This house was designed after an advertising agency in Tokyo , hired him to design a treehouse for a Nescafé commercial now running on Japanese television .
Mr. Kobayashi built an oval bird ’s nest of a house , 12 feet high and 9 feet in diameter , reached by a circular staircase , and the final price for this tree house was about $ 38,000 .
The house is located on a field there owned by the town of Kamishihoro , where it remains an enticing , if off - limits , gift from Nestlé , the makers of Nescafé , to the people of Hokkaido .
4 Free Spirit Spheres
Free Spirit Spheres can be hung from the trees as shown , making a tree house .
They can also be hung from any other solid objects or placed in cradles on the ground .
There are four attachment points on the top of each sphere and another four anchor points on the bottom .
Each of the attachment points is strong enough to carry the weight of the entire sphere and contents .
The spheres are made of two laminations of wood strips over laminated wood frames .
The outside surface is then finished and covered with a clear fibreglass .
The result is a beautiful and very tough skin .
The skin is waterproof and strong enough to take the impacts that come with life in a dynamic environment such as the forest .
5 The Dome
This geodesic dome perched in an olive tree uses natural pine , cork and clay for construction in a Spanish ecovillage .
Like the Fab Tree Hab , this structure combines the general form of a geodesic dome with the sustainability of an earthship .
6 O2 Treehouse
Dustin Feider has a different vision for tree houses : one that would be good for the tree , the environment and the deep human need to reconnect with nature and our primordial roots .
Through his company , O2 Treehouse , Feider is out to revolutionize not merely treehouses but the entire concept of habitat .
All the materials used for the treehouse are entirely recycled – and while the original O2 Sustainability Treehouse is 13 feet wide , interiors and sizes can be customized according to customer specifications .
7 TreeHouse Workshop
The TreeHouse Workshop is a Seattle - based company that takes the art of constructing tree houses extremely seriously .
They build an average of one tree house per month and hire extremely able builders and carpenters to construct their projects .
Their finished works vary in luxury but some even include ( counterintuitive ! ) fireplaces .
8 4 Treehouse
The 4 Treehouse by Lukasz Kos floats like a “ Japanese lantern on stilts ” and is situated to accommodate four existing trees on the site .
As with the best tree house designs , this project successfully worked around the existing natural site conditions .
The three - story house itself rents suspended from these four primary site trees .
9 Le Lit Perché
Alain Laurens , a former chairman of a major French advertising agency , left his position there in 1999 to found La Cabane Perchée , a Paris - based studio that designs and builds treehouses .
The firm ’s projects are unusually elegant by treehouse standards , but none so much so as Le Lit Perché , a roomy 42 - square - foot bed made from six segments of mattress perched on a red cedar platform within a railing of slender steel cables .
Mr. Laurens , 59 , built the first one in 2005 , 24 feet above the ground at his own country house in Bonnieux , in the South of France , and has since built 12 more for customers .
Le Lit Perché , which costs $ 15,000 , “ is for people to sleep in trees ” without having to spend the money to build an entire treehouse , Mr. Laurens said .
It features a pulley system that raises and lowers a basket that can be filled with food , wine or other supplies .
For those who find being suspended in mid-air ( or completely exposed to the elements ) scary , and not conducive to romance , the bed can be placed as low as six feet off the ground .
10 Everybody ’s Treehouse
When Bill Allen builds treehouses , he does not look for the perfect tree , sturdy with thick , embracing limbs and an abundant canopy of leaves .
Mr. Allen ’s nonprofit company , Forever Young Treehouses in Burlington , Vt. , founded in 2002 , designs its houses to be accessible to handicapped and chronically ill children , and “ the first thing we look for is the ground dropping away ” from the start of the access ramp , he said , so that the ramp does n’t need to climb too high to reach the house .
He also likes to build in a grove of trees so the ramp can meander from tree to tree .
Everybody ’s Treehouse , which cost $ 450,000 and which Mr. Allen completed in January in the Mount Airy Forest park in Cincinnati , is a typical Forever Young project .
Its 160 - foot ramp winds among 14 trees ( red and white oaks , maples and ash ) as it climbs 15 feet to a 2,000 - square - foot house with two asymmetrical cedar - shingle roofs that give it a Hansel - and - Gretel look .
The structure is made of tongue - and - groove pine boards with an ipê - wood deck and has eight windows ; most start 32 inches from the floor , an ideal height for wheelchair occupants .
“ For a kid in a wheelchair , ” Mr. Allen said , “ it gives a different perspective of what the world looks like , of what a tree looks like , of what a forest looks like . ”
" There were McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken containers everywhere .
I could n't get through to get to the kitchen and they were stacked all around the bed .
You could n't see any part of the floor in the living area .
David Foster Wallace , whose darkly ironic novels , essays and short stories garnered him a large following and made him one of the most influential writers of his generation , was found dead in his California home on Friday , after apparently committing suicide , the authorities said .
Mr. Wallace , 46 , best known for his sprawling 1,079 - page novel “ Infinite Jest , ” was discovered by his wife , Karen Green , who returned home to find that he had hanged himself , a spokesman for the Claremont , Calif. , police said Saturday evening .
Mr. Wallace was a professor in the English department at Pomona College in Claremont .
“ I know a great novelist has left the scene , but we knew him as a great teacher who cared deeply about his students , who treasured him .
That ’s what we ’re going to miss , ” said Gary Kates , the dean of Pomona College .
Mr. Wallace had taught at the small liberal arts college since 2002 and held the school ’s Roy Edward Disney Chair in Creative Writing .
He taught one or two classes each semester of about 12 students each , Mr. Kates said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - American International Group Inc has hired law firm Weil Gotshal to draw up bankruptcy papers , the New York Times reported on Tuesday .
AIG could file for bankruptcy as soon as Wednesday if a financing solution is not reached , according to the Times , citing a person briefed on the matter .
ONE in three American girls falls pregnant before the age of 20 , offering hope to Republican strategists that the electorate will shrug off the fact that 17 - year - old Bristol Palin is expecting .
Educators , meanwhile , are hoping the national discussion about the pregnancy of the daughter of vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin will renew the scrutiny of Federal Government - backed abstinence - until - marriage sex education programs .
" The US is so puritanical , and does not want to talk about sex , " said Stephen Conley , executive director of the American Association of Sexuality Educators , Counsellors and Therapists .
" Over the past eight to 10 years , we have had the abstinence movement take over sex education . "
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has continued her search for book sales and it seems her search for a plausible rationale for personally blocking any impeachment investigation of President Bush .
The latest explanation can in an interview with Time Magazine .
It seems that she would not allow an investigation because Bush would never have supplied incriminating evidence against himself .
It seems that House investigators rely on the accused to build an impeachment case .
Before moving to the obvious problems with the latest rationale for blocking any impeachment effort for years , it is worth noting that it took the Speaker ’s book tour to finally prompt her to answer questions about her decision .
Only last week , Pelosi used the august body of the hosts of The View to reveal her view on impeachment : there is simply no evidence of crimes committed by President Bush , click here .
My understanding is that her office was inundated with copies of the various documented crimes alleged against Bush .
Now , Pelosi is claiming a different rationale : they could not rely on the White House and GOP supplying the evidence needed to convict :
Nancy Shipes of Woodstown , NJ :
Why have you taken impeachment off the table as an option for President George W. Bush ?
Pelosi : I took it off the table a long time ago .
You ca n’t talk about impeachment unless you have the facts , and you ca n’t have the facts unless you have cooperation from the Administration .
I think the Republicans would like nothing better than for us to focus on impeachment and take our eye off the ball of a progressive economic agenda .
I guess Nixon worked tirelessly for his own impeachment and resigned only out of a sense of self - loathing .
What is particularly striking about this latest rationale is that it is so circular — as was Pelosi ’s first explanation .
First , we could not start an investigation for impeachment without clear evidence of crimes , but we can only confirm evidence of crimes by investigating .
Now , it appears the House cannot start impeachment proceedings unless a president and his party would agree to turn over incriminating evidence .
Of course , the use of a president ’s authority to conceal or destroy evidence in such an investigation is itself a potentially impeachable offense .
Pelosi prevented a John Dean from coming forward by barring the hearing .
In past hearings , we have seen former Bush officials implicate the Administration in investigations such a the firing of the US Attorneys .
Indeed , if this is Pelosi ’s rationale for barring impeachment , why is the House pursuing contempt on these other investigations ?
It appears that a lack of cooperation does not end matters that the House wants to address .
The biggest problem , however , is that the crimes are hiding in plain view .
A federal court has already found the domestic surveillance program was unlawful and there is no question as to the torture question — as found by the International Red Cross when it informed Bush that war crimes charges could be brought .
Moreover , Pelosi made this promise years ago and worked to prevent every effort to investigate or have courts review these programs .
I do not know what lessons the Speaker has laid out for our daughters , but this is one lesson that I think I will pass on for my daughter .

[ Link ] Toast
So I said I was going to write about Toast " tomorrow " , over a week ago .
Well , what can I say , I 've been busy with actually writing the thing .
We 're talking OCD - level , every - evening - until - 1 - AM coding .
First , a short recap of my last post : IF ( currently ) sucks , and one of the ways to fix it is to put it online with Jabber bots .
This post is mostly about that last .
Naming the thing was unexpectedly hard .
There was a period where I was calling it " Vox " until I decided that fun - and - nonthreatening was the way to go , so Toast .
There will be a companion program , Jelly , that will act as a sort of server piece for Jabber .
Toast is architected so that you can have Toast programs ( " responders " ) talk to almost anything .
It comes out of the box with a console runner for testing .
Toast ( and thus all bots written in Toast ) is written in Ruby .
Ruby has grown on me .
There are warts , but it lets you be more terse than in any language I 've seen yet , including Lisp .
And it has batteries that Lisp does n't , like a real object system built in .
How do I use it ?
Anyway , Toast .
Here 's how to use it :
You make a class that subclasses Toast : : Responder , called the same thing that the file is in ( my_responder.rb contains class MyResponder ) .
Your class has a method called respond , that takes a string , and returns a string .
Whatever the first thing your bot is sent ( from a particular user ) is passed in , and whatever you return is sent back .
So , here 's a simple bot : class Echo < Toast :: Responder def respond msg " you said #{msg} , #{self. from} " end end Not bad , huh ?
So far , this looks a lot like web development .
In fact , it looks a lot like Rails .
You define a responder ( analogous to a controller in Rails , or a servlet in Java ) and it's called when something comes in .
Each request gets its own responder .
So we have a Jabber app server .
But Jabber has something , something big , that the web does n't ( else why bother ) : statefulness .
When a second message comes in from a user , we know it 's from the same user .
Which means we can send it to the same responder .
I 've wrapped up a nice API for doing this in two functions : say and wait .
say takes a string and sends it back to the user .
It 's pretty simple , but it means you can send output without returning it , which is to say , without returning from respond .
wait is a bit more complex under the hood , but just as simple : it returns the next message the user sends .
Which is to say , it waits for another message and then returns it .
Here 's another short example : class TwoStep < Toast :: Responder def respond msg say " first message : # {msg} " second =wait " second message : # {wait} " end end
So here we 're receiving a message , like before , and printing it out .
But we 're using say to do that , so we 're still in the function .
The next line receives the second message from the same user and puts it in a variable , which we then incorporate into the second string , that we return .
There are a lot of ways to do this .
You could just freeze the whole server until something else comes in , which would make it useless for having more than one user .
You could have one thread per user , and freeze that thread until something else comes in , which would make the server use more memory .
I chose a third way .
If you want to know the trick , I urge you to look at the code , and meditate on it .
It 's clever .
I must admit it was not originally my idea , though using it in this context was .
So , having written a little Toast - bot , you would like to test it .
No problem !
Go into the directory where it 's stored and run " toastconsole " .
This will run your bot from a neat command - line tool with a command history and everything .
How do I get it ?
So where can you get this amazingness ?
If you do n't already have Ruby , go download it .
Then go download the Toast gem and run : gem install toast Voila !
Toasty goodness !
It even comes with an example , a Hangman game ( that sadly only works on the Mac at the moment ) .
Of course , you could also try it out by hitting one of the Toast - running bots when it 's online , like randrewsbot@jabber.vond.net .
You can send it a message from any Jabber client , including Google Talk .
It may go up and down randomly though , as I use it for development .
And if you want better documentation , look on the Toast wiki .
It 's terribly organized at the moment , but getting better .
What 's next ?
Anyway , Toast is about a quarter of the equation .
There 's also the talk - to - Jabber piece , tentatively called Jelly , that I 'm trying to convince someone else to write .
There 's the game framework ( called Iffy ) that I am currently writing .
Finally , there 's the public server portion .
Any of these is pretty standalone , and a decent product in its own right .
But here 's my final plan :
Toast can be used to write utilities and services , and Iffy can be used with it to write IF ( or IF - like things , although I think it qualifies according to Zarf 's definition ) .
Jelly puts
Toast online , through Jabber .
The public server is a web application that lets you install and manage Toast / Jelly apps .
You upload files , the server tells Toast / Jelly to run them in a sandbox , manages a database if you need it , and ( eventually ) charges you money for the privilege .
So it 's managed hosting for bots , complete with a rapid development framework .
Due to the nature of Jabber , I do n't even need to run a Jabber server ( although I think I probably will ) .
If you own whatever.com , you can make mobile@whatever.com a Jabber bot , host it on my server , but it looks like your domain .
I would charge maybe $ 5 per month per bot .
If you want to , it would be trivial to have a centralized account system ( I mean , Jabber users come complete with their own authentication , after all ) and allow people to charge a buck a month for access to a bot .
Imagine a game released like that , as episodes , one a month .
You toss in a couple bucks , play through the first episode on Jabber , if you like it then next month the same bot will have episode two , and you play through that .
It 'll remember you , of course .
Your savegame is in the network , like any webapp , so you can play from anywhere .
Imagine a tunnel to a forum like this .
You could have the forum ( a web app ) dispatch Jabber messages when someone replies to your posts .
The messages go to the bot , who then messages you .
You reply to the message , and the bot HTTP posts the reply on the forum .
The forum works like IM for you , but like a web app for everyone else .
Imagine an SMS gateway to Toast ( in a world where SMS does n't suck .
Maybe an iPhone Jabber client ? ) .
Jabber frontends to large databases ( imdb , Wikipedia ) become really handy .
Why load a web page over a crappy radio connection when you can send a bot a few characters and get back what you want ?
Anyway .
What do you think ?
Want to help ?
From : vond Date : August 29th , 2008 11:59 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Roxio's Mac disc burning app is called Toast - when they used to have a separate audio CD program , it was called ( this is even better ) Jam .
Reply ) ( Thread From : rbandrews Date : August 29th , 2008 02:40 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) I used to love Toast , actually .
Really awesome app .
Way better than the " make a burn folder " method .

I still think this would be a really cool way for writers interested in digital narratives and digital publishing to get their work out .
Story told through IM ?
THAT'S AWESOME .
Or how about a relatively established , mid-list author with a sizeable enough fan base to do something like what Catherynne Valente does , which is allow you to sign up for monthly mailings of exclusive stories and poems and other miscelleny - links would be sent to you via AIM , and bam !
Something new to read .
It 's easier to sneakily be on IM when you 're at work , too , so I imagine there 's a lot of possibility there , too .
Do n't give up !
It has a lot of potential for coolness , I think .

It sounds like you 're implementing ' wait ' using Ruby 's dreaded " continuations " feature ? [ shivers ]
There have been various conversational AIM bots , although none ( that I know of ) used for IF .
The best known was smarterchild , which was run by a startup that wanted to sell the bot - making software ...
I think the idea was that they'd be used for online marketing , like an N - Sync bot that you could chat with about how hot Justin was .
They ended up changing their business model a few times and then ( AFAIK ) folding .
Which is not to say that you could n't make a business , although probably smaller and lower - visibility , out of Jabber bots .
Just do n't aim your marketing at Fortune 500 companies ;-)
I 'm ambivalent about the idea of chatterbots .
I love IF , but what seems to happen with bots is that the designers do n't put enough effort into the parser , so it ends up being like a remember - and - type CLI shell .
If you type " weather san jose " it 'll give you the local forecast , but " how 's the weather in san jose " or " san jose weather " do n't work .
That 's lame .
Do n't make that mistake !

What is wrong with continuations ?
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : snej Date : August 30th , 2008 11:58 pm ( UTC ) ( Link )
Nothing wrong with them ; I just meant " dreaded " in that they are very powerful but unintuitive .
I have n't looked at your code , but continuations seem like the only way to implement a ' wait ' command the blocks but does n't really block .
( I 've experimented with doing similar things in Objective - C using the ' ucontext ' library , which is a C equivalent of continuations . )
Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : rbandrews Date : August 31st , 2008 05:30 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Yep , callcc is exactly how I do it .
It 's really not that tricky ...
You could probably do it with yield also , but I 'd have to think about it some .
One thing I miss is that I do n't think continuations in Ruby are serializable .
In Rhino they are , which means I could freeze continuations to disk , stop the server , restart it , and then load them back up , and ( except for a DB connection and filehandles ) bots would have no idea anything had happened .
Could probably pass them around a cluster too , if you really needed to , but my main thing is stopping the server .
If everything is stored in memory , instead of manually put into a database like Rails , then when the server stops , you 're going to lose a lot of session data if you 're not careful .

The US Treasury was already planning to borrow $ 438bn ( £ 237bn ) next year to shore up its budget deficit .
That could now rise to $ 1 trillion or more after the cost of the $ 700 bn mortgage rescue fund is taken into account .
Budget deficits of that kind are usually enough to scare many foreign investors away , and indeed the dollar slumped 1.1 cents to $ 1.8441 against the pound yesterday , and in late trading was down almost two cents against the euro at $ 1.46880 .
COMMENT : More B.S. – and we should believe your dubious claims linking Iran and ‘ al Qaeda ’ why ?
Kate Clark
BBC News
September 15 , 2008
Elements in the Iranian state are sending weapons across the border to the Taleban in Afghanistan , a BBC investigation has uncovered .
Taleban members said they had received Iranian - made arms from elements in the Iranian state and from smugglers .
The UK says its troops have intercepted arms which it believes were given by a group within the Iranian state .
The Iranian embassy in Kabul dismissed the allegations , saying Tehran supported the Afghan government .
‘ It ’s called Dragon ’
Among the Taleban , Iranian - made weapons are greatly sought after in the fight against the government of Hamid Karzai and the Nato and US - led forces deployed to support him .
They are considered to be reliable and particularly destructive .
For example , an Iranian - made Kalashnikov rifle can be adapted to fire grenades .
It costs $ 200 - $ 300 more than one made in Pakistan , Russia or China .
Iranian - made weapons , one commander told me , had really improved the Taleban ’s ability to attack the American military deployed in his area .
“ There ’s a kind of mine called Dragon .
Iran is sending it , we have got it , ” the Taleban commander said .
“ It ’s directional , it destroys .
If you lay an ordinary mine , it will cause only minor damage to Humvees or one of their big tanks .
But if you lay a Dragon , it will be destroy it completely . ”
‘ Limited supply ’
The question is – are Iranian weapons only being brought across the border by smugglers for profit or are elements of the Iranian state also donating arms ?
The Taleban commander and other sources in the south told me both routes were operating .
The British ambassador in Kabul , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , made the same allegation .
“ We ’ve seen a limited supply of weapons by a group within the Iranian state , not necessarily with the knowledge of all other agencies of the Iranian state , sending some very dangerous weapons to the Taleban in the south .

Advertisement Confusion has marred French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's farewell to Israel , after a soldier shot himself dead during an airport departure ceremony .
Mr Sarkozy and his wife , Carla Bruni , were rushed into their plane after the shot .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was also hurried to safety .
The incident at Ben-Gurion airport came at the end of Mr Sarkozy 's three - day visit to Israel and the West Bank .
A police spokesman said the security officer had committed suicide .
Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the incident , which happened just as Mr Sarkozy and Ms Bruni were about to board their plane , had posed no threat to the visitors .
He denied reports that it might have been an assassination attempt on the French president .
Other reports suggested the soldier may have shot himself accidentally .
Witnesses said the incident was over within minutes and that Mr Olmert had then boarded the Sarkozys ' plane to say farewell and explain what had happened .
' A priority ' Israel Radio reported that the soldier had been stationed on the perimeter of the airport , some 100 m to 200 m ( 330 - 660 feet ) from the Sarkozys ' plane , when he shot himself as a band played .
Mr Sarkozy and his wife earlier met Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas Television footage showed the French president and his wife being hustled up the steps into the aircraft .
Israeli President Shimon Peres , who was also present for the farewell ceremony , was also taken to his armoured car .
Mr Sarkozy 's visit was intended to improve relations between France and Israel .
He also held talks in the West Bank on Tuesday with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas .
Speaking after the meeting , Mr Sarkozy voiced his support for the creation of a Palestinian state .
" The security of Israel is non-negotiable for France , but the creation of a viable , democratic , modern state for the Palestinians is a priority for France , " he said .
He also repeated his call for Israel to halt its building of settlements in the West Bank .
It came a day after he told Israeli politicians in the Knesset that there would be no lasting Middle East peace without a freeze on Jewish settlement construction on Palestinian land .
Mr Abbas said the Palestinians were " relying a great deal on the European role " in the peace process , particularly as France takes on the rotating European Union presidency next month .

What are these ?
“ That was it , ” he added .
“ It was like the plug was pulled , ‘ No money for you anymore . ’ ”
But he was still under contract , he said , and extricating himself took four years .
Around 2000 he started talking with the band members about restarting My Bloody Valentine , but they were all involved in other projects .
Years drifted by .
In 2006 Mr. Shields started remastering the My Bloody Valentine catalog and revisiting unreleased songs to be added to a compilation album .
When he listened again to material from the aborted third album , he was heartened .
“ I realized that all that stuff I was doing in 1996 and 1997 was a lot better than I thought . ”
He now plans to complete that album , and to start recording new material with the band in the fall .
He has been writing songs steadily over the years .
“ I definitely do n’t think you need to suffer to be creative , ” he said .
“ I ’ve written some of my best songs when I ’ve been happy . ”
During the remastering the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California made a big offer for a reunited My Bloody Valentine .
“ We could actually buy equipment and rehearse properly and do it really well , ” Mr. Shields said .
“ That put the idea into our head .
Last time we toured we never had equipment .
It did n’t sound right .
We did n’t have control of the environment .
So we were kind of excited to play the songs properly . ”
But the band was n’t ready to appear at the Coachella festival in April , Mr. Shields said .
All Tomorrow ’s Parties had been courting Mr. Shields for years , and having attended its festivals in Britain , Mr. Shields decided to bring My Bloody Valentine to the upstate New York festival .
“ We had intentions to do new stuff when we started rehearsing , ” he said .
“ But it was about finding who we were again , and that became way more important than anything intellectual . ”
The band spent £ 200,000 , about $ 366,000 , on equipment for the tour , and Mr. Shields laughed when asked how many effects pedals he owned .
“ Hundreds , ” he said .
He only uses 30 onstage , he added .
There were no new songs in My Bloody Valentine ’s set on Sunday , but as in the ’80s and early 1990s , My Bloody Valentine ’s music flashed simultaneous , contradictory signals : the songs were bruised and hurting at their core but exultantly propulsive , catchy like punk and pop but spiked with fearsome cacophony .
High , looping sounds skirled like Celtic reels ; guitar chords hurtled forward , heaved back and forth , screeched with fury and exaltation ; the drums were triumphal and implacable .
“ You ca n’t do anything with sound , ” Mr. Shields had said , “ unless there is emotion . ”
Streetart lovers , rejoice : the Colossal Media / Banksy collaboration that we spotted yesterday on the corner of Grand and Wooster is now complete .

Following comments may suggest that it 's already a useless shiny brick .
It 's just too obvious .
Oh China , you so craaazeh .
Ben Bernanke has taken a distant backseat to Hammerin ' Hank Paulson on the Great Wall Street Bailout , and his erudite fans are beginning to shower him with boos .
Asha Bangalore , Northern Trust :
Chairman Bernanke , it 's time to grab the reins and lead .
With all due respect , Chairman Bernanke , you have led the Fed admirably in the charge against the current financial hurricane in the past thirteen months with numerous innovations and timely measures , but you have to do more now than endorse the Paulson rescue plan ...
I am sure you were consulted on the details of the plan and the Fed has a fleet of experts to study and evaluate it .
Economic and financial experts of different political persuasions are united in their view that the Paulson plan needs improvement .
In addition , members of Congress are not convinced of the merits of the plan .
There is no reason for a hasty passage of a faulty plan .
The Paulson plan surely did not strike you as the best solution .
The numerous facilities established at the Fed to obtain funds and the nationalization of Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac have bought the time necessary to examine all other solutions .
With all
due respect , Mr. Bernanke , declare that a package whose proposals and implications are not
thoroughly examined should not be the burden of taxpayers .
Of course , you may need to say this in more diplomatic terms .
The ongoing debate in Congress , calls from the public to
representatives of Congress , and the fact that the press is inundated with critical comments and
letters to the editors are examples of the plan ’s serious weaknesses .
Call upon Congress for a
special session to examine the issues carefully with full representation from experts .
You have the stature , credibility , and leadership to declare this is as a necessity .
It would be a serious lapse of leadership if alternatives and / or improvements to the Paulson plan are not considered .
Paul Krugman , Princeton and The New York Times :
Something needs to be done .
This is looking a little bit -- I 'm going to do the scare talk here .
This looks a little bit like a high - tech 21st - century version of 1931 of the great banking panics that brought on the Great Depression .
And nobody wants to see a repeat of that .
That said , that does n't mean that we have to do now , now , now , this week , exactly what Hank Paulson says .
So it 's worth taking some time to do it right .
And we should say that the most critical credit market , which is the home mortgage market , has actually already been rescued .
We just nationalized Fannie and Freddie .
And so I think we have a little more leeway .
I think that we need to cool this a little bit and say , " Yes , OK , we 're going to do this , but it does n't have to be this week . " ...
The federal government is going to have to put money into that system , but it has to do that in the way that at least gives taxpayers a reasonable interest in what happens .
That has n't come from Treasury ...
I think , if we 're going to be essentially providing public capital for firms , essentially what we 're calling for is we 're -- this is calling for Uncle Sam to be what , you know , in finance we call a white knight , somebody who comes in with capital to rescue a firm that does n't have enough capital .
I think Uncle Sam does need to be the white knight , but the white knight always , you know , gets a piece of the pie , gets ownership .
Allan Meltzer , Carnegie Mellon :
It 's a terrible idea .
It 's undemocratic .
It 's bad economic policy , and it 's bad social policy .
And it has a very little chance of solving the problem in a meaningful way ...
I 've listened to governments tell me for 40 years that there was a crisis and the world was going to fall apart if we did n't do this or that .
But there have been a few cases where they were n't able to do that .
One was the commercial paper crisis in 1970 .
There have been several others .
The world did not fall apart .
Last week , we had Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy .
Within three days , most of the assets were sold .
We had AIG turn down three offers to buy the company because they thought they would get a better deal from the government .
It turned out they did n't get the better deal from the government .
Now the stockholders suddenly woke up and said -- the major stockholders said , " We 'd like to buy the company . "
Well , that 's what I think we need to do .
We need to get the government 's hand out of this , and let 's see whether we can't get a market solution .
The market people caused this problem .
They ought to be the ones that pay the cost of having it cleaned up ...
[ I ] f they 're going to do something , then what they ought to do is make loans , which the financial institutions have to repay with interest .
And if you think -- that 's an idea which the Chileans have used in a bigger crisis than this for them in 1982 , and it worked for them .
People paid back the loans .
They were n't allowed to pay dividends until they repaid the loans .
They were n't allowed to take bonuses until they repaid the loans .
I think that 's the way -- if we 're going to do this , then that 's the way we should do it .

JUNE , 1889 .
WEALTH
BY ANDREW CARNEGIE .
The problem of our age is the proper administration of wealth , so that the ties of brotherhood may still bind together the rich and poor in harmonious relationship .
The conditions of human life have not only been changed , but revolutionized , within the past few hundred years .
In former days there was little difference between the dwelling , dress , food , and environment of the chief and those of his retainers .
The Indians are to - day where civilized man then was .
When visiting the Sioux , I was led to the wigwam of the chief .
It was just like the others in external appearance , and even within the difference was trifling between it and those of the poorest of his braves .
The contrast between the palace of the millionaire and the cottage of the laborer with us to - day measures the change which has come with civilization .
This change , however , is not to be deplored , but welcomed as highly beneficial .
It is well , nay , essential for the progress of the race , that the houses of some should be homes for all that is highest and best in literature and the arts , and for all the refinements of civilization , rather than that none should be so .
Much better this great irregularity than universal squalor .
Without wealth there can be no Mæcenas .
The " good old times " were not good old times .
Neither master nor servant was as well situated then as to - day .
A relapse to old conditions would be disastrous to both -- not the least so to him who serves -- and would Sweep away civilization with it .
But whether the change be for good or ill , it is upon us , beyond our power to alter , and there fore to be accepted and made the best of .
It is a waste of time to criticise the inevitable .
It is easy to see how the change has come .
One illustration will serve for almost every phase of the cause .
In the manufacture of products we have the whole story .
It applies to all combinations of human industry , as stimulated and enlarged by the inventions of this scientific age .
Formerly articles
Were manufactured at the domestic hearth or in small shops which formed part of the household .
The master and his apprentices worked side by side , the latter living with the master , and therefore subject to the same conditions .
When these apprentices rose to be masters , there was little or no change in their mode of life , and they , in turn , educated in the same routine succeeding apprentices .
There was , substantially social equality , and even political equality , for those engaged in industrial pursuits had then little or no political voice in the State .
But the inevitable result of such a mode of manufacture was crude articles at high prices .
To - day the world obtains commodities of excellent quality at prices which even the generation preceding this would have deemed incredible .
In the commercial world similar causes have produced similar results , and the race is benefited thereby .
The poor enjoy what the rich could not before afford .
What were the luxuries have become the necessaries of life .
The laborer has now more comforts than the landlord had a few generations ago .
The farmer has more luxuries than the landlord had , and is more richly clad and better housed .
The landlord has books and pictures rarer , and appointments more artistic , than the King could then obtain .
The price we pay for this salutary change is , no doubt , great .
We assemble thousands of operatives in the factory , in the mine , and in the counting - house , of whom the employer can know little or nothing , and to whom the employer is little better than a myth .
All intercourse between them is at an end .
Rigid Castes are formed , and , as usual , mutual ignorance breeds mutual distrust .
Each Caste is without sympathy for the other , and ready to credit anything disparaging in regard to it .
Under the law of competition , the employer of thousands is forced into the strictest economies , among which the rates paid to labor figure prominently , and often there is friction between the employer and the employed , between capital and labor , between rich and poor .
Human society loses homogeneity .
The price which society pays for the law of competition , like the price it pays for cheap comforts and luxuries , is also great ; but the advantage of this law are also greater still , for it is to this law that we owe our wonderful material development , which brings improved conditions in its train .
But , whether the law be benign or not , we must say of it , as we say of the change in the conditions of men to which we have referred :
It is here ; we cannot evade it ; no substitutes for it have been found ; and while the law may be sometimes hard for the individual , it is best for the race , because it insures the survival of the fittest in every department .
We accept and welcome therefore , as conditions to which we must accommodate ourselves , great inequality of environment , the concentration of business , industrial and commercial , in the hands of a few , and the law of competition between these , as being not only beneficial , but essential for the future progress of the race .
Having accepted these , it follows that there must be great scope for the exercise of special ability in the merchant and in the manufacturer who has to conduct affairs upon a great scale .
That this talent for organization and management is rare among men is proved by the fact that it invariably secures for its possessor enormous rewards , no matter where or under what laws or conditions .
The experienced in affairs always rate the MAN whose services can be obtained as a partner as not only the first consideration , but such as to render the question of his capital scarcely worth considering , for such men soon create capital ; while , without the special talent required , capital soon takes wings .
Such men become interested in firms or corporations using millions ; and estimating only simple interest to be made upon the capital invested , it is inevitable that their income must exceed their expenditures , and that they must accumulate wealth .
Nor is there any middle ground which such men can occupy , because the great manufacturing or commercial concern which does not earn at least interest upon its capital soon becomes bankrupt .
It , must either go forward or fall behind : to stand still is impossible .
It is a condition essential for its successful operation that it should be thus far profitable , and even that , in addition to interest on capital , it should make profit .
It is a law , as certain as any of the others named , that men possessed of this peculiar talent for affair , under the free play of economic forces , must , of necessity , soon be in receipt of more revenue than can be judiciously expended upon themselves ; and this law is as beneficial for the race as the others .
Objections to the foundations upon which society is based are not in order , because the condition of the race is better with these than it has been with any others which have been tried .
Of the effect of any new substitutes proposed we can not be sure .
The Socialist or Anarchist who seeks to overturn present conditions is to be regarded as attacking the foundation upon which civilization itself rests , for civilization took its start from the day that the capable , industrious workman said to his incompetent and lazy fellow , " If thou dost net sow , thou shalt net reap , " and thus ended primitive Communism by separating the drones from the bees .
One who studies this subject will soon be brought face to face with the conclusion that upon the sacredness of property civilization itself depends -- the right of the laborer to his hundred dollars in the savings bank , and equally the legal right of the millionaire to his millions .
To these who propose to substitute Communism for this intense Individualism the answer , therefore , is :
The race has tried that .
All progress from that barbarous day to the present time has resulted from its displacement .
Not evil , but good , has come to the race from the accumulation of wealth by those who have the ability and energy that produce it .
But even if we admit for a moment that it might be better for the race to discard its present foundation , Individualism , -- that it is a nobler ideal that man should labor , not for himself alone , but in and for a brotherhood of his fellows , and share with them all in common , realizing Swedenborg 's idea of Heaven , where , as he says , the angels derive their happiness , not from laboring for self , but for each other , -- even admit all this , and a sufficient answer is , This is not evolution , but revolution .
It necessitates the changing of human nature itself a work of oeons , even if it were good to change it , which we can not know .
It is not practicable in our day or in our age .
Even if desirable theoretically , it belongs to another and long - succeeding sociological stratum .
Our duty is with what is practicable now ; with the next step possible in our day and generation .
It is criminal to waste our energies in endeavoring to uproot , when all we can profitably or possibly accomplish is to bend the universal tree of humanity a little in the direction most favorable to the production of good fruit under existing circumstances .
We might as well urge the destruction of the highest existing type of man because he failed to reach our ideal as favor the destruction of Individualism , Private Property , the Law of Accumulation of Wealth , and the Law of Competition ; for these are the highest results of human experience , the soil in which society so far has produced the best fruit .
Unequally or unjustly , perhaps , as these laws sometimes operate , and imperfect as they appear to the Idealist , they are , nevertheless , like the highest type of man , the best and most valuable of all that humanity has yet accomplished .
We start , then , with a condition of affairs under which the best interests of the race are promoted , but which inevitably gives wealth to the few .
Thus far , accepting conditions as they exist , the situation can be surveyed and pronounced good .
The question then arises , -- and , if the foregoing be correct , it is the only question with which we have to deal , -- What is the proper mode of administering wealth after the laws upon which civilization is founded have thrown it into the hands of the few ?
And it is of this great question that I believe I offer the true solution .
It will be understood that fortunes are here spoken of , not moderate sums saved by many years of effort , the returns on which are required for the comfortable maintenance and education of families .
This is not wealth , but only competence which it should be the aim of all to acquire .
There are but three modes in which surplus wealth can be disposed of .
It call be left to the families of the decedents ; or it can be bequeathed for public purposes ; or , finally , it can be administered during their lives by its possessors .
Under the first and second modes most of the wealth of the world that has reached the few has hitherto been applied .
Let us in turn consider each of these modes .
The first is the most injudicious .
In monarchical countries , the estates and the greatest portion of the wealth are left to the first son , that the vanity of the parent may be gratified by the thought that his name and title are to descend to succeeding generations unimpaired .
The condition of this class in Europe to - day teaches the futility of such hopes or ambitions .
The successors have become impoverished through their follies or from the fall in the value of land .
Even in Great Britain the strict law of entail has been found inadequate to maintain the status of an hereditary class .
Its soil is rapidly passing into the hands of the stranger .
Under republican institutions the division of property among the children is much fairer , but the question which forces itself upon thoughtful men in all lands is :
Why should men leave great fortunes to their children ?
If this is done from affection , is it not misguided affection ?
Observation teaches that , generally speaking , it is not well for the children that they should be so burdened .
Neither is it well for the state .
Beyond providing for the wife and daughters moderate sources of income , and very moderate allowances indeed , if any , for the sons , men may well hesitate , for it is no longer questionable that great suns bequeathed oftener work more for the injury than for the good of the recipients .
Wise men will soon conclude that , for the best interests of the members of their families and of the state , such bequests are an improper use of their means .
It is not suggested that men who have failed to educate their sons to earn a livelihood shall cast them adrift in poverty .
If any man has seen fit to rear his sons with a view to their living idle lives , or , what is highly commendable , has instilled in them the sentiment that they are in a position to labor for public ends without reference to pecuniary considerations , then , of course , the duty of the parent is to see that such are provided for ? fl moderation .
There are instances of millionaires ' sons unspoiled by wealth , who , being rich , still perform great services in the community .
Such are the very salt of the earth , as valuable as , unfortunately , they are rare ; still it is not the exception , but the rule , that men must regard , and , looking at the usual result of enormous sums conferred upon legatees , the thoughtful man must shortly say , " I would as soon leave to my son a curse as the almighty dollar , " and admit to himself that it is not the welfare of the children , but family pride , which inspires these enormous legacies .
As to the second mode , that of leaving wealth at death for public uses , it may be said that this is only a means for the disposal of wealth , provided a man is content to wait until he is dead before it becomes of much good in the world .
Knowledge of the results of legacies bequeathed is not calculated to inspire the brightest hopes of much posthumous good being accomplished .
The cases are not few in which the real object sought by the testator is not attained , nor are they few in which his real wishes are thwarted .
In many cases the bequests are so used as to become only monuments of his folly .
It is well to remember that it requires the exercise of not less ability than that which acquired the wealth to use it so as to be really beneficial to the community .
Besides this , it may fairly be said that no man is to be extolled for doing what he cannot help doing , nor is he to be thanked by the community to which he only leaves wealth at death .
Men who leave vast sums in this way may fairly be thought men who would not have left it at all , had they been able to take it with them .
The memories of such cannot be held in grateful remembrance , for there is no grace in their gifts .
It is not to be wondered at that such bequests seem so generally to lack the blessing . -
The growing disposition to tax more and more heavily large estates left at death is a cheering indication of the growth of a salutary change in public opinion .
The State of Pennsylvania now takes -- subject to some exceptions -- one - tenth of the property left by its citizens .
The budget presented in the British Parliament the other day proposes to increase the death - duties ; and , most significant of all , the new tax is to be a graduated one .
Of all forms of taxation , this seems the wisest .
Men who continue hoarding great sums all their lives , the proper use of which for - public ends would work good to the community , should be made to feel that the community , in the form of the state , cannot thus be deprived of its proper share .
By taxing estates heavily at death the state marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire 's unworthy life .
It is desirable ; that nations should go much further in this direction .
Indeed , it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich man 's estate which should go at his death to the public through the agency of the state , and by all means such taxes should be graduated , beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to dependents , and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell , until of the millionaire 's hoard , as of Shylock 's , at least
" _____
The other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state . "
This policy would work powerfully to induce the rich man to attend to the administration of wealth during his life , which is the end that society should always have in view , as being that by far most fruitful for the people .
Nor need it be feared that this policy would sap the root of enterprise and render men less anxious to accumulate , for to the class whose ambition it is to leave great fortunes and be talked about after their death , it will at - tract even more attention , and , indeed , be a somewhat nobler ambition to have enormous sums paid over to the state from their fortunes .
There remains , then , only one mode of using great fortunes ; but in this we have the true antidote for the temporary unequal distribution of wealth , the reconciliation of the rich and the poor - - a reign of harmony -- another ideal , differing , indeed , from that of the Communist in requiring only the further evolution of existing conditions , not the total overthrow of our civilization .
It is founded upon the present most intense individualism , and the race is projected to put it in practice by degree whenever it pleases .
Under its sway we shall have an ideal state , in which the surplus wealth of the few will become , in the best sense the property of the many , because administered for the common good , and this wealth , passing through the hands of the few , can be made a much more potent force for the elevation of our race than if it had been distributed in small sums to the people themselves .
Even the poorest can be made to see this , and to agree that great sums gathered by some of their fellow - citizens and spent for public purposes , from which the masses reap the principal benefit , are more valuable to them than if scattered among them through the course of many years in trifling amounts .
If we consider what results flow from the Cooper Institute , for instance , to the best portion of the race in New York not possessed of means , and compare these with those which would have arisen for the good of the masses from an equal sum distributed by Mr. Cooper in his lifetime in the form of wages , which is the highest form of distribution , being for work done and not for charity , we can form some estimate of the possibilities for the improvement of the race which lie embedded in the present law of the accumulation of wealth .
Much of this sum if distributed in small quantities among the people , would have been wasted in the indulgence of appetite , some of it in excess , and it may be doubted whether even the part put to the best use , that of adding to the comforts of the home , would have yielded results for the race , as a race , at all comparable to those which are flowing and are to flow from the Cooper Institute from generation to generation .
Let the advocate of violent or radical change ponder well this thought .
We might even go so far as to take another instance , that of Mr. Tilden 's bequest of five millions of dollars for a free library in the city of New York , but in referring to this one cannot help saying involuntarily , how much better if Mr. Tilden had devoted the last years of his own life to the proper administration of this immense sum ; in which case neither legal contest nor any other cause of delay could have interfered with his aims .
But let us assume that Mr. Tilden 's millions finally become the means of giving to this city a noble public library , where the treasures of the world contained in books will be open to all forever , without money and without price .
Considering the good of that part of the race which congregates in and around Manhattan Island , would its permanent benefit have been better promoted had these millions been allowed to circulate in small sums through the hands of the masses ?
Even the most strenuous advocate of Communism must entertain a doubt upon this subject .
Most of those who think will probably entertain no doubt whatever .
Poor and restricted are our opportunities in this life ; narrow our horizon ; our best work most imperfect ; but rich men should be thankful for one inestimable boon .
They have it in their power during their lives to busy themselves in organizing benefactions from which the masses of their fellows will derive lasting advantage , and thus dignify their own lives .
The highest life is probably to be reached , not by such imitation of the life of Christ as Count Tolstoi gives us , but , while animated by Christ 's spirit , by recognizing the changed conditions of this age , and adopting modes of expressing this spirit suitable to the changed conditions under which we live ; still laboring for the good of our fellows , which was the essence of his life and teaching , but laboring in a different manner .
This , then , is held to be the duty of the man of Wealth : First , to set an example of modest , unostentatious living , shunning display or extravagance ; to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him ; and after doing so to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds , which he is called upon to administer , and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which , in his judgment , is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community -- the man of wealth thus becoming the mere agent and trustee for his poorer brethren , bringing to their service his superior wisdom , experience and ability to administer , doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves .
We are met here with the difficulty of determining what are moderate sums to leave to members of the family ; what is modest , unostentatious living ; what is the test of extravagance .
There must be different standards for different conditions .
The answer is that it is as impossible to name exact amounts or actions as it is to define good manners , good taste , or the rules of propriety ; but , nevertheless , these are verities , well known although undefinable .
Public sentiment is quick to know and to feel what offends these .
So in the case of wealth .
The rule in regard to good taste in the dress of men or women applies here .
Whatever makes one conspicuous offends the canon .
If any family be chiefly known for display , for extravagance in home , table , equipage , for enormous sums ostentatiously spent in any form upon itself , if these be its chief distinctions , we have no difficulty in estimating its nature or culture .
So likewise in regard to the use or abuse of its surplus wealth , or to generous , freehanded cooperation in good public uses , or to unabated efforts to accumulate and hoard to the last , whether they administer or bequeath .
The verdict rests with the best and most enlightened public sentiment .
The community will surely judge and its judgments will not often be wrong .
The best uses to which surplus wealth can be put have already been indicated .
These who , would administer wisely must , indeed , be wise , for one of the serious obstacles to the improvement of our race is indiscriminate charity .
It were better for mankind that the millions of the rich were thrown in to the sea than so spent as to encourage the slothful , the drunken , the unworthy .
Of every thousand dollars spent in so called charity to - day , it is probable that $ 950 is unwisely spent ; so spent , indeed as to produce the very evils which it proposes to mitigate or cure .
A well - known writer of philosophic books admitted the other day that he had given a quarter of a dollar to a man who approached him as he was coming to visit the house of his friend .
He knew nothing of the habits of this beggar ; knew not the use that would be made of this money , although he had every reason to suspect that it would be spent improperly .
This man professed to be a disciple of Herbert Spencer ; yet the quarter - dollar given that night will probably work more injury than all the money which its thoughtless donor will ever be able to give in true charity will do good .
He only gratified his own feelings , saved him - self from annoyance , -- and this was probably one of the most selfish and very worst actions of his life , for in all respects he is most worthy .
In bestowing charity , the main consideration should be to help those who will help themselves ; to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so ; to give those who desire to use the aids by which they may rise ; to assist , but rarely or never to do all .
Neither the individual nor the race is improved by alms - giving .
Those worthy of assistance , except in rare cases , seldom require assistance .
The really valuable men of the race never do , except in cases of accident or sudden change .
Every one has , of course , cases of individuals brought to his own knowledge where temporary assistance can do genuine good , and these he will not overlook .
But the amount which can be wisely given by the individual for individuals is necessarily limited by his lack of knowledge of the circumstances connected with each .
He is the only true reformer who is as careful and as anxious not to aid the unworthy as he is to aid the worthy , and , perhaps , even more so , for in alms - giving more injury is probably done by rewarding vice than by relieving virtue .
The rich man is thus almost restricted to following the examples of Peter Cooper , Enoch Pratt of Baltimore , Mr. Pratt of Brooklyn , Senator Stanford , and others , who know that the best means of benefiting the community is to place within its reach the ladders upon which the aspiring can rise -- parks , and means of recreation , by which men are helped in body and mind ; works of art , certain to give pleasure and improve the public taste , and public institutions of various kinds , which will improve the general condition of the people ;-- in this manner returning their surplus wealth to the mass of their fellows in the forms best calculated to do them lasting good . -
Thus is the problem of Rich and Poor to be solved .
The laws of accumulation will be left free ; the laws of distribution free .
Individualism will continue , but the millionaire will be but a trustee for the poor ; intrusted for a season with a great part of the increased wealth of the community , but administering it for the community far better than it could or would have done for itself .
The best minds will thus have reached a stage in the development of the race iii which it is clearly seen that there is no mode of disposing of surplus wealth creditable to thoughtful and earnest men into whose hands it flows save by using it year by year for the general good .
This day already dawns .
But a little while , and although , without incurring the pity of their fellows , men may die sharers in great business enterprises from which their capital cannot be or has not been withdrawn , and is left chiefly at death for public uses , yet the man who dies leaving behind many millions of available wealth , which was his to administer during life , will pass away " unwept , unhonored , and unsung , " no matter to what uses he leaves the dross which he cannot take with him .
Of such as these the public verdict will then be : " The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced . "
Such , in my opinion , is the true Gospel concerning Wealth , obedience to which is destined some day to solve the problem of the Rich and the Poor , and to bring ' Peace on earth , among men Good - Will . "

Dear Congress
Treasury Secretary Paulson is asking you to rush through a $ 700 billion package because " we ’re literally maybe days away from a complete meltdown of our financial system " .
Paulson states that it must be done quickly and that it is better than the alternatives .
Fed Chairman Bernanke agrees .
The first question Congress should ask is how would Paulson or Bernanke know ?
It was only a month ago Paulson was reiterating to anyone who would listen how sound our banking system is .
The fact of the matter is that neither Paulson nor Bernanke saw this coming , yet now Congress is supposed to trust they now " know " the solution .
Problem Defined
Before one can work out a solution , the first step is to identify the problem .
The problem is not a lack of liquidity , it is not a lack of trust , it is not lack of consumer confidence , it is not subprime lending , and in fact the problem is not housing at all .
The problem is consumers and corporations are deep in debt with no way to service that debt .
Attempts to bail out banks and brokers at taxpayer expense will do nothing but add to consumer debt , weaken the US dollar , and literally waste $ 700 + billion dollars that can and should go to more productive uses .
What Caused The Problem ?
The Fed
Congress
Fractional Reserve Lending
The Treasury

Hmm…so , six - ish months ago , I posted that I had just spent a month working at a new job , where I got to code Erlang all day , and that I had a crazy month coming up , which would mean less attention here .
That ‘ month ’ extended itself through the summer , and is going to continue through the fall , but I wanted to give you all an update .
Of course , anyone who really wanted to dig has already found that my new all - Erlang - all - the - time job is at Basho Technologies , but here ’s an announcement in a little more obvious place .
We ’re creating a web - based system for salespersons and sales organizations to track , analyze , and improve their process .
We are not just another CRM , and do not intend to become one .
We ’re providing real tracking , guidance , and analysis , not just an ‘ online rolodex ’ .
But , enough about the business , you all want to know about the tech we ’re using , right ?
Okay , so it ’s not quite all - Erlang - all - the - time .
Depending on the week , I spend anywhere from 40 - 90 % of my time in Erlang , but because we ’re providing a web service , I spend the rest of the day in HTML ( or our template / rendering language of choice ) , Javascript , or CSS .
There may be a time at which I ’ll have to add Java and / or Flash to that mix as well , but for now , they ’re staying down the hall .
Erlang provides the logic for basically all of our server - side code .
The webserver , mochiweb with a nice logic layer overtop code - named “ webmachine ” ( which you ’ll probably hear more about in the coming months ) , is entirely coded in Erlang , and accepts Erlang modules as “ resource providers . ”
The storage system uses components from the distributerl project to provide a distributed storage solution .
Even our template / rendering language is interpreted by Erlang code .
At this point , I ’m sure there are a few of you with your jaws hanging open , minds full of protests and questions .
“ What about the lack of strings ? ” “ What about the syntax ? ” I tell you now : these are not problems we ’ve stumbled over .
“ Lack of strings ” is a complete misnomer .
There are lists , iolists , and binaries .
Through combinations of the three , we get everything we need .
We do what coders have been doing for decades : we wrap tricky , repetitive , often - needed code in libraries and move on .
Honestly , we ’re having more trouble with the standard datetime tuple ( no standard for timezone marking , confusing timezone expectations of conversion functions ) .
To truly get an idea of how much trouble the syntax is , I recommend you try this excercise : code in Erlang - only for a few weeks , then try coding in something else , like Javascript .
I think you ’ll realize that each language has its own bunch of syntax quirks .
We were able to run the exercise above in our first few weeks of coding .
Many of us had never touched Erlang , and some had never touched Javascript .
Each language took a couple of days for the learner to be able to produce something useful , and another week or so for the same learner to be able to do it on their own in a reasonable amount of time .
We do have complaints about the way each language is written now , but they share little with the complaints we had when starting out .
Case in point : records .
Everyone ’s favorite structure to beat up ( after strings , of course ) .
At first they seem like overly - verbose , half - baked forms of structures from other languages .
Then comes the epiphany : they ’re not designed to take the place of those structures .
The best way to think about records is to envision C - structs full of void pointers .
Then you can realize that their real power is in pattern matching – function guards , selective extraction , format assertions .
But just describing the ways in which Erlang has n’t hindered us is n’t very impressive – how has Erlang actually helped us ?
Well , we ’ve been able to implement our own home - grown distributed storage system in just a couple of months .
We ’ve also been able to create an entirely new design of webserver that makes writing truly RESTful webservices simple and quick .
We ’ve been able to troubleshoot problems by quickly opening shell connections to the running webservers and learning exactly what is going on .
We ’ve written lots of extra self - contained services that can export , import , analyze , and otherwise munge live data easily .
In short , we ’ve been able to iterate quickly over lots of proposed solutions to problems and choose based on experience , rather than weak assumptions and hearsay .
Or , maybe it ’s just that I work with an amazing team that ’s able to roll with punches quickly , and usually end up with a better solution in the end than the one we designed in the beginning .
Could be – I know this team is the most talented I ’ve met since college . 🙂
Sitting here almost eight months since starting Erlang full - time , and almost two years since picking it up for personal projects , I ’d say that I ’m here to stay for a while yet .
I doubt neither that there will be another language in the future that will steal my attention , nor that there are other languages I ’d choose for other types of projects .
But , for distributed web - based services today , Erlang has my vote .

The killings were recorded and posted on a website A Nepalese man and relatives of 12 others who were killed in Iraq four years ago are suing American firm KBR on charges of human trafficking .
The men were recruited in Nepal to work in a hotel in Jordan , but were later told they would have to work at a US air base in Iraq , their lawyers said .
Twelve of the men were kidnapped and killed by Islamic militants while being transported inside Iraq .
The 13th man was made to work against his will at the air base , lawyers said .
The execution - style killing of the hostages was recorded by the extremists and posted on a website .
The incident sparked riots in Nepal with angry demonstrators targeting a mosque , some government buildings and offices of employment agencies .
At least two people were killed in the protests .
' Passports seized '
The lawsuit filed in the US District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday alleged " that the illicit trafficking scheme ... was engineering by KBR and its subcontractor " , identified as Daoud & Partners .
The men , between the ages of 18 and 27 , were recruited " to work as kitchen staff in hotels and restaurants in Amman , Jordan " , said a statement from Cohen , Milstein , Hausfeld & Toll , one of the law firms handling the case .
Some recruitment agencies are blamed for sending workers to Iraq
But once they arrived in Jordan " they were not provided the expected employment , " the statement said .
Their passports were seized , and they were told they were being sent to Iraq " to provide menial labour " at the Al - Asad air base , it added .
" For 15 months , the 13th man Buddi Prasad Gurung , was held in Iraq against his will , before KBR and Daoud allowed him to return home to Nepal , " the statement said .
" It does n't appear that any of them knew they were going to Iraq , " news agency Reuters quoted attorney Matthew Handley as saying .
KBR would not comment on the lawsuit , but in a statement , the company said it " in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behaviour " .
Nepal banned its citizens from going to Iraq to work there in 2003 because of safety concerns .
But a lack of employment opportunities back home meant that private recruitment agencies continued to send Nepalese workers to Iraq through countries like Jordan and Kuwait .

What are these ?
The Air Force Cyber Command ( AFCYBER ) is a provisional unit that was being developed to take on the challenge of finding ways to use and safeguard Internet infrastructure during military conflicts .
AFCYBER was announced in 2006 and the unit , after some delays , was expected to stand up in October of this year .
That launch has now been put on hold while the Air Force 's new leadership reviews the plans .
Some analysts speculate that the program may be embroiled in a dispute over which branch of the military should have authority over cyberspace .
Some recent incidents of Internet espionage and electronic warfare illustrate the significant role that technology could play in future conflicts .
Last year , we wrote about hackers infiltrating Pentagon e-mail and executing coordinated attacks against government - run laboratories in the United States that conduct national security research .
The attacks are becoming more sophisticated , and the federal government has been slow to improve the security of its technological infrastructure .
There is also evidence that major world powers , particularly China and Russia , have already experimented with techniques for using hacking and denial of service attacks as offensive weapons .
China was accused of orchestrating a chain of five separate attacks last year and hackers in Russia have been accused of using technology against Estonia and Georgia .
It remains unclear whether these attacks were conducted with government backing .
There is a clear need to build an understanding of the technical capabilities possessed by foreign powers and rogue groups .
AFCYBER was gearing up to investigate a wide range of technologies , including potential tactical uses of botnets .
The command was operating under provisional status through the Air Force Network Operations Center , pending its full launch and a final decision about where it will be based .
Suspension of the program raises serious questions about whether the military plans to move forward with the launch .
NextGov revealed today that the Air Force has delayed roll - out until the command 's structure and objectives can be reviewed by the new Air Force chief of staff , General Norton A. Schwartz , who was sworn in yesterday .
NextGov says that the high visibility of AFCYBER , which was achieved through video advertisements , attracted the attention of high - ranking military brass who want the Navy to take a more prominent role in the effort .
The government has repeatedly touted AFCYBER as an important strategic investment in future cyber warfare , so it seems unlikely that they intend to completely walk away from the concept .
The real question now is how the military plans to structure its future web warrior command and which branch will be given the authority to direct its efforts and define its mission .

Arising out of the UK Climate Camp in August 2008 there has developed an interesting debate between Ewa Jasiewicz , an activist in Britain , and well - known radical columnist George Monbiot about the role of so - called “ state solutions ” to climate change .
Jasiewicz ’s article , published on the Guardian website [ i ] and entitled “ Time for a Revolution ” , was an attack on Monbiot for a “ controversial presentation [ at climate camp ] … in which he endorsed the use of the state as a partner in resolving the climate crisis ” .
It was also prompted by a debate between Monbiot and former National Union of Mineworkers ’ leader and head of Britain ’s Socialist Labour Party Arthur Scargill about what is more polluting : nuclear or coal energy .
Jasiewicz stated :
“ State solutions to the climate crisis were presented to us 10 years ago through the Kyoto protocol – what were they ?
To privatise the air we breathe and turn carbon emissions into commodities , to buy and sell atmospheric poison , to create a new market of trading in the means of ecological destruction .
It 's no wonder many at the camp reject state solutions to climate change .
“ The question is , who and under what conditions , controls decision making , and has climate - changing power ? ”
In response , Monbiot , in an article on his website [ ii ] wrote :
“ [ Jasiewicz ] claims to want to stop global warming , but she makes that task 100 times harder by rejecting all state and corporate solutions .
It seems to me that what she really wants to do is to create an anarchist utopia , and use climate change as an excuse to engineer it .
“ Stopping runaway climate change must take precedence over every other aim .
Everyone in this movement knows that there is very little time : the window of opportunity in which we can prevent two degrees [ Celsius ] of warming is closing fast .
We have to use all the resources we can lay hands on , and these must include both governments and corporations .
Or perhaps she intends to build the installations required to turn the energy economy around -- wind farms , wave machines , solar thermal plants in the Sahara , new grid connections and public transport systems -- herself ? ’’
There are some confused notions in these two articles , like the Kyoto protocol was a “ state solution to the climate crisis ” ( Jasiewicz ) and that the role of the state is to “ prevent the strong from crushing the weak ” ( Monbiot ) .
However , the basic point that both fail to comprehend is that we do need the wealth and resources that are currently monopolised by corporations to stop climate change , however what ’s needed is for that wealth to be torn from the hands of those corporations and put under popular control .
The reality is that no fossil fuel corporation can be convinced to stop expanding and making profits and instead invest its wealth in a wholesale conversion of its operations to a renewable energy - powered , sustainable industry .
At the same time no capitalist government is going to be either willing or able to constrain corporations ’ rights to make profits in order to drastically reduce emissions .
In other words , the only way we can make use of the massive corporate wealth that is n’t in the hands of the people is with a revolutionary struggle that institutes a government which acts in the interests of people and the planet and puts control of all sectors of the economy in the hands of ordinary working people .
The real question is what needs to be done to achieve this ?
There does not need to be a contradiction between what we call for today in terms of immediate measures to combat global warming and building the movement for revolutionary change .
Arguing for the nationalisation of polluting industries , to be placed under the democratic control of ordinary people , is essential to constructing a movement capable of halting climate change .
Market anarchy or a planned approach
Since the release of the interim Garnaut Review ( a report commissioned to recommend what policies are required by Australia to address climate change ) and the Australian federal Labor government ’s green paper on climate change , the focus of the debate has been almost solely on what is the best market response to global warming and how much “ government regulation ” is appropriate to guide this .
The role of the government is reduced to determining how much large corporations will be subsidised under an emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) .
On August 27 , 2008 , a report by the National Snow and Ice Data Center found that the amount of ice coverage in the Arctic was the second - worst on record ( the worst being last 2007 ) .[ iii ]
It stated : “ With about three weeks left in the Arctic summer , this year could wind up breaking that previous record ” . [ iv ]
There is now almost near certainty that the Arctic will be ice free in summer within five to 10 years . [
v ]
It is clear that we have reached a major tipping point in climate change , which indicates that we are already experiencing dangerous climate change .
As Dr Jay Zwally , glaciologist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , put it , “ the Arctic is often cited as the canary in the coal mine for climate warming … and now as a sign of climate warming , the canary has died . ” [ vi ]
NASA Climatologist
Dr James Hansen has concluded that a safe climate zone necessary to preserve the Arctic lies somewhere within the region of 300 to 325 parts per million ( ppm ) carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) atmospheric concentration .
However , we currently are sitting around 385 ppm.[vii ]
In short we need an urgent and immediate response to the crisis , one which relies on a centralised accounting and coordination of the activities of major polluting industries through the government and enforced by the state .
Market mechanisms , corporate handouts and government investment in false solutions like “ clean coal ” spell nothing less than the death of the liveable planet .
Cuba and Venezuela show us what is possible
Two examples illustrate what is possible when the primary sources of wealth are under popular control .
The first is Cuba , where in the space of 10 years it was able to effect an extraordinary transformation from a highly import - based and unsustainable agriculture and energy sector , to become the most ecologically sustainable country in the world .
With the advent of the film The Power of Community , a number of environmental activists have developed the perception that this transformation was merely initiated by the artificially imposed “ peak oil ” crisis that hit Cuba after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Because of the US - enforced and illegal economic blockade of Cuba , Cuba was forced to rely heavily on the Soviet Union as its primary trading partner .
As a consequence , 98 % of its oil and oil - based products came from the USSR .
After the fall of the Soviet Union , Cuba lost half its oil imports in two years .
Furthermore , 66 % of all its food was imported and agriculture operated along the “ Green Revolution ” model , whereby single monoculture crops where grown primarily for export , using high levels of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides to increase yield .
[ viii ]
The result was an enormous food crisis .
While Cuba ’s response included community initiatives to grow urban vegetable and fruit gardens , the biggest factor that enabled Cuba to rapidly overcome the crisis was the significant level of state ownership of resources and industry and the existence of a socialist government .
A very useful report conducted by the UK Institute of Science in Sustainability , “ Organic Cuba without Fossil Fuels ” , documents exactly how the government was able to drive the process of transformation . [ ix ]
Beginning with a nationwide call to increase food production by restructuring agriculture , the government redivided the land and gave control of that land to the community , to best determine how to respond to the community ’s food requirements .
One major initiative was in urban areas , where all sorts of land was given over by the government for food production , including old car parks , disused buildings , vacant lots , etc .
As a consequence 60 % of Cuba ’s fresh fruit and vegetables are grown in urban farms . [ x ]
But the government ’s role extended far beyond this .
It set up a seed bank in the cities to distribute seeds to urban farmers , it massively invested in biotechnology to develop increased food production without pesticides , and it even passed a law banning the use of pesticides . [ xi ]
As Cuban permaculturalist Roberto Perez pointed out in an interview with Green Left Weekly , no rapid solution to Cuba ’s crisis would have been possible without Cuba having control over the totality of it ’s resources .
“ When the revolution gained sovereignty over the resources of the country , especially the land and minerals , this was the base for sustainability .
You can not think about sustainability of your resources if they are in the hands of a foreign country or in private hands .
Even without knowing , we were creating the basis for sustainability . ” [ xii ]
The second example worth considering is Venezuela .
Venezuela is one of the major oil - producing nations in the world , being the fourth - largest exporter of oil to the United States .
Despite this , the country had high levels of poverty and extensive environmental destruction .
While Venezuela ’s oil industry was technically nationalised in the 1970s , PDVSA was the only state - owned oil company that ran at a loss .
This was primarily due to the fact that the profits of the company where being used to fatten the pockets of the bureaucrats who leached off the industry .
Since socialist president Hugo Chavez was elected in 1998 the government has taken back control of the oil industry and used the wealth from it to fund social programs aimed at alleviating poverty .
It has also been extremely conscious of reducing the country ’s dependence on the oil industry and of ending the legacy of putting the needs of the environment behind that of oil production .
This is indicated in the new United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) program , which includes a section on “ Defence of Nature ; Planned Production ” .
This states that “ the program of the PSUV proposes the preservation of nature and the planning of production for the satisfaction of collective necessities in harmony with the requirements of the ecosystem . ” [ xiii ]
In 2005 the Chávez government and the PDVSA oil company made the decision to eliminate lead - based petrol .
Since then , PDVSA has begun recuperating green areas , reducing emissions and cleaning up rivers and lakes . [ xiv ]
Under Mission Energy , some 53 million light bulbs in more than 5 million homes have been replaced with energy - efficient fluorescent bulbs [ xv ] , with the next step being to substitute almost 27 million inefficient incandescent light bulbs by energy - saving light bulbs in the official , industrial and commercial sectors .[ xvi ]
President Chávez has also announced plans for a wind farm to generate electricity on the Caribbean coast [ xvii ] and in April 2007 the government banned construction of all new coal mines on Indigenous land in the opposition - controlled , major oil - producing state of Zulia.[ xviii ]
While there are major restrictions on the Venezuelan government ’s ability to implement these plans , due to a corrupt bureaucracy within state institutions , it is clear that none of these things would be possible if the government did n’t have real control over the oil industry to be able to fund and enact these programs .
Nationalisation , a transitional demand
As socialists we recognise that the only way out of the mess of climate change is for the vast bulk of the economy to be put under public ownership and control , with the creation of a workers ’ government that can oversee a thorough and detailed process in which the entire community can have democratic control over how the economy is run and for what purposes .
However this does n’t prevent us advancing the demand for the nationalisation of strategic industries even before we reach that stage .
In fact this demand is extremely important for posing the possibility of working people having complete and democratic control over the wealth of society ( which after all was created by the labour of working people and has been stolen by a tiny number of capitalist owners ) , and building a movement that can win this .
Given the state of the crisis and the urgency with which we need to act , any effective program of action advanced by the environment movement to stop climate change must include the demand for nationalisation – that is to put the key energy - producing and energy - consuming industries , and other unsustainable industries , under public ownership .
But first we need to make it clear that we are n’t arguing for a public sector operating like the commercialised , profit - making enterprises we see all too often today .
Most of the public sector , if it already has n’t been sold off and converted into privately run companies , has been turned into more or less the same thing in preparation for the time when it becomes politically possible for governments to privatise it .
Second , the public sector under capitalism is run by a big bureaucracy that the people have no control over .
While we can vote for people to be in parliament who can introduce new laws , we do n’t have any say over who the state employs to implement those laws .
Not to mention the fact that the major parties in parliament are the representatives of big business and act to preserve profits .
This means that such a struggle for nationalisation needs to be accompanied with a push for real democratic control over how the public sector is organised .
What would real government action on climate change look like ?
Currently , governments in Australia , both state and federal , are n’t just sitting on their hands on climate change ; they are funding and pushing for the expansion of the very industries that contribute most to the problem .
So the question is , what kind of government response is needed to avert the catastrophe ?
Electricity sector
First it is essential that the electricity generation sector be put under public ownership , instead of sold off to private companies , as is being attempted by the New South Wales state Labor government .
The majority of Australia ’s greenhouse gas emissions come from coal - fired power generation .
In order to stop global warming we need to halt the construction of all new coal - fired power stations and effect a rapid conversion from coal to renewable energy , primarily wind and solar , within five to 10 years .
Yet this will be virtually impossible unless the government has complete control over the electricity sector .
Furthermore , a national network of publicly owned electricity generators would ensure that the electricity produced actually meets people ’s needs .
A board could be elected democratically by the people and given the task of drafting a plan to transform the sector to meet the needs of the environment .
This plan could be ratified by referendum and if those in charge fail to implement the necessary measures there should be the right to recall them .
The government could also set up programs to roll out energy - efficient light bulbs and whitegoods , and ban the selling of inefficient ones .
The government should adopt stringent limits on how much greenhouse gases private companies are allowed to emit and take serious measures to curb energy inefficiency .
If a company continues to break the rules it should be made clear that it will be nationalised .
Public transport and freight
In Victoria , the public transport system was sold off to the multinational company Connex under the Liberal government in the 1990s .
Connex ’s contract is due to expire next year , but despite the atrocious state of Melbourne ’s public transport system , the state Labor government is now toying with the idea of renewing Connex ’s contract . [ xix ]
A recent article in the Melbourne Age newspaper showed that there had been a 70 % increase in public transport use in last 10 years , but only a 9 % increase in services , and very few new services in peak hours . [ xx ]
Instead of re-nationalising the public transport system , the government is considering the construction of a new road tunnel at a cost of A$ 9 billion , and the introduction of “ congestion taxes ” and new tollways .[ xxi ]
Meanwhile the major “ City Link ” tollway nets the Transurban corporation $ 1 million a day ![ xxii ]
The federal government should nationalise Australia ’s vehicle manufacturing industry , and retool the factories to pump out new trams , trains and buses to provide the massive needed expansion of the public transport system and , if necessary , produce electric cars that can be plugged into grid for those who ca n’t access public transport .
A publicly run public transport system is essential for rapidly expanding public transport , so that we can take millions of cars off the road , while providing the necessary levels of alternative transport .
This must extend to rural areas and involve the development of high - speed , long - distance trains to drastically reduce need for carbon - intensive flying .
Another major task is the moving of freight .
It was recently revealed that the state government is planning to expand Victoria ’s roads to allow more “ B Triple ” trucks – three - carriage freight trucks .[ xxiii ]
Such a plan is ridiculous in the context of climate change , when what ’s needed is the development of a thorough system of freight - train lines to drastically reduce emissions .
Such railways can be electrified with renewable energy , which could cut emissions significantly .
Water
Another problem project of the Victoria Labor government is the $ 3 billion desalination plant , which will have its carbon emissions “ offset ” by ``clean coal ’’ and other “ clean ’ ’ energy sources , possibly from interstate .[ xxiv ]
The plant is being used to discourage people from installing rainwater tanks , and failing to introduce tighter restrictions on commercial irrigators who use up most of the state 's water . [ xxv ]
Australia is still in extreme drought , with constantly diminishing water supplies .
There is a threat to the survival of one of our most important water supplies – the Murray - Darling river system .
It was recently revealed in a report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that found that almost 2 gigalitres a year is consumed on Victorian farms each year .
[ xxvi ]
As the Age reported on August 28 , “ in total the Australian farming sector used 8521 gigalitres of water in 2006 - 07 , with nine out of every 10 litres used for irrigation . ” [ xxvii ]
To preserve future water supplies and the natural environment , it is essential that our water supply is completely publicly owned , and managed in a manner that responds to the needs of people , not of big business .
One major thing the government must do is take over the most water - consuming farms , particularly cotton and rice , and instead use the land to grow less water - intensive crops like hemp .
Instead , the government is unwilling to restructure the water allocation to irrigators to help save the Murray - Darling system .
For domestic urban water usage the government could set up a system to roll out free water tanks and fit grey water systems to each home .
There are also a range of big corporate industries like the aluminium industry , logging , coalmining etc. , which contribute enormously to climate change .
The basis of their profits are processes which are intrinsically harmful to the environment so it is essential for them to be put under public ownership .
Only by ensuring that the big industries are no longer run for profits , will it be possible to determine to what extent they are actually needed and to what degree their impact on the environment can be reduced .
Jobs versus the environment ?
The bulk of the industries that are the biggest polluters are simply going to have to be shut down , and no corporation is going to willingly accept such a proposition .
Furthermore , while some corporations are investing in renewable energy , what ’s needed is a massive government investment and commitment to renewable energy , and the direct conversion of the fossil fuel industry not just a gradual “ transition ” .
The socialist approach puts it clearly that it is n't about putting the environment ahead of jobs , but instead that the only way any sustainable industry can operate is with workers to run it .
It 's clear there is a huge pool of possible workers to fill jobs in new renewable and sustainable industries , but these workers will be thrown onto the scrap heap unless there is a government plan to utilise these workers and skill them to work in those industries .
The reality is that under capitalism big business regularly chucks workers onto the scrap heap , in order to preserve profits – just look at the 380 workers being axed from the Fairfax newspapers in Australia .
It ’s not like there is less news to cover !
Some right - wing unions , such as the Australian Workers Union , have been able to tap into this fear by workers that they will be left without jobs .
The radical environmental movement must make it clear that the only solution is the nationalisation of those industries which will have to be reorganised or phased out , to allow public boards to be established to plan the rapid industrial transition and retrain workers so that they can be ( voluntarily ) deployed where they are needed .
This is what happens in the public education sector .
What we propose also includes a huge investment in education and skills training – to re-skill workers in the fossil fuel industry to run solar thermal plants or build wind turbines etc .
There also needs to be serious investment in the research and development of more energy - efficient technology and renewable energy sources .
But it is clear that no demand for nationalisation can be won without a mass struggle of workers that forces the government to do so .
Furthermore we know that no industry can operate long term within a capitalist framework as a truly community - controlled public sector .
Whenever a private corporation thinks it can make a profit , there will be a push from our present capitalist governments to carve up the public sector and privatise it .
Despite the fact that these are necessary services and real public assets , wealth built up by the hard labour of working people , capitalism cares only about finding new areas it can take over and operate for profit .
If we win our demand for partial nationalisation , it would open the way for many more workers to comprehend the advantages of far wider ( and even complete ) public ownership of the economy and shift the struggle towards achieving real democratic control over entire industries .
Only when we have control of the gears , pedals and steering wheels of the economy will we have any real chance to steer us away from the brink of a climate catastrophe .

HUERFANO COUNTY — Mike Stetler is proud of his garden .
It took him months to get the lush jungle just right .
“ Beautiful , is n’t it ? ” he said .
A decade ago , the labor of planting would have been impossible for Stetler .
Strung out on Demerol , OxyContin , morphine and oxycodone , the pain - addled Navy veteran was , he says , “ a slobbering zombie , stupid and living in la-la land . ”
Since 2002 , though , when he started growing and smoking the medicinal marijuana he now tends so carefully , he has n’t touched a pill .
“ The pain is n’t all the way gone , but I can live again .
I can get out of bed .
The sun is shining on me again , ” he said .
“ See what God does ?
He gives us something beautiful to use .
This healing herb .
And what happens ? ”
What happened is sheriff ’s deputies landed a helicopter on his land , broke open two padlocked gates and ransacked his trailer , ripping a gaping hole in the roof .
They seized 44 marijuana plants and more than eight state - issued medical - marijuana cards that indicate other medical - marijuana patients have told the state he is their designated caregiver .
They left a search warrant hanging over Stetler ’s medical - marijuana sign .
Almost eight years after Colorado voters approved Amendment 20 , engraving in the Colorado Constitution the lawful use of doctor - recommended medical marijuana for those “ suffering from debilitating medical conditions , ” police and prosecutors zealously pursue medical - marijuana growers such as Stetler , citing everything from the fact that they just do n’t like the law to concerns about public safety and confusion over what the law allows .
The law is “ overly broad , ” “ a work in progress , ” “ vague ” and “ a mistake , ” according to cops and prosecutors along the Front Range , home to more than three - quarters of the state ’s 3,302 residents enrolled in the Colorado medical - marijuana registry program .
There are 12 states in the U.S. that have medical - marijuana laws .
Of the 10 with marijuana card systems , Colorado is the only state that does not issue caregivers like Stetler licenses that specifically allow for cultivation .
“ Marijuana cultivation is a violation of federal and state law .
Just because someone says ‘ medical marijuana ’ does n’t mean we automatically back off and we do n’t enforce the law , ” said Larry Abrahamson , district attorney for Larimer County , where more than 45 percent of felony marijuana cases in the past decade have involved growers , many with state - issued cards .
“ Just because we have Amendment 20 does not mean we have free marijuana for everyone . ”
Raid , but no charges
Tucked into a lonely corner of 7,755 - resident Huerfano County , Stetler has nursed 33 new marijuana plants from the sandy soil .
Good medicine , he says , squeezing sticky , stinky and crystallized buds atop listing 7 - foot stalks .
His plants are growing on private land miles from a paved road in two sheds posted with 13 state - issued medical - marijuana certificates that designate Stetler is now a licensed care giver for 13 patients .
His doctor has advised he needs 15 plants to alleviate his constant pain stemming from a 1990 car accident .
Since the raid more than a year ago , Huerfano County Sheriff Bruce Newman has not filed any charges or returned Stetler ’s plants .
No visits from police .
Not even a ticket or a letter .
Newman said he ’s waiting .
“ We want to see what happens with some of these other cases , ” said Newman , who suspects not all of Stetler ’s 44 plants were legal and has destroyed them .
“ There ’s a lot of legal stuff up in the air , and it ’s going to take judges making decisions to figure it out . ”
The amendment seems to be functioning for people who use and distribute medical marijuana .
Eleven storefront dispensaries operate openly in Colorado , some distributing medical marijuana to as many as 600 patients who need as much as an ounce of the weed a week .
More than 500 doctors have recommended marijuana , and the number of patients on the state ’s registry has almost doubled since January .
“ I ’d have to say it is working , ” said Denver attorney Warren Edson , who represents half of the state ’s dispensaries .
“ But the dispensaries are not cultivating , and there ’s a huge need .
The cultivation side is problematic . ”
Indeed , for the green - thumbed suppliers of the statewide demand for thousands of pounds of medical marijuana , life is not good .
While Amendment 20 outlines a host of protections for medical - marijuana patients and allows them to designate a caregiver , the law does nothing to address growers .
So though many medical - marijuana patients designate growers as caregivers , the marijuana farmers are subject to arrest - first , ask - if - it ’s - medical - later SWAT raids .
They face lengthy and costly legal battles , which , regardless of an acquittal , dismissal or conviction , end with dead marijuana plants .
“ The police are supposed to be protecting me from thieves and such , but they are the thieves , ” said Stetler , who is one of three designated caregivers in Colorado preparing a civil lawsuit demanding compensation for plants destroyed by police .
“ It ’s not right .
They are making up their own laws and mocking the state ’s laws they are supposed to be protecting .
They are mocking the voters they serve . ”
“ Where do they think all the medical marijuana for more than 3,000 patients comes from ? ” said marijuana farmer Chris Crumbliss , who has been raided twice in Larimer County despite possessing dozens of state - issued medical - marijuana cards from patients listing him as their primary caregiver .
“ Do they want one person growing for 50 people , or do they want 50 people growing on their own ? ”
Law rubs wrong way
For police , Amendment 20 conflicts with federal laws and long - held state laws prohibiting cultivation of marijuana .
Even worse , say police , Amendment 20 ’s requirement that all property and plants seized in a medical - marijuana investigation “ shall not be harmed , neglected , injured , or destroyed ” is unworkable .
( If a cop waters a marijuana plant , is she breaking the law ? )
And the notion that marijuana — which the federal government considers a “ Schedule I ” substance alongside PCP and methamphetamine — can be legal at all dismisses decades of law enforcement culture and ingrained drug war doctrine .
Larimer County ’s Jim Alderden is a folksy sheriff who refers to Amendment 20 as an “ ill - conceived law ” and aggressively pursues marijuana growers .
They may call themselves licensed caregivers , but he calls them “ dope dealers . ”
“ Wholesale drug dealers are hiding under the umbrella afforded them by the statute , ” he says .
“ These people are nothing more than dope dealers , and they are hiding under this thing , and we are not going to back off .
These people who say they are caregivers providing for 60 to 70 people are running the same sort of scam you see on the West Coast where people see a physician who is willing to prostitute themselves for money and say ‘ here ’s the dope . ’ ”
Scott Carr , the regional director for Colorado ’s THC Clinic in Wheat Ridge , disagrees with Alderden ’s assessment of doctors who recommend marijuana .
Carr says the doctors in his clinic care for their patients and advise the best treatment for their ailments .
“ We do a pretty extensive screening of medical history .
We get charts and copies of doctor notes , ” Carr said .
Jeff Sweetin , head of Denver ’s branch of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration , regularly hears growers pleading their product is medical marijuana .
When the operations “ reach into hundreds of plants and millions of dollars , that argument that they are immune because of state medical - marijuana laws is absurd , ” Sweetin said .
“ I think it was a mistake .
It ’s bad public policy , and it put cops in a terrible spot , ” Sweetin said of Amendment 20 .
“ The very term ‘ medical marijuana ’ does n’t hold much water .
I mean really , what kind of medicine do you smoke ? ”
Sweetin fields calls “ all the time ” from Colorado cops begging his help when a court orders the return of marijuana or growing equipment .
“ Ninety - nine times out of 100 , our answer is , ‘ This is not our problem to fix . ’
I feel for these guys and they are my friends and they are partners , but it is not the position of the DEA to rescue everybody from their state ’s legislation . ”
A need for clarity
If there ’s one thing cops , prosecutors , attorneys and growers agree on , it ’s that more work is needed to lift the fog surrounding Amendment 20 and its implementation .
How it ’s going to get done is the big question .
Last month , Crumbliss stood trembling with his arms held high in his front yard at 4 a.m. , his boxers pulled to his ankles , his head and face wrapped in a T - shirt , a laser - scoped assault rifle trained on his chest and his dogs howling from a shower of tear gas .
He kept saying one thing over and over : “ I have a license to grow medical marijuana . ”
The armored men behind the guns were Larimer and Boulder county sheriff ’s deputies in a multi- jurisdictional , predawn SWAT - team raid of three of Crumbliss ’ homes .
After months of investigation — which included no - subpoena - needed access to Poudre Valley Rural Electric Association electrical usage reports from Crumbliss ’ and neighbors ’ homes — the raid netted 200 marijuana plants and 25 pounds of cannabis .
Crumbliss and his wife , Tiffany , were arrested and charged with a host of felonies that could land them in prison for almost a decade .
It was the second time in two years Larimer County cops have raided the Crumblisses , who have never hidden their predilection toward medical marijuana .
“ I thought I was going to be executed , ” said Crumbliss , a father of two and a perpetually grinning marijuana farmer who holds more than 40 state medical - marijuana licenses from patients who list him as their primary caregiver .
“ I ’ve never had a felony in my life .
I preach love and compassion .
I really believe what I ’m doing is legal and I am following the letter of the law .
And it ’s an honor and a privilege to stand up for sick people who ca n’t stand up for themselves .
It might earn me a spot in jail , and it might earn me a place in heaven . ”
Sean McAllister , the attorney who represented Crumbliss against his previous and still - pending marijuana cultivation charges from 2007 , called Larimer County ’s “ smash and grab ” tactics “ the worst abuse I ’ve ever seen by police of the medical - marijuana law because they are arresting first and determining if it ’s medical later . ”
McAllister , the founder of Sensible Colorado , a nonprofit advocating for drug policy reform , said the writers of Amendment 20 made too many compromises and growers like Crumbliss are left in the law ’s “ gray areas . ”
“ You can smoke it .
You can dispense it .
But how are they supposed to grow it ? ” said McAllister , a Breckenridge attorney who specializes in medical - marijuana cases .
“ Unfortunately the Crumblisses are the guinea pigs who are going to have to test the legal status of Colorado ’s medical - marijuana laws . ”
Prosecutions increase
Larimer County , which medical - marijuana attorney Rob Corry calls “ the worst ” in its pursuit of medical - marijuana caregivers , is not alone in its hunt for marijuana farmers .
Across the state , prosecutors in recent years have pursued more cases than ever against growers who argue they are within the bounds of Amendment 20 .
Last year , prosecutors in El Paso , Jefferson , Denver and Larimer counties — home to nearly half the state ’s medical - marijuana patients — tried 72 felony cultivation cases , up from nine cases in 2000 .
Part of the issue is public safety , said Lynn Kimbrough , spokeswoman for Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey .
She explained a litany of potential hazards involving the unregulated business of marijuana growing operations : fire danger from high electrical use and indoor grow lamps , price gouging , the safety of the product and the potential dangers facing future residents of a house where marijuana was grown .
“ There is no mandate in our office to go out and aggressively prosecute caregivers or growers , but we are not going to look the other way , ” Kimbrough said .
“ I think ( district attorneys ) would welcome some more attention to this because there is a sense that there is some work that still needs to be done to clarify the process and perhaps regulate the business aspect and ensure the safety of the people for whom this law was meant to help . ”

Update :
We incorrectly reported that that Shaun Malone was found innocent of speeding .
As PressDemocrat.com reports , the trial is still ongoing and is scheduled to resume on October 3rd .
The judge " is expected to issue a ruling after hearing additional testimony in October , including from both sides ' experts . "
While an 11 - year old , Louisville , Kentucky boy is using a toy radar gun to get drivers to slow down through his neighborhood , the police are finding that real radar guns might not be a match for GPS -- at least not when contested in court .
According to a press release issued by Rocky Mountain Tracking , an 18 - year old man , Shaun Malone , was able to successfully contest a speeding ticket in court using the data from a GPS device installed in his car .
This was n't just any old make - a - left - turn - 100 - feet - ahead - onto - Maple - Street GPS ; this was a vehicle tracking GPS device -- the kind used by trucking fleets -- or in this case , overprotective parents .
The device was installed in Malone 's car by his parents , and the press release makes no mention if the teenager knew that the device was installed in his vehicle at the time .

No matter , because Malone knew by the time he had to show up in court to contest the speeding ticket for going 17 - mph over the posted 45 - mph speed limit .
While the police clocked him going 62 - mph , the GPS 's data in fact showed him driving at the 45 - mph speed limit .
In an initial trial - by - affidavit , Malone was found guilty of speeding .
GPS expert , Dr. Stephen Heppe wrote a report that essentially said that the GPS data was not accurate enough to contest the accuracy of the radar gun .
Malone appealed the decision and had his day in court .
At trial , things played out differently :
" However , when he took the stand to begin his testimony , Dr. Heppe corrected that written report , saying that the Rocky Mountain Tracking device was " very " accurate , to within a couple of meters on location and to within 1 mph on speed .
Dr. Heppe also pointed out that the GPS device released instantaneous data , and not data averaged over a distance . "
Needless to say , with Dr. Heppe 's revised testimony , Malone was found innocent of speeding .
Some 21 percent of those with salaries of $ 100,000 or more say they are living paycheck to paycheck , according to a recent survey conducted by CareerBuilder.com .
While experts are quick to acknowledge that high gasoline prices , the slumping housing market and a generally weak economy are weighing on consumers ' finances , they also agree that the general difficulty in making ends meet is also the result of persistently bad spending and saving habits that are now catching up with the spendthrift American .
" Unquestionably , more people are living paycheck to paycheck now than 12 months ago , ” says Ken Goldstein an economist at the Conference Board .
" Americans have never been big savers under any economic circumstance or condition . "
The amount of money Americans save has been declining for decades .
Most recently , the personal savings rate was 1.2 percent of after - tax income , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis .
A couple years ago , the rate was actually negative , meaning consumers were dipping into savings to cover expenses .
One - in - ten workers making more than $ 100,000 say they put no money in a savings account each month , according to the CareerBuilder survey .
( Calculate your savings rate vs. the national average . )
While recessions and inflation are inevitable , your personal balance sheet need not be perpetually red .
" The one thing you can control for a more secure long - term financial future is your savings and spending rate , ” said Alyce Zollman , a financial consultant at Charles Schwab .
Here are some tips to break out of the paycheck - to - paycheck syndrome .
Follow the Money
To cut down on unnecessary expenses , Zollman recommends tracking every dollar you spend for a month .
( Spending calculator . )
Use an online bank or create a spreadsheet to keep tabs and decide what expenditures you can do without .
For example , eliminating one night of dining out a month can free up $ 50 to $ 100 that can be saved or invested .
( Budget calculator . )
Save More Automatically
In addition to contributing to a 401 ( k ) or a similar retirement account , Ronald T. Wilcox , a business administration professor at the Darden School of Business and author of " Whatever Happened to Thrift ? " , suggests opening an account that automatically withdraws funds from your paycheck and into a high - interest savings account .
What 's more , since the best opportunity to save more money is when you get a raise , he recommends diverting any pay increase directly into a savings or retirement account .
Downsize
Stop trying to impress the neighbors .
Their fancy cars and large homes may look great on the surface , said Wilcox , but there 's a good chance there 's a lot of financing behind them .
Right now , consumers should be looking to lower their standard of living , he says , and begin living below that of their peers .
If you ’re looking to buy a home , Terry Fergus , president of FSM Capital Management recommends holding off on the purchase and rent instead .
( Use our calculator . )
Even in this market , he says , renting is cheaper than owning a home .
By waiting longer , you can save more money for a down payment and push it up to 25 - 35 percent of the purchase price .
Avoid Credit Cards
It ’s a no-brainer , but it needs to be mentioned .
Focus on lowering debt and stop adding to what you have .
“ Live off of what you have , ” said Fergus .
Do n't run up balances on credit cards by paying the minimum ; pay in full each month , avoiding costly interest and finance charges .
A number of loan calculators can help you track the costs .
One silver lining of living paycheck to paycheck might be learning to never fall into that rut again by continuing to save money .
" Once the economy does improve , and someday it will , " says Goldstein , " this will wake people up and make them realize we need to be saving more money . "

Americans must consider the terrible possibility that electing John McCain as president , and Sarah Palin as Vice - President , will result in a series of escalating confrontations with Russia over oil supplies in central Asia that will lead to a nuclear exchange .
In 1960 , Herman Kahn wrote On Thermonuclear War , and in 1962 , a follow - up , Thinking the Unthinkable , grim books about fighting a nuclear war with the Soviet Union .
The dangers of a nuclear war have receded from the public ’s mind since the fall of Soviet communism in 1989 .
But since the ill - advised invasion of South Ossetia by Georgian troops , and the swift response of Russia , the bellicose talk by American leaders means that the very real possibility of nuclear war must again be considered by every adult American .
Last week , in a clear warning to the United States , Russia flew nuclear - capable bombers to Venezuela .
The US , for its part , has sent naval vessels to the Black Sea , and is striving to make Georgia and Ukraine part of NATO .
The Bush administration has been pushing to place missile interceptor systems in Poland , on Russia ’s border .
Conservatives still shake their heads over the 1964 anti-Goldwater “ Daisy ” television commercial , which showed a girl counting petals from a daisy as a mushroom cloud appeared in the distance .
That commercial frightened Americans and helped elect Lyndon Johnson .
There is little doubt that John McCain is a hot - tempered man , given to volcanic bouts of profanity and anger .
It seems possible that his long captivity in Hanoi induced a form of “ frontal lobe disorder , ” a labile mood disorder characterized by impaired executive functioning , as well as disinhibition , emotional instability , aggression , irritability or impulsiveness .
He has made asinine jokes about bombing Iran , and bizarrely declared that “ we are all Georgians now . ”
Such a man , no matter his war service , is clearly unfit for the presidency .
Sarah Palin , an individual with no foreign policy expertise , has recently said that war with Russia may be necessary .
Such an idiotic statement should immediately disqualify her for the Vice Presidency .
Could America fight a nuclear war with Russia and survive ?
Consider the reality of such a war .
It would be nothing like the television show Jericho , or even , given the changes in America that have occurred in 50 years , like Pat Frank ’s book Alas Babylon .
Even if your town or city survived the immediate destruction , and the radioactive fallout ( dependent on prevailing wind conditions in the days and weeks after a nuclear strike ) , ask yourself how long would your community survive without electricity ?
There would be no food on the shelves at your stores after the first 24 hours of looting .
There would be no gasoline stations capable of operating pumps .
Major port facilities would be destroyed , or themselves without power .
There would be no oil or coal to run power plants , no trucks to deliver fuel .
There would be no money , other than cash you happened to have on hand .
It would be worthless .
Financial markets would be closed .
Computer screens would be dark .
Wall Street would almost certainly be destroyed .
Insurance companies , as well as pension funds , would instantly become matters of historical interest only .
There would be no medicine after on - hand supplies ran out .
Pharmacies would be looted clean of their stocks within days , if not hours .
Do any of you imagine that America as it is now would n’t degenerate into savagery , as marauding armed gangs searched with increasing desperation for horded canned goods ?
The police would be able to do little without gasoline , and most would seek , rightly , to protect their own families .
James Kunstler ’s recent book , A World Made By Hand , would be at best an idyllic fantasy .
Think Cormac McCarthy ’s The Road .
But worse .
Do you entertain ideas about being able to grow your own food ?
Who among you , even if you ’ve stocked seed and can grow enough food to last an entire year , would know how to harvest seed for the following year ’s crop ?
Do you know how to can and jar to last the winter ?
How much ammunition do you have with which to hunt ?
And what would you be hunting ?
For those who live up north how long could you survive a winter without electricity or heating fuel ?
Do you have abundant trees nearby to use as fuel ?
What about the second year ?
For those in the south , how would life be without air - conditioning ?
How will you water your food garden during hot summer months , and protect it from pests , animal and otherwise ?
Do you live in a remote area ?
After your small supply of fuel runs out , you will be cut off .
How long will you and your family last in those conditions ?
How long would your food stock really last ?
Do you live in a large city which was n’t hit ?
You will find yourself living through " Night of the Living Dead . "
Chaos will reign outside your apartment , and you can trust your last Starbuck ’s cup that no farmer will be bringing you food ; they ’ll be too busy themselves trying to survive .
Live on a high floor , without power or water ?
Good luck with that .
How many people have available , potable water ?
How would you guard against giardiasis and other contaminants ?
Even if you have water filters , how many extra canisters do you own ?
There would be no antibiotics after the first year .
No insulin for diabetics .
No medicines of any kind for the elderly .
No protection other than the most primitive against infections from cuts and other accidents .
No effective treatment for injuries .
No x-rays .
Glasses break ?
Tough .
How many shoes do you own ?
There wo n’t be any more coming .
Think .
We are no longer a pioneer people .
After three years , almost the entire population of the United States would be dead , if not from the initial effects of nuclear blasts , then from ensuing violence , disease , and starvation .
There would be a few survivors .
I would estimate less than 5 % of the population would have any hope of surviving beyond three years .
There would be a few , perhaps , of our “ leaders , ” who made it into their Cheyenne Mountain - type bunkers before the bombs hit .
The world they would emerge to “ rule ” would be a nightmare world .
The living would envy the dead .
For 7 years since the attacks of 9 - 11 , Americans have been told by their government to be afraid of “ Moslem terrorists . ”
We were bombarded with absurd color - coded “ threat levels , ” until we tired of the game .
Most thinking Americans have long realized that terrorists do not constitute a material threat to our way of life .
Possibly a bomb here , a plane there , maybe someday a hazmat attack or a small dirty nuke , but nothing that would seriously disrupt our nation ’s ability to survive .
A nuclear war with Russia is a very different matter .
If we are to be afraid of anything , that is what we need to be fear .
Loss of preeminence as an economic power , a Greater Depression , we can survive .
But a nuclear war we wo n’t .
The world is a very different place than it was even 20 years ago .
80 % of the world ’s petroleum is now controlled not by Anglo - American oil companies , but by state - owned oil firms , such as Gazprom in Russia , Pemex in Mexico , and Chavez ’s Venezuela .
Even these supplies are dwindling .
The fight in Georgia was not about nascent democracy , or even Saakashvili ’s ambition .
It was about control of oil being piped out of central Asia .
Securing supplies of oil will be the critical determinant of near - term foreign policy .
Our bid to control Iraqi oil has turned to dust , and any attempt to take over Iran ’s fields will prove to be madness .
Russia announced last week that any military action against Iran , whether by the United States , or Israel , will be “ unacceptable . ”
China also cannot be expected to stand by and have its oil supply , much of which now comes from central Asia and Africa , compromised .
Compounding the problem of peak oil and foreign control is the fact that the United States is now a beggar nation .
We have to borrow 2 billion dollars a day , over 600 billion dollars a year , just to fund our government .
Federal taxes collected from Americans go to pay the interest on the debt .
The recent bail - out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will add untold hundreds of billions to our debt .
It is by no means clear that foreign governments will continue to purchase our debt , particularly if the United States is using its military to seize foreign oil supplies .
This election is not about family values , or the color of Sarah Palin ’s lipstick or Barack Obama ’s skin .
It is about navigating our way through these treacherous minefields without finding ourselves at war with Russia .
There will be no “ renewed cold war . ”
This time around it wo n’t be about ideologies , it will be about resources .
Russia has lots of oil , and we do n’t .
Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico or ANWAR wo n’t change that reality .
War with nuclear - armed Russia is not something we can entertain .
Anyone who doubts Putin ’s seriousness over the oil issue can read his graduate thesis .
That paper was not written by a fool , and can be read here .
Do we really want the hot - tempered McCain , whose campaign chair is a paid lobbyist for Georgia , or the clueless Sarah Palin , sitting by the red phone , and by the nuclear football ?
The terrible game of " prisoner ’s dilemma " shown towards the end of the recent Batman film could become quite real if a hot war in the Caucasus or Black Sea breaks out .
Just as in the film Dr. Strangelove , which seems to us a comic relic of the cold war , both sides would find themselves pressured into a first strike , “ before the other guy does it . ”
With even a few ballistic submarines at its disposal , Russia would be able to inflict catastrophic damage to the United States .
We should not pretend that in 2009 or 2010 , we would survive such an attack .
Americans are no longer a self - sufficient people .
Without food and goods at the local Wal - Mart or minimart , without gas at the local Racetrak , we would perish .
I , like many readers of LRC , supported Ron Paul .
I watched the videos , I donated money to all his money bombs , I bought the book .
I know he has recently called for his supporters to vote for the third - party candidate of their choice .
In normal times I would agree .
But these are not normal times .
I think it imperative , and very possibly a matter of national survival , that Barack Obama , and not John McCain , becomes president .
Yes , it will mean higher taxes and boondoggle social programs and yes , he has called for more troops in Afghanistan and waffled on any number of key issues .
But Obama , or even Joe Biden , will be better able to act prudently in a time of crisis and not plunge our country into a war with Putin ’s Russia .
We should seek friendship with Russia , not war .
We need not fear Moslem terrorists .
But we should rightly fear an intemperate man like John McCain , and the clueless Sarah Palin .

CYNICISM WATCH ….
A couple of hours ago I suggested that maybe John McCain would try to postpone the first debate to October 2nd because that would then eliminate the vice presidential debate .
( So sad … . )
I thought I was just being hackishly cynical when I said that , but no : according to CNN , that ’s exactly what McCain is proposing .
The VP debate would then be “ rescheduled . ” ( Perhaps to November 5th , joked Dana Milbank . )
My lesson for the day :
No matter how hackishly cynical you think you are , you ’re no match for the hackish cynicism of the McCain campaign .
Although he works as a tour guide at a hotel in Tenby , Mr Hilling returned from work every day to his museum - piece cottage which was always in darkness until he struck a match to light the gas .
The thief , or thieves , was either very smart or very , very lucky .
The side door of the home in the hills of Encino was unlocked on the Saturday morning in late August .
The elderly owners were in a back room , otherwise occupied .
The maid had stepped out .
So the thief stepped in -- and made quick work of the wealthy real estate investors ’ multimillion - dollar art collection .
Marc Chagall ’s “ Les Paysans , ” gone .
Diego Rivera ’s “ Mexican Peasant , ” a blank spot on the wall .
Arshile Gorky ’s “ Cubist Still Life , ” ditto .
By the time the maid returned about an hour later , at least a dozen artworks -- frames and all -- had been stripped from the home .
A collection that took more than half a century to compile was dismantled in less than 60 minutes .
The anti-theft system , for whatever reason , did not prevent the heist .
Advertisement
“ Somebody did this very quickly , ” said Det. Donald Hrycyk of the Los Angeles Police Department ’s art theft detail .
Both art experts and authorities described the art theft as one of the largest in Los Angeles history .
The crime , which occurred Aug. 23 but was announced Tuesday , had the art world buzzing .
Police announced a $ 200,000 reward for information leading to the paintings ’ return .
But they would not elaborate on where the money came from , saying only that it was not a government source .
The LAPD statement on the incident referred to a single “ thief , ” but officials said they are not sure whether it was a lone suspect or a group .
They have not released the victims ’ names or the crime ’s location .
And they are struggling to put together a description of the suspect to help narrow their search for the paintings .

“ We try to gauge the sophistication of the thief , because it may give us an indication of whether [ the artwork ] will show up at a swap meet or a thrift shop , ” said Hrycyk , who has been investigating art thieves for 14 years .
“ Somebody may sit on it for a decade before trying to sell it overseas . ”
Each painting is worth at least six figures , some upward of $ 1 million , said Richard Rice , a senior consultant for 21 years at Gallerie Michael on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills , and the collection was on par with those of A - list Hollywood celebrities .
The stolen artworks include Emil Nolde ’s “ Figur mit Hund ” ( Figure With Dog ) , 1912 ; Lyonel Feininger ’s “ Fin de Seance , ” 1910 ; Chaim Soutine ’s “ La Vieille Dame au Chien ” ( Old Woman with Dog ) , 1919 ; Soutine ’s “ La Femme en Rouge ” ( Woman in Red ) , 1926 ; Kees van Dongen ’s “ Alicia Alanova , ” 1933 ; and Hans Hofmann ’s Untitled ( Blue Bottle ) , 1947 , authorities said .
“ A collection of this quality that is so specialized -- these people had a passion , ” Rice said .
“ They were collecting artwork that was to the left of center .
It was n’t mainstream .
Most people , if they have wealth and taste , they collect things that are in the mainstream : Renoir , Degas , maybe Salvador Dali . ”

Rice called the collection “ a rarefied group only sold at a small clique of galleries ” in New York , London , Vienna , Paris , Zurich or Geneva .
“ What these people collected was almost a subculture of the art world , ” he said .
Unlike their counterparts in New York , Rice said , Los Angeles collectors are more private .
With a few exceptions , such as real estate mogul Eli Broad , L.A. collectors tend not to publicize , lend or show their paintings .
“ These are not people who open up their doors and allow the public to come in , ” Rice said .
“ It ’s just shocking that something like this would happen .
I was saddened that someone could build such a collection and in a matter of minutes it could be gone . ”
The big question is what will happen to the stolen art next .
Because of the pieces ’ estimated worth , the works will be difficult to sell , said the LAPD ’s Hrycyk .
Unlike cheaper artwork , he said , “ when you get into this range , most people who want to buy art want to know the provenance of the piece . ”

If potential customers or auction houses check the artworks ’ history , they will find that Hrycyk flagged all of them as stolen in the Art Loss Register and in the FBI and Interpol stolen art files .
The FBI estimates that art theft is a $ 6 - billion - a - year global industry .
Chris Calarco , a supervisor with the agency ’s L.A. office , said that art crimes are on the rise and that the recovery rate is less than 5 % .
The Art Loss Register lists 177,000 missing or stolen collectibles , and of those , 491 are from California .
Most come from residences ( 236 ) compared to art galleries and other businesses ( 120 ) , in keeping with national trends .
The most frequently stolen artist : Picasso , mainly because his name and styles are so famous , said Christopher A. Marinello , executive director and general counsel for the Art Loss Register in an interview from the register ’s London office .

But thieves also target paintings by lesser - known artists , thinking they will be easier to sell , Marinello said .
He called the paintings taken from Encino last month “ a very high - end collection . ”
The approach largely depends on the thief .
Common thieves often bypass art for electronics or jewelry , police said , or stumble onto a masterpiece and try to unload it quickly , tipping off investigators .
More sophisticated thieves target museums or high - end collections looking for specific paintings , Marinello said .
They then sell the paintings to other collectors or criminal gangs specializing in pilfered artwork .
Criminals trade the artwork on an international black market , using it as collateral for laundering money , trading weapons and drugs .
Advertisement
Either the works are “ found very quickly within the first few months or a year , or they go underground and it may take a generation for them to resurface , ” Marinello said .
Last year , his office helped a collector recover a $ 1 - million Fantin - Latour still life stolen from the collector ’s Connecticut home while he was on vacation in Italy , Marinello said .
A handyman had allegedly stolen and sold the painting for $ 500 to a local consignment shop .
LAPD officials declined to provide details about the couple , saying that they were wealthy and elderly and that officials did n’t want to expose them to the publicity .
Authorities would not say whether the paintings were insured .
The last high - profile art heist in L.A. occurred two years ago when a cat burglar stole an Edgar Degas painting along with jewelry and other valuables during a string of robberies mostly in the San Fernando Valley .

Authorities later found the painting in a storage locker , where the burglar was hiding it .

Times staff writer Richard Winton contributed to this report .
The city closed the failing Dodge Elementary School , for example , in 2002 and reopened it as an academy where candidates for advanced degrees in education work in classrooms under master teachers while studying at a local university .
Mr. Obama visited the school in 2005 , liked what he saw and now proposes to create 200 such teacher residency programs nationwide .
The goal , he says , would be to turn out 30,000 teachers a year to work in the toughest schools .
Mr. Obama ’s views have drawn heavily from a cast of experts who helped mold the Chicago experience .
Strategies for overhauling failing schools have come from Arne Duncan , who as chief executive of the Chicago public schools led the turnaround efforts .
The senator derived his views on early childhood education in part from the work of a Nobel Prize - winning economist based in Chicago .
The scope of Mr. Obama ’s plan has impressed many educators , but not everyone .
Michael J. Petrilli , a former Education Department official under Mr. Bush , said Mr. Obama ’s plan was more comprehensive than Mr. McCain’s .
“ That ’s because Obama is proposing what somebody called a Christmas tree of new programs , ” Mr. Petrilli said .
“ McCain is suggesting a couple of new things , but does n’t think Washington should spend more on education than we already are . ”
Mr. Obama ’s interest in education extends back to his work as a community organizer here in the mid-1980s .
In his memoir , “ Dreams From My Father , ” he describes a school system plagued by textbook shortages and teacher strikes .
He carried those experiences with him to Harvard Law School , where he took courses on school issues taught by Christopher Edley Jr .
“ Barack became committed to the notion that progress in school reform ca n’t come through volunteerism and professional aspiration alone , ” said Mr. Edley , now dean of the law school at the University of California , Berkeley .
“ It has to be undergirded with a legal and regulatory structure that rewards success and goes after failure . ”
Mr. Obama immersed himself in education issues after his return to Chicago , where he began lecturing at the University of Chicago Law School and joined the boards of two education foundations .
Every war has a story line .
World War I was " the war to end all wars . "
World War II was " the war to defeat fascism . "
Iraq was sold as a war to halt weapons of mass destruction ; then to overthrow Saddam Hussein , then to build democracy .
In the end it was a fabrication built on a falsehood and anchored in a fraud .
But Afghanistan is the " good war , " aimed at " those who attacked us , " in the words of columnist Frank Rich .
It is " the war of necessity , " asserts the New York Times , to roll back the " power of Al Qaeda and the Taliban . "
Barack Obama is making the distinction between the " bad war " in Iraq and the " good war " in Afghanistan a centerpiece of his run for the presidency .
He proposes ending the war in Iraq and redeploying U.S. military forces in order " to finish the job in Afghanistan . "
Virtually no one in the United States or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) calls for negotiating with the Taliban .
Even the New York Times editorializes that those who want to talk " have deluded themselves . "
But the Taliban government did not attack the United States .
Our old ally , Osama bin Laden , did .
Al - Qaeda and the Taliban are not the same organization ( if one can really call al - Qaeda an " organization " ) , and no one seems to be listening to the Afghans .
We should be .
What Afghans Say
A recent poll of Afghan sentiment found that , while the majority dislikes the Taliban , 74 % want negotiations and 54 % would support a coalition government that included the Taliban .
This poll reflects a deeply divided country where most people are sitting on the fence and waiting for the final outcome of the war .
Forty percent think the current government of Hamid Karzai , allied with the United States and NATO , will prevail , 19 % say the Taliban , and 40 % say it is " too early to say . "
There is also strong ambivalence about the presence of foreign troops .
Only 14 % want them out now , but 52 % want them out within three to five years .
In short , the Afghans do n't want a war to the finish .
They also have a far more nuanced view of the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
While the majority oppose both groups - 13 % support the Taliban and 19 % al - Qaeda - only 29 % see the former organization as " a united political force . "
But that view does n't fit the West 's story line of the enemy as a tightly disciplined band of fanatics .
Whither the Taliban
In fact , the Taliban appears to be evolving from a creation of the U.S. , Saudi Arabian , and Pakistani intelligence agencies during Afghanistan 's war with the Soviet Union , to a polyglot collection of dedicated Islamists to nationalists .
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar told the Agence France Presse early this year , " We 're fighting to free our country .
We are not a threat to the world . "
Those are words that should give Obama , The New York Times , and NATO pause .
The initial invasion in 2001 was easy because the Taliban had alienated itself from the vast majority of Afghans .
But the weight of occupation , and the rising number of civilian deaths , is shifting the resistance toward a war of national liberation .

No foreign power has ever won that battle in Afghanistan .
War Gone Bad
There is no mystery as to why things have gone increasingly badly for the United States and its allies .
As the United States steps up its air war , civilian casualties have climbed steadily over the past two years .
Nearly 700 were killed in the first three months of 2008 , a major increase over last year .
In a recent incident , 47 members of a wedding party were killed in Helmand Province .
In a society where clan , tribe , and blood feuds are a part of daily life , that single act sowed a generation of enmity .
Anatol Lieven , a professor of war at King 's College London , says that a major impetus behind the growing resistance is anger over the death of family members and neighbors .
Lieven says it is as if Afghanistan is " becoming a sort of surreal hunting estate , in which the U.S. and NATO breed the very terrorists they then track down . "
Once a population turns against an occupation ( or just decides to stay neutral ) , there are few places in the world where an occupier can win .
Afghanistan , with its enormous size and daunting geography , is certainly not one of them .
Writing in Der Spiegel , Ullrich Fichter says that glancing at a map in the International Security Assistance Force 's ( ISAF ) headquarters outside Kandahar could give one the impression that Afghanistan is under control .
" Colorful little flags identify the NATO troops presence throughout the country , " Germans in the northeast , Americans in the east , Italians in the West , British and Canadians in the south , with flags from Turkey , the Netherlands , Spain , Lithuania , Australia and Sweden scattered between .
" But the flags are an illusion , " he says .
The UN considers one third of the country " inaccessible , " and almost half , " high risk . "
The number of roadside bombs has increased fivefold over 2004 , and the number of armed attacks has jumped by a factor of 10 .
In the first three months of 2008 , attacks around Kabul have surged by 70 % .
The current national government has little presence outside its capital .
President Karzai is routinely referred to as " the mayor of Kabul . "
According to Der Spiegel , the Taliban are moving north toward Kunduz , just as they did in 1994 when they broke out of their base in Kandahar and started their drive to take over the country .
The Asia Times says the insurgents ' strategy is to cut NATO 's supply lines from Pakistan and establish a " strategic corridor " from the border to Kabul .
The United States and NATO currently have about 60,000 troops in Afghanistan .
But many NATO troops are primarily concerned with rebuilding and development - the story that was sold to the European public to get them to support the war - and only secondarily with war fighting .
The Afghan army adds about 70,000 to that number , but only two brigades and one headquarters unit are considered capable of operating on their own .
According to U.S. counter insurgency doctrine , however , Afghanistan would require at least 400,000 troops to even have a chance of " winning " the war .
Adding another 10,000 U.S. troops will have virtually no effect .
Afghanistan and the Elections
As the situation continues to deteriorate , some voices , including those of the Karzai government and both U.S. presidential candidates , advocate expanding the war into Pakistan in a repeat of the invasions of Laos and Cambodia , when the Vietnam War began spinning out of control .
Both those invasions were not only a disaster for the invaders .
They also led directly to the genocide in Cambodia .
By any measure , a military " victory " in Afghanistan is simply not possible .
The only viable alternative is to begin direct negotiations with the Taliban , and to draw in regional powers with a stake in the outcome : Iran , Pakistan , Russia , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan , China , and India .
But to do so will require abandoning our " story " about the Afghan conflict as a " good war . "
In this new millennium , there are no good wars .
Ed Hochuli Email
, in his 19th year as a referee , blew the whistle that was heard ' round the NFL in a call that cost the San Diego Chargers a victory against the Denver Broncos .
The call was botched when Bronco 's QB Jay Cutler had the ball slip off his hand in San Diego territory , bouncing off the grass and into the arms of San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins .
Hochuli ruled it an incomplete pass instead of a fumble , allowing the Broncos to keep the ball and then score the winning points .
Hochuli has since been flooded with hate email and has issued a response :
I 'm getting hundreds of emails – hate mail – but I 'm responding to it all .
People deserve a response .
You can rest assured that nothing anyone can say can make me feel worse than I already feel about my mistake on the fumble play .
You have no idea . . .
Affecting the outcome of a game is a devastating feeling .
Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably .
Although it does no good to say it , I am very , very sorry .
Ed Hochuli
The NFL Referees Association is standing behind Hochuli .
" No one feels worse about this than Ed , but like the coaches and players in our high - speed game , mistakes will occur , " NFLRA executive director Tim Millis said in a statement .
" Warcarting : when wardriving , warwalking , warflying , warrocketing , warballooning , warbiking , and warboating are just not good enough . "
" You 've been wardriving , but have you ever gone warcarting ? "
" Warcarting : because wardriving is so 2000 , and warflying is so 2002 . "
" Warcarting : the hobo 's approach to wireless communications interception . "
" Warcarting : wardriving on a budget "
To understand the Warcart requires one understand a bit of history first .
Wardriving , that is , driving with a laptop computer and tracking WiFi access points , first became popular around 2001 .
Within a short time span , people invented warwalking , and millions flocked to walk the streets with a laptop and WiFi card in hand .
Then the craze really took off when someone flew a Cessna airplane with a laptop and became the first warflyer .
Within no time at all , the press and every tech blog on the internet was covering the latest war - something .
There was warrocketing , warballooning , warbiking , and warboating .
There were talks and seminars .
News stories and blog posts .
Television reports and radio shows .
All about the latest in WiFi tracking .
It soon became apparent to the larger community that most of these methods are highly elitist .
Here are car - driving , personal - plane - owning , leisure - hot - air - ballooning , yachting aficionados armed with laptop computers .
What the world needed was a low - cost , yet powerful alternative .
And thus , mostly as a joke and for reasons that would have been disclosed ( if it was n't blocked ) in this talk at Defcon 16 , the Warcart was born .

Can You Sniff It
Warcart Features
The Warcart is more than a WiFi sniffer .
It is a complete wireless communications interceptor built on top of an abandoned shopping cart found in the streets .
The above graphic shows the key features of the Warcart .
Here is a listing of its capabilities :
1 ) WiFi Sniffing .
With two high - gain WiFi antennas , the Warcart can pick up even the faintest of signals .
Software ( Kismet ) running on one of the laptops records these signals to an external hard drive .
2 ) Cordless Phone Recording .
A powerful 900 MHz antenna and radio scanner can pick up cordless telephone conversations and record them to one of the laptop 's hard drives .
The obnoxious - mode switch can also switch the live conversation over the PA speaker , ensuring everyone in the vicinity will hear the conversation .
3 ) USB Flash Drive Dropper .
It is old news , now , that a U3 flash drive can be used to take over someone 's computer ( http://wiki.hak5.org/wiki/USB_Switchblade).
One hit of a button on the control panel and several such drives can be dropped .
This is the perfect tool to use while taking the Warcart into the office around some cubicles .
Someone finds a " lost " flash drive , and he cannot resist plugging it into his machine .
4 ) Police Communications Monitoring .
With a device like the Warcart , it should be not surprising to have an encounter with the authorities .
Indeed , it may be troubling if a device such as the Warcart were allowed in the streets without an officer questioning its safety and legality .
With the onboard police scanner , however , one can be attune to any intervention before it happens .
5 ) Sentry - Gun-Style Smoke - Grenade Launcher .
Courtesy of the kind folks at http://www.keepshooting.com/, the Warcart is equipped with a detachable launcher that emits smoke grenades .
These canisters are harmless , but provide a thick smoke for hiding the Warcart 's movement .
The launcher is attached to a custom - built pan and title mechanism that is operated by a joystick .
[ note that actual use of this feature is only legal in emergency maritime operations ]
6 ) General - Coverage Radio Snooping .
The Warcart is equipped with a standard radio scanner .
This can pick up most security , emergency services , private operations ( handheld walkie - talkies ) , etc .
7 ) Bright Lights .
The Warcart features a 2 - million candle - power spotlight , a halogen " intimidator light " that illuminates the shopping cart , and a neon lamp .
8 ) Loud PA Speaker .
For playing live or recorded radio communications , or music .
A microphone allows the operator to make announcements .
The system works quite well for stopping traffic and clearing pathways on busy sidewalks .
9 ) Extra Space .
There is still enough room within the cart for groceries .
Crowds of people follow and watch the Warcart near Harvard Square ( above ) .
The control panel ( above ) features two IBM Thinkpad laptops , a switchbox to control the lights , horn , and flash - drive dropper , a joystick to control the pan / tilt mechanism , an antenna selector , a radio scanner , and a key - switch to turn the Warcart on / off .
The Warcart has a detachable smoke grenade launcher .
The above image shows one of the grenades creating a smoke - screen at night .
It is glowing because the interior halogen " intimidator light " is on .
The smoke grenade launcher is especially useful when the Warcart and its operator are in pursuit .
The two - million candle - power headlamp illuminates deep into the night .
The waterjet - machined pan / tilt assembly has a quick - release mount to allow one to alternate between a highly - directional WiFi antenna and a smoke grenade launcher .
Interior lights add to the intimidation factor of the Warcart .

Comics With Problems
Presents the first of a two part series entitled
" Dick Hafer was an asshole " Celebrating the self - titled Comics Commando Who was Dick Hafer and why does he deserve two issues of Comics With Problems ?
The answer is he deserves more .
Hafer is a favorite of the site .
He 's dead , too .
Anyway , here 's a panel : Equiped with a style that could have played well in Mad or even Playboy , Hafer was the right - wing 's Jack Davis : a man who could , and did , lampoon any chosen target of what one could tent together as " Republican Interests " .
Gays , Hippies , Abortion , Ted Kennedy , the National Education Association , all sorts of terrible demons .
But for everything he hated , he sure seemed fixated on talking - at length - about the nasty stuff .
What would a psychologist say ?
We decided to jump right off with his most offensive work .
But it 's great reading too , obsessed with sodomy , urine , masturbation , all the x-rated ideas .
But be forewarned :
These comics were not intended for you .
No .
In the world of pitching and catching , this is something intended for the other team .
Reading these pages is like jumping into a bizarro world of bent pent - up pop-culture where the wrong is right , the shirt and haircut does n't match , and most of the food shopping is done in bulk through QVC .
Full of religious radio , weekly gun rallies , dittoheads , the 700 club , casserole potlucks ...
There are tops and bottoms to this discussion , clearly , and this comic was intended for the humans over the homos .
We can't even type the title of what we 're about to present without laughing a bit .
But that 's what Hafer fans lovingly refer to as " that ol ' dick magic " .
Dick Hafer really was that sort of an asshole .
Anyway ...

Raw Story nominated for online journalism award
RAW STORY is proud to announce that its investigative news series " The Permanent Republican Majority , " conducted and penned by Larisa Alexandrovna Muriel Kane and Lindsay Beyerstein , has been nominated for an online investigative journalism award by the Online News Association .
RAW STORY 's investigation , " The Permanent Republican Majority " series , blew open details of the GOP 's involvement in the arrest and imprisonment of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
Recently , the involvement of former Bush political advisor Karl Rove in the prosecution of Siegelamn was raised by the House Judiciary Committee in its debates on holding him in contempt for refusing to testify .
The committee wishes to question Rove about the case .
Many thanks to all our readers and donors who make this type of reporting possible .
Your continued support is greatly appreciated .
The winners will be announced on Sept. 13 during a Washington , D.C. dinner banquet .
In July , Google released Lively , a " Second Life in the browser " plug - in that lets anyone embed a basic 3D chat realm on a website or blog .
We strolled through Google 's new social world back then and found that , possibly as a result of the " 20 percent time " Google allows employees to spend on projects like this , Lively seemed to be 20 percent done .
Now , a month later , we took another look to see if Lively is living up to its name .
For those who have n't experienced it yet , Lively is the search giant 's attempt to bring the personalization and interactivity of a 3D virtual realm into the browser .
Marketed under a wonderfully catchy slogan — " Create an avatar and chat with your friends in rooms you design " — Lively runs only via a plug - in on Windows Vista / XP in IE or Firefox .
Users are able to customize their appearance by building a character using premade components , and web site owners can create their own room , embed it in their site , and , ideally , use it as a sort of virtual community .
Simple blog comments and smiley faces may have seemed limiting to someone at Google , and apparently a full 3D worlds with avatars , text bubbles , and interactive environments seemed like the next logical step .
As it 's a Google product , Lively netted the typical press attention from the usual outlets ( ahem ) , and some sites embedded one of Lively 's launch rooms .
But , from what we can tell , that 's about as far as it went .
There does n't seem to be much activity in most of the rooms we checked out over the past week ; besides the obligatory rooms like " Sexy Babes Club , " most of the new rooms listed at Lively 's site do n't claim more than double - digit visitors .
Outside of following links from Lively 's product page , we were n't able to find Lively rooms being used in sites or blog posts .
So what 's wrong ?
Is the web just not ready to embrace interactive realms where commenters can yell and wrestle each other while hiding behind animated 3D avatars ?
The more likely answer is that Lively 's growth is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
It was released under Google 's disclaimer of being a " 20 percent project , " but Lively is an ambitious project that targets unproven interactive web technology .
Google obviously knows it needs to build a community that can help it figure out how a rich , web - based interactive environment like this should operate , but Lively is extremely unpolished and buggy , so even early adopters seem to be passing it by .
Lively is in a digital chicken versus egg conundrum : it needs users to direct its improvement , but it 's currently in such a rough state that it frightens away users .
Considering its potential for monetization , this probably is n't a project that Google will simply give up on .
3D environments have been a big hit in gaming , and Google is the obvious candidate to bring the technology to the web and turn it into a money maker .
It is n't hard to imagine video ads playing on the wall of a blog 's Lively room while visitors chat about the latest post .
Google needs to do a lot of work and UI improvements , though , if Lively is going to pioneer that future for the web .
The American financial system was shaken to its core on Sunday .
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. faced the prospect of liquidation , and Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to be sold to Bank of America Corp .
The U.S. government , which bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac a week ago and orchestrated the sale of Bear Stearns Cos. to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in March , played much tougher with Lehman .
It refused to provide a financial backstop to potential buyers .

JODHPUR : One hundred and forty - seven dead , over 60 injured and hardly a drop of blood .
All it took was some unruly people jumping the queue and some furiously whispered rumours of a bomb going off , to leave this deathly trail .
( Watch )
It was not even dawn .
Over 10,000 had turned up at the Chamunda Devi temple in Jodhpur���s Mehrangarh Fort for a darshan of the goddess .
The temple gates had opened earlier than usual on Tuesday morning , at 3.45 am .
Things went smoothly for about two hours .
Then , suddenly , some people began pushing forward .
A barricade broke , opening up more space on the 8 - ft - widepath .
Seeing the widened approach , people began jumping the queue , and suddenly everything started going wrong .
A few people fell down and were crushed under the feet of rushing devotees .
The news , as it trickled down , got twisted .
Someone mentioned a bomb , and all hell broke loose .
Panic - stricken people started running in the opposite direction , pushing , trampling .
A toll that may have been contained to single digits kept shooting up with every push , every desperate shove .
While the death toll from hospital sources and other eyewitnesses totalled 147 , authorities put it at 140 .
Many suffocated to death while standing in the queue .
����� �Around 80 % of the people died on the spot .
We just have three orthopaedic cases of the 45 persons admitted at the hospital here , ������ said Nitin Negi , a doctor on duty at the city���s Mahatma Gandhi Hospital .
A while back I had a bank alt that I needed to level to 35 to get Alchemy and Leatherworking up to a more respectable level .
Along the way , I figured I ’d make another low budget twink with relatively easily obtainable items .
I did n’t really like the 30 - 39 bracket much , and now that level 30 players have mounts , I believe that will have changed the entire dynamic of the game .
I played this bracket for a while , and will probably leave my hunter where he is , but , I doubt I ’ll play much in this bracket .
Here are my notes for making a budget twink hunter in the 30 - 39 bracket .

In this bracket , I dislike guns .
You ’re a lot more powerful than you had been in the 29 bracket where guns do make a lot of sense .
There ’s nothing more frightening to the defenders in the flag room to hear the boom of a gun as it hits one of them .
They believe the entire team is on the way .
With a bow , you can catch people offguard because they never hear their teammate get hit .
As for pets , I ’ve seen a few and it depends on what type of player you are .
For Defense , I like a cat .
They have a little better stealth detection and parked in the right place , rogues can not get by .
For FC / EFC support , I like boars for their charge & stun .
Scorpions are interesting with their poisons .
Cats also are very good for targeting casters with as they have a very fast attack speed and that interrupts casting .
Ravagers do pure DPS in this bracket and since you do n’t need to worry about taking aggro from a tank , killing your target fast is a great benefit .
I chose a cat for the Caster Interrupting and the increased stealth detection as I run D quite a bit more frequently than I run O .
In WoLK , there will be a number of different pet skills added and the entire pet mechanics are going to be changed , so , you might find yourself getting a new pet when WoLK is released .
Remember to put your [ item ] 29534 [ /item ] or [ item ] 29536 [ /item ] on your legs before you equip them .
Again , there are much better items that you can get , but , the goal here was to create a bank alt / transmuter that I could also run battlegrounds with .
Will America close the books on the Bush dynasty when George W. leaves office in January ?
Or is it still possible that his younger brother , Jeb , will rise from the ashes of the second Bush presidency -- perhaps even as part of the Bush clan ’s ongoing duel with the House of Clinton ?
While one should never say never in politics , such a rematch in 2012 or 2016 is beginning to seem extremely unlikely .
Even Jeb himself apparently regards prospects for a Bush resurrection as largely hopeless .
To understand why , one needs to look more closely at the relationship between George and Barbara Bush ’s two eldest sons .
George Walker , 61 , and John Ellis Bush ( who turns 55 Monday ) have long been their family ’s principal rivals , and by various accounts they are not close .
In 2004 , George W. told Brit Hume of Fox News that he and Jeb speak by phone only about once a month .
The competition is not always obvious because of the way George and Jeb function as allies when the family enterprise ’s collective interests are at stake , as they did in the 2000 Florida recount .
But as a factor in George ’s own drive to succeed , sibling rivalry has been second only to his relationship with his father .
And in a way , it is the primary expression of it , because the ultimate stake in the rivalry was inheritance of their father ’s mantle .
George W. was always keenly aware , according to friends and family members , that Jeb was viewed the smarter of the two .
Jeb , for his part , has always known that the cousins , aunts and uncles like Junior better .
Jeb is relentlessly focused , introverted and serious .
Though his political future was regarded as the most promising by the rest of the family , he has never had the glib banter or the gift for friendship of his older brother .
Advertisement
Asked in 1987 how the brothers were different , Jeb responded : “ George is the tightest with his money , that ’s for sure .
He ’s always been very careful .
Marvin [ the youngest brother ] is the most personable , and he has this great sense of humor .
I ’m the serious one . ”
Jeb in many ways behaves more like a firstborn than a younger sibling .
He was born into a more settled and established family that had moved beyond the crisis of their sister Robin ’s death from leukemia , an event that profoundly affected George .
Jeb faced no apparent learning disabilities or struggles with self - control of the kind his older brother did .
But somehow Jeb absorbed George ’s portion of care , while George pranced off with Jeb ’s share of worldly ease .
Where George slacked , Jeb drove as hard as he could .
Jeb has never played the game of diminishing expectations -- or many other games either .
Though both brothers tried to follow their father ’s example in various ways , Jeb ’s emulation appeared , for many years , far more successful .
Jeb married young , as his father did , and got through the University of Texas in just 2 1/2 years .
( Dad made it through Yale in three . )
Married at 21 , he was a father at 23 .
While George was floundering in the oil business , drilling dry holes back in the town where they grew up , Jeb was getting ahead in banking and real estate .
In choosing Florida over Texas , he followed their father ’s script more cleverly .
Miami in the early 1980s offered the kind of opportunity that Midland , Texas , had for his father in the 1950s .
Soon after his arrival there , Jeb tellingly described Miami as “ the frontier ” in relation to Texas , which had in the intervening decades become a place where social snobbery and established hierarchies made it hard for his wife , a Mexican immigrant , and his family to fit in .
Advertisement
Florida in the 1980s , like Texas in the 1960s , was a Democratic state poised to turn Republican , with a group of feverish conservatives -- the Cuban exiles -- leading the charge .
Like his dad and unlike his impatient older brother , Jeb was happy to endure a dry policy discussion and a political slog .
Rather than start with Congress , he ran in 1983 for Dade County Republican Party chairman , a position in which he served as a bridge between the new extremists and the national party establishment -- just as his father had for members of the John Birch Society in Harris County , Texas , in the early 1960s .
To ally himself with them , Jeb positioned himself well to the right .
“ I ’m a hang - ' em - by - the - neck conservative , ” he declared .
When Bob Martinez was elected governor of Florida in 1986 , Jeb moved to Tallahassee to become Florida ’s secretary of commerce .
By that point , the Bush parents had come to focus on Jeb as the family ’s next - generation political leader .
After George H.W. Bush lost to Bill Clinton in 1992 , they looked to Jeb as their best hope for vindication .
Jeb ’s position as favorite son rankled his brother , and people I ’ve spoken to who know the president well speculate that it was a factor in George ’s effort to pull his life together at age 40 , when he found God and quit drinking .
In politics , George would often drop comments that suggested he measured himself principally in relation to Jeb .
Asked once on the campaign trail what he was going to do for “ the little guy , ” he responded : “ I am the little guy .
Jeb is 6 - 4 . I am only 5 - 11 . ”

When George first proposed running for governor of Texas in 1990 , his parents strongly opposed the idea .
When he returned to the idea in 1994 , they reacted the same way .
Barbara Bush , in particular , worried that George ’s campaign would drain money and attention away from Jeb ’s contest for the governorship in Florida , according to Doug Wead , an aide to the father who became close to George around that time .
When George chose to run despite their objections , the parents expected , as did others in the family , that he would lose to Ann Richards and that Jeb would defeat Lawton Chiles .
When George won and Jeb lost , their positions were reversed .
In the hotel suite in Houston where George was celebrating , his aunt , Nancy Ellis , heard him speaking to his father over the phone .
“ Why do you feel bad about Jeb ? ” he asked his dad , according to one biography of the family .
“ Why do n’t you feel good about me ? ”
Such feelings notwithstanding , primogeniture -- inheritance by the firstborn son -- was now restored .
By the time Jeb was elected Florida governor in 1998 , his brother was already planning his own presidential campaign .
As the second Bush presidency grinds to its dismal conclusion , both Jeb and his parents seem to think that George ’s mistakes have destroyed the second son ’s chances of ever occupying the White House , family friends say .
Jeb was merely recognizing reality when he opted not to run for president in 2008 .
While a campaign in 2012 or beyond is theoretically possible , Jeb says he has no interest and complains that no one will believe him .
Among those who do n’t want to take no for an answer is his brother the president , for whom , ironically , Jeb ’s election would provide a measure of historical vindication .
Advertisement
While Jeb seems resigned to abandoning politics , family friends have described his parents as devastated that the older son spiked the chances of the younger one .
In December 2006 , the former president gave a glimpse of this when he paid tribute to his second son at a ceremony to mark the end of Jeb ’s two terms as governor .
Bush began to crack when talking about Jeb ’s 1994 defeat , and how his son did n’t whine or complain about the unfair attacks on him in the election .
“ The true measure of a man is ... " Bush tried to say , now openly sobbing as Jeb approached to comfort him , " ... is how you handle victory ... and also defeat . ”
Jeb , the obedient son , the one who was supposed to be president , who even after George Junior ’s election was regarded as a potential third in the line , now faces a political impasse .
His older brother dashed ahead and blew up the bridge behind him .
At this point , not many people inside or outside the family think it can be rebuilt .
Kucinich : No ' cash for trash , ' give taxpayers a stake in bailout Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 22 , 2008
Print This Email This With the White House and Wall Street pressuring Congress to quickly approve a massive taxpayer - funded bailout package this week , several Democrats are coming forward with proposals they say would benefit average Americans alongside financial executives .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) outlined a proposal he said would create " a genuine ownership society , " by giving taxpayers a stake in the companies the government will be saving with its proposed $ 700 billion package .
 Simply purchasing bad debt , ' cash for trash ' and not receiving anything of value or giving $ 700 billion and not having a commensurate equity interest in Wall Street firms is unacceptable , " Kucinich said in a news release Monday .
" No ' cash for trash . ' "
The former Democratic presidential candidate said he would be introducing a bill this week to create a " United States Mutual Trust Fund " to convert assets purchased by the governemnt into shares that would be distributed to every man , woman and child in the country .
Every American would receive about $ 2,300 worth of shares because that is the cost of the bailout package to each individual , Kucinich said .
While it was unclear whether Kucinich 's proposal would gain any traction , Democratic leaders in the House and Senate were offering a variety of additional proposals to add to the bailout bill , the New York Times reported : Democrats said the plan would need to provide more specific relief for troubled homeowners .
They said the program , which the administration proposed to be run by Treasury , would have to be more accountable to Congress .
And they said that the plan must restrict the compensation of corporate executives from companies that make use of the program to sell the burdensome securities on their balance sheets to the United States .
 We need to offer some assurance to the American taxpayer that Congress is watching ,  Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee , told reporters on Sunday .
 One of the things that got us into this mess was the lack of accountability and the lack of oversight that was occurring , and I dont think we want to repeat those mistakes with a program of this magnitude .
This week is expected to be Congress 's last in session until after the November election , putting added pressure on lawmakers to act quickly .

UNTIL this week America 's authorities clung to the hope that they could tide over the financial system with a few loans until home prices stabilised and all the bad debts were accounted for .
But the destruction visited on Wall Street in the past week has dashed those aspirations and forced policymakers to consider a more sweeping response .
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and AIG 's federal takeover have triggered a wholesale flight to safety that could turn illiquid institutions insolvent .
Healthy corporations can no longer issue bonds .
Banks can barely borrow from each other .
The federal government , having lent hundreds of billions of dollars to banks and investment banks and AIG , now thinks it must put permanent capital into the financial system to restore confidence and stop the vicious spiral .
Hank Paulson , the treasury secretary , and Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , met Congressional leaders towards the end of the week .
And on Saturday September 20th Mr Paulson sent a preliminary plan under which the federal government would be authorised to purchase up to $ 700 billion of " residential or commercial mortgages and any securities , obligations , or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages " originated or issued on or before Wednesday .
It could buy them from any financial institution headquartered in the United States .
America 's financial regulators had already taken some steps to restore order to the markets .
On Friday it followed the example set by their British counterparts and temporarily banned the short - selling of shares in financial institutions .
Short - sellers have taken the blame for some of the instability .
The Treasury also announced that it would provide guarantees of $ 50 billion to money - market funds , where cracks are also appearing .
At the same time , the Federal Reserve announced two measures aimed at easing strains in money markets .
It will buy short - term debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from primary dealers .
In a sign of the acute stress in markets this week , this paper has been trading at spreads of almost three precentage points above government debt of comparable maturity despite the de facto nationalisation of the mortgage agencies two weeks ago .
The Fed will also extend loans to banks to buy asset - backed commercial paper from money - market funds that face redemptions .
The authorities are considering two broad approaches to shore up the financial system .
One is to create an institution to provide capital to weakened institutions .
A proposal floated on Thursday by Charles Schumer , a Democratic senator , would recreate the Depression - era Reconstruction Finance Corporation to “ provide capital to struggling financial institutions in exchange for an equity stake . ”
The banks would have to let judges write down delinquent mortgages to levels homeowners could afford .
Such an institution could conceivably relieve the Fed of its politically compromising loans to Bear Stearns and AIG .
The problem is that such an approach might not have much impact until bad debts drove many institutions to the brink of failure and they had nowhere else to turn .
By that point , the economy would be in dire straits and the financial system in chaos .
Moreover , the Bush administration has opposed forcing lenders to write down their mortgages .
The Treasury 's preference is to buy the mortgage securities at the heart of the problem , thereby putting a floor under their prices and removing them from the banking system .
The Treasury already has the authority to purchase mortgage - backed securities underwritten by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but wants to be able to buy much dodgier mortgage securities which have become impossible to trade .
This approach has its problems .
As Mr Schumer noted , “ most troubled mortgages have been sold into complex mortgage - backed securities , which have themselves been split into pieces and sold to thousands of investors around the world . ”
To modify these mortgages so that homeowners could stay in their homes , the government “ would have to be able to gather all of the pieces of every security and put the proverbial puzzle back together .
This would be incredibly difficult . ”
The bail - out plan 's large size is designed to provide meaningful support .
As of June 30th , $ 10.6 trillion of home mortgages were outstanding ( the vast amount current ) .
Once authorised , the money may not be spent : mere knowledge of the fund 's existence might restore confidence .
And banks do n't have to sell their mortgages to benefit ; merely having a credible market price for those they hold could restore the confidence of investors .
And if the Treasury is astute in its buying , it could even make money .
After all , thanks to investors ' panicked flight to the safety of Treasury debt , it can now borrow for close to nothing .
The Treasury would have to recognise that it could lose a lot of the money too : there 's a reason no one wants this paper .
At 5 % of GDP , $ 700 billion would be larger than the net amount spent on the savings - and - loan clean - up in the early 1990s which came to around 3 % of GDP .
The final price tag of this bailout should be less since the government would eventually recoup some of the money owed on the mortgages .
Even 5 % of GDP is cheap compared to an average of 16 % that banking crises around the world have cost in the past 30 years , according a recent staff study of the International Monetary Fund .
Congressional leaders , who plan to go into recess at the end of next week , had previously said that consideration of such an ambitious initiative would have to wait until after the election .
This week 's events have concentrated their minds .
Republicans recoil at the thought of bail - outs but do n't want to accept blame for a market meltdown less than two months from an election .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had been heading for another sickening fall on Thursday until news of the plans sparked a turnaround and sent it up by 4 % on the day .
It jumped by another 3 % Friday .
The Treasury and the Fed would like Congress to pass enabling legislation this week .
Virtually every day I read something about the GOP or McCain or Palin or conservatives that makes me say " What the .... did I read that right ? "
It 's common enough to be not worth nothing often , but this one is .
The Virginia Republican Party , report Greg Sargent and Eric Kleefeld , is holding a " minority outreac " event starring ... George Allen !
Yes , the George Allen who , when running for reelection to the Senate in 2006 , called a young man of color " macaca . "
The George Allen who has shown a disquieting interest in the Confederate flag over many years .
I do not joke here .
At any rate , the rally is this Saturday in Fairfax County .
It should be right up there with last week 's moving " Remembering Brezhnev : the Man , not the Myth " tribute in Warsaw .
Ann and Nancy Wilson are hoping the Republicans change their tune — and are n't planning on waiting until November to find out .
The sisterly duo known as Heart sent a cease - and - desist notice to the McCain - Palin campaign Thursday afternoon after their hit " Barracuda " was used — twice — without permission as the official rallying cry for the vice presidential candidate after her nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention .
The song was chosen as a would - be cute tie - in to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's past — " Barracuda " was her high school nickname .
Only problem , campaign officials failed to ask either the group , Universal Music Publishing or Sony BMG whether the song was fair game to use .
It was n't .
When I taught at Hillsdale College , I heard one of my colleagues ( whose office was right next to mine , and our doors were open ) listening to a student ask if he could take the class final early , because he wanted to go participate in a rally for newly - reelected President Bush .
My colleague wearily asked , " Why do you support him ?
He 's not a conservative .
Look at how much he increased spending during his first term , even non-defense spending . "
Exacta - mundo , to quote the Head & Shoulders commercial .
Just as Republican Richard Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard and instituted explicit wage and price controls , so too it has happened under a Republican administration that the Federal Reserve has engaged in unprecedented actions to interfere in financial markets , and the Treasury has now " seized control " of Fannie and Freddie .
One of Tyler Cowen 's readers had the temerity to ask why taxpayers should be put on the line to bail out fraudulent financial players , and Tyler 's answer was that if the government allowed Fannie and Freddie to fail , basically the world would end .
( Go read his post to see how little I am exaggerating . )
After warning of a collapsing dollar and stock market , as well as boils and frogs , he at least links to a Jeffrey Rogers Hummel article on why libertarians should welcome a default by the U.S. government .
I will post more on this topic in the coming days , but for now I want to make the simple point that the government per se cannot create wealth or financial stability .
It is not as if the people running Freddie and Fannie were stumped , and then Paulson sprang up in his bed Sunday at 3 a.m. with a brilliant new way to securitize mortgages .
All the government can do is inject money into sinking operations by ( a ) stealing it from taxpayers and / or ( b ) creating more dollar bills through the printing press .
Either way , " America " is paying for the bailout .
Any increased " confidence " in the rescued sector is counterbalanced by an increase in uncertainty in other areas , like , " How much are my taxes going to go up over the next ten years to pay for this ? ! " or " What in the world will a gallon of milk cost next year ? ! "
I want to stress that these interventions have been getting progressively bolder .
If , back in August 2007 when the credit crunch first hit , Paulson had announced all of the measures that have been unveiled in the last 13 months , most " right - wing " analysts would have cried foul .
They would have labeled him a socialist and compared him to FDR .
But instead of throwing the private sector into the boiling pot , instead Paulson and Bernanke have just been turning up the dial incrementally .
The reason we are in the current fix , where " libertarian " Tyler Cowen and others are saying it is necessary for the government to take over Freddie and Fannie , is that Paulson and Bernanke chickened out and did n't simply let a bunch of banks fail back in September 2007 .
It would have been painful -- there would have been billions in losses , house prices would have plummeted , the dollar may have fallen , etc .
But guess what ?
All those things happened anyway , and the fundamental problems in the economy merely festered .
The same will happen with this " rescue . "
The housing market is not suddenly fixed with the promise of hundreds of billions in Treasury injections .
On the contrary , it relieves pressure on the systemic problems that led to these massive malinvestments in the first place .
What happens as the recession deepens , and other institutions that are " too big to fail " line up for their injections of hundreds of billions ?
Will the federal government take over the Big Three automakers , the pension funds of homebuilders , etc . ?
The government can only rearrange -- and in the process , dissipate - - wealth .
The federal takeover of Fannie and Freddie is just one more example that there is no difference between Republicans and Democrats .
It does n't matter whether McCain or Obama wins ; your taxes are going up .
How else is the government going to pay for all of the " compassionate conservatism " -- not to mention the " humble foreign policy " -- that has been ladled out the last eight years ?

The next version Debian has come a step closer to completion with the freezing of the current testing distribution version codename Lenny .
This will form the basis of Debian 5.0 , expected in September .
The freeze means that package developers who have not uploaded software for inclusion in the Debian 5.0 release have effectively missed the boat .
It also means that their packages will almost certainly be omitted from the next versions of popular Linux distros such as Ubuntu , Xandros and Linspire that are based on Debian .
Debian developers have their work cut out over the next few weeks if they are to maintain Debian 's reputation for top-quality releases .
There are 363 bugs currently outstanding in the many pieces of software that make up Debian .
The job is to fix these bugs during the current test phase for the release to be considered " stable " in September .
The current stable release - codenamed Etch ( 4.0 ) - will then become the " oldstable " version .
The latest , so - called " unstable " version , is always codenamed Sid and includes experimental code that may or may not figure in future releases .
The prime development goals for Lenny aim to bring Debian up to date with advances in hardware architectures and software .
These include support for IP v6 , the latest version of internet protocols , support for large file systems ( LFS ) and version four of NFS .
Support for future GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) releases and Python 2.5 are also on the list .
The release will also tidy up Debian 's build functions to improve installation .
It will be tested for so - called " double compilation " support to ensure build consistency and obsolete functions such as " debmake " - and any packages that require it - are being removed .
New or updated support for I18N description standards and full support for UTF - 8 will also be included . ®
This is a very sad book , the story of thousands of Americans who , during the Depression , lured by sham Soviet propaganda and pro-Soviet falsehoods spread by the likes of George Bernard Shaw and the corrupt New York Times Moscow correspondent , Walter Duranty , migrated to the USSR in search of jobs and a role in the " building of socialism . "
It was , in the words of the author , " the least heralded migration in American history " and a period when " for the first time in her short history more people were leaving the United States than were arriving . "
Most of these expatriates , not intellectuals but simple working men , were quickly disenchanted and wanted to return home , only to find that Moscow considered them Soviet citizens and barred them from leaving .
Ignored by the American government , many of them ended in the gulag .
In Tim Tzouliadis 's " The Forsaken " ( Penguin Press , 436 pages , $ 29.95 ) , their dismal story is told with great skill and indignation usually missing from Western accounts of communist Russia .
Click Images for Slideshow FPG / 2005 Getty Images A Stalinist work camp in Siberia , Russia .
They came to Russia full of enthusiasm , bringing with them baseball and jazz , and eager to acclimatize .
Russians found it difficult to believe the Americans ' tales of woe when they saw their clothes , luxurious by Russian standards .
And the migrants were themselves quite unprepared for the poverty and lawlessness which characterized life under Stalin , and in many if not most cases decided to leave .
They soon learned , however , that when they surrendered their American passports upon stepping on Soviet soil ( passports which were then used by Soviet agents in America ) , they had become , automatically , Soviet citizens .
Protests and appeals to the American authorities qualified the émigrés in Moscow 's eyes as troublemakers and led to their arrests , followed by confinement in concentration camps .
Stalin , whose paranoia grew to the point where he confessed he could not even trust himself , had no use for these foreigners .
This was for two reasons .
One was that he feared they would spread discontent among Soviet citizens .
The other was that he feared they would demand repatriation and , on returning home , enlighten Americans about the dreadful conditions of life in the USSR .
So he ordered them to be treated as Soviet citizens , accused of " espionage " and isolated in the Gulag from which few were expected to emerge alive .
Mr. Tzouliadis , a Greek native raised in England and currently a documentary filmmaker and television journalist , cites example after example of the U.S. State Department and its consular officials in Moscow ignoring appeals for assistance from these forlorn men and women .
Sympathize as one may with their plight , I think he is somewhat unfair to the American authorities in stressing their failure to provide " the forsaken " with assistance .
After all , they were not abducted , but went to the USSR voluntarily , and in most cases the American authorities found it impossible to determine whether they freely gave up their American citizenship or were robbed of it .
The scope of this admirable work is broader than the title indicates .
The American expatriates dissolved in Soviet society , especially after they were incarcerated , becoming nonpersons , and their stories , too , became tied up with the broader Soviet one .
Much of the book deals with American - Soviet relations during the 1930s and 1940s .
We are given examples of the incredible naïveté of Franklin Roosevelt , who lacked even elementary knowledge of the Communist regime :
He is quoted as asking , " How could Stalin afford to buy all these factories ? "
There are vignettes of the no less naïve vice president , Henry Wallace , who visited the concentration camp at Magadan and found nothing amiss , as well as of the despicable American ambassador to Moscow , the multimillionaire Joseph Davies , who liked everything in the Soviet Union and even took Stalin 's show trials at face value .
These public figures eclipse the poor devils who had themselves migrated to the Soviet Union  and who flit in and out of the pages of this book , faceless and nameless .
The only expatriate to emerge as a distinct personality is one Thomas Sgovio , an aspiring artist from Buffalo and the son of an American communist , who miraculously survived years in the Kolyma camp and on his return to America published his memoirs .
Sgovio arrived in Moscow in 1935 .
At first all went well , as he joined a chorus and worked on his drawing and painting .
But in 1938 , in the midst of Stalin 's terror , during which his father and many of his friends were arrested , Sgovio paid a visit to the American embassy to seek help .
Upon leaving , he was immediately arrested .
He was interrogated and condemned to five years in the notorious Kolyma camp , a place with the coldest recorded temperatures on earth .
When his term lapsed , he was kept imprisoned :
Of the 25 years he lived in the Soviet Union , 16 were spent in prison or concentration camp .
Finally in 1960 he was allowed to return to America .
His tale of misery and helplessness were repeated thousands of times by others less fortunate , among them his father , who spent 10 years doing hard labor , only to die shortly after being released .
The horror that was Stalinist Russia is still incomprehensible to many Americans , even to many of those who study the USSR professionally .
Reading this book is certain to open their eyes .

A new fundamental mechanism of how tumour cells communicate has just been discovered by the team of Dr. Janusz Rak at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) in collaboration with Dr Guha from the University of Toronto .
The cancer cells are able to communicate with their more healthy counter - parts by releasing vesicles .
These bubble - like structures contain cancer - causing ( oncogenic ) proteins that can trigger specific mechanisms when they merge into non or less - malignant cells .
These findings could change our view on how cancerous tissues work and lead to major clinical innovations .
They were published on April 20 in the on-line edition of Nature Cell Biology .
The surface of some brain tumour cells has long been known to express a mutated version of what is called the variant III epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFRvIII ) .
Although this factor is expressed only in a fraction of tumour cells , it has a major impact on the malignancy of the whole tumor .
How could this cellular minority have such an important impact "
This mechanism was still unknown … until now .
This study shows that the mutated EGFRvIII triggers production of small vesicles that project from the cell membrane and that carry mutated copies of EGFRvIII on their surfaces .
They were baptised “ oncosomes . ”
Surprisingly enough , this shows that oncoproteins are not always confined to the cell that produced them .
In this case they even migrate !
Oncosomes will migrate until they fuse with another cell , either healthy or benign tumoral .
Oncogenic protein AGFRvIII then becomes integrated in the membrane of the “ recipient ” cell and starts stimulating specific metabolic pathways to make it act in an aberrant and malignant way .
Although this may be a transient event , the changes could impact tumor behaviour by more rapid increases in cell numbers and by stimulation of blood vessel growth , hallmarks of malignant brain tumors .
“ With this information we can imagine that many mutant proteins are not necessarily confined to the cells that make them , but rather can migrate and spread around as cargo of oncosomes , a process that could be referred to as formation of the “ oncogenic field effect , ” explained Dr. Rak .
“ It demonstrates that cancer is a multi-cell process , where the cells talk to one another extensively .
This goes against the traditional view that a single ‘ mutated ’ cell will simply multiply uncontrollably to the point of forming a tumour .
This discovery opens exciting new research avenues , but we also hope that it will lead to positive outcomes for patients . ”
Indeed , the presence of oncosomes ( containing EGFRvIII or other proteins ) in blood of cancer patients could become a clinical marker , meaning that doctors could screen for a tumour ’s molecular characteristics instead of having to perform invasive surgery or biopsy .
Currently , in the case of brain cancer , this very precise assessment cannot be performed without removing the tumour and therefore opening a patient ’s skull .
However , the assay and analysis of oncosomes would potentially only require taking a small sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid .
This would be a step in ensuring patient comfort and choosing the best therapeutic strategy for them , factors that are key in the journey towards personalized medicine in a hopefully not - too - distant future .

China has ordered the closure of 40 factories in a city close to Beijing in the run-up to the Olympics Games .
The plants in the eastern port city of Tianjin have been ordered to stop production from late July .
The move is the latest attempt by China to minimise air pollution in the capital during the Games in August .
Some athletes have expressed concern about air quality affecting their performance and damaging their health .
State media reports that work on key building sites in Tianjin will be suspended , including the construction of an underground railway line .
Two cement works , 26 building sites and six factories which cause " effluvial contamination " will also be affected , said Xinhua news agency .
On Friday , similar action was taken in the city of Tangshan , 150 km ( 90 miles ) east of Beijing where about 300 factories will suspend their operations .
Beijing is one of the most polluted cities in the world and officials have been making extensive efforts to improve air quality before the Games .
But correspondents say that pollution in the city is as bad as ever and it is often shrouded in heavy smog .

Nouriel Roubini , RGE Monitor , who accurately predicted the current economic crisis : " Last week we argued that , with the nationalization of Fannie and Freddie , comrades Bush , Paulson and Bernanke had started transforming the USA into the USSRA ( United Socialist State Republic of America ) .
This transformation of the USA into a country where there is socialism for the rich , the well connected and Wall Street ( i.e. where profits are privatized and losses are socialized ) continues … with the nationalization of AIG . "
Atrios : " The entire financial system is practically collapsing and they 're lamenting the possibility of more regulation ... People who prattle on about ' the free market ' are usually too stupid to have a clue how complicated and pervasive the " rules " had to be to to get a well - functioning modern market system : sophisticated concepts of contracts and enforcement , property rights , legal entities , proper accounting , bankruptcy , limited liability , etc ... etc... , did not descend from the heavens but were , in fact , created .

A panel set up to review Denver ’s marijuana policies has recommended that police refrain from arresting adults who fire up during the Democratic National Convention .
Police will have to deal with numerous security issues next week when thousands of people — from protesters to delegates — descend on Denver , said Mason Tvert , leader of a group that sponsored a law mandating that marijuana be a low - enforcement priority .
“ It is absolutely absurd for the police to be spending any of their time worrying about adults using a drug that is less harmful than alcohol , ” he said today .
Tvert , who also sits on the Marijuana Policy Review Panel , said he would deliver the recommendation to Mayor John Hickenlooper , Police Chief Gerald Whitman and Denver City Council president Jeanne Robb .
The panel was formed to gather statistics on marijuana arrests and has no legal authority , said David Broadwell , Denver assistant district attorney .
“ Any citizen can make a recommendation , ” he said , adding that police have no obligation to follow it .
Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said officers will continue to enforce a state statute barring possession and use of marijuana despite the voter - approved city ordinance making small amounts of marijuana the “ lowest law - enforcement priority . ”
“ We ca n’t relax the laws ; we have to enforce the laws on the books .
If an officer witnesses a wrongdoing , he is responsible to take action , ” Jackson said .
Police and the mayor ’s office were n’t immediately available for comment today .
The panel recommended that police not arrest , detain or issue a citation to anyone over 21 who possesses up to one ounce of pot for private use during the convention .
In 2005 , city voters approved a referendum that mirrors the panel ’s recommendation , but arrests continued as police continued to enforce state law .
In 2007 , voters approved making marijuana the city ’s lowest law - enforcement priority .
But in the first six months of this year , Tvert said , 927 adults were prosecuted for possession .
“ The people of Denver have made it clear they do not want adults in this city punished for simply possessing a drug less harmful than alcohol , ” said Tvert .
“ Now a panel appointed by the mayor of Denver has echoed that call , and we hope police will not defy the people of this city or its mayor when the international spotlight hits the Mile High City next week . ”

Dendroclimatology : thermometer or hygrometer ?
Hot climate or cold , tree leaves stay in comfort zone
From the Google Climate Discussion Group , see an article also in Science News
Paris , June 11 ; Agence France - Presse
A new study that shows their internal temperature remains constant at 21.4deg could challenge the way trees are used to determine historical climate data
The internal temperature of leaves , whether in the tropics or a cold - clime forest , tends toward a nearly constant 21.4 degrees Celsius , reports a study released today .
It had long been assumed that actively photosynthesising leaves – using energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar – are nearly as cold or hot as the air around them .
The new findings not only challenge long - held precepts in plant biology , but could upend climate models that use tree rings to infer or predict past and present temperature changes .
For decades , scientists studying the impact of global warming have measured the oxygen isotope ratio in tree - rings to determine the air temperature and relative humidity of historical climates .
Oxygen atoms within water molecules evaporate more or less quickly depending on the number of neutrons they carry , and the ratio between these differently weighted atoms in tree trunk rings has been used as a measure of year - to - year fluctuations in temperatures and rainfall .
“ The assumption in all of these studies was that tree leaf temperatures were equal to ambient temperatures , ” lead researcher Brent Helliker told AFP .
“ It turns out that they are not . ”
Helliker and University of Pennsylvania colleague Suzanna Richter turned those assumptions upside down in examining 39 tree species , across 50 degrees of latitude ranging from sub-tropical Columbia to boreal Canada .
They compared current observed records of humidity and temperature against the isotope ratios in the trees , and found that tree leaves were internally cooler than surrounding air temperatures in warm climes , and warmer in cool climes .
Even more startling was that in all cases the average temperature – over the course of a growing season – was about 21degC .
“ It is not surprising to think that a polar bear in northern Canada and a black bear in Florida have the same internal body temperature , ” because both animals have internal thermostats to prevent overheating or freezing to death , he said .
“ But to think that a Canadian black spruce and a Caribbean Pine have the same average leaf temperature is quite astonishing , ” he added .
Tree leaves keep cool through constant evaporation and reducing sun exposure through leaf angles or reflective qualities .
Warmth is gained by decreasing evaporation and increasing the number of leaves per branch .
All these tricks should be seen as evolutionary adaptations that help the trees attain a maximum of nutrients through optimal photosynthesis , Helliker said .
The fact that part of this adaptation occurs at the level of entire forest canopies , and not just within individual leaves , is one reason direct measurements of tree temperatures have been so hard .
The new findings , published in the British journal Nature , are bolstered by a recent study of a mixed species forest in Switzerland based on infrared thermal imaging .
Measured across an entire growing season , the forest canopy temperatures were found to be 4degC to 5degC higher than the cool , ambient air in the Swiss Alps .

Ice is in retreat worldwide as glaciers melt , Arctic ice floes vanish , and Antarctic ice shelves break apart .
Will all of it eventually disappear as the globe warms ?
Not necessarily , say André Bornemann of the University of Leipzig in Germany and several colleagues .
From sediment cores drilled out of the Atlantic seafloor , they retrieved fossils of tiny , shell - encased marine organisms called foraminifers that lived 91 million years ago during the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum , when tropical seas were about 12 Fahrenheit degrees warmer than they are today .
The fossils ' shells contained a high proportion of oxygen - 18 , an isotope that increases in the ocean relative to oxygen - 16 when water evaporates from the sea and gets trapped on land as ice .
The isotope data suggest that even during the hot spell , an ice sheet half the size of the current Antarctic ice cap existed — but where ?
It could n't have been near the North Pole , which the fossil record shows was then home to heat - loving crocodiles .
Instead , Bornemann thinks the ice cap covered high mountain ranges near the South Pole .
The warm weather prevailing elsewhere would have injected plenty of moisture into the air to fall as snow on high altitudes way down south .
But make no mistake .
Compared with today , a lot of ice was missing back then , and sea levels were much higher — a history that seems to be on the verge of repeating itself .
The research was detailed earlier this year in the journal Science .
FIRST , A WARNING
The following material is likely to be intensely triggering to child abuse survivors , including ( but not limited to ) survivors of physical and mental abuse and childhood incest .
I apologise for this in advance .
I do , however , feel it is necessary to expose the full horror of religiously motivated child abuse .
I am not going to object if those of you who are survivors of child abuse do not wish to read this diary ( though I do appreciate commentary from those who do ) .
For the rest of you -- yes , this is going to be upsetting .
Unfortunately , this is a reality for literally millions of kids ( and also explains why I have such grave , grave concerns regarding dominionist " parallel economy " alternatives to things like pediatricians ' associations ) .
The hell begins at birth
The horror of dominionist " Bible - based " child abuse begins , all too often , from the very time that baby goes home from the hospital .
One of the more popular books among dominionist childrearing circles is Gary and Anne Marie Ezzo's book " Babywise " -- promoted in the dominionist " Quiverfull " circles as " Growing Kids God 's Way " .
The books are popular enough that there are online forums promoting the Ezzo material ( including the Livejournal community " Babywise " and -- frighteningly -- the books are now being promoted in homeschooling circles in the United Kingdom as well .
To say " Babywise " is " not so wise " ( as an article critical of the book quipped ) is possibly the understatement of the millenium .
The Ezzos are known to promote some of the most abusive books known targeting the dominionist " bible - based baby - beating " crowd because the schedule of infants ( from the time they emerge from the womb ) is strictly regimented and parents are encouraged to ignore the cries of their wailing infants for hours on end to " train " them .
Not only this , but the Ezzos happily promote striking tiny babies to " chasten " them .
( This is , alas , a nearly universal practice in dominionist childrearing circles , as we 'll see . )
The Ezzos specifically promote something called " parent - directed feeding " ( or PDF for short - - not to be confused with the Adobe Acrobat format ) ; in essence , this is a " mommy - centered " rather than " baby - centered " method of childrearing , with such basic things as when and how long baby gets to nurse set to a strict schedule .
A description from the Livejournal " Babywise " community comments :
The infant management concepts presented in this book have found favor with over two million parents and twice as many contented babies .
On Becoming Babywise brings hope to the tired and bewildered parents looking for an alternative to sleepless nights and fussy babies .
The Babywise Parent Directed Feeding concept has enough structure to bring security and order to your baby 's world , yet enough flexibility to give mom freedom to respond to any need at any time .
It teaches parents how to lovingly guide their baby 's day rather than be guided or enslaved to the infant 's unknown needs .
It should not take an expert in child development to see where this could cause problems .
Use of the books as directed ( which involves setting up a very strict schedule for baby , including with feeding and sleep , from the time they are born in complete disregard for the actual needs of the infant ) has been linked to hospitalisations for dehydration and failure to thrive as infants are basically starved to death :
Though " Babywise " does say , " With PDF , a mother feeds her baby when the baby is hungry , " it also instructs parents to do otherwise .
In a question - and - answer section , parents of a 2 - week - old baby , who did not get a full feeding at the last scheduled time and wants to eat again , are instructed that babies learn quickly from the laws of natural consequences .
" If your daughter does n't eat at one feeding , then make her wait until the next one . "
Unfortunately , the schedule in " Babywise " does not take into account differences among breastfeeding women and babies .
According to one report , differences of up to 300 percent in the maximum milk storage capacity of women 's breasts mean that , although women have the capability of producing the same amount of milk over a 24 - hour period for their infants , some will have to breastfeed far more frequently than others to maintain that supply .
Babies must feed when they need to , with intervals and duration determined according to a variety of factors in temperament , environment , and physiological make - up .
Averages may fit into a bell - shaped curve , but some babies will require shorter intervals .
( Daly S. , Hartmann P. " Infant demand and milk supply , Part 2 .
The short - term control of milk synthesis in lactating women . "
Journal of Human Lactation ; 11 ; ( 1):27-37 ) .
Examples of the many other unsubstantiated medical claims in " Babywise " include :
* " Lack of regularity [ in feeding intervals ] sends a negative signal to the baby 's body , creating metabolic confusion that negatively affects his or her hunger , digestive , and sleep / wake cycles . "
* " Demand - fed babies do n't sleep through the night . "
* " A mother who takes her baby to her breast 12 , 15 , or 20 times a day will not produce any more milk than the mom who takes her baby to breast six to seven times a day . "
* " Mothers following PDF have little or no problem with the let down reflex , compared to those who demand - feed . "
* " Colic , which basically is a spasm in the baby 's intestinal tract that causes pain , is very rare in PDF babies but is intensified in demand - fed babies . "
* " In our opinion , much more developmental damage is done to a child by holding him or her constantly than by putting the baby down .
In terms of biomechanics alone , carrying a baby in a sling can increase neck and back problems , or even create them . "
* " Some researchers suggest that putting a baby on his or her back for sleep , rather than on the baby 's tummy , will reduce the chance of crib death .
That research is not conclusive , and the method of gathering supportive data is questionable . "
My review of the low weight gain and FTT accounts associated with " Babywise " revealed several disturbing trends .
Parents were often adamant about continuing with the feeding schedule , even when advised otherwise by health care professionals .
They were hesitant to tell their physicians about the schedule , making it difficult to pinpoint the cause for the weight gain problems .
Many elected to supplement or wean to formula rather than continue breastfeeding at the expense of the schedule .
The parents ' commitment can be especially strong when they are using the program for religious reasons , even though numerous leaders within the same religious communities have publicly expressed concerns .
( Let 's review .
Apparently " Back to Sleep " ( which is pretty damn conclusively proven ) is a myth , putting these kids at risk for SIDS ; the book promotes punishing a two week old baby who does n't get enough to eat when nursing ; and the book tells parents to disregard medical advice .
As we will see below , at least one mommy in the group ended up being told by her own pediatrician her daughter was starving to death . )
The American Academy of Pediatrics has specifically warned against the practices promoted in the book as has the Canadian Child Care Federation and a major site for new mothers .
One of the big risks , at this , is that babies do n't form proper attachments ( and thus are set up for lifelong anxiety disorders as they never really learn to trust ) :
Why is " On Becoming Babywise " so controversial ?
Most , if not all , medical and childcare experts advise against following Ezzo 's strict , by - the - clock method .
They say it contradicts recent research that emphasizes the critical importance of early child - parent attachment .
They also point out that babies are extremely variable , and each one has different needs for eating and sleeping .
A number of pediatricians have observed PDF - reared infants who have problems such as insufficient weight gain , dehydration , and difficulty thriving .
Psychological and child development experts are concerned about potential emotional disturbances with this approach and cite evidence of such problems among some GFI families .
One review expressed significant concern that the Babywise method could potentially lead to child abuse .
Medical and childcare experts are n't the only ones who are concerned .
Numerous leaders in Ezzo's own religious community have publicly expressed concerns that he misrepresents Scripture and gives medically unsound advice .
In addition , an article in the Bradenton Herald noted how the Ezzo material is potentially highly dangerous as well -- including a tiny four - month - old baby who was not only starving but literally had given up the will to live :
A new Mom came to Debby Kearney searching for help .
Something was very wrong with her new baby .
Between her first two to four months of life , she gained only two ounces .
She should have put on at least two pounds , maybe even four , in that time .
A lactation consultant in private practice in Orlando , Florida , Kearney has logged thousands of hours helping breastfeeding mothers .
She suggested the mother breastfeed her baby girl more frequently , common advice she 'd give for a baby not gaining properly .
She was stunned when the young mother refused .
" The baby quit showing any signs of hunger .
They ran this baby though every test imaginable and could not find an organic cause " , Kearney said of the case about two years ago .
" I think the baby showed every sign of clinical depression . "
Something similar -- although not as severe -- happened again a few months later .
Another mother .
Another problem .
Another reluctance to nurse her baby more often .
And again .
And again .
A report by two pediatricians in Child Magazine , later reprinted in Pediatric News , notes that the material is dangerous and also notes the promotion of " Bible - based " baby - beating :
Furthermore , the authors recommended spanking ( with an instrument that is not too stiff ) to punish certain behaviors .
( Their advice on " chastisement , " as they call it , reminds us of that dispensed by the Rev. John Robinson , who wrote in the early 1700s that " by the time a child is 1 year he must be taught to fear being beaten with a stick .
The unpleasant noise of crying will be rarely heard in the house and the family will live in as much quietness as if there were not a child among them . " )
Ezzo ’s suggestions for using physical punishment and other " parent - centered " methods of childrearing are hardly likely to produce well - adjusted children .
Of particular note , the Child Abuse Prevention Council of Orange County has issued a general statement of concern in regards to religiously motivated child abuse in religious parenting programs that focuses specifically on abusive practices in the Ezzo books .
And believe you me , the group does promote things that would be considered bona - fide child abuse in most jurisdictions .
The LJ community booju_mooju ( a freeform community on family and parenting issues ) has given a particularly good glance of the full extent of the material promoted in typical Ezzo support forums ( including the " Babywise " forum on Livejournal ) .
A few highlights from the latter include :
a) Beating an 11 - month - old girl for being squirmy when dressed .
b ) " Hot - saucing " a one - year - old kid and " flicking the mouth " of kids that bite .
( More on " hot saucing " in a bit -- it 's been increasingly promoted by dominionists as a punishment tactic to the horror of hot - sauce manufacturers . )
c ) Letting a five - month - old baby scream continuously for an hour because Mommy did n't want to get up at 5 am .
d ) Promoting letting a thirteen - month - old child scream alone in a room for an hour .
e ) Letting a fifteen - month - old baby with a brain cyst cry for hours at a time because they were trying to force her to nap ( even though the mommy acknowledged that the kid may not be able to do so because of her brain lesion ) .
f ) Letting a three - week - old baby scream continuously for four and a half hours ...
g ) ... and then kvetching because her doctor told her that her kid was experiencing failure to thrive at her fifteen - week checkup .
h ) literally forcing one 's fingers down the throat of a child under 9 months of age to force them to vomit because they had " something in their mouth they were n't supposed to " ( the child started to gag himself in imitation at 9 months of age )
i ) Whacking a fifteen - month - old baby for having a temper tantrum ( if baby is already having a meltdown , whacking is n't gonna help ) .
Sadly , this sort of stuff is typical in Ezzo support forums .
If it were just the Ezzos ( who are sufficiently infamous that an entire site exists just for exposing the abusive tactics promoted in their childcare guides ) , that 'd be bad enough .
Unfortunately ... it's not .
Chastening , and " death by chastening rod "
Two other darlings of the dominionist " Bible - based " childrearing set are Michael and Debbie Pearl .
Their books , including " To Train Up A Child " , are popular in dominionist " homeschooling " circles as well as their website No Greater Joy ; disturbingly , they 've also shipped several copies of their abusive manuals to US Armed Forces servicemen as complimentary baby - beating books .
( In fact , according to at least one article on the Pearls written by the Raleigh , NC News - Observer , over 500,000 families nationwide regularly use the Pearls ' books and over 2 million copies have been sold worldwide of their books . )
Much like the Ezzos , online support forums exist for parents using these books as well ( including the eponymous LJ community " Trainupachild " , which promotes not only the work of the Pearls but Tedd Tripp , Bill Gothard , and others ) .
The Pearls are , of note , promoters of child - rearing techniques that make even James Dobson 's look tame in comparison .
Of note , they are also among some of the very few authors whose works are -- if used as directed -- directly attributable to the death of a child by suffocation and by PVC pipe used as a " chastening rod " :
A few years ago , Lynn Paddock sought Christian advice on how to discipline her growing brood of adopted children .
Paddock -- a Johnston County mother accused of murdering Sean , her 4 - year - old adopted son , and beating two other adopted children -- surfed the Internet , said her attorney , Michael Reece .
She found literature by an evangelical minister and his wife who recommended using plumbing supply lines to spank misbehaving children .
Paddock ordered Michael and Debi Pearl 's books and started spanking her adopted children as suggested .
After Sean , the youngest of Paddock 's six adopted children , died last month , his older sister and brother told investigators about Paddock 's spankings .
Sean 's 9 - year - old brother was beaten so badly he limped , a prosecutor said .
Bruises marred Sean 's backside , too , doctors found .
Sean died after being wrapped so tightly in blankets he suffocated .
That , too , was a form of punishment , Johnston County Sheriff Steve Bizzell said .
The Pearls ' advice from their Web site : A swift whack with the plastic tubing would sting but not bruise .
Give 10 licks at a time , more if the child resists .
Be careful about using it in front of others -- even at church ; nosy neighbors might call social workers .
Save hands for nurturing , not disciplining .
Heed the warning , taken from Proverbs in the Old Testament , that sparing the rod will spoil the child .
Oh , yes , that rod .
Being whacked with a 1/ 4 " diameter flexible supply line is n't fun -- it hurts , it can cause whiplike injuries to the kid , it does n't break like wood .
That is in fact also the precise childrearing advice the Pearls give -- to get one 's self up to the plumbing supply section of your local Home Depot or Lowe 's and get yourself a length of supply line to whack the hell out of your kid :
As a rule , do not use your hand .
Hands are for loving and helping .
If an adult swings his or her hand fast enough to cause pain to the surface of the skin , there is a danger of damaging bones and joints .
The most painful nerves are just under the surface of the skin .
A swift swat with a light , flexible instrument will sting without bruising or causing internal damage .
Many people are using a section of ¼ inch plumber ’s supply line as a spanking instrument .
It will fit in your purse or hang around you neck .
You can buy them for under $ 1.00 at Home Depot or any hardware store .
They come cheaper by the dozen and can be widely distributed in every room and vehicle .
Just the high profile of their accessibility keeps the kids in line .
If anyone wants to get a good look at what they advocate whacking kids with -- get thineself to Lowe's , or Salon Magazine has a pretty good visual in its article in regards to the Pearls .
Their tactics are n't just restricted to whacking kids with plumbing supplies , either .
A list of highlights :
a) Whacking two - and four - year - old kids with aforementioned plumbing supplies for picking their noses and thumbsucking .
( Whilst we do agree these are filthy habits , it 's not worth inducing a possible complex when Junior hits the Menard 's or Ace Hardware for home repair supplies in his college years . )
b ) Whacking a seven - month - old infant for the unforgivable crime of being fussy and not wanting to go to sleep .
c ) Yanking a baby 's hair to discourage it from hair - pulling .
d ) Beating kids with plumbing supplies for being " Twinkie Twerps " ( the last I checked , it was a rite of childhood to try to steal from the cookie jar ! )
e ) Yanking the hair of tiny , tiny babies for being a bit rough with nursing .
f ) Claiming that all infants are in fact evil , evil manipulative little bastards .
( Last I checked , little Stewie from " Family Guy " was a cartoon , not reality . )
g ) Promoting this sort of ' training ' from birth , including letting babies alone to cry for hours on end .
( Shades of the Ezzos ! )
h ) Again , confuses the world 's infants with Stewie Griffin of TV's " Family Guy " in portraying infants as actively plotting to manipulate their parents to their infantile wills .
( In fact , their scenario ( told from what they see as baby 's point of view ) could make a great scenario for that show - - not that the Pearls approve of such a heathen show as " Family Guy " .
However , treating your baby as if it were Stewie Griffin is a piss - poor method of childrearing . )
The abuse is n't just restricted to kids , either .
The Pearls also run an agony column for wives in dominionist households ; in one particular letter , they literally tell a woman she should stay with her husband even if he 's abusing her and the kids because " God hates divorce " .
In another agony column -- which should pretty much end any discussion how dominionists actually feel about reproductive issues and is but one step removed from Margaret Atwood 's horror novel The Handmaid 's Tale - - a woman is told that it is ultimately her husband 's decision , not hers , whether or not she is to go on the Pill and what her reproductive destiny will be .
( Ironically , the woman writing in was part of the " Quiverfull " movement and did not want to go on the Pill !
Literally , all that would be needed would be for her to legally change her name to " Offred " or something like that , and you 'd get the idea .
:P )
In another column , the Pearls declare authoritatively that all assertive and " uppity " women are possessed by " Jezebel spirits " .
( Did I mention that the Pearls are seriously into the whole " deliverance ministry " thing , and have claimed that if you do n't knock the hell out of your kids that it will inevitably cause them to be possessed by Satan ? )
Again , this is just the highlights off their website : Stop The Rod has far more excerpts of both To Train Up A Child and No Greater Joy available .
Even the News - Observer article notes things like a form of " hot - saucing " ( involving giving bitter herbal remedies ) to kids " whining about being hurt " , chasing down kids to beat them ( and in fact giving them additional " chastening " for running away and even promoting sitting on kids to administer the required whackage with the trusty plumbing equipment ) , whacking kids for complaining about the other spouse whacking them , whacking kids " 10 times a day at noon each day " for lying ( and being made to pull their own switch ) , and recommending not only the use of material from Home Depot 's plumbing section for " correction " but promoting the use of footlong willow branches for " chastening " the under - 1 - year set and 3 - foot branches and belts for older toddlers and kids .
Disturbingly , the Pearls ' tactics are so far out there that they led to an investigation by Tennessee child welfare officials :
Michael Pearl and his wife , Debi , do n't understand all the fuss .
Their five children , now grown , turned out well .
They are self - assured young men and women raising their own babies to be God- fearing mothers and fathers .
Besides , the Pearls say , the top investigator for the Tennessee Department of Human Services inspected their techniques a few years ago and gave them his blessing .
A spokesman for the agency declined to comment .
Stop The Rod , an activist group started by a Christian ( non-dominionist ) homeschooler mom who was mortified at promotion of " Bible - based baby beating " , has also noted that Tennessee 's child welfare agencies have investigated the Pearls .
However , the most bizarre commentary on the matter may be from the Pearls themselves , who literally accused critics of being demon possessed .
Toddler Torture with Tedd Tripp
Another favourite of the dominionist childrearing set is Tedd Tripp , whose book " Shepherding A Child 's Heart " actually makes some of the suggestions by the Pearls seem acts of loving - kindness by comparison .
" Stop The Rod " again has the definitive info , but a few highlights of note :
a ) " I recall many conversations that went like this :
Father :
You did n’t obey Daddy , did you ?
Child : No .
Father :
Do you remember what God says Daddy must do if you disobey ?
Child : Spank me ?
Father :
That ’s right .
I must spank you .
If I do n’t , then I would be disobeying God .
You and I would both be wrong .
That would not be good for you or for me , would it ?
Child : No. ( A reluctant reply ) " ( from p.31 )
b ) " There is validity to this concern .
You must be careful to avoid unnecessary exposure to being reported by someone who does not approve of spanking .
Spanking should be done in the privacy of the home . " ( p. 114 , in response to a parent who expressed valid concern that his tactics would lead to an arrest for child abuse .
Yes , you are reading this correctly ; Tripp is expressly educating parents to hide signs of religiously motivated child abuse . )
c ) " Even a child in the womb and coming from the womb is wayward and sinful .
One of the justifications for spanking children is that ‘ Folly is bound up in the heart of a child , but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him ’ ( Proverbs 22:15 ) .
The point of the proverb is that something is wrong in the heart of the child that requires correction . " ( p. 21 )
d ) " Obedience means more than a child doing what he is told .
It means doing what he is told ---
Without Challenge
Without Excuse ,
Without Delay . " ( p. 138 )
e ) " Acquaint your children with authority and submission when they are infants .
This training starts the day you bring them home from the hospital . " ( p. 134 )
f ) " You exercise authority as God ’s agent .
You must require obedience of your children because they are called by God to obey and honor you .
Parents should be ‘ benevolent despots ’ " .
( in foreward , p. xvii )
g ) " Obedience is not simply an issue between the parent and the child .
It is an issue between the child and God in which the parent is God ’s agent . " ( p. 139 .
Yes , you are reading this right ; parents are explicitly promoted as " God 's regent " and in families using this system , common child disobedience or even signs of independence are seen as directly disobeying God Himself . )
h ) " It is imperative that children learn to honor and obey .
The disobedient child has moved outside the place of covenant blessing . " ( p. 135 .
It is important to note that the above is a " Joel 's Army " codephrase ; the " Saved " are seen to have a " place of covenant blessing " ( and thus this is the reason for " name it and claim it " and political dominionism in general ) , and kids who disobey are seen as having directly disobeyed God and thus are cursed and cast out by God Himself . )
i ) " The fool ’s life is run by his desires and fears .
This is what you hear from your young children .
The most common phrases in the vocabulary of a 3 - year - old are , ‘ I want ...’ or ‘ I do n’t want ....’
The fool lives out of the immediacy of his lusts , cravings , expectations , hopes and fears . "
" Watch a baby struggle against wearing a hat in the winter .
Even this baby who cannot articulate or even conceptualize what he is doing shows a determination not to be ruled from without .
This foolishness is bound up within his heart .
Allowed to take root and grow for 14 or 15 years , it will produce a rebellious teenager who will not allow anyone to rule him .
The spanking process drives foolishness from the heart of a child .
Confrontation with the immediate and undeniably tactile sensation of a spanking renders an implacable child sweet . " ( p. 106 .
Yes , kids can seem quite " sweet " if they are in fact terrified of you . )
j ) " Faced with being kind to one who abuses you , there is nowhere to go but to God , who alone can enable a person to respond in love .
When your child ’s heart desires revenge , when she must love an enemy , when her faith demands she leave room for God ’s justice — there is no place to go but to the cross . "
" Getting help from Christ was powerfully illustrated in the life of our daughter .
As a ninth grader she seemed to get on the wrong side of her Spanish teacher .
Through four years of high school she struggled with feeling angry over being sinned against .
We spent many hours talking about how to respond .
We discussed the impossibility of her loving this lady apart from God ’s grace .
We encouraged her to find hope , strength , consolation and comfort in Christ . " ( p. 58 . )
k ) " The rod is a rescue mission .
The child who needs a spanking has become distanced from his parents through disobedience .
The spanking is designed to rescue the child from continuing in his foolishness .
If he continues , his doom is certain .
Thus , the parent , driven by love for the child , must use the rod . "
" Failure to obey Mom or Dad is failure to obey God .
This is the issue .
The child has failed to obey God . " ( p. 110 )
l ) " When your child is old enough to resist your directives , he is old enough to be disciplined .
Rebellion can be something as simple as an infant struggling against a diaper change or stiffening out his body when you want him to sit on your lap .
When our oldest child was approximately 8 months old , we were confronted with parenting our first mobile child .
We had a bookshelf constructed of boards and bricks .
Fearing the shelf would fall on him , Margy told him not to pull himself up by the shelf .
After moving him away from the shelf , she left the room .
As she peeked in on him , she observed him surveying the room .
Not seeing her , he headed back toward the forbidden bookshelf .
Here was a young child , not yet able to walk or to talk , looking to see if the coast was clear so he could disobey .
Obviously , he was old enough to be disciplined . " ( p. 154 )
So , let 's review ( and keep in mind I only listed about half the stuff that Stop The Rod did ) -- disobeying pisses off God Himself , it is your job to literally beat the hell out of your child from the time they are in the cradle lest they end up in Satan 's Army , and kids are taught there is no escape from this particular type of holy hell other than by praying very fervently for God to save them from this .
I can testify ( growing up in a family using a similar method of discipline ) that being taught that being naughty pisses off not only Mom but Jesus can produce a hell of a complex in a kid . :P
I have not even touched upon things like " revenge chastening " ( aka beating the kid for being angry about being beaten ) , whacking then hugging the kid ( let 's just say this can lead to some very interesting confusions later in life ) , and promoting self - worth as " pride " ( and thus as a mortal sin ) .
There are still worse promoters , though .
Reb Bradley and Richard Fugate - - a dangerous duo
I have partnered these two together , in part because Reb Bradley 's material is largely based upon Fugate 's material ( as noted on Stop The Rod ) .
Both promote the same material in essence as Tripp 's books -- namely , that children are born sinners , that they are all bound to jump into the welcoming arms of Satan unless you beat the hell out of them as soon as they 're off the bitty , and to abuse them if they seem like they 're resistant to the abuse .
First , Bradley 's highlights :
a ) " Whenever possible , an unruly child should be taken somewhere private and disciplined , where others will not be disturbed . " ( p. 62 )
b ) " If after a time of chastisement , a child lacks proper humility , the chastisement obviously did not work , and should be repeated a second time . " ( p. 73 )
c ) " A child who is not spanked can hardly be called a son or daughter . " ( p. 69 )
d ) " Children must not be allowed to interrupt parental discussions , and offer their opinions without permission or invitation . "
" Do not always allow them to decide what they will order at restaurants .
On occasion , exercise your parental prerogative of ordering for everyone . " ( p. 91 )
e ) " The general rule for our children :
If you have not been granted authority , do not make decisions on your own .
If it does not belong to you , do not touch it .
If you have not secured permission , do not offer your opinion . " ( p. 129 )
f ) " Sass is any response to an adult statement that is given without permission or invitation . "
" Sass is any response except Yes Dad , Yes Mom , May I appeal ?
or some other respectful request for permission for further discussion . " ( pp. 125-126 . )
g ) " To test a toddler ’s understanding of your vocabulary , without showing him anything , offer him a familiar treat , like ice cream or a bottle .
Does he respond ?
If he does , then he is old enough to understand a simple direction such as , ‘ Come here , son , ’ and should be chastised each time that he chooses to defy your authority . " ( p. 134 )
h ) " A child who is learning to submit his will to his parents should be required to respond ... ‘ Yes , Mom ’ or ‘ Yes , Dad , ’ ; ‘ I will obey you , Dad ’ ; ‘ I will stay in bed , Dad . ’
Children can respond with anything you require of them , like my wife ’s favorite : ‘ Yes , Mother , most beautiful among women . ’ " ( p. 142 .
The last part is highly creepy , seeing as this is from Song of Solomon 1:8-- and the verse is part of a love - song between Solomon and his bride .
Shades of those creepy " purity balls " ! )
The original source material from Richard Fugate is even more chunder - inducing , including not only a whole mess of " scripture - twisting " but encouraging beating of kids to the point of raising welts on page 173 ( and dismissing them as essentially side effects on page 174 ) , whacking kids beginning in the crawler stage with 1/8 " dowel rods on page 177 ( thereby setting the lower limit of around six months old ) , and even ( incredulously ) even promotes a veritable arsenal of " chastening rod " sizes geared towards different ages :
AGES 1 - 2 " Tot Rod " - - 3/16 " x 24 " dowel
2 - 4 " Mob Control " - - 1/4 " x 24 " dowel
4 - 8 " Train or Consequences " - - 5/16 " x 27 " dowel
8 -12 " The Equalizer " - - 3/8 " x 27 " long dowel
12 & up " Rebel Router " - - 1/2 " x 33 " dowel ( Of course , the " Attention Getter " for toddlers is defined under note 1 . )
( At this rate , Home Depot , Lowes and other home repair outlets are going to need to start monitoring purchases for possible " diversion " to religiously motivated child abuse ! )
Page 127 also promotes beating babies : " A wriggling six - month - old baby who intentionally refuses to be diapered can be taught the meaning of " no " in one or two simple lessons .
When he tries to crawl away during a changing , he can be told " no , " pulled back , and held in place for a moment .
The next time he tries to crawl away , he should be told " no " once firmly and lightly tapped once or twice on the upper leg with a small switch .
The shocked look and tears will indicate you got his attention and that the command " no " has taken on a real meaning .
An angry cry and continued squirming may indicate a strong - willed child who will require more pressure in both intensity and frequency . "
A quote from page 54 describes dominionist family relationships starkly in regards to family votes : " Granted , the voting was not equal : the three children each had one vote , Mother had four votes , and Dad had eight . "
In the " Please tell me you are joking " Department : " purity balls "
As if direct references to Mommy using the Song of Solomon ( easily the most explicitly erotic book in the entire Bible - - one that even gives a whole new meaning to the term " spiritual pornography " at times : D ) are n't squickworthy enough for you , there 's always the concept of the dominionist " purity ball " - - a whole different category of potential religious child abuse .
A " purity ball " , for those uninitiated to this ( and who were asking all manner of questions about the whole " date your daughters " thing in our expose of the " Bible boot camp " yesterday -- usually phrased in a variation of " OMG , he did NOT just say ' date your daughters ' ... " < insert spewing and retching sounds here > ) is a little ceremony that dominionist groups have been pushing in their endless War On Premarital Coitus that has a very decidedly creepy twist :
Purity Balls can vary in many particulars , but fathers who attend typically pledge before God to protect their young daughters ' purity in mind , body and soul .
Daughters are expected to remain virgins , abstaining from pre-marital sexual intercourse .
Fathers must sign the " Covenant of Purity and Protection , " witnessed by their daughters , and openly commit to the pledge , a typical example of which might be : I , ( daughter ’s name ) 's father , choose before God to cover my daughter as her authority and protection in the area of purity .
I will be pure in my own life as a man , husband and father .
I will be a man of integrity and accountability as I lead , guide and pray over my daughter and as the high priest in my home .
This covering will be used by God to influence generations to come .
I should note that the Wikipedia article also considerably understates what actually goes on at these get - togethers ( that frankly sound like a paedophile 's wet dream ) .
Glamour Magazine depicts a more typical " purity ball " :
In a chandelier - lit ballroom overlooking the Rocky Mountains one recent evening , some hundred couples feast on herb - crusted chicken and julienned vegetables .
The men look dapper in tuxedos ; their dates are resplendent in floor - length gowns , long white gloves and tiaras framing twirly , ornate updos .
Seated at a table with four couples , I watch as the gray - haired man next to me reaches into his breast pocket , pulls out a small satin box and flips it open to check out a gold ring he ’s about to place on the finger of the woman sitting to his right .
Her eyes well up with tears as she is overcome by emotion .
The man ’s date ?
His 25 - year - old daughter .
Welcome to Colorado Springs ’ Seventh Annual Father - Daughter Purity Ball , held at the five - star Broadmoor Hotel .
The event ’s purpose is , in part , to celebrate dad - daughter bonding , but the main agenda is for fathers to vow to protect the girls ’ chastity until they marry and for the daughters to promise to stay pure .
Pastor Randy Wilson , host of the event and cofounder of the ball , strides to the front of the room , takes the microphone and asks the men , " Are you ready to war for your daughters ’ purity ? "
. . .
The older girls at the Broadmoor tonight are themselves curvaceous and sexy in backless dresses and artful makeup ; next to their fathers , some look disconcertingly like wives .
In fact , in the parlance of the purity ball folks , one - on - one time with dad is a " date , " and the only sanctioned one a girl can have until she is " courted " by a man .
The roles are clear : Dad is the only man in a girl ’s life until her husband arrives , a lifestyle straight out of biblical times .
" In patriarchy , a father owns a girl ’s sexuality , " notes psychologist and feminist author Carol Gilligan , Ph.D.
" And like any other property , he guards it , protects it , even loves it . "
When it ’s time for dads and daughters to take the pledge ( some informally exchange rings as well ) , the men stand over their seated daughters and read aloud from parchment imprinted with the covenant : " I , [ father ’s name ] , choose before God to cover my daughter as her authority and protection in the area of purity .... "
The men inscribe their names and their daughters sign as witnesses .
Then everyone returns to their meals and an excited buzz fills the room .
. . .
With his bright smile , steady eye contact and the erect posture of a small but confident man , he reminds me of the magnetic self - help guru that Tom Cruise portrayed in Magnolia .
" Way to go , men ! " Wilson says .
" I applaud your courage to look your daughter in the eye and tell her how beautiful she is .
If you have n’t done it yet , I ’ll give you a chance to do it right now . "
No , I am not making this up .
I could not make this up if I tried .
They are literally holding mock weddings of girls to their own dads in these " purity balls " .
This is stuff that I am very , very thankful was not in fashion so much when I was growing up in a dominionist household , because frankly this is chunder - inducing to me .
Most of the kids who attend these are , to put it mildly , sheltered to an extent that apparently even kissing is a form of sex , and -- increasingly - - marriages are de facto arranged :
Randy Wilson ’s 19 - year - old , Khrystian , is typical :
She works at her church , spends most weekends at home with her family and has never danced with a male other than her father or brother .
Emily Smith , an 18 - year - old I meet , says that even kissing is out for her .
" I made a promise to myself when I was younger , " she says , " to save my first kiss for my wedding day . "
A tenet of the abstinence movement is that having lovers before marriage often leads to divorce .
In the Wilsons ’ community , young women hope to meet suitors at church , at college or through family connections .
. . .
When I point out to Christy Parcha ’s father , Mike , that experience with relationships , bumps and all , can help young women mature emotionally and become ready for sex and marriage , he warily concedes that ’s true .
" But there can be damage , too , " he says .
" I guess we ’d rather err on the side of avoiding these things .
The girl can learn after marriage . "
Like other fathers I speak with , Parcha says that if his daughter were to fail in her quest to be pure , she would be met with " grace and forgiveness . "
But , he continues , " I am not worried about that .
She is not even going to come close to those situations .
She believes , and I do too , that her husband will come through our family connections or through me before her heart even gets involved . "
Randy Wilson ’s oldest daughter , Lauren , 22 , met her fiance , Brett , a young man from the Air Force Academy , at church , and other fathers and daughters mention this to me as a hopeful sign that God will open similar doors for them .
God has been throwing some curveballs lately , though ; a week before the ball , Mike and Christy Parcha ’s pastor , Ted Haggard , a man who has openly railed against gay marriage , made headlines nationwide when he admitted to receiving a massage from a man ( one who claimed Haggard had paid him for sex ) , showing how at odds what is preached and what is practiced can be .
. . .
When Lauren Wilson hit adolescence , her father gave her a purity ring and a charm necklace with a tiny lock and key .
Randy Wilson took the key , which he will hand over to her husband on their wedding day .
The image of a locked area behind which a girl stores all of her messy desires until one day a man comes along with the key haunts me .
And no , sexual maturity is n't required to participate .
Menstruation and the use of training bras is n't required to participate .
Knowing how to read stuff more advanced than " Veggietales " picture books is not a requirement :
The majority of the girls here are , as purity ball guidelines suggest , " just old enough ...[ to ] have begun menstruating .... "
But a couple dozen fathers have also brought girls under 10 .
" This evening is more about spending time with her than her purity at this point , " says one seven - year - old ’s dad , a trifle sheepishly .
The event is seemingly innocent — not once do I hear " sex " or " virgin " cross anyone ’s lips .
Still , every one of the girls here , even the four - year - old , will sign that purity covenant .
Yes , you read this right .
Seven - year - olds , even four - year - olds , are being taken to these things .
Signing " purity contracts " at ages when they probably do n't even know that " boys have a penis , girls have a vagina " ( much less how the plumbing works ) .
Of course , it could be argued that even the older ones do n't understand what they 're giving away to dear old Dad .
A USA Today article on the phenomenon of " purity balls " discusses how these disturbing events pretty much are the moral equivalent of the infamous Sea Org " billion - year contracts " in Scientology :
Yet there is something profoundly disturbing about these purity balls and all they represent .
They reflect , and worse , they romanticize , several of the most pernicious aspects of patriarchal religion .
From their inception , Wilson envisioned them as events where young girls " could walk into everything that their femininity is about , their beauty , their dress , their makeup . "
Daddy 's little girl — and some of them are little indeed , ages 10 and up — gets to dress up and be treated like a " princess , " often with reference to Psalm 45:13 : " All glorious is the princess within . "
But the pampering comes at the price of her sexual self - agency .
Many of these girls are pledging away something they do n't even understand they have .
Those old enough to comprehend the pledge they are making to dear old Dad know they are literally placing their sexuality in his hands .
Daddy 's little girl is his baby , until he hands her off to her husband .

Tomorrow , we focus on some of the " lighter " promoters of religiously motivated child abuse and the practical problems encountered by those trying to escape these situations .
Jack Abramoff , the once - powerful Republican lobbyist , was sentenced Thursday to four years in prison for his leading role in a wide - ranging corruption scandal that rocked Congress and the Bush administration .
As family members and angry former clients looked on , U.S. District Judge Ellen S. Huvelle pronounced sentence after a tearful Abramoff , admitting that he had “ happily and arrogantly engaged ” in a corrupt lifestyle , made a plea for leniency .
“ I come before you today as a broken man , ” he said .
“ My name is the butt of jokes , the source of laughs , the title of scandals , the synonym for perfidy , and I am not sure that will ever change .
. . .
I am so sorry I put everyone through all this . ”
The sentence means that Abramoff , who has been imprisoned since November 2006 on a separate Florida fraud conviction , will spend what Huvelle described as “ just shy of six years in prison . ”
The two sentences will be served at the same time , the judge said .

In the case heard Thursday , federal sentencing guidelines recommend a minimum sentence of 10 years and one month .
Huvelle said the sharp reduction was appropriate because of Abramoff ’s cooperation in the cases against 10 other people , including former Rep. Bob Ney ( R - Ohio ) and the former No. 2 official at the Interior Department , J. Steven Griles .
Both prosecutors and defense lawyers had sought an even lesser sentence , but Huvelle rejected those requests , citing Abramoff ’s central role in the scandal .
“ Your fraud activities are really quite multifaceted , ” she told Abramoff .
“ These activities corrupted the political process and deprived the public of the honest services of their public officials . ”
The courtroom drama was the final chapter in a stunning fall from grace for one of Washington ’s most powerful figures , whose web of influence -- and crimes -- came to snare figures in the Bush administration , members of Congress and their top aides .

Abramoff pleaded guilty in January 2006 to fraud , tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials by showering them with gifts and inducing them to take official action on behalf of his lobbying group .
The largesse included the use of luxury suites at Washington - area sports venues , free meals at an upscale restaurant Abramoff owned and an all - expenses - paid golf outing to Scotland .
Clad in khaki pants and a faded brown T - shirt , Abramoff remained stoic through much of Thursday ’s hearing , seated facing Huvelle with his hands folded in his lap .
He wiped away a tear while a member of an Indian tribe he once represented asked the judge to impose a lesser sentence because of the millions of dollars in federal aid Abramoff had brought the tribe .
Others , however , urged Huvelle to throw the book at the defendant .
“ His actions have caused a dark stain not only on the tribes that hired him but on Indian country as a whole , ” said Brian Sprague , a former member of the governing council of the Saginaw Chippewa tribe in Michigan , a former Abramoff client .

“ Thank you , Jack , ” Sprague said facetiously , turning from the lectern to address Abramoff directly .
Although acknowledging the seriousness of his client ’s crimes , Abramoff ’s lawyer , Abbe Lowell , told Huvelle that some offenses attributed to Abramoff had been exaggerated , and that some clients were overlooking the benefits of the access Abramoff brought them .
“ This is a case where the myth of Jack Abramoff can overtake the actual man , ” Lowell said .
“ Jack is here to make an accounting for his actions -- those that were wrong and those that were not . ”
Abramoff has already served 21 months of a 70 - month sentence for mail and wire fraud in a separate case involving the purchase of a casino - boat business in Florida .
The Justice Department has asked the judge in that case to reduce that sentence as well because of help Abramoff provided prosecutors .

Club Penguin Anonymous
My son Nicholas , age 5 , recently discovered the internet .
Last week I got him an account at Club Penguin , a website for kids .
Since then , he has spent hours at a time on Club Penguin .
He refuses to come to meals .
He throws tantrums if forced to stop .
Even when enticed with activities he used to find enjoyable , like terrorizing the cat , he remains fixated on the computer screen .
I was shocked yesterday when he asked me to cancel his Club Penguin account .
“ Why ? ” I asked .
“ Are you tired of it already ? ”
“ No , I love it , ” he replied .
“ It is just that once I start , I ca n’t get off of it . ”
Used for Decades as an Allergy Drug , Dimebon now Shows Promise in Treating Alzheimer 's Patients
By Salynn Boyles
WebMD Health News
Reviewed By Louise Chang , MD
April 17 , 2008 — A nearly forgotten allergy drug first used in Russia more than two decades ago is showing promise for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease .
In a study of the antihistamine Dimebon , Alzheimer 's patients with mild to moderate disease continued to show improvements in memory , thinking , and daily and overall functioning over six months of treatment .
Some patients showed improvements when treated for up to a year .
Results from the Russian study were presented this week at the 60th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology ( AAN ) in Chicago .
Study results were also reported last summer at an international conference on Alzheimer 's disease .
Dimebon Alzheimer 's Trial
Dimebon was approved as an antihistamine in Russia in the early 1980s .
It attracted attention as a potential Alzheimer 's treatment following positive animal studies in 2000 .
The human trial conducted in Russia included 183 patients with mild - to - moderate disease treated for six months with either Dimebon or placebo .
Some patients continued to take the antihistamine for as long as a year .
Researchers reported significant improvement in memory , thinking , and other cognitive measures over placebo in as little as 12 weeks , and the differences were maintained over six months to a year .
Tests to measure mental function and interviews with caregivers confirmed improvements or disease stabilization in 81 % of the Dimebon - treated patients after six months .
In a presentation delivered Thursday at the AAN meeting , Steven H. Ferris , PhD , reported that the drug 's impact in Alzheimer 's patients appears to be broad , rather than selective .
Ferris directs the Alzheimer 's Disease Center at NYU School of Medicine .
" Our sub - analysis of the trial results suggests a broad , general benefit affecting language , memory , and other domains of cognition , " Ferris tells WebMD .
International Trial Planned
The biopharmaceutical company Medivation Inc. , which hopes to market Dimebon for the treatment of Alzheimer 's in the U.S. , is funding a second study of the drug to be conducted in the U.S. , Europe , and South America .
If the earlier findings are confirmed , Medivation Inc. CEO David Hung , MD , tells WebMD that the company plans to petition the FDA for the drug 's approval as an Alzheimer 's treatment in 2010 .
Dimebon has not been compared to the currently approved Alzheimer 's drugs , but Hung says there are suggestions from the Russian study that it has a different mechanism of action that is unrelated to its antihistamine properties .
Three of the drugs — Aricept , Razadyne , and Exelon — block the activity of an enzyme in the brain called cholinesterase and are approved for the treatment of mild to moderate disease .
" What happens in Alzheimer 's disease is that the neurons in the area of the brain that govern memory and thinking get sick and die , " Hung says .
" The cholinesterase inhibitors can slow this down , but they do n't keep the cells from dying . "
Early findings suggest that Dimebon may keep the neurons alive and even make sick neurons healthy again , he says .
Because many patients in the Russian trial showed improvements in memory and other aspects of mental functioning over time , there is some suggestion that the drug could modify the course of Alzheimer 's disease .
Longer , rigorously designed studies would be needed to prove this , however .
Alzheimer 's disease researcher Steven DeKosky , MD , who was not involved with the Dimebon research , calls the findings from the Russian study very promising .
But he adds that the findings must be confirmed .
DeKosky directs the Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh .
" If the Russian findings hold up , that would be a big deal , " he tells WebMD .
" There is n't anything out there that works as well as this drug appeared to in that study .
But there are still a lot of unanswered questions .
We will know more when the phase III international trial is completed . "

Those Damn Short Sellers Are Just Killing It !
There were a sew of articles in the papers today about just how much money those damned shorts are making !
First up , the WSJ , who looked at who was killing it :
" Some hedge - fund stars of 2007 are having an encore year .
In the process , they are defying skeptics who questioned whether they could keep their runs going .
John Paulson , who directed Paulson & Co. to gains of almost $ 15 billion last year , is up as much as 20 % in some of his hedge funds through June 30 , according to investors , thanks to continued bets on the woes of financial companies .
Philip Falcone , who saw gains of about 120 % in his largest hedge fund in 2007 , gained 42 % through June in that fund , Harbinger Capital Partners I , from various commodity - related investments , among other areas .
It is n't necessarily surprising that investors who wagered against mortgage and housing - related investments are excelling , since the housing troubles have spilled over into 2008 .
The real challenge for these managers will be turning in similar performances when that gambit has run its course . "
Next up , Bloomberg focused on the total amount wagered on the short side :
" Investors worldwide are betting more than $ 1 trillion on a collapse in stock prices .
Managers from William Ackman to Jim Rogers made a total of at least $ 1.4 billion in July with wagers against U.S. mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , data compiled by Bloomberg as of last week show .
Harbinger Capital Partners staked $ 665 million that U.K. mortgage lender HBOS Plc would drop and Sao Paulo - based hedge - fund manager Francisco Meirelles de Andrade 's short selling of Cia .
Vale do Rio Doce is also paying off .
More than $ 1.4 trillion of equities worldwide are now on loan , about a third higher than at the start of 2007 , data compiled by Spitalfields Advisors , the London - based firm specializing in securities lending , show .
Almost all of that is being used to speculate that shares will fall , according to James Angel , a finance professor at Georgetown University who studies short selling .
The global economic slowdown , $ 453 billion in bank losses and an explosion of funds that can profit from stock declines spurred the increase in short selling , helping send 22 of 23 countries in the MSCI World Index into bear markets . "
Next , the FT had an interesting twist :
The brokers and iBanks are making lucrative trades lending out shares to shorts !
" Conservative fund management firms and custody banks are making billions of dollars from short - selling by lending stocks to facilitate such trades in exchange for lucrative fees .
Even as short - sellers attract blame for driving big falls in financial stocks , financial services firms – including those targeted by short - sellers – are profiting from the investing strategy .
US prime brokerage firms , most of which are owned by big Wall St banks , will reap revenue of $ 11bn ( £ 5.5 bn ) this year , according to a recent study by Tabb Group , a research business .
Prime brokerage units provide services to hedge funds .
They do not reveal their financial results , but executives who work for the units say they make most of their money from lending to short - sellers . "
Funny -- no one really looked at the reasons why the shorts were killing it -- namely , the credit and derivative system run amok , a toothless SEC and a Federal Reserve that was guilty of malfeasance in terms of their obligations to regulate lending institutions .
However , this Bloomberg quote at least makes an attempt to explain the purpose shorts serve in the investment eco-system :
" Short sellers are a very important part of the ecosystem of our financial markets , '' said Angel , a professor at Georgetown 's McDonough School of Business in Washington .
`` The same way that lions go after a herd , they go after the weaker animals .
The shorts will pick on a company where there 's a legitimate controversy over its valuation . ''

Linus Torvalds needs no introduction in operating systems or open - source circles .
He 's the creator , muse and chief developer of the Linux operating system .
Torvalds started Linux while he was in college in 1991 .
Today , Linux is the foundation of multibillion - dollar companies including Oracle , Novell and Red Hat .
It 's used on computers from small office servers and home office desktops to the New York Stock Exchange .
Torvalds does this by managing a self - selected team of over a thousand developers around the world , united only by a mailing list ( the Linux Kernel Mailing List ) and a source - code management system ( Git ) .
Torvalds herds
Linux programming cats from multiple major companies , such as IBM , Intel and SGI , as well as the occasional stereotypical developer programming in a basement .
How does he do it ?
Find people you can trust .
My personal guiding principle is that I try very hard to find people I can trust , and then try to get out of their way as much as possible .
I do n't mean totally unconditional trust ; but on the other hand , once somebody maintains something , he really should be able to make all the normal daily decisions .
Be trustworthy yourself .
I , in turn , try to make myself as trustworthy as I can .
And in this context , " trustworthy " is a lot about not surprising people .
In other words , it 's not some kind of fuzzy , feel - good Kumbaya trust where we all love each other ; it 's more about the fact that people know my opinions and where I stand on things .
While they may not necessarily like or agree with them all , at least they can trust me to be reliable .
Be honest — sometimes painfully honest .
Part of that , by the way , is not feeling shy about saying impolite things or showing some emotion .
So I 'd rather flame people for doing stupid things and call them stupid , rather than try to be too polite to the point where people did n't understand how strongly I felt about something .
There 's the saying , " On the Internet , nobody can hear you being subtle . "
Okay , so the saying is really , " On the Internet , nobody knows you 're a dog " or any number of other things , but my saying is the " hear you being subtle " one .
That 's because , to be blunt , subtlety or sarcasm simply does n't get through , or it may not translate to other cultures .
You also have to let the others get their say in .
Part of that , of course , is ending up having to sometimes say , " I was wrong . "
That can be hard .
But I make it easier for me by often writing my flames something along the lines of : " You 're a completely incompetent idiot , and I 'm not going to apply this patch because it 's obviously broken and is a total piece of sh*t .
And here 's why ... "
But then at the end I 'll include :
" And hey , maybe I 'm just being a d*ck , and you can prove me right , so please explain to me why you did that horrible thing .
Please ?
Hmm ? "
This gives people the ability to tell me I 'm being a d*ckhead and I was wrong , and that all the reasons I called them idiots were actually bogus .
Of course , it does n't happen all that often .
Or maybe it does , and people are just too polite to point it out in public .
Not that I 've met all that many polite people in kernel development , but that 's probably because I 've scared them all away .
A combination of bluntness and honesty leads to the best code ending up in Linux .
Anyway , the theory goes that it 's better that people know how you feel than then to be surprised by it later when you simply refuse to take their code .
Or — even worse — if you end up taking crap code because you feel it's too hard to call it crap and to tell them why you refuse .
Additonal Note : When Torvalds speaks , people listen .
What Torvalds did n't mention is that many other open - source projects have floundered when they try to get everyone working in the same direction .
While Torvalds ' methods may sound harsh , they have also worked for more than a decade .
One reason this is so is because when Torvalds is wrong , he 's willing to admit it .
In other projects ( not just software development projects ) , a refusal to ever admit fault decreases confidence in a leader and lowers morale .
Perhaps the most important reason that Torvalds ' methods work is that he commands enormous respect in programming circles .
When Torvalds flames someone , developers listen to his specific complaints .
They do n't dismiss his comments as mere insults or evidence that Torvalds really does n't understand their work .
In other development circles , programmers might walk out ; in Linux , the best developers stick it out , because they know that Torvalds really does know what he 's talking about .

The US military provided combat training to 80 Georgian special forces commandos only months prior to Georgia ’s army assault in South Ossetia in August .
The revelation , based on recruitment documents and interviews with US military trainers obtained by the Financial Times , could add fuel to accusations by Vlad­imir Putin , Russian prime minister , last month that the US had “ orchestrated ” the war in the Georgian enclave .
The training was provided by senior US soldiers and two military contractors .
There is no evidence that the contractors or the Pentagon , which hired them , knew that the commandos they were training were likely be used in the assault on South Ossetia .
A US army spokesman said the goal of the programme was to train the commandos for duty in Afghanistan as part of Nato - led International Security Assist­ance Force .
The programme , however , highlights the often unintended consequences of US “ train and equip ” programmes in foreign countries .
The contractors — MPRI and American Systems , both based in Virginia — recruited a 15 - man team of former special forces soldiers to train the Georgians at the Vashlijvari special forces base on the outskirts of Tbilisi , part of a programme run by the US defence department .
MPRI was hired by the Pentagon in 1995 to train the Croatian military prior to their invasion of the ethnically - Serbian Krajina region , which led to the displacement of 200,000 refugees and was one of the worst incidents of ethnic cleansing in the Balkan wars .
MPRI denies any wrongdoing .
US training of the Georgian army is a big flashpoint between Washington and Moscow .
Mr Putin said on CNN on August 29 : “ It is not just that the American side could not restrain the Georgian leadership from this criminal act [ of intervening in South Ossetia ] .
The American side in effect armed and trained the Georgian army . ”
The first phase of the special forces training was held between January and April this year , concentrating on “ basic special forces skills ” said an American Systems employee interviewed by phone from the US army ’s Fort Bragg .
The US military official familiar with the programme said the Pentagon hired the military contracting firms to help supplement its own trainers because of a lack of manpower .
The second 70 - day phase was set to begin on August 11 , a few days after war broke out in South Ossetia .
The trainers arrived on August 3 , four days before the conflict flared on August 7 .
“ They would have only seen the inside of a hotel room , ” quipped one former contractor .
Neither MPRI nor American Systems would speak at length to the FT about the programme .
American Systems di­rected questions to the US army ’s Security Assistance Training Management Organisation ( Satmo ) at Fort Bragg , part of the US Army ’s Special Warfare Center School .
Satmo sends trainers , mainly special forces but also contractors , to countries such as Yemen , Colombia and the Philippines .
Satmo trainers generally work with forces involved in counter - insurgencies , counter - terrorism or civil wars .
A Satmo spokesman declined to comment .
One US military official familiar with the programme said it emerged from a Georgian offer to the US in December 2006 to send commandos to Afghanistan to work alongside American special operations forces .
According to this person , the US told Georgia that the offer should be made through Nato , which welcomed the offer but informed Georgia that its forces would need additional training to meet the military alliance ’s standards .
While the programme is not classified , there is a lack of transparency surrounding it , though US military officials said the lack of publicity was not part of an effort to keep the programme secret .
Other US military training programmes in Georgia have their own websites and photo galleries .
A US European Command spokesman confirmed the existence of the programme only after reviewing an e-mail sent by MPRI recruiters that was obtained by the FT .
According to the e-mail , which did not mention Nato operations , former US special operations forces would receive $ 2,000 ( $ 1,150 , â‚ ¬1,400 ) a week plus costs as trainers .
“ We can confirm the pro­gramme exists , but due to its nature and training ob­jectives we do not discuss specifics to ensure the integrity of the programme and force protection of the trainers and participants , ” he said .
James Appathurai , Nato ’s spokesman in Brussels , said : “ Georgia has made an offer to provide forces to Isaf in the last two years .
But until now these Georgian forces have not joined the Isaf mission . ”
An official at a senior Nato member state said it was understood that the forces had been trained by the US , but that the forces had not passed a certification process under which all potential members of the Isaf mission are vetted .

Conflict in the Caucasus
The conflict between Russia and Georgia began on the night of August 7 , when Georgian forces , including commando units , tanks and artillery , assaulted the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali .
Russia says that at least 133 civilians died in the attack , as well as 59 of its own peacekeepers , according to figures released this week .
In response Russia launched a mass invasion and aerial bombardment of Georgia , in which 215 Georgians have died , including 146 soldiers and 69 civilians .

Earlier this year , for instance , when the hedge fund manager David Einhorn was making his public case against Lehman ( he now refuses to talk about the firm ) , he stressed his belief that Lehman was valuing its securities too high .
He turned out to be exactly right .
Every time the market was roiled — especially after the Bear Stearns collapse — every firm on Wall Street had to re-mark their securities to reflect the new reality .
That ’s why you saw firms taking billion - dollar write - off after billion - dollar write - off , long after they thought they had taken care of the problem .
And it is also why the write - offs will continue now that Lehman is bankrupt .
“ Selling begets more selling , ” said Sean Egan of the independent bond - rating firm Egan - Jones .
And yet , even as they lowered the value of their mortgage - backed securities , firms like Lehman had still priced them too high .
Back when he was talking publicly about Lehman , Mr. Einhorn used to cast Lehman ’s mark - to - market pricing as an act of dishonesty .
I tend to think it was more like wishful thinking .
Either way , the result was the same .
A week ago , even as the government was bailing out Fannie and Freddie , Mr. Fuld went off to seek new capital — something Lehman desperately needed to shore up its decimated balance sheet — from the Korea Development Bank .
Why did those talks break down ?
Because Mr. Fuld wanted more for Lehman than the Koreans thought it was worth .
He simply could n’t face the reality that his firm was n’t worth what he thought it was .
Now look at his next - door neighbor , John Thain at Merrill Lynch .
To be sure , Mr. Thain owned a better house — although Merrill Lynch also had billions in toxic securities , its bread - and - butter is its brokerage arm .
It is fundamentally a gatherer of assets , not a bond - trader .
But there is another big difference between the firms .
Unlike Mr. Fuld , who had run Lehman since 1993 and is the architect of the modern Lehman , Mr. Thain had been at Merrill Lynch just since December , when he was brought in to stanch the bleeding .
He did n’t have the same pride of ownership in Merrill that Mr. Fuld had in Lehman .
That is why he was willing to sell $ 31 billion worth of mortgage - backed derivatives for 22 cents on the dollar in late July — far lower than many firms had been pricing those securities .
And that is also why , seeing what had happened to Bear Stearns , Fannie and Freddie , and Lehman Brothers , he took the pre-emptive step of selling Merrill Lynch to Bank of America .
In the process , he got $ 50 billion for Merrill ’s shareholders .
True , that was half of what Merrill was worth a year ago , and a once - proud name is about to be swallowed up by a commercial bank .
But he also got $ 50 billion more than Mr. Fuld got for his shareholders — and being sold is a lot better than being liquidated .

If you , my fellow Americans , will not demand the impeachment of the worst president in American history , a man who is a traitor to our Constitution , a global tyrant , a destroyer of world peace and order , and a threat to the survival of human life on this planet , who will you impeach ?
This George W. Bush , this native - born nincompoop , this dangerous dunce , this wastrel , this smirking twister of truth , this forked - tongued liar in a business suit , this heinous torturer , this killer of innocents , this Thief - of - Baghdad , this mass murderer , this fountainhead of human vomit , in short , this blot on the very name of America , must be compelled by Congress and the American People to answer for his alleged and apparent crimes .
He , and every culpable member of his Gang must be impeached and made to stand trial before the Senate for the Genocide of Iraq and countless other criminal acts .
One of the least of his crimes , ordering wiretaps without court order in violation of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , entitles him to a five - year vacation at Leavenworth for trampling the Fourth Amendment ’s protection against unreasonable search and seizure .
And his most heinous crime , the war of aggression against Iraq , violates the U.S. War Crimes
Act of 1996 that subjects perpetrators to imprisonment and the death penalty if a victim dies .
Surely , Americans who are too timid to sign a petition for impeachment might well consider there are 1,100,000 Iraqis who , had they lived , could have signed such a petition with their own blood .
As far back at October , 2005 , an Ipsos Public Affairs poll found 50 % of the public agreed with the statement , “ If President Bush did not tell the truth about his reaons for going to war with Iraq , Congress should consider holding him accountable by impeaching him . ”
Now , as new evidence comes to light each day documenting how Bush and his aides lied this nation into a criminal war of aggression , yes , just as Hitler did when he invaded Poland , just as Stalin did when he invaded Finland , just as Mussolini did when he invaded Ethiopia , just as Hirohito did when he invaded China , the numbers of Americans who want George W. Bush impeached is swelling .
Passively favoring impeachment , though , is not the same as actively demanding it .
At the Constitutional Convention , Ben Franklin insisted on the impeachment provision in the name of fairness , to give the president an opportunity to defend against charges of “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
Otherwise , Franklin said , the only way to remove an errant president would be to assassinate him .
Americans today have more urgent reason to remove King George Bush II from office than the Colonists had for overthrowing King George III and founding this nation .
King George III ’s crimes against the Colonists were as nothing compared to the damage this self - made King George Bush II has visited upon America and Americans , and upon world order .
Even though he is not a king , George Bush conducts himself as one , for he has arrogated to himself sweeping kingly powers , powers seized in secret , powers stolen in the dead of night without debate , powers aggrandized with the cowardly compliance of a lied - to Congress , powers to arrest any citizen , fling the individual in jail , and then throwing away the key ; powers to listen in on any private conversation ; powers to order Pentagon spying on antiwar protesters and the clergy ; powers to enter any home and search and seize without a warrant ; powers to read without a court order any citizen ’s mail and Internet communications ; powers to invade our library records and medical records and financial papers ; powers to nullify the Acts of Congress ; powers to reach around the globe and kidnap any foreigner off any street in any country and to remove him without trial to a dungeon for torture ; powers to invade other countries on lies and pretexts and to dragnet arrest their citizens , powers to tear their citizens away from their native lands and their families and to remove them to distant , secret prisons without recourse to the most primary principles of law , without lawyers , without trials , without habeas corpus , without Red Cross visits , and to detain them forever and there to torture them until bodily disintegration , madness , suicide , or death ; and powers to trample the Geneva Convention against the use of poison weapons by firing ammunition containing radioactive uranium widely across Afghanistan and Iraq , whose deadly discharge is at this moment creating new Hiroshimas and Nagasakis in those countries while poisoning our own troops as well .
Bush ’s invasion of Iraq was no war of self - defense , as claimed , but a crime against peace contrary to the Charter of the United Nations .
The result of this war , which former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called “ illegal , ” has been the destruction of an innocent society ; driving four millions from their homes and creating what the UN has termed Â “ a humanitarian crisis . Â ”
The president must also be put on trial for the mass roundup and arrest of more than 5,000 foreigners living in the United States ; for the military incarceration of U.S. citizens ; for violating the First Amendment rights of Americans ; for violating the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions ; for reinstitution of the notrious “ Cointelpro ” program ; for violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ; for violating Article II of the UN Charter by crimes against peace ; for violating what the UN Committe on Torture declared was the “ ill - treatment ” of detainees in violation of the international Convention Against Torture ; for violating the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare ; for violating the Nuremberg Charter banning the wanton devastation of a city or area ; for violating the Genocide Convention by his massacre of Iraqis ; for violation as Commander - in - Chief of U.S. Army Field Manual Regulation 27 - 10 against conspiracy to commit war crimes ; for usurping the power to imprison people arbitrarily for indefinite periods by making himself judge and jury ; for signing into law the misnamed Patriot Act ’s provision allowing the government to pry into any individual ’s private records , including health care and finances ; for lowering a shroud of secrecy over the operations of the U.S. government ; for willful noncompliance with the Freedom of Information Act ; for failure to faithfully execute the laws of the land including Article VI of the Constitution that holds U.S. treaties “ shall be the supreme law of the land ” ; for withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resuming work on nuclear devices ; for launching an aggressive campaign to militarize space in order to dominate the earth ; for violating the Bacteriological Warfare Covenant by engaging in germ warfare research including the restoration of long dead pathogens that imperil the planet , and for the creation of delivery systems for such pathogens .
My fellow Americans , we cannot wait until the next election .
Our fathers and mothers , our wives and husbands , and our sons and daughters are dying in vain in Iraq by the thousands ; and the death toll of the innocent people of Iraq , whose only crime was the possession of oil , is now more than one million .
It is for all these reasons , and likely for treacheries and treasons yet undiscovered , that the American people must stand up to their sacred obligation to impeach George W. Bush now or go on living as a nation of patsies , stooges , and victims that allow their blood , treasure , and precious freedoms to be squandered by this heartless tyrant .

" I was exhilarated to have survived the operation and then to be told that I did n't have cancer - I could not get my head around the words . "
An attack on Iran , which Israeli and Bush administration officials appear set to carry out if Iranian uranium enrichment is not halted , would ignite a regional war in the Middle East and lead to economic collapse and political upheaval in the United States .
“ In short and simple terms , we would be plunged into a depression that would make the Great Depression of the 1930s in which I spent my childhood look like boom times , ” said William R. Polk , former professor of history at the University of Chicago and a member of the Policy Planning Council under President Kennedy .
“ Industries would fail , banks would collapse , government revenues would dry up , universities would have to close , health care , even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million Americans , would virtually cease .
In short , something like [ what ] the South suffered at the end of the Civil War would plague the country . ”
The passage of vast amounts of oil and liquefied gas through the Persian Gulf would be disrupted .
Iranian attacks , carried out with rocket - and bomb - equipped speedboats and submarines , would be deadly and effective .
A classified Pentagon war game in 2002 simulated these swarming attacks by Iranian speedboats packed with explosives in the gulf ; the Navy lost 16 major warships , according to a report in The New York Times .
Iranian oil , which makes up 8 percent of the world ’s energy supply , would instantly be taken off the market .
And oil would jump to over $ 500 a barrel and perhaps , as the conflict dragged on , to over $ 750 a barrel .
Our petroleum - based economy would come to a halt .
Israel would be hit by Iranian Shahab - 3 ballistic missiles .
Hezbollah , with its new store of Iranian - supplied rockets that allegedly can reach any part of Israel , including Israel ’s nuclear plant at Dimona , would enter the conflict .
Israel would lash back .
Terrorist attacks on U.S. targets would become frequent .
U.S. casualties in Iraq would mount as the Iranians rained missiles down on U.S. bases and installations , including our imperial city , the Green Zone .
Chaos and mayhem would grip the Middle East .
The world financial markets would go haywire .
“ Even at today ’s price , as you know , 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel , ” said Polk , one of the country ’s leading scholars of the Arab world .
“ At double or triple today ’s price , none could fly unless nationalized .
A whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand .
Ironically , war would push America into a form of socialist economy . ”
The U.S. economy is already tottering .
We recently witnessed the second - largest bank failure in U.S. history , and there are fears that as many as 150 banks could fail over the next 12 to 18 months .
There will be 6.5 million foreclosures over the next five years , according to Wall Street analysts .
The government is furiously pumping billions of taxpayer dollars into private corporations to keep them afloat .
The Congress bailed out the shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These bizarre “ government - sponsored enterprises ” own or guarantee half the mortgages in the country — some $ 5.1 trillion .
The Federal Reserve evoked rarely used emergency powers to put billions of taxpayer dollars at risk to stop the meltdown of a non-bank , Bear Stearns , which it never regulated .
More than $ 300 billion has been written down so far .
Losses , by the time we are done , could exceed $ 1 trillion .
The already staggering debt generated by the war in Iraq would mushroom with an attack on Iran .
Fighting wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and Iran , we would soon be struggling to pay off a debt of at least two or three times the present amount .
This is a weight the U.S. economy cannot bear , especially as the dollar tumbles against the euro and other major currencies .
The government has borrowed abroad roughly a quarter of our annual national income in order to pay for the Iraq debacle .
We have been told for the first time by a sovereign fund ( South Korean , one of the world ’s largest ) that it will no longer buy U.S. Treasury bonds .
Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz estimates that the final cost of the war in Iraq , once all the hidden costs are added up , could be as high as $ 7 trillion .
“ Financial capitalism is crashing , ” wrote independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader .
“ So the lights are on late in Washington ’s Federal Reserve , SEC and Treasury Department trying to figure out how socialism ( your tax dollars and credits ) can once again bail out these big - time gamblers with our money .
…
Reckless , self - enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing Washington socialists , for without them , you would surely be in chains . ”
A war with Iran would also have grave political consequences .
The specter of millions of Americans driven out of their homes , no longer able to afford basic necessities , out of work and enraged , would , as it has throughout history , embolden messianic right - wing and proto - fascist movements .
Given the potential for social unrest , basic freedoms would be curtailed and in some cases abolished in the name of order and national security .
The radical fringes of the Christian right could rise up with a vengeance .
They would happily ally themselves with an assortment of oddballs , lunatics and corporate behemoths from Blackwater mercenaries to frightened capitalists at Halliburton .
It was economic collapse , along with a climate of fear and instability , that was used to build the fascist and communist movements that plagued Germany , Italy and the Soviet Union during the last century .
These same forces led to the collapse of the former Yugoslavia .
We are not immune to these distortions .
But maybe those who advocate a war with Iran know all this .
Maybe this is what they want .
Maybe they understand that a war with Iran would finally kill off our weakened and anemic democracy .
Maybe they see this as the dawn of a new era , an era when the last impediments to a global totalitarian capitalism can finally be removed and we can all be ground under the corporate jack boot , from Shanghai to New Delhi to Ohio .
There are huge corporations that make obscene profits from human misery .
They run our health care industry .
They run our oil and gas companies .
They run our bloated weapons industry .
They run Wall Street and the major investment firms .
They run our manufacturing firms .
They also , ominously , run our government .
The Current Population Survey ( CPS ) is a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
It provides a comprehensive body of data on the labor force , employment , unemployment , persons not in the labor force , hours of work , earnings , and other demographic and labor force characteristics .
The union membership rate was 10.3 percent in 2019 , down by 0.2 percentage point from 2018 .
The number of wage and salary workers belonging to unions was little changed at 14.6 million in 2019 .

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 1.4 million in August , and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent .
These improvements in the labor market reflect the continued resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed due to the pandemic , as well as hiring for the 2020 Census .

Global climate change will not only impact plants and animals but will also affect bacteria , fungi and other microbial populations that perform a myriad of functions important to life on earth .
It is not entirely certain what those effects will be , but they could be significant and will probably not be good , say researchers today at a scientific meeting in Boston .
â€ œMicrobes perform a number of critical functions for ecosystems around the world and we are only starting to understand the impact that global change is having on them , â€ says Kathleen Treseder of the University of California , Irvine , at the 108th General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Treseder studied the effect of rising temperatures and fungi on carbon stores in Alaskan boreal forests , one area of the globe that is experiencing greater warming than others .
â€ œThere is a lot of frozen dead material under the snowpack .
There is as much carbon trapped in the soil of northern ecosystems as there is carbon in the atmosphere .
It is a big unknown what is going to happen if these environments heat up , â€ says Treseder .
She started her research with the hypothesis that an increase in temperatures would lead to increased decomposition by fungi .
Since one by - product of decomposition is carbon dioxide , rising temperatures should result in greater carbon dioxide release from the soil .
What she found was that nitrogen levels in the soil increased as temperatures rose , and nitrogen tends to suppress fungal decomposition rates .
â€ œIn reality as temperatures increase we tend to see greater nitrogen availability in the soil .
Nitrogen suppresses activity and diversity .
What we end up seeing is less carbon dioxide production from fungi as temperatures increase in northern ecosystems , â€ says Treseder .
Rising temperatures are also having an effect on snowpack and glaciers and that could be detrimental to the communities of microorganisms living below them .
Steven Schmidt from the University of Colorado and his colleagues have been studying the diverse populations of microorganisms that make their home in the sub - freezing zone underneath glaciers .
â€ œAs global temperatures rise and glaciers retreat , these microorganisms lose their habitat .
They will probably go extinct before we can study them and get a better idea of their contributions , â€ says Schmidt .
He is also studying microbial activity under the snowpack in coniferous forests .
Undersnow microbial activity is especially high in the late winter as the snowpack provides ideal temperatures and moisture for the growth of mats of snow mold .
To the average suburban dweller , snow mold may just be another disease that damages the lawn , but in the coniferous forest ecosystem , these mats serve an important function .
â€ œSnow mold are extremely rapidly growing at very low temperatures â€ “ below freezing and contribute about 10 - 30 % of the total year - round carbon dioxide production at these sitesâ€ says Schmidt .
Snow mold needs a period of a month or two at relatively low temperatures to do its job effectively .
As global temperatures rises the late winter period of subfreezing temperatures will shorten , and snowpacks may be less as well .
â€ œAs the soils warm , snow molds will have less water and will produce less carbon dioxide , which may sound good in terms of global warming , but the trees in this system also depend on snow melt water and will ultimately die under extreme drought , thus leading to an overall decrease in carbon fixation by the system .
The trees may die .
Overall , its probably going to be bad , â€ says Schmidt .
While rising temperatures may be reducing microbial carbon dioxide production , rising levels of carbon dioxide due to human activity can cause subtle but important shifts in the composition of microbial populations , says John Kelly of Loyola University in Chicago .
Kelly is studying the effect of increased carbon dioxide on microbial populations both on the leaves of trees in Northern Michigan and in leaves decomposing in streams and has found a distinct shift in some microbial populations .
This could have an enormous impact on the food chain as the microbes are as much , if not more , a source of nutrients for the small animals that feed on these leaves .
â€ œIt really does look like microbes are sensitive to global changes .
We are just not quite sure how they will respond , â€ says Treseder .

This was followed by the arrival of the Han Chinese to Taiwan wherein they traveled across the Taiwan Strait from Chinese provinces like Fujian and Guangdong .
The Spanish colonizers also tried to establish a settlement in Taiwan at some point during the 17th century .
However , they were driven away by the original colonizers of the island , which would be the Dutch .
The colonizers were eventually defeated by the loyalists to the Ming dynasty in 1662 after they lost control of mainland China .
This prompted them to re-locate to the island of Taiwan .
In fact , several parts of Taiwan ended up being integrated into the rule of the Qing empire .
During World War II , Taiwan served as base for the Japanese .
This explains the influence of the Japanese to the culture of Taiwan , particularly when it comes to imperial educational system .
There were also some Taiwanese that were forced to fight for Japan during the war .
When the war ended , China took control of Taiwan and has since been under the control of the Chinese empire .
Today , Taiwan is named as one of the “ Four Asian Tigers ” , reocognized for their rapid development and economic success .

If only she prayed hard enough , she could make Susan Alamo rise from the dead .
At age 12 , having not set foot outside a religious compound in Arkansas since she was 4 , Elishah Franckiewicz believed it was possible .
Day after day , she lay down beside the corpse , dressed in a wedding gown , for Susan Alamo was " the bride of God .
" And day after day , she endured beatings by church elders because the dead woman -- wife to sect founder Tony Alamo -- did not open her eyes .
" We prayed over her open coffin for months , " said Franckiewicz , now 37 and an English teacher at an area community college .
" When she did n't come back to life , Tony ( Alamo ) started losing his mind .
He believed that it was because the devil was in the children , because we had weak souls . "
On Sunday , the morning after federal investigators raided the Arkansas headquarters of Alamo 's ministry as part of a child pornography investigation , Franckiewicz , for a brief moment , became that 12 - year - old again .
In a resolute voice , she made clear how she and others in the greater Portland area endured and escaped unspeakable abuses at the compound .
Franckiewicz fled in 1985 at age 15 .
Franckiewicz said she and a loose network of adult compound survivors spent Saturday evening on the phone , calling one another from opposite ends of the country to discuss what they could do to help the six children who have been placed in temporary state custody as they are interviewed in the wake of the raid .
" We 've been watching CNN , " Franckiewicz said .
" They announced that authorities were doing what they could to return the children to the parents again as soon as possible , which is the worst thing that could happen . "
Franckiewicz says she was the first baby born at Alamo 's first compound in California .
Years after her escape , she testified against Tony Alamo , now 74 , whom she describes as a " seriously dangerous man , " in his tax evasion trial in 1994 .
For that , he was convicted and served four years in prison for failing to pay taxes in the lucrative line of " Tony Alamo " brand sequined denim jackets he sold in the 1980s .
Franckiewicz said Sunday she decided to tell her story because she worries that the public will be swayed by Alamo 's arguments that his group is being persecuted .
At one time , she says , Alamo was married to 10 girls ages 15 and younger , including her two nieces .
Arkansas police said Saturday that they had received complaints from former ministry members about allegations of child abuse , sexual abuse and polygamy .
In turn , they turned over information about the allegations to the FBI .
Alamo has publicly denied the child abuse allegations .
" I want to talk about this because I am so afraid that once again allegations are just going to somehow find a way of not coming to fruition , " Franckiewicz said .
" He 's been on the news before .
He 's been raided before .
Yet , he 's still here .
My story does n't matter now .
But there are people 's stories who do matter .
They 're more recent .
I want to tell mine so there 'll be safety in numbers . "

The early days
Tony Alamo was n't always Tony Alamo .
He was born Bernie Hoffman .
In the early 1960s , he moved to Los Angeles and assumed the names Marcus Abad and Mark Hoffman and pursued a career in music .
He was briefly incarcerated for a weapon - related offense .
In 1966 , he married Susan Lipowitz , an aspiring actress and Jewish convert to evangelical Christianity who was nine years older than he .
Soon after their marriage , the couple changed their names to Tony and Susan Alamo .
Together , the couple established the Tony and Susan Alamo Christian Foundation in 1969 in Hollywood , Calif .
The Alamos purchased the property north of Los Angeles in 1970 .
Their followers worked for businesses owned by the Alamos or on nearby farms and lived in sex - segregated dormitories .
Punishments varied for those who disobeyed the Alamos .
Penalties ranged from withholding food to beatings to being booted from the church .
Those leaving the church were told they would die , go insane or turn into homosexuals .
Franckiewicz says she was the first child born into that compound , her parents among the group 's original followers .
" A lot of people went there because they were desolate and down and out , homeless and , quite frankly , not all there , " she said .
In 1973 , she said , a magazine infiltrated the compound and wrote a scathing piece that , more or less , labeled it a cult .
Soon after , in part to escape publicity , Franckiewicz says , the group relocated to a new compound in Arkansas and she , at 4 , was brought along .
The new compound was operated much like the one in California .
Followers were expected to get jobs out in the world , Franckiewicz said , but were ordered to give their entire paychecks to the Alamos ' foundation .
Shelter was provided .
But everyone except the Alamos and their " right - hand people " were prohibited from keeping food in their own homes .
Followers ate at the compound 's cafeteria , often with spoiled food gathered from grocery stores and garbage bins .
Franckiewicz said bonds between parents in the compound and their children were often broken and the Alamos made all decisions .
" Whatever the leader says to do , happens , " Franckiewicz said .
" The parents of children in the compound are not what we understand as parents .
They 're not protectors .
They 're not nurturers .
They do whatever Tony tells them to do to their children . "
Children were taught in a school on - site and rarely if ever permitted to leave .
Nearly everything -- including playing house -- was considered " evil , " Franckiewicz said .
Instead of " cowboys and Indians , " she recalls role - playing that " the deprogrammers " were going to come and " turn our minds evil . "
" We did n't know that was n't normal , " she recalls .
" We only knew what they told us . "
Franckiewicz said she and other compound children never attended public school and were educated in the compound .
" We learned that , for instance , the Pope had JFK assassinated and that dinosaurs did n't exist . "
She said that while she was never sexually abused , Alamo still acted strangely to her and other young girls .
" He was very creepy , " she recalls .
" He would grab my face and he'd rub my face and my shoulders and run his finger down my neck .
Many times as he was stroking my face , he 'd spit in my face .
We were thankful that he just did that and not beat us . "
Death and beatings
When Susan Alamo died of cancer April 8 , 1982 , things got even stranger at the Arkansas compound .
According to news reports at the time , Tony Alamo claimed publicly that she would be resurrected .
Local radio stations made fun of the announcement , Franckiewicz recalls .
" They were playing , ' Wake Up , Little Susie , ' over and over again . "
The event was a turning point in Franckiewicz 's life .
" As a child in that environment , " she said , " I believed 100 percent that she was going to rise from the dead . "
Week after week , she recalls attending prayer vigils , and even lying down and curling up next to Susan Alamo 's rotting corpse .
" She smelled , " Franckiewicz said .
" She was cold and really , really hard .
She was dead . "
Soon , children were being subjected to horrible beatings for every day Susan Alamo remained dead .
" That 's my worst memory , " she said .
" The beatings were severe .
We were hit with 2 - by - 6 boards drilled with holes . "
She recalls having to get into a bathtub with her clothes on before getting undressed -- the fabric stuck with dried blood to her open wounds .
Franckiewicz said it was extremely painful because children " started telling on each other in hopes of getting a lesser punishment . "
At one point , Franckiewicz said a thought passed through her mind : " When Grandma Suzie wakes up , she 's really going to be mad that these kids are being beaten like this . "
Immediately , she was terrified that God was going to tell Tony Alamo that she'd had the thought .
The beatings went on , but Tony Alamo never mentioned it .
" Something turned inside me , " Franckiewicz said .
" It was n't that I thought everything he said was a lie , but now I knew at least one thing that was n't right .
" He could n't read my thoughts . "
Escape
About six months after she died , Susan Alamo was placed in a mausoleum .
Franckiewicz was despondent .
She comforted herself by lying on the mausoleum marble , running her index finger in the grooves of Susan Alamo 's carved nameplate , still praying the dead woman would rise .
Franckiewicz said she felt guilt and shame , as if she were responsible for Alamo 's continued death , and all the souls that would n't be saved as a result .
The next year , in 1984 , at age 14 , Franckiewicz ran away .
" It was ' Little House on the Prairie ' meets 1985 , " she said .
" At first , I did n't tell the police where I was from , but they knew . "
Franckiewicz said social workers became involved and eventually sent her back to the compound with regular state welfare checks .
The beatings stopped .
But Franckiewicz was still afraid .
The day the social worker was scheduled to close the case , she followed him to his car .
" I told him he could n't leave me there , " she recalls .
" I told him , ' You do n't understand what 's going to happen to me if you do . '
He said , ' I do n't have a place to put you , sweetie . '
He left me there , and that night I was beaten unconscious . "
Soon after , she said , a man came to the compound to visit his brother .
He stayed for a while and noticed Franckiewicz .
" He said I was the saddest person he had ever seen , " she said .
Ten years older than she , Steve Franckiewicz promised that he would rescue her .
One time , someone caught them talking in the compound 's tape library , which housed all of the recordings of Tony Alamo 's sermons .
As a result , Steve Franckiewicz was kicked out of the compound and Elishah was " beaten within an inch of my life . "
Six months later , in a car disguised as the one driven by her grandparents , Steve Franckiewicz drove into the compound and whisked her away .
By the time anyone knew she was gone , they were already several states away .
Tax fraud
In 1985 , the year Elishah Franckiewicz fled , the IRS revoked the tax - exempt status of Alamo 's church .
Three years later , he was charged with child abuse for ordering followers to beat an 11 - year - old boy .
But charges were dropped for lack of evidence .
The child 's parents sued Alamo and won a $ 1.5 million judgment .
In 1991 , Alamo ordered his followers to bring along his first wife 's body when they evacuated the Tony and Susan Alamo Christian Foundation compound in Crawford County , Ark .
The compound was about to be raided by federal marshals in the wake of a civil lawsuit against Alamo .
The following year , a Memphis , Tenn. , grand jury indicted Alamo for evading income taxes in the late 1980s .
Soon after , Alamo became a fugitive .
In 1994 , he was convicted on the tax charges after Franckiewicz and others who grew up in the compound testified , saying that they had been abused as children and had helped him falsify documents .
At his sentencing , former church members testified that Alamo was a polygamist and had several young wives .
Alamo served four years in prison .
At the time , he owed the government $ 7.9 million .
Franckiewicz said her parents left the compound several years ago but " really still believe much of what was taught there . "
She and her siblings , including one who lives in Portland , have no contact with them .
After a slow courtship , Franckiewicz married Steve .
This week , they will celebrate their 22nd wedding anniversary .
They have an adult child who 's in college .
After leaving the compound , Franckiewicz 's English language skills tested below those of people for whom English is a second language .
But she persevered .
Today , she holds a bachelor 's degree in English from the University of California at Davis after graduating with highest honors and holds a master 's from California State University .
Franckiewicz says she hopes that in telling her story , others will share theirs .
" Tony Alamo says he has an army -- the army of God , " she said .
" We , the survivors , have one , too .
Each other . "

It has come to this : Zimbabwe is about to run out of the paper to print money on .
Fidelity Printers & Refiners , the state - owned company that tirelessly churns out bank notes for the Robert Mugabe regime , was thrown into a crisis early this month after a German company stopped supplying bank note paper because of concerns over Zimbabwe ’s recent violent presidential election , widely seen as fraudulent by international observers .
The printing operation drastically slowed .
Two - thirds of the 1,000 - strong workforce was ordered to go on leave , and two of the three money - printing shifts were canceled .
The result on the streets was an immediate cash crunch .
Advertisement
“ If you think this currency shortage is bad , wait two weeks .
By then it will be a disaster , ” said a senior Fidelity staffer , who spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity because he would face dismissal and possible violence for talking to a Western journalist .
The paper will run out in two weeks , he said .
Fidelity Printers is Mugabe ’s lifeline .
It prints the money to pay the police , soldiers and intelligence organs that keep the regime in power .
Lately , the money has been used to set up a network of command bases around the country staffed by liberation war veterans and youth militias , hired muscle to terrify the population into voting for Mugabe in the June 27 presidential runoff election .
If the regime ca n’t pay the security forces on which it relies , it would face economic paralysis -- and potential collapse .
Zimbabwe ’s economic meltdown harks back to the collapse of its major export industry , commercial farming , after Mugabe ’s controversial land reform program early in the decade .
That left the nation starved of foreign exchange , but government spending went on .
Advertisement
How did it do that ?
It printed money .
But printing more and more money without an increase in productivity fueled rampant hyperinflation .
As hyperinflation spiraled last year , Fidelity printed million - dollar notes , then 5 - million , 10 - million , 25 - million , 50 - million .
This year , it has been forced to print 100 - million , 250 - million and 500 - million notes in rapid succession , all now practically worthless .
The highest denomination is now 50 billion Zimbabwean dollars ( worth a U.S. dollar on the street ) .
Despite the recent currency shortage , the Zimbabwean dollar has continued to slide against the U.S. dollar and shopkeepers are still increasing their prices steeply .
The price of the state - owned Herald newspaper has leaped from 200,000 Zimbabwean dollars early this month to 25 billion now .
Before the crunch , a beer at a bar in Harare , the capital , cost 15 billion Zimbabwean dollars .
At 5 p.m. July 4 , it cost 100 billion ( $ 4 at the time ) in the same bar .
An hour later , the price had gone up to 150 billion ( $ 6 ) .

Apart from the paper crisis , the real fear inside Fidelity is that its software license for the European bank note design technology that it uses could be withdrawn because of new sanctions threatened against the Mugabe regime , the staffer said .
The design department is crucial :
It must constantly conceive new notes as those on the streets are rendered worthless by hyperinflation .
“ If that happened , that would be it , ” the staffer said .
The internal workings of Fidelity Printers have been one of the regime ’s best - kept secrets for years .
But as the government looks increasingly tenuous , institutions that were once impossible to penetrate are starting to show cracks .
Fidelity may be the beating heart of the regime , but the staffer revealed an institution under severe pressure .

The place pulsates with sound and smells of ink .
The printing machines are old and frequently break down , requiring spare parts from Germany , which will no longer arrive .
Workers are unhappy about salaries and fear for their jobs because of the paper shortage .
“ When the machines were operating 24 hours a day , there was so much pressure on the employees that they just could not take , ” he said .
“ You could n’t take time off .
Even weekends , people had to come in .
“ People are aware that printing money is also one of the causes of the inflation .
But you know , it ’s a job .
You ’ve got to do it . ”
Now that the production has slowed , the pressure of working full time is replaced with the terror of being laid off , he said .
The plant is planning to use paper from a local producer , but that manufacturer already has trouble meeting its orders for paper for checks .

As the currency shortage took hold on the streets this month , the capital ’s myriad currency dealers found it harder to make a profit .
Here ’s how the currency black market works :
Dealers get local currency illegally through the back door of the reserve bank or from tellers who will provide cash in return for a payoff .
They sell it at a profit to locals with foreign currency , gotten by trading in neighboring countries or through remittances from Zimbabwe ’s huge diaspora .
On the first floor of a building downtown , the black market currency - dealing offices attract some of the city ’s best and brightest young graduates .
One office looks like something out of a Chicago gangster movie .
The boss , impeccably dressed , sits behind a desk .
On his right , in a white cap and suit , sits one of the dealers .
A Mugabe election poster is plastered on the wall .
On a cabinet is a framed $ 10 note -- which generates as much nostalgia around here as a much - loved but extinct fluffy mammal .
Advertisement
“ That was real money , ” cracks the boss .
Everyone laughs , though the joke is not funny .
Tendei , 34 , one of the black market dealers , gave up a good job as sales manager of a large Western company in 2003 because the salary did not cover his commuting and other costs .
In recent weeks , until the German paper supply stopped , the government had accelerated its money printing , with fresh notes constantly seen on the streets .
Advertisement
“ They were just printing money to pay all the militias , ” Tendei said .
“ Inflation is now out of control .
Nobody can control it . ”
For most Zimbabweans , the economic crisis boils down to one thing : how to put food on the table .
It ’s a difficult trick when you have no job , or if the bus fare costs more than your pay , and the prices in shops keep going up .
“ Everyone is struggling to keep up with this mounting pressure , day by day , ” said John Robertson , an independent economist here .
“ It ’s a thing that gradually creeps up .
Some people have already succumbed .
Some factories have closed .
More are likely to succumb as prices rise . ”
Another independent economist , Tony Hawkins , said Zimbabwe ’s economy was imploding so fast , some major factories were reporting that it would be a matter of weeks before they would be forced to shut down .
Advertisement
“ The beer and Coke guys are saying they have only six to eight weeks before they will have to close , ” Hawkins said .
“ Some of the smaller banks are screaming .
It ’s accelerating downhill .
It ’s got its own momentum now .
Just sit back and watch .
“ Everything is imploding at the same time .
You just get the sense that they ca n’t hold on much longer . ”
Everyone at Fidelity Printers knows the money printing is propping up Mugabe , the staffer said .
Despite the threat to their jobs , some secretly hope for breakdowns and paper shortages , he said .
“ I ’m happy about this crisis caused by the unavailability of paper , ” the staffer said .
“ Because maybe it might lead to a change of things in this country . ”
( UPDATE : I ’ve translated McCain ’s interview from April with the Spanish press – that translation is at the end of this post .
He could n’t have been more clear that he ’s interested in having fantastic relations with Spain , and in fact , McCain invited the Spanish leader to the White House should be win the election .
It ’s clear that McCain is now lying when he says that he meant to distance himself from Zapatero yesterday . )
It appears that John McCain now believes that General Franco , who died in the 1970s , is still ruling Spain .
That ’s the only explanation for why the McCain campaign is now saying that McCain wo n’t meet with the Spanish President should McCain win the election ( in the Spanish press , Zapatero is in fact referred to as “ the president “ ) .
This is the excuse the McCain campaign is now giving reporters to explain why McCain recently told an interviewer with the Spanish paper El Pais that he was n’t sure he’d be interested in meeting the Spanish president .
It ’s clear from the interview , which we posted below , that McCain was having some kind of mental lapse during the interview so that he did n’t even understand that Spain was in Europe .
But the McCain campaign can’t admit that John McCain appeared to have a senile moment , and that his dementia was caught on tape .
Instead , the McCain campaign is now embracing the only argument they have left – they ’re actually now claiming that McCain meant every word he said .
Really ?
Let ’s analyze , then , what McCain said .
1 . When asked about Spain and the president of Spain , McCain responded about “ Mexico ” ( twice ) , “ Latin America , ” and “ the hemisphere . ”
All of those are references to Latin America and not Spain .
Why would McCain answer a question about Spain – four questions about Spain , in fact – by talking about Latin America ?
2. McCain is now claiming that he wo n’t meet President Zapatero of Spain , should McCain become president .
That ’s rather odd , since in April , McCain did an interview with the same Spanish newspaper saying bygones were bygones , it was time to “ look to the future , ” and that he ’d welcome Zapatero visiting him in the White House .
So , why the sudden change now ?
We ’re seriously to believe that McCain just decided , 6 weeks before the election , to bash the entire nation of Spain when 5 months ago he said he was happy to meet with the Spanish leader ?
3 . The reason McCain gives for not wanting to meet with Spain ’s president is that he only meets with leaders who embrace democracy and human rights .
Uh , McCain thinks Spain does n’t embrace democracy and human rights ?
What does he think , it ’s the 1970s and General Franco is still in charge ?
On its face , what McCain said makes no sense .
He thought he was talking about Chavez or someone in Latin America , even though the interviewer repeatedly told him she was talking about “ Spain ” and “ the president of Spain . ”
That ’s the only explanation .
Or , McCain suddenly thinks it ’s the 1970s and that General Franco is still alive .
http://player.hulu.com/embed/aol_player.swf?pid=35W__A1PX58EPBvvvGngyO53jJatd8l-&embed=true
Here is the translation of the first part of the interview McCain did with the Spanish paper in April .
It ’s clear that McCain is now lying when he says that he meant to say he would n’t meet with Zapatero – the interview could n’t be more positive :
Pasadena , Calif .
Abandoning grueling freeway commutes and the ennui of San Fernando Valley suburbs , Mike Boseman recently found residential refuge in this Southern California city .
His apartment building straddles a light - rail line , which the 25 - year - old insurance broker rides to and from work in Los Angeles .
Richard Wells is more than a generation older but was similarly attracted to the Pasadena apartment building .
The British - born scientist retains what he calls a European preference for public transportation despite his nearly 30 years in California .
Plus , he said , the building 's location means , " I can walk to a hundred restaurants , the Pasadena symphony and movie theaters . "
Messrs .
Boseman and Wells embody trends that are dovetailing to potentially reshape a half - century - long pattern of how and where Americans live :
The driveable suburb -- that bedrock of post - World War II society -- is for many a mile too far .
In recent years , a generation of young people , called the millennials , born between the late 1970s and mid-1990s , has combined with baby boomers to rekindle demand for urban living .
Today , the subprime - mortgage crisis and $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline are delivering further gut punches by blighting remote subdivisions nationwide and rendering long commutes untenable for middle - class Americans .
The schizophrenization of America becomes revealed .
Was America too laissez faire , which lead to the crisis ?
Or not enough , which lead to a bailout plan ?
The answer depends , in large part , on whether you think it 's your money at stake .
Whether it is a good plan or a bad plan remains to be seen .
Indeed , it will never be known since we will never really know what would have happened had the other course been taken .
If Depression is indeed averted , no one will thank Paulson .
Or , if Depression comes , whether it could have been averted by the plan .
So be it .
But is it socialism ?
No .
In a sentence , it is the belief that a country 's strength is tied to how much money it can accumulate .
In the heyday of British mercantilism , 1600 - 1776 , it meant the accumulation of bullion ; favoring exports over imports ; keeping money within the nation , not sending it elsewhere .
The money could be used to purchase commodities and fund armies -- which , in turn , helped bring money into the country .
Mercantilism was premised on the belief that there is a fixed quantity of wealth in the world , and everyone has to fight over it .
Economics , it was felt , is a zero sum game ; and since not everyone can win , it becomes acceptable that they do n't .
State policies reflected this .
" Free trade " meant " free trade for me . "
Protectionist tariffs and regulations ; international treaties that solidified trade superiority .
Colonies to sell the exports to .
And a tight control over the means of shipping .
Mercantilism also exerted influence not just on commerce but on thought and culture .
In order to maximize exports , it had to convince the populace that the export ( or approved import ) was necessary .
In the late 1600s , calicoes , previously the cloth of the poor , became a sought after fashion necessity -- entirely because it was what was being imported .
It was n't sought after and therefore imported ; it was importedsought after .
Cleverly , British merchants made high profile gifts of the calicoes to prominent ladies ; the nobility accumulated them ; and then everyone had to have them .
They went into clothes , furniture , drapes .
Mercantilism had changed the aesthetic of the the entire nation -- the world .
Generally unimportant products took on gigantic importance , because the market convinced people they were important .
Here 's an example : Columbus accidentally discovered America because he was looking forCapitalism identifies a market and then tries to maximize profit within it .
Mercantilism , by contrast , marketsbased on what it has to offer , and then controls those markets .
What preceded British mercantilism ?
Feudalism -- local , feudal power rather than a centralized government ; vague territorial boundaries ; and ever changing racial and cultural characteristics .
It was local , and fluid .
But as the world " shrunk " ( or got flat ) it could not adequately provide for its people .
Unemployment and poverty rose .
Meanwhile , the opening of trade and improvement in travel offered greater opportunities than farming someone else 's land .
States formed , over time , and absorbed the fiefdoms , removed the existing lords , consolidated the power , and served the interests of its domestic merchants and producers .
And so the rise of the nation - state ; racially homogeneous , with rigid territorial boundaries ; partly feudal but with a new quasi-class system of nobility , merchants , workers , and slaves .
As I have written before here and here , for some time in modern America , feudalism was the growing trend ; but rather than lord - vassal , it was company - employee .
Government 's role was secondary and shrinking ; companies provided income , healthcare and retirement benefits , and , more importantly , a sense of identity and belonging .
The company provided protection in exchange for service .
Even two years ago , this was increasing .
These company - lords become even more powerful as they merged and privatized , going off the public exchanges but still wielding massive influence .
But for this progression was suddenly diverted .
Now , instead of companies going private , they are going government .
Who has the big money now ?
Sovereign wealth funds , of which , if / when the Paulson Plan is passed -- for it is inevitable , in some form -- the U.S. will become .
In the past , there was a tug of war between private ownership and state ownership .
Now , instead of outright nationalization of a program ( e.g. Social Security ) governments own financialin businesses , in sectors -- and in themost important sector of all , the financial sector .
The Chinese have this system firmly in place , but pretend it is " communism . "
Saudis as well .
And now , soon , the U.S.How does the U.S. government separate its foreign policy with its fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders , which is you ?
How does it separate its domestic policy from a revenue motive ?
It can't .
They become one and the same .
If the complaint in the past was that government is too influenced by big business , how does this change when government Big Business ?
Put all this together with a growing protectionist sentiment , and you have our new economic model : mercantilism .
America can't move closer to socialism , if for no other reason than those in power are too young to remember what it really looks like and how to execute it ; and with so much individual narcissism , no one could demote themselves so much to the state .
Such policies like the Paulson Plan appear socialist because the government seems highly involved in the control , in the regulation of an industry .
But this is exclusively in the service of the business franchises that it controls .
The analogy for todays events is n't The USSR or even France ; it 's the East India Trading Company ; an independent , for profit , business arm of the state .
It was nearly a monopoly .
It could even command the military , as needed .
Within the East India Trading Company 's flag was the union Jack -- Britain 's flag -- contained in the canton .
Get it ?
Britain at the service of the Company ; the Company for the benefit of Britain .
Reducing current events to historicalis a fool 's game , for drunks in a bar or political scientists with tenure -- played when there is no accountability for the opinion .
It serves no purpose unless it can be used to make predictions .
So here they are , linked to the key characteristics of the mercantilism of old .
In general , the future holds increased protectionism , increased state control , increased classism , and the necessity of piracy .
1. Obvious .
Look for more , not less .
More tariffs ; more treaties ensuring trade advantage .
Not only will the movement be away from capitalism , but it will be consideredthat capitalism is unworkable .
More emphasis on " Free Trade , " as it is subtly redefined to mean " ensuring domestic products are not undercut by unfair foreign advantage such as low labor costs , etc . " 2.despite the importance of trade , the nation state sought to free itself from outside imports .
Domestic agriculture and manufacturing subsidies ; " energy independence . "
That means solar power , whether or not oil is expensive ; increasing ethanol and agricultural subsidies .
3. Most important to mercantilism was control of shipping .
While it was impossible to control what other countries tried to produce or export , Britain could control how and if it made it to Britain .
The Navigation Acts required that all imports to Britain or its colonies had to be done on British ships , or through British ports .
(2) Thus , cheaper goods from other countries could not be obtained , or were taxed so heavily as to make them impossible to afford .
So British West Indian sugar was cheaper to Americans than French West Indian sugar , but only because thecheaper French West Indian sugar was taxed so heavily .
That " shipping " is nowadays done on the internet .
Look for the government or its business arms to try and regulate or even outright control it , and strongly discourage ( read : tax ) the use of non-domestic providers accordingly .
In the past this meant racial homogeneity , but this will be replaced by regional and cultural homogeneity .
So Russia tries to reabsorb its former satellites ; and America asserts its cultural identity by seemingly arbitrary emphasis on the use of English , stronger national boundaries ; clearer divisions between American and " illegal immigrant " with accompanying restrictions ( e.g. no driver 's license , etc ) .
5 . That this is happening is indisputable ..
More monitoring , but as this is mercantilism and not fascism , the monitoring is in the service of commerce , e.g .
Google , credit cards over cash , etc .
Surveillance is for the protection of the state which is at the service of commerce .
6.economic disputes become political ; and political disputes are settled , ultimately , by guns .
Look for corporations to have their own mercenary armies , or have ready access to America's .
And look for more wars , with the cover story of protecting Americans , stopping genocide , etc.7.rather than foreign nations being politically controlled , the control will be economic or cultural .
The purpose of the British colonies was access to raw materials , and the creation of new markets for the mother country 's products .
So too will come the need to convince foreign peoples that they need what we have , and need us to extract what they have .
8. slavery will not return , but the use of groups of people who will work for much less than the citizens will be necessary to maintain competitiveness .
Different from capitalism , however , will be that these people are purposely blocked from rising in class or wealth .
Moral justifications will be necessary , and of the form , " they 're better off than they were .
" 9.unlike the boundariless possibilities of capitalism -- up or down -- mercantilism requires specific classes , especially a working class .
In America , classism will supersede all other internal disparities , including racial .
This suggests an Obama presidency and the replacing of interracial conflict with intraracial conflicts , along class lines .
10 .
Sumptuary laws , though generally ignored , rigidly defined types of products that could be owned , and by whom .
The rationalization was that they prevented excess and waste and kept the money in the country , reinforced national pride and morals , and provided markers social class .
The modern twist : no goods are luxury goods .
Cars , GPS , brand name clothes -- they are all " necessities . "
Waiting at the welfare office , applicants pass the time texting on Blackberrys .
It 's not their fault .
The economythat these are not luxuries .
They are lulled into low introductory rates , a free handset ; no money down .
Those $ 400 shoes only cost $ 15 a month .
Forever .
In a truly capitalist system , one would have to aspire to aspirational goods .
The system is short circuited -- one can afford those goods without actually possessing the status or wealth that ownership implies .
Mercantilism maintains dominance not by best serving a market , but by best serving a market11 .
An emphasis on making specialized products of high quality to maintain export superiority ( e.g. specialty goods over spatulas ; services over durable goods . )
12 . If wealth is hoarded in the U.S. , at the expense of another nation , than the value of the wealth falls in the U.S. and rises in the other nation .
Eventually , it will not be economically profitable to hoard wealth -- it will have more value abroad .
13 . : when the end finally comes , as it must to all illogical economic systems , it will be replaced by what replaced it in 1776 with : capitalism , and the beginning of the next Industrial Revolution .
That 's some of what can be expected , albeit it gradually , so that no one notices .
There 's one more important development , too large to be discussed adequately here .
The control over commerce , goods , and pricing meant that not everyone was able to get , or afford , what they wanted ( or needed . )
Simultaneously , the state itself had to compete against other states for markets and materials .
This necessitated an underground economy and related class ; a class so necessary to and intertwined with these untenable economic policies that they are celebrated even today : pirates .
They were the logical and inevitable extension of controlled commerce ; were extremely skilled , and often navigated the shipping lanes with more knowledge and flexibility than even the military .
They worked for themselves , or they worked for the state , as the situation arose .
In the new world order , shipping is the internet ; the goods are data .
Drink up , me hearties , yo ho .------ 1. though in this case rather than the Company lending money to the Treasury for exclusive trading rights , the Treasury lends it to the Company for a cut of the profits and taxes -- which is in turn in exchange for protection .
2 .
The Boston Tea Party was not about the tea being too expensive because of tariffs ; it was because British Tea Act allowed the EITC to sell the tea without a tariff , and therefore cheaper than even American -- Samuel Adams , John Hancock , and others -- could sell it .

Okay , I 'll head on over to FoxNews .
They 've got to be trustworthy .
They 've got " News " right there in the title , so to suggest seriousness , and " Fox , " so to suggest cleverness .
Or perhaps that you can't trust them around chickens .
Hey , FoxNews.com has clips of Sean Hannity 's interview with Sarah Palin .
Sean says that it's an uncensored interview , withno questions off limits !
Palin has been fairly reluctant to speak , and FoxNews offers a no-holds - barred interview ?
The Bloodsport of interviews ?
Hot damn , we 're cooking with gas !
Let 's see , on the subject of what 's to be done about the Economy , Sarah Palin says " We 've gotta cure this .
By reform . "
Now , moving on to - Wait .
No .
That can't be enough of an answer .
That 's way too obvious .
Our current system led to the giant retarded Wall Street implosion , so of course the answer is reform .
I mean , after the economic week we 've had , if you asked me what I think we should do , with my absolutely nonexistent background in economics , all I 'd be able to say would be " Hey , you know our old plan that ended up turning into a shit sandwich ?
Let 's not keep doing that . "
Are you saying that 's enough to satisfy you , Hannity ?
CanI be Vice President ?
Who would say reform is n't the answer ?
I mean , when there 's a problem , you fix it by doing things differently .
Is anyone actually running on a platform of " These current practices are pretty clearly flawed and poisonous to America ... but I 'm gonna stick with them and see how this all plays out . "
No .
Why is " By reform " a satisfactory answer for the question of how to heal the economy ?
That 's the tip -
No , that 's not even the tip of the iceberg , that 's the idea of the iceberg .
That 's iceberg as a concept .
Why are you okay with that , Sean Hannity ?
Ooh , do you know what other questions Hannity asks in this rare , no - topics - are - off - limits interview with the hitherto unknown woman who may well become our Vice President ?
Also on the topic of the current state of the economy , Hannity asks " Is what Barack Obama doing dangerous for America ? "
That is the poison disguised as a question that he asked in this shitstorm disguised as an interview .

During the three - day trial , police testified that , on Jan. 9 , Barracks locked herself inside her Nissan Murano in the parking lot of The Journal News in Harrison , where she worked as a part - time telemarketer .
She then dumped laundry detergent all over the seats and yelled into her cell phone , " I 'm doing it now !
I 'm getting everything ! "
I hope that this tampering conviction is admissible evidence in the rape trial of her boyfriend , Tyrone Haywood , so that jurors in his trial do n't wrongly assume that the absence of DNA evidence in that car supports the defense 's story of what did or did not happen .
In more rape cases rapists who are aware of the power of DNA evidence do n't wait until after the crime to work to obscure forensic evidence .
Some of the most horrific parts of the 19 hour rape ordeal a grad student endured were done with the intent to destroy DNA evidence or to destroy this rape victim 's eyesight so she could not identify him .
He did n't succeed in destroying all the DNA evidence despite attempting to murder his victim and setting fire to his victim 's apartment , but if he had the idea that his efforts would be rewarded with an acquittal should bother everyone .
Those who dismiss victim testimony even when it is credible as being insufficient to get a rape conviction lead rapists to believe that they can get an acquittal if they destroy enough physical evidence .
For some of these rapists that means murdering their victims and destroying their victim 's bodies .

There 's something incongruous about experts from normally cloudy Germany coming to California , the land of eternal sunshine , to teach the locals about how to harness solar power .
But that 's was happening this week in San Francisco , where organizers of the world 's largest solar exhibition , Germany 's intersolar , launched an American version of their confab amid
predictions of a massive solar boom in the ailing US economy .
Conference chairman Professor Eicke Weber , director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems , insists that it makes perfect sense for Germans to bring their solar accumen to the Golden State .
Americans are already beginning to cut back on their driving habits
As soaring fuel costs combine with rapidly changing public perceptions about the dangers of climate change , the US embrace of solar power is at a tipping point , he predicts .
Soon , the US will follow the massive investments already made in Europe in renewable energy , where thanks to strong government support the solar industry is years ahead of its American counterpart .
" Before , our only argument was the environment , but now with oil at $ 140 ( 88 euros ) a barrel , I think the much stronger argument will be the pocketbook , " he said .
" That 's why I think solar energy will have a great future in the United States . "
No backing from Bush
One indication of the gulf that separates the two continents is the size of their solar exhibitions .
The German Intersolar has been growing at some 30 percent a year .
The recent Munich expo attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 attendees from 140 countries .
In contrast , the San Francisco Intersolar has only 200 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees .
The major reason for the difference is the scope of government support , or the lack of it in the United States .
Under President George W. Bush , a former oil company executive , the federal government until recently denied the science of climate change .
Vice President Dick Cheney famously dismissed conservation as a meaningless personal virtue .
Though the US does offer homeowners a one - time , $ 2,000 federal tax credit for the installation of photo - voltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity , Weber argued that it needed a
so - called feed - in tariff to really allow the sector to take off .
Such a tariff offers energy producers a guaranteed price for energy that they feed into the grid from renewable sources , and was the key stimulus in boosting the European solar sector .
But there are many other factors in play .
The next big thing ?
For instance , it 's no coincidence that the conference is taking place in San Francisco .
The city is the northern anchor of Silicon Valley , where an ever - increasing pool of venture capital and a growing number of start - ups are chasing the solar dream .
SunPower Corp. CEO
Thomas
Warner next to the solar panels on the roof of the SunPower building in San Jose
Many are already predicting a solar boom , akin to the dot - com boom that accompanied the rise of the Internet .
Some start - ups like NanoSolar and Solyndra are already valued at more than $ 1 billion before they 've ever made a profit , reflecting the huge growth potential that Wall Street sees in the solar field .
The comparisons to California 's tech industry do not end there .
Solar - cell production is a close cousin to the production of computer chips , and there is a constant exchange of personnel , techniques and equipment between the two sectors .
" Each time we double the volume of production , the cost goes down by 20 percent , " Weber said .
" At the end of the day , it will be the least expensive energy of all .
We just need a little help to ignite the revolution . "
Dan Martin , who heads SemiCon West , a trade association of semiconductor manufacturers , believes the same dynamic -- that dramatically reduced the price of computer chips while simultaneously increasing their power -- will also characterize the solar voltaics sector .
" We are going to change the world , " he said .
" I 've seen it happen before , and it will happen again . "
The academics looked at achievement in maths Going to a good pre-school nursery boosts a child 's chances of achieving in maths at the age of 10 , experts say .
But the long - term UK study by academics found the biggest influence on a child 's achievement in maths at 10 was the education of their mother .
However , they found that going to a good pre-school or primary school and playing word and number games at home also had a big effect .
They say what they call a good " home learning environment " is crucial .
The research - led by Professor Edward Melhuish from Birkbeck , University of London - is published in the journal Science .
The academics looked at the progress of children in the UK from the age of three or four up to 10 , and measured it against various factors .
They ranked the children 's " home learning environments " after interviewing their parents about how often they did various activities , such as reading stories , singing nursery rhymes and playing games involving numbers and shapes .
They included other possible factors which could influence a child 's development such as gender and parents ' income , occupation and education .
Strongest effect " The results indicated that home learning environment , pre-school effectiveness and primary school effectiveness all make separate , significant impacts , " said Professor Melhuish .
" The mother 's educational attainment is the strongest effect , there 's no doubt about that , but home and school and pre-school environments are also important . "
He said that the researchers found many examples where a mother 's lower level of education was more than made up for by parents creating a good home learning environment through the activities they did with their children .
" And there are quite a few well - educated people who do not provide a good home learning environment , " he added .
The report 's authors - from four institutions - pointed to the way China is investing in pre-school education for all in efforts to achieve its economic goals .
In England , all three - and four - year - olds are entitled to a part - time place at nursery school .
The Westminster government sees early years education as a vital step in lifting children out of poverty .
Professor Melhuish said although a mother 's education and the family 's socio- economic status were key factors , the study showed how focussing on aspects of a child 's life which could be changed - such as access to good nursery and primary schools - could improve their education and chances in life .

What are these ?
" Isms " were not in good odor for much of the last century .
American political writers of a centrist - to - conservative cast used to rail against an evil triumvirate of " socialism , communism , and fascism " and contrast them with the only " ism " they liked : " Americanism . "
Goodness , this kind of rhetoric sounds quaint : a relic of the days when journalists were called newsmen , and they clapped their fedoras onto their heads when they bolted out of the office in search of a scoop .
When these worthies said " Americanism , " they meant the American constitutional system , as it translated into a political culture and a free , open society .
In that sense , the term seems harmless .
But see it as American + ism , the ideology of being " American , " and it seems less innocent .
Does the term have counterparts in other nations , and if so , how would we feel about them ?
How would we feel about " Indonesianism , " say , or " Dutchism " ?
" Peruvianism " ?
I 've recently run across another " ism " that might end up making trouble in our own time : Christianism .
Google has rounded up 631 hits for me for " Christianist , " along with the query , " Did you mean to search for ' Christiano ' ? "
Hmm , no , thank you .
I figure 631 hits is the Internet equivalent of seeing the first sliver of the sun coming up over the mountain in the morning .
" Christianist " is evidently formed on the analogy of " Islamist . "
Islamist is in the dictionaries meaning either an Islamic studies specialist or simply an adherent of Islam - a Muslim .
Here 's what Wikipedia says about " Islamism " : " a political ideology derived from the conservative religious views of Muslim fundamentalism .
It holds Islam is not only a religion , but also a political system that governs the legal , economic , and social imperatives of the state . "
" Islamist " is a term many Western journalists and scholars came to after deciding that " fundamentalism , " which they 'd been using , was n't quite right - in part because it seemed to be an improper borrowing from Christianity .
And so now , after the borrowed " fundamentalist " has been returned , perhaps with polite thanks , to Protestantism , the " ism " of Islamism is being applied to some Christians - the ones seen to be adherents of " Christianism , " of what we might call " political Christianity . "
Still with me ?
Specifically , Christianists are linked with another " ism " - " dominionism " - a political ideology that interprets a passage from Genesis ( 1:26 ) as commanding Christians to bring societies under the rule of the Word of God .
It 's not exactly a compliment to be called a " Christianist . "
The Portland ( Ore. ) Indymedia website posted a rant a while back against " Christianist ayatollahs . "
But the term looks like a useful way to denote the political Christians of the right .
And it has a certain symmetry with " Islamist " :
If Muslims of a political slant are " Islamist , " then perhaps it makes sense to call Christians of a certain political slant " Christianists . "
Both " Islamists " and " Christianists " have been associated with " hijacking " - the former literally , but both metaphorically .
" Hijacking " has been so often used as a metaphor with reference to Islam that even President Bush has gotten into the act - and Pat Robertson has given him grief about it , too .
But now it 's happening to Christianity .
" I am dismayed at the way the Christian faith is being more and more hijacked by the right , " one author appearing in the blog archive " Things I 've Seen " has written .
Onward , Christianist soldiers ?
Oh , let 's not .

For those of us whoÂ enjoy working on our carsÂ ( or do n’t particularly enjoy it butÂ know that it ’s a necessary evil ) there are plenty ofÂ simple things we canÂ do to help maintain our cars and keep them in peak running condition .
Â
Not surprisingly , cars that are properly maintained also tend to get much better gas mileage as well . Â
Here are some simple car maintenance things you can do yourself in your own driveway that will help keep your car in good condition as well as help to increase its gas mileage :
Check your tire pressure .
Improperly inflated tires can reduce your car ’s gas mileage by up to 2 % .
Considering your tires will naturally lose roughly 3 % of their air pressure each month , this is probably the task you ’re going to have to do most often .
Go ahead and spend a couple of bucks on an air pressure gauge , and when the pressure gets below what your car ’s manufacturer recommends , go ahead and put some extra air in the tires the next time you ’re at the gas station .
Replace dirty air filters .
An excessively dirty or clogged air filter can cause your car ’s gas mileage to drop by as much as 10 % .
Most air filters are easy to check , take less than five minutes to replace and should set you back less than $ 15 .
Replace worn spark plugs .
Driving around with worn or fouled spark plugs will cause your car ’s air / fuel mixture to be ignited less efficiently , and will reduce your car ’s performance and fuel economy .
This job may take a little bit of time , but it should n’t take too much money .
Check your gas cap ’s gasket .
If your car ’s gas cap does n’t get a proper seal , you ’re going to let gas simply escape from your car .
If the gasket looks old and cracked , go ahead and get a new gasket from your localÂ auto parts store .
It ’ll take you less than 5 minutes and a couple of bucks to get the job done .
Switch to synthetic motor oil .
This one ’s probably the most labor intensive and expensive job out of the five , but it should be enough to help you get an extra boost in fuel economy .
Simply put , synthetic motor oils tend to do a better job reducing engine friction , meaning your car ’s engine will run more efficiently .
Translation : a more efficient engine tends to get better gas mileage .
Anyway , most of this stuff is pretty simple , even if you do n’t know a ton about cars .
Â
That being said , if you do n’t feel comfortable or have absolutely no idea what you ’re doing , take your car up to your local mechanic and have them do this work for you .
Either way , it wo n’t take a lot of time or money to help your car get the best possible gas mileage .
Some AI Koans
These are some of the funniest examples of a genre of jokes told at the MIT AI Lab about various noted hackers .
The original koans were composed by Danny Hillis , who would later found Connection Machines , Inc .
In reading these , it is at least useful to know that Minsky , Sussman , and Drescher are AI researchers of note , that Tom Knight was one of the Lisp machine 's principal designers , and that David Moon wrote much of Lisp Machine Lisp .
Tom Knight and the Lisp Machine A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power off and on .
Knight , seeing what the student was doing , spoke sternly : “ You can not fix a machine by just power - cycling it with no understanding of what is going wrong . ”
Knight turned the machine off and on .
The machine worked .
Moon instructs a student
One day a student came to Moon and said : “ I understand how to make a better garbage collector .
We must keep a reference count of the pointers to each cons . ”
Moon patiently told the student the following story : “ One day a student came to Moon and said : ‘ I understand how to make a better garbage collector ...
[ Ed. note :
Pure reference - count garbage collectors have problems with circular structures that point to themselves . ]
Sussman attains enlightenment
In the days when Sussman was a novice , Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP - 6 .
“ What are you doing ? ” , asked Minsky .
“ I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic - Tac - Toe ” Sussman replied .
“ Why is the net wired randomly ? ” , asked Minsky .
“ I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play ” , Sussman said .
Minsky then shut his eyes .
“ Why do you close your eyes ? ” , Sussman asked his teacher .
“ So that the room will be empty . ”
At that moment , Sussman was enlightened .

Did a Nevada , Iowa , police officer deliberately need to run down a knife - wielding man ?
Eric Peterson 's family is claiming that their son had not threatened police and the deliberate attack on Peterson by a police vehicle was unwarranted .
Eric Peterson is the knife - wielding man you will see in the following video behaving strangely running on top of a police cruiser and then running after the cruiser .
The Nevada police department claims that Peterson was a threat to the officers involved in the incident , which is why they ran him down .
The video is from the dashboard video cameras of the two squad cars .
Peterson 's family claims that the video clearly shows that the police cruiser deliberately had to veer to the left in order to hit Peterson .
It does appear in the video that is precisely what happened .
The family said that " Eric did not attack either officer , " and did not threaten them .
Officers said when they arrived at the scene that the man began to run toward their squad cars .
" Ultimately , the suspect was hit by one of the police vehicles as the suspect was running towards the officers with the knife , " said Police Chief Mike Tupper .
Witness to the incident Teresa Phillips said , " the cop floored it into the parking lot and hit him . "
It does appear in the video that the squad car sped up as it approached the man .
Peterson 's family released a statement to the media saying in part , " Eric did not attack either officer .
Eric did not try to get into either police car .
He was holding a knife but not brandishing it . "
" He did jump on the hood of the first police car and ran onto the roof and over the vehicle but his actions were not an attempt to gain entry to the vehicle . "
" As that car drove away , Eric was chasing it on foot , and not likely to be able to catch it .
The second police car arrived , and appears to purposefully strike Eric . "
The second squad car did have a cracked windshield from its impact with Peterson .
The family 's statement continued , " Eric is mentally ill and his actions are not always within his voluntary control . "
" Nevada police officers , including the two involved in this incident , are well aware of Eric 's mental illness . "
" We do not want to place blame at this time , but we want to ensure that all of the facts of the case be distributed on Eric 's behalf . "
The following video depicts graphic violence .
Do not watch if you think you may be offended :
An air ambulance flew Peterson to Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines , and he remains there in critical condition .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Total sales at retailers in August fell for a second month in a row , according to a government report on Friday that showed consumers were coming under increasing pressure amid rising prices .
Sales dropped 0.3 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted $ 381.17 billion after a sharply revised 0.5 percent drop in July that previously was reported as only a 0.1 percent decline .
The August fall in sales was sharply contrary to forecasts by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Reuters who had expected a 0.2 percent sales increase .
Sales at motor vehicle dealers rose 1.9 percent in August -- the first increase since January -- after a 4.3 percent July drop .
But August sales still were down 13.5 percent from a year earlier .
Excluding motor vehicles , retail sales in August were down 0.7 percent after gaining 0.3 percent in July .
Gasoline sales fell 2.5 percent last month - the biggest monthly decline since mid-2007 - after a 0.2 percent rise in July .
Gasoline prices eased in August from record July levels .
Sales of building materials , clothing and electronics all were weaker in August than they were in July .
Analysts have been warning that , with businesses cutting jobs in every month so far this year , consumers are bound to have difficulty keeping up spending that fuels two - thirds of national economic activity .
Israel 's Defence Minister Ehud Barak speaks to the press after his meeting with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the United Nations Headquarters in New York July 30 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - The United States has turned down Israeli requests for military hardware to help it prepare for a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities , a frontpage report in Israel ’s Haaretz newspaper said on Wednesday .
The unsourced report said the Americans had warned Israel against carrying out any such attack and had refused to supply offensive military hardware .
Instead they had offered to improve the Jewish state ’s defenses against surface - to - surface missiles .
Interviewed on Israeli Army Radio , Defense Minister Ehud Barak did not deny the Haaretz story , but refused to discuss it .
“ It would not be right to talk about these things , ” Barak said .
The West accuses Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran denies this and says its nuclear program is only to generate electricity .
It has vowed to retaliate against Israel and the United States if attacked .
Israel , which is believed to have the Middle East ’s only atomic arsenal , says a nuclear - armed Iran could threaten its existence .
The Haaretz report , by one of its senior columnists , did not specify what weapons systems Israel had requested .
It said Washington had told Israel its aircraft would be denied permission to use Iraqi airspace to reach Iran .
Barak said Iran was a “ threat to the whole world order , and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures ” .
He said the United States “ does not see an action against Iran as the right thing to do at the moment ” , but shared Israel ’s view that “ no option should be removed from the table ” .
The United States said last week that Iran , by ignoring demands that it halt sensitive nuclear activities , had left the U.N. Security Council no choice but to increase sanctions .
On Wednesday , some hackers apparently obtained unauthorized access to Gov. Sarah Palin's Yahoo !
email account by posing as Gov. Palin and getting a new password ( Michelle Malkin and Wired News have details ) .
Yesterday we noted that , based on the facts in newspaper reporting , a court would likely consider this a violation of the Stored Communications Act ( SCA ) .
However , the Department of Justice may be hamstrung in any prosecution of this invasion of privacy by its restrictive view of " electronic storage . "
The SCA prohibits unauthorized " access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage . "
The act defines " electronic storage " as " any temporary , intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof , " or in the alternative as " any storage of such communication by an electronic communication service for purposes of backup protection of such communication . "
Under Ninth Circuit precedent , both received and unreceived emails are in electronic storage .
This is because when the recipient accesses an email but does not delete it , it moves from storage incident to transmission to backup storage under the second part of the SCA 's " electronic storage " definition .
See Theofel v. Farey - Jones , 359 F.3d 1066 , 1075 ( 9th Cir. 2003 ) ( finding that “ obvious purpose ” for storing a message on the provider ’s server after delivery is to provide a second copy of the message in the event it needs to be downloaded again ) .
Thus , since Gov. Palin and Yahoo ! are both in the Ninth Circuit ( Alaska and California respectively ) , it would violate the SCA to obtain unauthorized access to her emails , whether opened or not .
The DOJ , however , strongly disagrees with Theofel .
According to its Prosecuting Computer Crimes Manual , the DOJ " continues to question whether Theofel was correctly decided , since little reason exists for treating old email differently than other material a user may choose to store on a network . "
Rather , the DOJ argues :
If the recipient chooses to retain a copy of the communication on the service provider 's system , the retained copy is no longer in " electronic storage " because it is no longer in " temporary , intermediate storage ... incidental to ... electronic transmission , " and neither is it a backup of such a communication .
The DOJ 's interpretation of the SCA means that any emails that Gov. Palin had already opened ( but left on the Yahoo ! Mail servers ) would not be protected under this email privacy law .
This would mean no SCA privacy protection for the majority , if not the entirety , of the Gov. Palin 's email messages at issue .
As the DOJ acknowledges , " [ i ] f Theofel 's broad interpretation of ' electronic storage ' were correct , prosecutions under section 2701 would be substantially less difficult ... "
On the flip side , if the DOJ were right and Theofel were wrong , any hacker responsible for obtaining access to those emails - or any other individual 's opened messages - could not be prosecuted under the SCA .
What happened to Gov. Palin shows why Theofel is good for privacy .
As more and more people use Web mail like Yahoo ! , Gmail , Hotmail and others , they also will naturally leave opened email on the server .
People should not have to sacrifice their privacy protections under the law when they do so .
* RIAA attorney Donald Verrilli Jr. says file sharers are automatically liable for copyright infringement and monetary damages for using peer - to - peer networks .
Casey Lentz is trying to settle her RIAA lawsuit .
She says the RIAA is " harassing " her .
* It was five years ago Monday the Recording Industry Association of America began its massive litigation campaign that now includes more than 30,000 lawsuits targeting alleged copyright scofflaws on peer - to - peer networks .
The targets include the elderly , students , children and even the dead .
No one in the U.S. who uses Kazaa , Limewire or other file sharing networks is immune from the RIAA 's investigators , and fines under the Copyright Act go up to $ 150,000 per purloined music track .
But despite the crackdown , billions of copies of copyrighted songs are now changing hands each year on file sharing services .
All the while , some of the most fundamental legal questions surrounding the legality of file sharing have gone unanswered .
Even the future of the RIAA 's only jury trial victory – against Minnesota mother Jammie Thomas – is in doubt .
Some are wondering if the campaign has shaped up as an utter failure .
" We 're just barely scratching the surface of the legal issues , " says Ray Beckerman , a New York lawyer and one of the nation 's few who have taken an RIAA defendant 's case .
" They 're extorting people – and for what purpose ? "
When the first round of lawsuits were filed on Sept. 8 , 2003 – targeting 261 defendants around the country – it was a hairpin turn from the RIAA 's previous strategy of going after services like Napster , RIAA president Cary Sherman said at the time .
" It is simply to get peer - to - peer users to stop offering music that does not belong to them . "
The goal in targeting music fans instead of businesses was " not to be vindictive or punitive , " says Sherman .
Today , the RIAA – the lobbying group for the world 's big four music companies , Sony BMG , Universal Music , EMI and Warner Music – admits that the lawsuits are largely a public relations effort , aimed at striking fear into the hearts of would - be downloaders .
Spokeswoman Cara Duckworth of the RIAA says the lawsuits have spawned a " general sense of awareness " that file sharing copyrighted music without authorization is " illegal . "
" Think about what the legal marketplace and industry would look like today had we sat on our hands and done nothing , " Duckworth says in a statement .
( The RIAA declined to be interviewed for this story . )
Casey Lentz , a 21 - year - old former San Francisco State student , is among those caught in the RIAA 's PR campaign .
" They 're harassing me nonstop , " says Lentz , who 's been trying to settle her RIAA case , but can't afford a lawyer .
" I was n't the one who downloaded the music .
It was a shared computer with my roommates and my friends .
They want $ 7,500 for 10 songs . "
" I told them I only had $ 500 in my bank account .
And they said ' no way , ' " she says .
Despite a fallow legal landscape , most defendants cannot afford attorneys and settle for a few thousand dollars rather than risk losing even more , Beckerman says .
" There are still very few people fighting back as far as the litigation goes and they settle . "
" It costs more to hire a lawyer to defend these cases than take the settlement , " agrees Lory Lybeck , a Washington State attorney , who is leading a prospective class - action against the RIAA for engaging in what he says is " sham " litigation tactics .
" That 's an important part of what 's going on .
The recording industry is setting a price where you know they can not hire lawyers .
It 's a pretty well - designed system whereby people are not allowed any effective participation in one of the three prongs in the federal government . "
Settlement payments can be made on a website , where the funds are used to sue more defendants .
None of the money is paid to artists .
The quick settlements have left largely unexamined some basic legal questions , such as the legality of the RIAA 's investigative tactics , and the question of what proof should be required to hold a defendant liable for peer - to - peer copyright infringement
In two cases , judges have ruled that making songs available on a peer - to - peer network does not constitute copyright infringement – the RIAA has to show that someone actually downloaded the material from a defendant 's open share folder .
One of those cases is still mired in pretrial litigation .
In the other , an Arizona judge issued a $ 40,000 judgment last week in favor of the recording industry , after learning the defendant tampered with his hard drive to conceal his downloading .
The so - called " making available " issue also emerged , belatedly , in the only RIAA file sharing lawsuit to go to trial : the case against Thomas , a Minnesota mother of three , who was slammed with a $ 222,000 judgment last year for sharing 24 tracks in her Kazaa folder .
Months after the Duluth , Minnesota jury 's October verdict , U.S. District Judge Michael Davis called the lawyers back to his courtroom .
He said he likely committeda " manifest error " in the case by instructing ( . pdf ) the jury that merely offering music was infringement .
Judge Davis is expected any day to declare a mistrial in the case , and rule that the Copyright Act demands a showing of an actual " transfer " of files from Thomas ' share folder .
If that line of reasoning is followed elsewhere , it endangers a key prong of the RIAA 's litigation strategy .
The association believes it is technically impossible to prove that files offered on a peer - to - peer user 's shared folders were actually downloaded by anyone besides its own investigators .
" It 's all done behind a veil , " RIAA attorney Donald Verrilli Jr. argued in the Thomas case last month .
That does n't mean the RIAA would be dead in the water .
The recording industry could try to prove , through forensic examination , that the shared files were pirated to begin with , i.e. , that the defendant infringed copyright law by downloading the music , before sharing it again .
It 's also possible the courts will find that – as the RIAA has argued – downloads by the RIAA 's investigators can be considered infringement by the file sharer ; digital rights advocates counter the recording industry should not be able to pay investigators to make downloads of its own music , and then declare them unauthorized copies .
The RIAA 's investigative tactics have come under attack as well .
In a few states – Michigan , Texas , Florida , New York , Massachusetts , Oregon and Arizona – state governments and RIAA defendants have challenged the qualifications of the private company that develops the music industry 's cases .
MediaSentry – aka SafeNet – specializes in logging into peer - to - peer networks , where it downloads some music , takes screenshots of open share folders and documents the offending IP address .
The RIAA 's position is that the online sleuthing is n't covered by state laws regulating private investigators .
But Michigan ( .pdf ) recently disagreed , and told MediaSentry it needed a private investigator 's license to continue practicing in that state .
Against that shifting legal backdrop , a handful of universities , including the University of Oregon , have begun refusing to divulge students ' names in file sharing lawsuits , on privacy grounds .
Nobody can credibly dispute that file sharing systems are a superhighway for pirated music .
" There is no doubt that the volume of files on P2P is overwhelmingly infringing , " says Eric Garland , president of Los Angeles research firm BigChampagne .
But critics of the RIAA say it 's time for the music industry to stop attacking fans , and start looking for alternatives .
Fred von Lohmann , a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , says the lawsuits are simply not reducing the number of people trading music online .
" If the goal is to reduce file sharing , " he says , " it 's a failure . "

A couple of years ago a friend alerted me to Goodbye Dear Old Stepstone , a website I , for some reason or another , only got around to looking at last week .
And damn , was I missing out .
GDOS was a radio show on MOMA's P.S.1 Art Radio , hosted by Nathan Salsburg , a Kentucky folk musician and former member of the now - defunct Halifax Pier , as well as the production manager of the Alan Lomax Collection .
Lomax was the folklorist who made some of the earliest recordings of Woody Guthrie , Leadbelly , Pete Seeger , and Muddy Waters , anthologizing such recordings for The Library of Congress , before working for the BBC and writing his acclaimed music bio of Jelly Roll Morton , Mister Jelly Roll , and his award - winning memoir , The Land Where The Blues Began .
" It was hard for me , " Salsburg wrote in a recent email , " to be immersed in so much wonderful music all day long but have very little opportunity to share it with folks .
My father and grandfather are / were both in radio and I 've always been attracted to it . "
When a friend who was working for P.S.1 told Salsburg he could get him a radio show , Salsburg went for it .
" I sent what was admittedly a very eager and overwrought essay pitching the show , " Salsburg said .
But it worked .
Salsburg was hired on in early 2005 .
On GDOS , broadcast every two or three weeks between May 23 , 2005 and August 7 , 2006 , Salsburg put together half hour programs of traditional American folk music , with themes like " I 'd Rather Be Sloppy Drunk Than Any Way That I Know " and " Floods , Levees , and R. L. Burnside in Memoriam . "
" Half - hour shows kinda demanded thematic consistency , so I tried to run a specific genre , subject , or region for each program . "
Goodbye Dear Old Stepstone takes it 's name from the song by Bascom Lamar Lunsford , which I first heard on Will Oldham 's Daytrotter Session .
Salsburg himself has played with Oldham , and also introduced Oldham to Lunsford 's music .
When Salsburg was managing a 2006 Lomax exhibit and folk concert series at a New York art gallery , he asked Oldham to open for Hazel Dickens .
When Oldham asked Salsburg what songs to play , Salsburg sent him " Goodbye Dear Old Stepstone , " which he ’s covered regularly ever since .
On GDOS , Salsburg also used songs from the Anthology of World Music and other recordings of traditional Asian , European , and African folk music for many of his programs , including " North African 45s " and " Music From the Axis of Evil and Other Thorns in Our Side , " that exclusively featured such music .
The latter was particularly well produced , with songs like " Song of the Dear Comrade Kim Jong Il " by Korean People 's Army Concert Troupe and a traditional Iranian love song from the Luristan and Fars Provinces , with the beautiful and unexpected lines : " Remove the scarf which you wear on your chest / So that I can touch your breasts .
/ What kind of politics are you doing now ? "
Salsburg now works on Root Hog Or Die on New York 's East Village Radio , more or less a continuation of his work on GDOS .
He also blogs and maintains a directory of free mp3 world music websites and radio programs , including the John Donald Robb Collection , featuring Southwestern " Native material ( dance tunes , ritual pieces , game songs ) , lots of corridos , religious performances , frontier and border ballads both Hispanic and Anglo , and a couple really nice cowboy pieces , " and The Secret Museum of the Air on WFMU which Salsburg describes as " a show ... so completely without peer as to almost make you desperate . "
Currently , Salsburg is working on collaboration with Drag City called Twos & Fews .
As he explains the title , " It 's a black saying from the teens , maybe ?
It means small change ; like , " Sorry I ca n't afford it — I only have twos and fews . "
Twos & Fews , like Root Hog or Die and GDOS before it , will offer traditional American and international folk with " occasional doo wop , or hip hop , or roots reggae music . "
Their first release , I Want to Go Where Things are Beautiful , a collection by Nimrod Workman is due out November 18 .
Samples can be found at the Twos & Fews MySpace .
I have this dream that one day we will see true interoperability between social networking sites potentially powered by OpenID .
As part of trying to make this dream a reality I 've been reading a lot about the pros and cons of implementing OpenID since a shared identity system is the cornerstone of any hope of getting interoperability to work across social networking sites .
Here are some of the things I 've learned .
The Problems OpenID Solves for Web Developers
There are two ways to approach using OpenID on your Web site .
The first way is to treat OpenID as a way to delegate user authentication on your site to another service .
This means that you rely on someone else to authenticate ( i.e. sign - in / log - in ) the user and take their word for it that the user is who he / she claims to be .
Some sites use this as the sole means of authenticating users ( e.g. StackOverflow ) while others give users the choice of either creating an account on the site or using an OpenID provider ( e.g. Source Forge ) .
The assumption behind this view of OpenID is that asking users to create yet another username / password combo for your site is a barrier to adoption and using OpenID removes this barrier .
However this assumption is only correct if the OpenID sign - in process is easier for users than registering a new account on your site .
The second approach is to use OpenID as a way to give users of other Web sites access to features of your site that are traditionally only available to your users .
For example , Google 's Blogger has an option to enable anyone with an OpenID to comment on your blog .
However Blogger does not allow you to login with OpenID instead you must have a valid Google account to create a blog on their service .
In this scenario , the assumption is that asking users to create yet another username / password combo just to leave a comment on a blog or use some other feature of the site is too high of a barrier to entry but that same barrier to entry is acceptable for people who want to become full users of the site .
It should be noted that the second approach is actually why OpenID was originally invented but scope creep has made it become a popular choice as a single sign - in solution .
The Ideal OpenID User Experience
As a Web developer , the main problem OpenID is supposed to solve for you is that it reduces the barrier to using your service .
This means that if redirecting a user to an OpenID provider to be authenticated and then having them redirect the user back to your site is more complicated than a new user account creation flow you could build on your site then using OpenID will cost you users .
The ideal OpenID user experience should be
Your log - in page gives the user a choice of OpenID providers to use to sign in The user selects their OpenID provider from a list or enters their OpenID provider information
The user is redirected to a log - in page on the provider 's site User enters their credentials
The user is redirected back to your site and is now logged in
Even in this ideal flow , there is a chance you will lose users since you have distracted them from their task of using your site by directing them to another site .
The assumption here is that the redirect -> sign - in - > redirect flow is less cumbersome than asking new users to pick a unique username and password as well as asking them to solve a Human Interactive Proof or CAPTCHA .
This sounds like a fair tradeoff although I 'm not aware of any published research results that back up this assumption .
However if the OpenID sign - in flow is any more complicated than the above steps then the risk of losing users increases significantly .
Here is an example of how OpenID can cost you users taken from a post by Ned Batchelder entitled OpenID is too hard
Earlier this week I visited yet another site that encouraged me to get an OpenID , and I decided I would finally cross OpenID off my list of technologies I should at least understand and probably use .
The simplest way to use OpenID is to pick a provider like Yahoo , go to their OpenID page , and enable your Yahoo account to be an OpenID .
This in itself was a little complicated , because when I was done , I got to a page that showed me my " OpenID identifiers " , which had one item in it : https://me.yahoo.com/a/.DuSz_IEq5Vw5NZLAHUFHWEKLSfQnRFuebro-
What !?
What is that , what do I do with it ?
Am I supposed to paste that into OpenID fields on other sites ?
Are you kidding me ?
Also , in the text on that page is a stern warning :
This step is completely optional .
After you choose an identifier , you can not edit or delete it .
( Emphasis theirs ) .
So now I have a mystifying string of junk , with a big warning all over it that I can't go back .
" This step " claims it 's optional , but I seem to have already done it !
Now I 'm afraid , and I 'm a technical person — you expect my wife to do this ?
How many users do you think start this process and complete it successfully ?
Now how many of these users would have been lost if the site in question had replaced their OpenID usage with a lightweight account creation process similar to that used by reddit.com which only requires username / password and solving a CAPTCHA ?
This is food for thought when comparing the costs and benefits of adopting OpenID .
The Risks of Using OpenID
There are lots of commonly voiced criticisms about OpenID , a number of which are captured in the blog post entitled The problem (s ) with OpenID by Stefan brands .
A few of the complaints are only interesting if you are a hardcore identity geek while others are of general interest to any Web developer considering adopting OpenID .
Some of the key criticisms include
Susceptibility to Phishing :
The argument here is that the growing popularity of OpenID will train users into thinking that it is OK to enter their credentials on a " trusted site " after following a link from another Web site .
However given that this is how phishing works it is also training users to be more susceptible to phishing since any random site can now claim to be powered by OpenID when in truth it redirects people to http://www.example.com/phishingattempt/yahoo.com/login or some similarly malicious URL .
Given that we live in a world where worse practice of Please Give Us Your Email Password is now commonplace and the best solution people have come up with for dealing with it ( OAuth ) also utilizes browser - based redirection , I 'm not sure this is a fair criticism against OpenID .
Identity Providers May Be Lax about Validating Users :
When you outsource user authentication to an identity provider via OpenID you are trusting that they are performing some minimum level of user validation to keep spammers and bots out of their service .
However there is no requirement that they do that at all nor is there any minimum standard that they have to meet .
A year ago , Tim Bray posted an interesting thought experiment where he pointed out that one could create an identity provider that " successfully authenticated " any user URL you provided it with .
You can imagine what kind of fun spammers would have with such an identity provider on a site like StackOverflow .
Identity Providers May Recycle Identities : A number of large email service providers like Yahoo ! and AOL have decided to become OpenID identity providers .
Email service providers typically recycle abandoned email accounts after a set period of time .
For example , if I do n't sign - in to my dare@example.com email address after three months then all my data is wiped and that account joins the pool of available email accounts .
What happens to my accounts on other sites where I use that email address as my OpenID ?
Does this mean that the next person to use that email address can log -in to StackOverflow as me ?
Maybe …it depends on quality of the identity provider .
Privacy Concerns : Delegating user authentication to another service means you are letting this other service know every time a user logs in to your site and often times what the user was trying to do since you pass along a return URL .
Depending on the sensitivity of your site , this may be information that you would rather not leak about your users .
Then again , most Web developers do n't care about this given how much information about their users they let Web analytics firms and advertising providers track .
White Lists are Key
The bottom line is that accepting an Tom , Dick and Harry as an identity provider on your site is probably a bad idea .
User authentication is an important aspect of an online service and delegating it to others without vetting them is not a wise given how widely the user experiences and the policies of various identity providers can vary .
Developers should evaluate OpenID providers , then select a subset those whose policies and sign - in experience is compatible with their goals to avoid the risk of losing or alienating users .

TUCSON -
The founders of an Arizona church that deifies marijuana have pleaded guilty to two criminal charges .
Dan and Mary Quaintance are each facing up to 20 years in prison .
Sentencing in federal court is set to take place within the next 75 days , but the Quaintances are confident an appeal will keep them out of prison .
The couple pleaded guilty Aug. 18 to two counts relating to their 2006 federal arrest - one count of conspiracy with intent to distribute 200 pounds or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana ; and one count of possession with the intent to distribute 100 pounds or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana , as well as aiding and abetting .
The sentence will depend on the discretion of the judge .
Dan Quaintance believes freedom of religion will prevail , and predicts the case could go as far as the U.S. Supreme Court .
" It was tough to plead guilty , but really we were just pleading to what we said we did .
There is no doubt we had marijuana with us , " he said .
" We think ultimately the courts will see that we are just people using marijuana for our religion .
It 's the First Amendment .
We think we 've got a pretty good case . "
The Quaintances live in Pima , some 90 miles northeast of Tucson .
They founded the Church of Cognizance in 1991 in Pima and returned to their home after pleading guilty .
The couple , both in their 50s , had attempted to have the charges against them dismissed on the grounds that marijuana is part of their religion .
A U.S. District Court dismissed that appeal , and the Quaintances said that 's why they pleaded guilty - without the religion defense they knew they'd be convicted at trial .
Now that the case has been concluded , the appellate court is expected to reconsider the religious argument .
The Quaintences stepped down as leaders after their arrests .

TEHRAN --
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries could decide to roll over or cut crude oil production from existing levels when the group meets in early September in Vienna , Iran 's OPEC governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi said Saturday .
Oil prices , which have fallen back to just above $ 113 a barrel from highs of above $ 145 a barrel in New York six weeks ago , are being pressured by higher supplies and lower demand , Khatibi told Dow Jones Newswires in a phone interview .
" The market is oversupplied by at least 1 million barrels a day .
If OPEC would like to remove this additional oil out of the market , then OPEC has to cut some production , " Khatibi said .
PEC 's next policy meeting is scheduled for Sept. 9 in Vienna .
" There will be maybe two options .
One option is maintaining the level of production .
It means OPEC will roll over the production .
The other option will be some decrease in production , " he added .
Ignorance is bliss , which perhaps explains Gov. Sarah Palin being so confidently wrong about the root cause of the federalization of most of the nation ’s mortgage market .
But what is Sen. John McCain ’s excuse ?
Both act as if the financial meltdown of the U.S. economy has nothing to do with the policies of the political party they represent — but she at least may not know any better .
Distracted momentarily from her campaign revelries of maverick opposition to the “ bridge to nowhere , ” which she had supported until it became a public relations debacle , and congressional earmarks for which she , as a small - town mayor , had hustled piggishly at the federal trough , Palin made the mistake of dealing with an unscripted subject .
Referring to the government ’s bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Palin opined that the two had “ gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers , ” displaying abysmal ignorance of the fact that only now will those privately owned banks become a huge taxpayer obligation , as the federal government takes them over .
Nor can the meltdown of home values be traced to those two beleaguered institutions , because they did not make the original subprime mortgage commitments .
The housing bubble was the result of the Ponzi - scheme antics of those other financial entities : commercial banks , stockbrokers and hedge funds , which were allowed in a GOP - deregulated market to get into the “ swap ” business .
Through the rampant reselling of loans , the obligation to collect on a loan was divorced from the act of selling it in the first place , so who cared if the recipient of the loan was not at all qualified or the appraisal of the property value was inflated , as long as the paper was traded away , or insured , before the moment of foreclosure ?
As with any Ponzi scheme , the perps , who included the legislators as well as the bankers who exploited the loopholes they provided , expected to bail long before the bubble burst .
The role of the legislators , Republican - led but with far too many Democratic running dogs , was critical to the success of the scam .
The mortgage swaps distancing the originator of the loan from the ultimate collector were made legal only as a result of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , which former Sen .
Phil Gramm , R - Texas , pushed through Congress just hours before the 2000 Christmas recess .
Gramm , until recently co-chair of the McCain campaign , also had co-authored the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which became law in 1999 with President Bill Clinton ’s signature .
That gem , which Gramm had pushed for years with massive financial industry lobbying , destroyed the Depression - era barrier to the merger of stockbrokers , banks and insurance companies .
Those two acts effectively ended significant regulation of the financial community , and no wonder we have witnessed an even more rapid and severe meltdown in housing values than during the Great Depression .
Not surprisingly , Gramm was rewarded for his service upon retirement as a senator and as head of the Senate Banking Committee with a top position at the Swiss - based UBS bank , which is close to drowning in the subprime mortgage nightmare he helped create .
These folks have no shame , as was evidenced when the senator ’s wife , Wendy , was named a director of Enron , whose roiling of the energy market had been made possible only through yet another provision of Gramm ’s Commodity Futures Modernization Act .
While neophyte Palin can claim ignorance of such matters , that would be particularly difficult for McCain , who as a senator consistently lined up with Gramm in his deregulation crusade .
Clearly McCain had not learned much from his previous involvement with the savings - and - loan debacle about the risks to consumers in unregulated banking .
McCain served as chair of Gramm ’s abortive 1996 presidential campaign , and Gramm returned the favor , providing critical support for McCain with the hard - line Republican base , including the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal .
It was assumed in the business press that Gramm was the front - runner to be Treasury secretary in a McCain administration .
Gramm left his role as the top economic person near McCain only after he made an embarrassing statement blaming the current economic downturn on “ whiners , ” an awkward reference to the victims of his disastrous legislation .
Amazingly , the turmoil in the housing market , which has led to the socializing of the nation ’s revered homeownership market in a massive expansion of the role of big government , has apparently not troubled McCain ’s conservative supporters .
As I said , ignorance is bliss , and evidently not just for the newbie Palin .

“ You just ca n’t keep using the Fed , ” the chairman told Politico .
“ Do you need more of what happened ( with AIG ) yesterday ?
If you do , it has to be on a systematic basis . ”
Frank : U.S. can't ' keep using the Fed '
With the markets still unhappy after the takeover of AIG , House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank said Wednesday that Washington must consider a bolder , less ad hoc approach to cleaning up the bad debts “ clogging the arteries ” of the nation ’s financial system .
“ You just ca n’t keep using the Fed , ” the chairman told Politico .
“ Do you need more of what happened ( with AIG ) yesterday ?
If you do , it has to be on a systematic basis . ”

Going forward , the Massachusetts Democrat made two additional points .
First , the government should press harder for financial institutions to show more forbearance to avoid foreclosures .
“ There is some optimism there , ” he said of progress made already .
“ Substantially reducing the foreclosures would help . ”
Second , Frank suggested that central bankers in nations allied with the United States could be more helpful .
And he specifically took a shot at European bankers who he said pressed Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for the AIG rescue but put up no money of their own .
“ They figured out that we would do it without them , is my guess , ” he said .
But with the Dow down again Wednesday and no relief in sight , Frank ’s chief focus was on finding a way to bridge the gap between the markets today and what he hopes will be a more orderly , regulated system in the future .
“ The easy part going forward is regulation , ” he said .
“ But how do you survive to where you can have regulation and keep bad things from happening ?
It ’s not clear . ”
“ Everything else having been tried , does the federal government have to buy up a lot of the bad stuff ?
It ’s the good bank / bad bank notion .
The federal government has to take up the bad stuff to unclog these arteries , hold it , hope that there will be some recovery in assets , and get the thing going .
“ That ’s the next question .
I do n’t know what else you can do . ”
It would be a huge undertaking , calling for legislation that would be immensely difficult for Congress to address in the short time remaining before November ’s election .
But if the markets were to continue to deteriorate , it could yet force a lame duck session at least to address the problem .
Frank is not alone in calling for this debate .
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Nicholas Brady , Treasury secretary under President Bush ’s father , helped author an opinion column published in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday making similar arguments for some new federal entity akin to the Resolution Trust Corporation , which was create to address the S&L crisis in the late 80s and early 90s .
“ Until there is a new mechanism in place to remove this decaying tissue from the system , the infection will spread , confidence will deteriorate further and we will have to live through the mother of all credit contradictions , ” Brady and Volcker wrote together with Eugene Ludwig , comptroller of the currency under President Clinton .
Frank himself is leery of comparisons to the RTC since he feels it can confuse the debate , but he has talked with Volcker and is planning a hearing on the issue next week before his panel .
“ It clearly involved buying up some of the bad stuff .
Who buys it , under what terms , etc. , etc. , you have to have a hearing . ”
But it has to be legislation ?
“ In a democratic society , it ’s a great mistake not to , ” he said .
“ RTC confuses people because it ’s real property , etc. , ” Frank said .
But the debate is better seen as one “ arguing that you need a systematic intervention basically to have the federal government step in and unclog the arteries or we die – not die , things do n’t get better . ”
In the meantime , he joked of introducing a resolution to declare Sept. 15 , the day that Treasury and the Fed watched Lehman Brothers go bankrupt , as “ Free Enterprise Day . ”
“ That ’s the one day …
` Let them all go under , Let the chips fall where they may , ’ ” Frank said .
“ That lasted one day , free enterprise .
And then we went back to a big bailout . ”

I do n't usually find piracy easy to justify , but considering that EA has been pig-headed to the extreme over the use of SecuROM in its products -- a measure deemed harmful to the enjoyment of the paying consumer -- it 's kind of karmic to learn that Spore 's piracy levels have been deemed " extraordinary " by by one peer - to - peer research firm .
Spore has been at the center of a big DRM controversy , as its piracy - protection program generated a huge user backlash on Amazon .
We also learned that EA's " draconian " level of control limits people to creating only one account per copy of the game .
People are understandably angry and upset at Electronic Arts for exerting this kind of dictatorial power over its customers , and it looks like they are doing what they can to punish the publisher .
" The numbers are extraordinary , " exclaimed Eric Garland , boss of P2P researcher Big Champagne .
" This is a very high level of torrent activity even for an immensely popular game title . "
The game has been downloaded 171,402 times since September 1 , and users such as " deathkitten " on The Pirate Bay are urging users to add to that figure , claiming that it's " the right thing , " to do .
The right thing it may not entirely be , but EA was kind of asking for it .

Watching Palin 's speech , I was struck by how blatantly she could lie about her previous support for the now infamous Bridge to Nowhere ( among other things ) .
But before I could write a post about it , the Obama campaign actually printed its own ( surprisingly thorough ) fact sheet about Palin 's awfully misleading speech .
Here it is , printed in its entirety :
PALIN : “ Our opponents say , again and again , that drilling will not solve all of America 's energy problems - as if we all did n't know that already .
But the fact that drilling wo n't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all . ”
REALITY : PALIN SAID SHE WOULD BEG TO DISAGREE WITH ANY CANDIDATE WHO SAID WE CAN ’T DRILL OUR WAY OUT OF OUR PROBLEM
Palin Said She Would Beg to Disagree With Candidate Who Said We Ca n’t Drill Our Way Out of Our Problem .
Asked by Invester ’s Business Daily “ Some politicians and presidential candidates say we can't drill our way out of our energy problem and that drilling in ANWR will have no effect .
What 's your best guess of the impact on prices ? ”
Palin responded , “ I beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we can't drill our way out of our problem or that more supply wo n't ultimately affect prices .
Of course it will affect prices .
Energy being a global market , it 's impossible to venture a guess on ( specific ) prices . ”

Among the earmarks : $ 449 million for what critics have ridiculed as two ‘ bridges to nowhere ’ -- one in Ketchikan and one across Knik Arm in Anchorage formally named Don Young 's Way .

[ Anchorage Daily News , 11/11/07 ]
As Recently as June , State Asking for Cost Estimate Proposals for Knik Arm .
“ An independent party will be called in to look at one of the most elusive aspects of a proposed bridge linking Anchorage and Mat - Su : the price tag .
Gordon Keith , regional director for the state Department of Transportation and Public Facilities , said his office will be putting the job of estimating the cost of the controversial project out for bids in coming weeks .
He said the task of coming up with a price could cost up to $ 200,000 and take up to 3½ months .
‘ The issue keeps swirling around , so we thought it best to go ahead and do an independent estimate , ’ he said .
The cost to get the estimate is going to be high ‘ if you want to do it correctly , ’ he said .
The cost of a span reaching across Knik Arm from Anchorage to Point MacKenzie has ranged over the years from $ 450 million to $ 1 billion , depending on what kind of bridge is envisioned and what starting date is plugged into the formula …
Randy Ruaro , a special assistant to Gov. Sarah Palin , said the administration , even in the face of the recent lengthy report from the bridge authority , was having trouble getting an accurate picture of everything that is involved in the project , of the timing of the phases , and of the costs .
He said the independent estimate is expected to answer those questions .
Mary Ann Pease , spokeswoman for the authority , said she welcomes the effort to get updated costs . ”

In the first week of the 110th Congress , Obama joined withSenator Feingold to introduce a “ Gold Standard ” ethics package .
Manyof the Obama / Feingold bill ’s most important provisions were includedin the final ethics reform package passed by the Senate in lateJanuary : a full ban on gifts and meals from lobbyists including thosepaid by the firms that employ lobbyists ; an end to subsidized travelon corporate jets ; full disclosure of who 's sponsoring earmarks andfor what purpose ; additional restrictions to close the revolving doorbetween public service and lobbying to ensure that public serviceis n't all about lining up a high - paying lobbying job ; and requiringlobbyists to disclose the contributions that they " bundle " - that is , collect or arrange - for members of Congress , candidates , and partycommittees .
In January 2007 , the Washington Post wrote in aneditorial that “ … Mr. Reid , along with Sens. Russell Feingold ( D - Wis. ) and Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , deserves credit for assembling and passingthis package . ”

REALITY : Obama has expressed support for a bipartisan compromisethat would cut tax breaks for oil companies , invest in alternativeenergies , and allow for limited new offshore drilling
Obama Said He Would Be Open To Offshore Drilling If We Come Up With “ AGenuine Bipartisan Compromise ” To Get To Energy Independence .
“ Senator Barack Obama said Saturday that he would reluctantly consideraccepting some new offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico inexchange for stripping oil companies of tax breaks and extendingseveral tax credits to spur the search for alternative fuels .
At thesame time , Senate Republicans appear to have dropped their insistenceon opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling .
Mr. Obamahas until now opposed any offshore drilling .
But in a news conferencehere , he noted that there had been ‘ very constructive ’ talks betweenSenate Republicans and Democrats on this issue in recent days , applauding a plan unveiled by a group of Republican and Democraticsenators to permit drilling while supporting an effort to convert mostvehicles to using alternative fuels in 20 years .
‘ If we come up with agenuine bipartisan compromise , where I have to accept some things thatI do n’t like in order to get energy independence , ’ Mr. Obama said , ‘ that ’s something I will have to consider . ’
Still , he cautioned thathe was not yet ‘ ready to sign off on any approach . ’ ” [ New York Times , 8/3/08 ]

Thisstrikes me as less of a shift and more as a gesture of sorts to thereality that the major cap and trade legislation next year thatCongress will mark up -- legislation that will be introducedregardless of who 's president -- requires the participation of andcompromise from the industry .
The oil industry has two cards , basically , in the negotiations .
One : that windfall profits taxes woulddisincentivize further exploration somehow ... two : that , as thestaple source of energy , oil companies ought to have more land / waterto figure out where oil is and then tap those pools .
Democrats aremore likely to compromise on the second , rather than the first .

Ø Stoller : Obama Supported A “ Real Compromise ” On Energy .
Obama ’s position on drilling is “ actually a real compromise … thecompromise put forward by Obama would in fact move us forward onsustainable energy while raising taxes on the oil companies .

Here we consider the seven stages of monitoring investments throughout life .
The seven ages of man is a speech from one of Shakespeare ’s plays and catalogues the stages we go through in life , from baby to old age .
It is an excellent comparison to investing and how investors need to ensure their investments keep pace with them as they move through life .
However , this does n’t just apply to saving for retirement , it applies to any investment goal and portfolios need to be monitored to make sure they are on track to achieve their objective .
Baby to young adult :
Although financial commitments are negligible at this stage in life , it is a good idea to encourage children to save for themselves and to understand the basics of money from an early age .
Under 25 : Retirement is a long way and a bulk of an individual ’s income may be earmarked to fund their current lifestyle – buying property or cars for example – rather than saving for later years .
However it is still a good idea to get started in investing and understanding what it is all about .
Now also might be a good time to develop a high risk , aggressive portfolio as there is plenty of time to recover from any capital losses .
25 to 35 : Although retirement may still seem a long time away , the earlier someone starts investing , the greater chance they have of building a significant nest egg for later years .
At this stage in life people may be able to afford higher risk and more aggressive growth strategies as there is more time for investments to recover from losses or market volatility .
Read
35 to 45 : Family obligations and expenses may be increasing at this stage in life .
Saving for medium to long term goals such as retirement , a child ’s education or wedding may require investments that seek capital growth .
More immediate goals such as paying for school fees or a mortgage may require investments that require a regular income .
Therefore a balance between capital growth and income is a sensible idea and at this stage of life , however , a higher level of investment risk may still be acceptable .
45 to 55 : At this stage with retirement not too far away , capital protection may be a greater concern for an investor .
It might be time to move towards a more conservative or medium to lower risk portfolio .
This will help to cushion capital if equity markets experience sudden market volatility .
Over 55 : At this stage there is less time to recover from any capital losses and the bulk of any portfolio should be in low risk investments wit a high degree of capital security .
This may also be a time to look at investments that offer income as opposed to capital growth .
Retirement : Capital preservation is key to ensure that a lump sum is kept secure to enable it to provide income during retirement .
Low risk portfolios with a high degree of capital security may be preferred at this time , as may investments that provide income .

McCain has the perfect running mate .
She should prove to be lots of fun .
I love the list you have .
She should turn much of middle America towards Obama .
Plus , given his proclivity for extra-marital affairs , this should give the rumor mongers some meat .

As Rove said , Obama 's pick for Veep will be strictly political .

Palin's avowed support of Steven and the like is troublesome .
The lack of any broad base experience besides the year and 8 months as governor is worrisome .
Palin is said to be pro corporate and anti-environment which sounds too GOP for me .
Palin does not have the qualifications to be veep and especially a veep under a 72 year old man .
Frightening .

well I thought I would never say these words , but if you thought BUSH was bad just wait until these 2 criminals sashay on into the white house .
The people surrounding McSame are actually WORSE than those that surrounded Bush .
McSame has already * won * this S-election , the MSM is making that perfectly clear .
The real question is , are we the people going to allow this AGAIN ?
Or are we all going to do exactly what we did in 2000 & 04 ' which is absolutely nothing ?

If this lunatic gets into power I fail to see how this country could possibly survive in its current condition .
People are going to start having to make some serious choices by this time next year and none of them are good .

No big deal of course for the Repubs !
What do you bet , she 's going to back out to spend time with her family .
In the meantime , maybe she 'll get a job description for VP , since she stated she had no idea what a VP does !
It 's been said that some will vote a block of wood if it 's shaped right !

The selection is briliant .
It places two slick lawyers against a military hero and a woman who connects with the 80 % of the public on drilling .
Now , both of the Clintons have been cast to the vicisitudes of scholarly history they so richly deserve .
Nancy Pelosi's worst nightmare - the diva will finally have strong competition in demonstrating female competence .
It starts with drilling .
Perfect !
You protest , Palin has no foreign policy experience as governor of Alaska , some citizens of which can see Russia 2.4 miles away with their naked eyes ?
By now everyone should be aware that pipelines have strategic international significance ( Georgia and Russia ) .
Alaska not only has a major pipeline , but the crude resources .
Further , Alaska borders the resource rich Arctic to which Canada , Russia and Denmark ( to name a few ) have already already laid claim .
This woman has mastery of energy policy details of which only Biden wishes he knew .
In truth , Palin has more international policy experience than Arkansas 's Gov. Clinton had when he laid claim to the WH .
Fortunately , she is no draft dodger , either .
Too bad more of you are not for female affirmative action .
I no longer intend to vote for Obama .

BH - I 'll second that .
I 've heard on some radio shows that McCain has been fondly admiring the backside tho .
No doubt the " trade - up " has crossed his mind ( not that she 'd have anything to do with it I 'm sure ) , he 's done it once before and it proved to be a working formula for him .
All joking aside , i think it would be great to have a woman in the presidency or VP spot .
Just not this one .

There is a narrow segment of our population that believes that doing anything to serve their faith is justified , even if those actions violate the law .
Many of these people could not support McCain before he selected the homophobic , anti-choice , ethically - challenged Palin to the VP role .
Now these people --- many of whom have wormed their way into the election machinery of the United States --- have a reason to facilitate the massive election fraud that will be required to insure a continuation of this criminal cabal .
We have already seen election corruption originating in the Justice department where grads fresh from Bob Jones University put prosecutors with distinguished careers through a litmus loyalty test to determine if they were fit to continue to serve .
Those who focus on Palin 's lack of qualifications for election to the critical role a heartbeat away from the Presidency miss the point ---
Her purpose is to energize and mobilize those that will facilitate the stealing of the third Presidential election in a row .

Palin is a joke , nothing more .
But all those who say Obama should 've picked Hilary are wrong .
You know why ?
Because , McCain 's choice will galvanize Hillary and her supporters to campaign for Obama like never before .
Do you know why Hillary & Co. will do this ?
Partly out of pride and mostly out of desperation -- anyone with half a brain knows that , if elected , Palin will set back the cause of women 's rights 150 years or more , especially if McCain dies in office !

McLamb hit the nail square on the head .
This is all to energize the reality challenged , those Christofascist that see nothing wrong with destroying the Constitution , Bill of Rights ( too late for that one , its long gone already ) , breaking every law & treaty on the books , brutally attacking ANY other country on the planet as long as its Muslim or have dark skin .
They see nothing wrong with any of this in fact they believe they are fully " justified " by their religious insanity .
This of course in their delusional minds is to " save them " and or to take " Dominion " over the entire planet .
These lunatics have taken over the Rethuglican party , the US military and the news media .
This country , the planet and our lives are in the hands of stark raving lunatics that deny science , refuse to accept the known fact of Evolution , deny global warming , most believe the Earth is 6000 years old and we were all poofed into existence because of a few choice words of Hebrew & the wave of a magic wand by their sun god .
McSame is a war mongering , PNAC connected , old doddering fool that appears to be going senile .
Palin is a Christofascist nut bag that if given the power of the US presidency would become basically Empress Caligula .
In a way I actually hope these cretins steal this election and do so even more blatantly than they did in 2000 & 04 ' .
Because this country has got to WTFU !
9/11 was without any question an inside job and until the fat & lazy ignorant masses open their damn eyes and see this clearly then NOTHING is ever going to change .
But when you have almost 1 / 2 of the population that you can not even get to accept the absolutely irrefutable fact of Evolution then if appears we are shyt outa luck .

Unfortunately , 17 and 20 are probably right on !
We know Obama 's position on the Iraq war , fight against terror , nuclear proliferation , the economy , taxes 95 % of Americans will receive a tax cut , jobs , energy , global warming as a national priority , health care , and social security .
We also now know his management skills and style .
We are responsible for jm / sp .
For the last 8 years , gw and company have committed or permitted every crime known to man without one iota of reprimand or criminal charge .
And we let him .
Every time there was a motion in Congress , they caved and gw goes on his merry way - getting what he wants .
And here we are , when you seem secure that no one could be worse than gw , guess again .
I can't help but hope and pray that common sense will prevail and the vast majority of people will see the light and want a better future for themselves and their families , which will in turn be good for the country .

Having watched Palin's VP acceptance speech last night I put 40 quid at Coral on McCain - Palin to win ( 13 - 8 ) .
Just a bet on the evidence from Guardian newspaper , The Spectator , bbc.co.uk , and CNN .
Looked at from the distance of the UK , the Palin appointment would be geographically analogous to the plucking of the CEO of Aberdeenshire County Council from the north of Scotland to be David Cameron 's Tory Deputy Leader ( would n't happen ) .
Palin displayed a lot of energy , mind ... will the US media not attempt to engineer a debate between Obama and Palin ?
Is n't the beef there now ?
Could McCain not be making to run the race , clutch at his breast at the very last , then pass the Bonfire Night baton to Palin ?
That 's how I 'd be thinking if I wanted my party to screw the Dems on the ballot - room floor for another 8 or more .
What are the odds on that ?

European shares rebounded on Monday and the dollar fell from two - month highs as market sentiment recovered briefly , although investors remain cautious about both the second wave of COVID - 19 in many regions and the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election .
Equities fell sharply last week and the dollar hit a two - month high as coronavirus infections surged again in Europe and as investors reassessed their expectations for a global economic recovery ahead of the U.S. vote .

A while back I posted an article to my old blog called ' 6 Tips for High Quality Youtube Videos . '
Well that site does n't exist anymore and Youtube is quite a bit different now so its probably time I update that article .
When posting to Youtube the first thing to remember is that it will make your video look worse .
No matter what .
Youtube is compressing your video and compression makes things worse .
Period .
However , if you follow some simple rules , you can minimize this worsening , or ' Youtubeification ' , to the point where it is not noticable .
Read on .
1 . Shoot the highest resolution and the lowest compression possible
There are about a million different video cameras on the market .
There about 500,000 different video formats that they shoot in .
Ok , I exaggerate , but your choices in shooting formats are immense .
Some of these formats are better than others .
To achieve the best results on youtube , choose the highest resolution and the lowest compression possible .
For resolution , you should pick an HD camera ( 1920x1080 or 1280x720 pixels ) over an SD camera ( 720x480 or 720x576 pixels ) .
As far as compression goes , you want a camera that has the biggest file size possible once it gets onto your computer .
Also , if you can see compression artifacts in your original video , these artifacts will get worse on Youtube .
Ok , so you probably already own a camera and maybe its not perfect for Youtube .
What else can you do to get better quality ?
2. Use a Tripod !
That 's Right !
Using a tripod makes your video look more professional and it helps minimize the compression problems associated with Youtube .
Why is this ?
Video compression is based on motion -- the more motion in the frame , the more work the compression has to do .
When you shoot hand held , every frame is a little bit different which makes a compression algorithms go crazy .
When you use a tripod , the image only changes when something in the frame moves which is a relatively small change .
Or it changes when you pan or tilt , but these changes are smooth and predictable enough to be easy on compression .
3 . Have plenty of light
Compression is based on detail .
If things are dark it will be harder to achieve nice compression .
This can be as simple as opening the blinds , turing on a lamp or going outside .
In general , bright is better than dark for compression .
The following has changed due to Youtube 's introduction of widescreen video .
A new post is coming soon .
4 . The secret ingredients to encoding for Youtube : at least 6000 kbps h.264 , 640x480 ( 640x360 for widescreen ) , Multipass encode , deinterlace .
No matter what you use to encode your video , these magical settings should insure a clean version to post to youtube .
I personally use Quicktime Pro .
So I will go over these particular settings here :
The Quicktime Pro Export Menu
Selecting the h.264 codec and setting
h.264 is the most modern codec available and is able to compress video in the best looking way possible .
At a data rate of at least 6000 kbps the compression should be virtually invisible for a frame size of 640x480 .
The frame size of 640x480 or 640x360 ( for wide screen ) are chosen because this is the native frame size that Youtube displays
A Multipass encode checks each frame at least twice to ensure that it is encoded the best .
If you shoot on an interlaced format , you must deinterlace because computers are a progressive format .
If you do n't , you will see the so called ' mice - teeth ' effect .
If you shoot on a widescreen format ( 16x9 ) then choose the output size of 640x360 ( under custom in QTPro size menu )
One more tip :
Try to get as close to the 1 gigabyte files size limit as possible by increasing the data rate .
Do n't go over board though .
A 10 second clip wo n't ever be that big
There .
Now you know the best settings to get the best out of Youtube .
As a public service I have posted below two examples .
One with the right way of doing things and one with the exact opposite .
Enjoy !
This clip was shot with a Sony Z1U .
It is a clip from my upcoming documentary " Legacy of the Great Aletsch "
This clip was shot with a janky $ 99 DV - DA1 VP crap camera .
It is a clip of my cats shot a few hours ago .
There ’s a lot of talk out there from commentators who you ’d think would know better claiming that this was basically a bipartisan failure — that both parties , Republicans and Democrats , failed to carry their members for this bill .
But look at the numbers .
60 % of Democrats in the House voted for this bill .
33 % of Republicans .
Face it , that ’s not even close .
Both parties wanted to force as few members to vote for this as possible .
It ’s really unpopular .
It ’s perfectly legitimate ( though in the absence of any credible alternative , pretty iffy ) to argue that the Republicans did the right thing by killing the bill .
But there ’s simply no question of why and how this bill failed .
Forget the Rumba and the Cha Cha .
It appears as though Dancing with the Stars professionals and Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Cheryl Burke and practicing the Horizontal Mambo together .
The rumored new couple was spotted holding hands , snuggling and possessing far more chemistry than Kim Kardashian and Mark Ballas on the dance floor ...
Consummation , as set down dispassionately by the Oxford English Dictionary is " the action of making a marriage or relationship complete by having sexual intercourse " ; from the Latin verb consummare , uniting con- ( altogether ) , with summa ( sum total ) , the feminine of summus ( highest , or supreme ) .
An end , then , that may be no less a beginning and a lofty one at that , ripe with connotations that the act itself should prove consummate .
And yet , in practice , sex is rather akin to dancing : something physical and exuberant that makes most of us look like arses .
Tinseltown intercourse certainly packs a terrific bang for its buck : so many tastefully lit montages of deeply meaningful acrobatics .
( What was sex like before celluloid , the post - modern citizen wonders , before orgasms become as platitudinous as Meg Ryan herself ? )
Back in the real world , we may dress for sex , hanker after it , thrill and scheme , but the reality is that the fist slamming , raw - faced , ululating meeting - of - minds - as - bodies phase can be frustratingly short - lived .
As the American writer and wit Anita Loos decreed : " Sex , which has been acclaimed by too many misguided poets as an utopian activity , seldom attains that status in the human race . "
Like life , it has a tendency to be nasty , brutish and short , which may or may not be exactly how one likes it .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Too much that falls under the category of consummation conforms to the nursery rhyme dictum that when it is good it is very , very good , but when it is bad it is horrid .
There are too many permutations .
The anonymous encounter whose ghost looms like a priapic Colossus over congress with someone you actually like .
The lacerating , genitals - only connection with someone you once loved .
The absurd , two - person pantomime that can have us writhing with mortification years in its wake .
As a friend once implored : " Why only beer goggles , why not lifelong blinkers ? "
One of the most popular novels of recent years , Ian McEwan 's On Chesil Beach , might well be a record of non-consummation , of a honeymoon encounter turned into the dampest of squibs .
The British have yet to shake off entirely the impression that sex falls somewhere between the territories of Philip Larkin and Benny Hill : something that is both ignominious and comical .
A run-in with the website beautifulagony.com provides ample fodder for those of this persuasion .
The site is a picture library of the facettes de la petite mort ( or " cum faces " in the lexicon of the lavatory wall ) of its " agonées " .
" The only nudity it contains is from the neck up , " declare its creators .
" That 's where people are truly naked . "
And so – gurning or beatific– they are .
What is at once most brilliant and terrible about sex is its capacity for self - exposure .
Somehow intercourse makes us feel as if we are revealing something at the very core of our beings ; even if at this core lies merely more play - acting .
Sex is the most resplendently subjective experience , which implies there is a subject , or so the logic goes .
The rhetoric of congress reflects this assumption : an individual becomes known via the sexual act .
And there is a sense in which we all recognise the veracity of this : the rush of something passing for post - coital intimacy ; that intoxicating alliance born of pillow talk ; the sudden , potent familiarity with someone who was until recently exhilaratingly unknown ; something unfamiliar discovered in a familiar ally ; the mess of selves and sweat .
You and me against the world , if only for the time it takes us to gather our wits .
And , yet , of course , these sexual selves are as constructed as anything else our consciousnesses can muster .
Unravel the tangle of many a woman 's thwarted idea of arousing feminine behaviour and you will discover some chimera made from : Scarlet O'Hara , Elizabeth Bennett , Holly Golightly and " Not My Mother " ; ready to drop her knickers for that elusive Rhett / Darcy / Peppard / daddy substitute .
Someone 's particular fetishes may be less knowingly laid down : the thumbsucker who yields to more graphic oral fixations ; the squirming schoolboy who grows up ever hankering after a walloping ; the News of the World journalist who goes hard at the prospect of a Mosley in uniform .
Some epiphanic moment spawns a rubberite here , a frottage enthusiast there , our sexual selves becoming all this and more , greater than the sum of their , or anybody else 's , parts .
Animals that we are , we sniff our lovers out .
A significant factor in whom we find alluring is that we succumb to the scent of genetic compatibility or , rather , the complete lack of compatibility that ensures a healthy genetic mix .
But this is only the beginning of our substance abuse , because sex is chemically addictive , rendering us all crack whores .
The initial flood of lust feeds off the gendered part of the package , notably a torrent of testosterone and oestrogen .
This is the pre-consummation stage , or the period when consummation has been so fleeting as to leave no lasting mark .
The high it inspires is a gas , but not yet a dragging compulsion .
The ensuing love or infatuation phase relies on a potent cocktail of neurotransmitters including adrenaline , noradrenaline , dopamine , serotonin , and phenylethylamine – or in layman 's terms , an entirely head - fucking bolt of stimulants .
This is a havoc wreaked in consummation 's wake .
Where lust was a diversion that could be kept in its box , so the junk of infatuation consumes us .
Renaissance poets recognised its ravenousness in their obsession with the erotic contortions of Ovid 's Metamorphoses .
Robert Burton 's early 17th - century treatise , The Anatomy of Melancholy , devotes a considerable portion of its musings to libidinous frenzy .
A century on , the vernacular take on such dependency was more spade - calling , the afflicted deemed " cock - struck " or " cunt - struck " .
Most of us will have been so stricken .
Something bestial crawls under the skin , rendering us moony , jittery , distraught and rhapsodic .
Overnight we have the energy for a range of behaviours we would hitherto have strained to accommodate : Herculean erotic feats , the trading of interminable biographical detail , cavernous sleep deprivation , texter 's finger , shagger 's groin .
We become nearly as compelling to have about as the coke addicts from whom we are scarcely distinguishable .
The love object 's every gesture is analysed , every adjective applied to them qualified , every opportunity to refer to them clawed .
Tedious , yes , but what is most crushing about this chemical high is how fleetingly the fix endures .
The affection or commitment stage that follows this honeymoon period , typically at around 18 months , is the product of the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin .
Both are believed to interfere with dopamine and noradrenaline pathways , heightening bonding , but sabotaging sexual craving .
Hence that most painful of erotic paradoxes : at the point where you have never have loved someone more , you may never have wanted to sleep with anyone less .
Familiarity may not breed contempt , but it is likely to guarantee sexual torpor , as a million magazine articles testify .
Chemically , then , sex may be mere sex , or it can seem like everything – after which it seems destined to become a chore .
Small wonder that we should chose to invest consummation with so much meaning , ham it up in inverse proportion to the brevity and insignificance of the act itself .
Consummation 's past associations have been legion : disease , danger , fertility rite , sin , the accruing of dynastic swagger .
It was not until relatively recently that sex has been thought to coalesce with wedlock , wedlock with love , and love to loop back again and lasso itself to sex .
Frances Osborne 's engrossing biography , The Bolter , offers a caution against the impression that our grandparents ' sexual mores were more rigid than our own .
Meanwhile , The First and Second World Wars unleashed orgiastic eruptions of extra-marital copulation .
Nevertheless , by and large , as the 20th century wore on , consummation came to signify some sort of mystical , marital union of simultaneously orgasmic soulmates ( thank you D H Lawrence and Marie Stopes ) ; a fairy - tale that endured long past the sexual revolution that was supposed to have set morals swinging .
If Freud made sex a panacea , Lawrence lent that panacea transcendence – a surrendering to the body to escape its bounds .
Bona fide Lawrentian union – proud , elemental , phallic , unselfconscious – was to be favoured over " sex in the head " – visual , voyeuristic , controlling – beloved of " cocksure " females and other deviants .
" Why were we driven out of paradise ? " he inquires in Fantasia of the Unconscious .
" Not because we sinned .
Ah , no .
All the animals in Paradise enjoyed the sensual passion of coition .
Not because we sinned , but because we got sex into our head . "
A century on , and postlapsarian sex in the head is the only show in town .
While various orifices may be involved , our over - stimulated brains are where it 's really going down .
Consummation is not epochal , but recreational , as entertaining and banal as any other leisure activity .
Sex can be pursued as a team sport , a game of doubles , or a solo exercise .
Inanimate objects have become fair game as – in a reversal of pre-20th century anxieties – self - pleasuring has come to be regarded as a purveyor of mental and physical health ( " I use my vibrator to give my skin a boost , " remarks an acquaintance with the nonchalance of the salubriously orgasmic heroine of Brave New World ) .
Our culture is not so much navel - gazing as fixated further south .
The over - fifties gad about amassing STDs , their offspring hooking up – a fuck not so much zipless as conducted at emotional arm 's length , less coitus than mens interruptus .
Sex is considered safe if it precludes propagation or disease ; an underestimate of the damage one can do while one 's wedding tackle remains intact .
The true fetishist has become he or she who abstains from consummation while the rest of society gets its kicks in a post - modern pornutopia in which all manner of experiences can be had with all comers and myriad things .
The celibate are stigmatised as freakish , thwarted .
And yet the great surveyed platitude among consenting adults is that most would rather sleep than screw ; a kink at which uncontracepted generations would surely have gawked .
Perhaps the same chemical flattening that dulls intercourse in long - term unions applies to society at large .
Where there is opportunity , satiation , multiple consummations , so there must also be over - familiarity , ennui .
The terrier - like , up - against - the - leg sexual enthusiasm of mainstream culture also brings collective apathy in which all rush is spent .
And yet , in spite of all this , sex still has the ability to knock us sideways : that element of voodoo rising that can fell at a hundred paces and have even the most po-faced mouthing Molly Bloom 's ecstatic : " Yes , yes , yes ! "
Its sway is registered on an epic scale from the fall of Troy to the detumescence of the Clinton White House .
It imprints itself in our lives like a post - coital bruise .
For , suddenly , here you are , stumbling across someone with whom you are not an arse , but dancing with the agility of Sylvie Guillem , to collapse in a great wash of elation , exhaustion , gratitude , spent rubber and , still , every now and then , love .
Get a key , and use it to open the door .

From Conservapedia
Barack Hussein Obama II ( reportedly born in Honolulu , Hawaii on August 4 , 1961 ) was the 44th President of the United States .
Elected as America 's first " post- racial " president according to mainstream fake news media , Obama exacerbated racial tensions and left a dismal legacy of a divided [ 2 ]
America along Marxist class , racial , and " gender normative " lines .
[ 3 ]
In his final year in office , Barack Obama illegally meddled in the 2016 Presidential election and attempted to blame the Russians for it . [ 4 ]
In early January 2017 , Obama empowered holdovers in his administration to stage a coup against the Trump transition team and the incoming Trump administration .
[ 5 ]
Barack Obama is the first American president since the transition of James Buchanan to Abraham Lincoln who refused a peaceful transfer of power to his elected successor .
According to Joe Biden , who served for more than four decades in the nation 's capital , there were no clean , bright , and articulate Blacks prior to Barack Obama . [ 6 ]
Obama was educated at Harvard Law School .
In a paper he wrote as a student , he dismissed the American dream as " unfounded optimism " while noting that Donald Trump is the true idol of the American working class . [ 7 ]
Obama insisted on failed policies , such as ObamaCare , and yet had an arrogant dismissal of his critics . [ 8 ]
A hard veil of censorship fell during his administration . [ 9 ]
Much of Obama 's personal life was shrouded in mystery [ 10 ] as a fawning media promoted his agenda of uprooting cultural norms .
Critics of Obamacare or gay marriage typically were smeared as racist .
The US Intelligence Community was used to spy on , harass , and intimidate independent journalists and political opponents . [ 11 ]
His presidency was marred by anemic economic growth , rising federal debt , his poor foreign policies and multiple political scandals . [ 12 ]
Obama separated families at the border and locked children in cages . [ 13 ]
Pursuing a foreign policy that undermined American interests , he developed close relations with foreign dictators and shunned democratic movements . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
He failed to see the backlash against his " transformational " Cultural Marxist programs and said in February 2016 , " I continue to believe that Mr. Trump will not be president . " [ 16 ]
Some people say that Obama is the worst president in history . [ 17 ]
Obama is pro-abortion .
In fact , he was the most pro-abortion president to date . [ 18 ]
Obama dedicated himself to promoting abortion — rather than reduce them as he promised .
Just to name a few of the administrative actions by which he has done this would include expanding abortions through Obamacare , appointing many pro-abortion judges and officials , moving to strip medical professionals of rights of conscience , and forcing taxpayers to support the pro-abortion movement around the globe .
Obama partnered with al Qaeda and Islamic State elements in Syria for a regime change war against Bashar al Assad . [ 19 ]
Assad was a voice for pluralism and inclusion , protecting Christians , Jews , Yazidis and minorities against Obama - backed Islamofascists . [ 20 ]
Despite framing himself as an advocate for the poor , speaking about income inequality and socialism , Obama is a limousine liberal as his life after his presidency attests .
Biography
Early controversies
Main article : Early life and career of Barack Hussein Obama
Obama claims to have been born in Honolulu , Hawaii on August 4 , 1961 , to Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Obama Sr. — who had married just six months prior . [ 21 ]
Some contend that this story is a complete fabrication .
Obama was reportedly given a social security number whose first three digits were assigned at that time to applications coming from zip codes in Connecticut . [ 22 ]
Obama traveled to Pakistan , India , and Indonesia in 1981 , however , he never obtained a U.S. passport until 2004 after he was elected to the United States Senate .
During the 2008 presidential primaries , a firm headed by John Brennan hacked into the U.S. State Department 's visa files and accessed Obama 's passport files using whichever Social Security numbers Obama was using at the time . [ 23 ]
An FBI informant and whistleblower who worked for Brennan , and was the key witness , was found murdered by a gunshot wound two weeks later . [ 24 ]
Obama later appointed Brennan to a key White House position and as CIA director in his second term .
Brennan was referred for criminal investigation in 2019 in Obama 's Spygate scandal .
Claims that Obama was born in Kenya have been traced to sources hired by Obama .
In 1991 , Obama 's literary agent , Acton & Dystel , published a promotional booklet stating that Obama was born in Kenya . [ 25 ]
The claim that Obama was born in Kenya remained on the agent 's website until 2007 . [ 26 ]
Internet archives confirm this information . [ 27 ]
In addition to the information from literary agents , Michelle Obama stated in a speech that Kenya is Obama 's " homeland " . [ 28 ]
At a speech in Kenya shortly after his presidency ended , Obama publicly stated that , " Now , three years ago , I visited Kenya as the first sitting American President to come from Kenya . " [ 29 ]
Obama 's birth parents divorced in 1963 when his mother discovered Barack Obama Sr. was already married to a woman living in Kenya . [ 30 ]
When Obama was 2 years old his mother married Lolo Soetoro , an Indonesian geologist .
At age 6 his mother and adoptive father took him to Jakarta , Indonesia for 4 years while his mother pursued a Ph.D. in Anthropology requiring fieldwork there . [ 31 ]
His mother then abandoned him in Hawaii with his grandparents ( Stanley and Madelyn Dunham , who had moved to Hawaii in 1959 ) [ 32 ] so she could return to Indonesia after her divorce .
Obama 's grandfather arranged for his friend , the noted Communist writer Frank Marshall Davis , to serve as a mentor and role model for an impressionable African - American youth .
Other siblings of Obama 's include his half - sister Maya Soetoro - Ng and 7 other children born to his father by 4 different women . [ 33 ]
For much of his early life , prior to his transfer to Columbia University , he went by his nickname , " Barry . "
In the summer of 1988 , before attending Harvard Law School ( he 'd just been accepted ) , he visited Kogelo , Kenya , to learn more about his father 's family .
When his mother died in 1995 , he and his sister Maya scattered her ashes over Hawaii 's south shore . [ 32 ]
Obama attended Reverend Jeremiah Wright 's Trinity United Church from 1984 - 1988 during his time as a community organizer ( See 1985 - 1988 , Community Organizer section ) .
Obama credits
Wright with his alleged conversion to Christianity , and had both his daughters , Sasha and Malia , baptized there . [ 32 ]
Education
At age 6 , Obama attended schools in Indonesia , the first a Catholic school while he was in kindergarten , and later a public school which taught religion .
The school had mostly Muslim students ( since most Indonesians are Muslim ) .
In Dreams from My Father , Obama writes , " In the Muslim school , the teacher wrote to my mother that I had made faces during Koranic studies . " [ 34 ]
Insight magazine first reported Hillary Clinton 's organization had " questions about Obama ’s Muslim background :
Are the American people ready for an elected president who was educated in a Madrassa as a young boy and has not been forthcoming about his Muslim heritage ? " [ 35 ]
In 1971 , at age 10 , Barack Obama moved to Hawaii , and his grandparents helped him gain entrance to the prestigious Punahou Academy in Honolulu where he began substance abuse and illegal drugs . [ 36 ]
He was accepted through a scholarship for disadvantaged minorities while he was in 5th grade . [ 32 ]
At this elite high school with 1,200 students he was just 1 of 3 black students .
Obama failed to make the starting lineup of the school 's state champion basketball team his senior year .
He wrote a poem for the school 's literary magazine , Ka Wai Ola . [ 33 ]
In 1979 , he began a 2 - year stint at Occidental College college in Los Angeles , [ 21 ] and then transferred to Columbia University in New York , which he graduated from in 1983 . [ 37 ]
During this time he published an anti-military tirade embracing Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev's [ 38 ] proposal for a nuclear freeze in the campus newspaper and allegedly spoke at an Anti-Apartheid rally , [ 32 ] although several prominent student leaders said they did not remember him there .
Professor Michael L. Baron was impressed by Obama and wrote him a recommendation for Harvard Law School . [ 39 ]
From 1983 to 1988 , Obama took time off from his education to work as a financial analyst and later a community organizer in Chicago .
In the winter of 1988 , Barack Obama decided to attend Harvard Law School , and left Chicago for Cambridge , Massachusetts .
In his 2nd year a power struggle broke out among the dominant white liberals over control of the Harvard Law Review .
Obama was elected its first black president as a compromise candidate largely with help of conservatives following a " marathon voting session " in which he finally won on the 19th ballot . [ 33 ]
This led to national attention and numerous job offers , which Obama passed up , at age 30 , to pursue his political career in Chicago . [ 40 ]
When Obama was attending Harvard Law School , he dreamed of him or his children becoming like Donald Trump . [ 41 ]
Personal life According to Rising Star by David J. Garrow , in 1986 Obama tried hard to convince Sheila Miyoshii Jager , someone of Dutch and Japanese ancestry , to marry him . [ 42 ]
She refused his request to marry him due to her age .
By 1987 , Obama had his sights on becoming U.S. president . [ 42 ]
Michelle ( Robinson ) Obama , Barack Obama 's domestic partner .
Barack Obama met his mate known then as Michelle Robinson , while he was an intern and Michelle was on staff at Sidley Austin LLP , a very large corporate law firm . [ 21 ]
Despite company policy prohibiting relations between staff and interns , the two became involved .
The two continued a long - distance relationship while he finished law school , and on October 18 , 1992 , [ 43 ] were joined in a domestic union officiated by Reverend Jeremiah Wright at Trinity United Church , [ 44 ] a church which has supported gay marriage since the 1970s . [ 32 ]
Michelle has not practiced law since 1994 when she failed to renew her law license , allegedly to start a family .
Malia , the couple 's oldest daughter , was born in 1999 , and Natasha ( often called Sasha ) in 2001 . [ 21 ]
Early employment
1983 –1984 : financial analyst and writer
In 1983 Obama colluded with Russia to further Russian foreign policy interests against the United States in an essay entitled Breaking The War Mentality published in Columbia University 's weekly magazine , The Sun Dial . [ 45 ]
In 1984 Obama worked as a writer and financial analyst for Business International Corporation to help pay off some of his student loans .
Business International Corporation was a small newsletter - publishing and research firm which aided multinational companies in understanding overseas markets .
Obama served as a writer / researcher for a company reference service , Financing Foreign Operations , and wrote for their newsletter , Business International Money Report .
His supervisor was Cathy Lazere . [ 46 ]
1984–1988 : community organizer
In 1984 , Obama was hired by the New York Public Interest Research Group , a non-profit organization promoting environmental , consumer , and government reforms .
He also was paid just under $ 10,000 annually as a full - time organizer for Harlem 's City College to mobilize student volunteers . [ 39 ]
From 1985 – 88 , Obama worked as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago [ 47 ] funded with a $ 25,000 grant by Bill Ayers ' Woods Fund .
The New York Times reported he was paid $ 1,000 a year , with $ 2,000 extra for a car [ 48 ] however stories vary wildly .
Jerry Kellman , who hired him , says it was " $ 10,000 a year and a $ 2,000 car allowance " .
Obama himself gave different numbers ; his memoir says $ 10,000 ( as well as the car ) , in his Wesleyan speech he gave it as " $ 12,000 a year plus $ 2,000 for an old , beat - up car " , and when he announced his candidacy for president , it was " a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $ 13,000 a year " .
Ryan Lizza at The New Republic reported that " Jean Rudd of the Woods Fund ... had provided Kellman with his original $ 25,000 to hire Obama " .
Ari Berman reported in The Nation that the " [ Woods Fund ] gave a $ 25,000 grant to the Developing Communities Project , which hired Obama " .
CBS Channel 2 in Chicago ran a story with a document showing that Obama 's proposed salary in 1987 was $ 25,000 , a number that the Obama campaign confirmed while insisting at the same time his original salary was $ 13,000 . [ 49 ]
Many of the organizers that Obama worked with in Chicago were experienced in the methods of Saul Alinsky , and taught Obama many of the methods found in his book Rules for Radicals . [ 50 ]
During this time Obama joined Reverend Wright 's Trinity United Church because in the words of Suzanne Malveaux of CNN , " It was the church to join if you wanted to be one of Chicago 's black movers and shakers . "
At the time , community organizing involved close affiliation with churches , which was how Obama met Wright .
Obama abandoned the fight against asbestos contamination in the Altgeld Gardens housing project to pursue personal interests and a career by enrollment at Harvard Law School in the winter of 1988 . [ 32 ]
The Birther movement was started by Obama himself .
1988 –1996 : law practice
In 1988 Obama gained work as a Summer Associate at one of the most prestigious corporate law firms in the world , Sidley Austin LLP , [ 51 ] whose partners included Newton Minow , thanks to the recommendation of Minow 's daughter Martha , a professor at Harvard Law School .
It was at the Sidley Austin firm that Obama would meet Michelle Robinson , his future domestic partner . [ 33 ]
From 1993 - 96 he practiced civil rights law including suing Citibank to force them into making subprime mortgages to minority borrowers . [ 52 ]
After graduating from Harvard he was hired by Miner , Barnhill , & Galland , a small politically - connected law firm . [ 53 ]
It was at Miner , Barnhill , & Galland that he would meet influential real estate developer Tony Rezko . [ 32 ]
1991 –1992 : Project Vote
In 1991 Obama was recruited by Sandy Newman to head the Chicago chapter of Project Vote ! , [ 32 ] and in 1992 was the Executive Director , overseeing a voter registration drive which registered 125,000 black voters and was credited with defeating popular incumbent Democrat Senator Alan Dixon in the primary and electing Carol Moseley - Braun as a reprisal for Dixon 's support for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas . [ 54 ]
1991 -1995 : Author
In 1995 Obama published Dreams From My Father about his life and family background . [ 21 ]
It was in a 1992 book Obama claimed to have been born in Kenya .
1995 : Nation of Islam
According to the Encyclopedia Britannica , prior to the information being scrubbed from its website in mid-April 2008 during the Democratic Presidential Primaries , Obama was one of three prominent organizers of black supremacist group the Nation of Islam 's Million Man March on Washington , D.C. [ 56 ]
1992 –2004 : lecturer at University of Chicago Obama taught part - time at the University of Chicago Law School [ 33 ] from 1992 –2004 .
Though Obama erroneously describes himself as a " constitutional law professor " , [ 57 ] he was actually only a senior lecturer and the class he taught the most times was called " Current Issues in Racism and the Law " . [ 58 ]
He was a Lecturer from 1992 – 96 , teaching 3 courses per year , and a senior lecturer from 1996 – 2004 .
After Obama was criticized for lying about his job title , the University of Chicago released a statement stating that senior lecturers are considered Law School faculty and regarded as professors but not full - time or tenured .
Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full - time , tenured track position several times during this period but declined each time . [ 59 ]
Awards
Obama shares the distinction with Richard Nixon and Josef Stalin as twice being named Time magazine person of the year .
2009 Nobel Peace Prize
On October 9 , 2009 , Barack H. Obama became the third sitting U.S. President [ 60 ] to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize " for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples " . [ 61 ]
Obama stated that he was " surprised and deeply humbled " to receive the unexpected award , [ 62 ] and also said , " To be honest , I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who 've been honored by this prize — men and women who have inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace " . [ 60 ]
The award was widely criticized given Obama 's then lack of accomplishments . [ 63 ]
1996 –2003 : Illinois State Senate
1996 election
In 1995 a cadre of like - minded individuals gathered for a fundraising event in the early career of Barack Obama hosted by Weather Underground ( WUO ) terrorist William " Bill " Ayers .
Besides Obama , those in attendance were Ayers wife Bernardine Dohrn , [ 64 ] and Carl Davidson , veterans of guerrilla warfare training in Cuba just prior to the 1968 Democrat National Convention riots .
Ayers and Dohrn have taken credit for , and never denied , bombing the U.S. Capitol , the Pentagon and the State Department .
Ayers and Dohrn used their celebrity status among leftists to launch Obama 's career .
Ayers , Dohrn and Jeff Jones [ 65 ] are authors of Prairie Fire : The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-imperialism , the title taken from The Sayings of Mao Zedong . [ 66 ]
The book declares " we are communist men and women . " [ 67 ]
Ayers later jokingly , publicly admitted to ghostwriting Obama 's book , Dreams From My Father [ 68 ] and Obama was to appoint several openly avowed Maoists to prominent White House and Executive Branch positions . [ 69 ]
A Charter of Negative Liberties
In a 2001 interview on WBEZ FM Chicago Public Radio , Senator Obama said some critically disparaging things about the United States Constitution .
He said :
If you look at the victories and failures of the civil rights movement and its litigation strategy in the court , I think where it succeeded was to vest formal rights in previously dispossessed peoples .
So that I would now have the right to vote , I would now be able to sit at the lunch counter and order and as long as I could pay for it I ’d be okay .
But the Supreme Court never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth and sort of more basic issues of political and economic justice in this society .
And to that extent as radical as people tried to characterize the Warren court , it was n’t that radical .
It did n’t break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in the Constitution , at least as it ’s been interpreted , and the Warren court interpreted it in the same way that generally the Constitution is a charter of negative liberties .
It says what the states ca n’t do to you , it says what the federal government can’t do to you , but it does n’t say what the federal government or the state government must do on your behalf .
And that has n’t shifted .
One of the I think tragedies of the civil rights movement was because the civil rights movement became so court focused , I think that there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing and activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributed change and in some ways we still suffer from that . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ]
Backstabbing fellow Democrats
Barack Obama ran for the Illinois state senate in 1996 .
He was initially supported by incumbent Alice Palmer , who declared she would run for the U.S. Congress .
However , when her bid for Congress failed on November 28 , 1995 , she tried to run for her old seat in the March 1996 election .
Her supporters asked Obama to step aside , although whether this was with her permission remains uncertain . [ 37 ]
Not only did Obama not step down , he gathered a team of high - priced lawyers , including fellow Harvard Law School graduate Thomas Johnson , to challenge his opponent 's petition signatures on technicalities after the filing deadline had passed .
Such tactics are legal and frequently used in Chicago ; in 2006 they eliminated 67 of the 245 aldermanic candidates ; [ 73 ] yet nevertheless led to the term " hardball " by The New York Times [ 37 ] and " cutthroat " by David Mendel as reported by both CNN [ 32 ] and MSNBC . [ 21 ]
The Chicago Tribune declared Obama had mastered " the bare - knuckle arts of Chicago electoral politics " , noting " The man now running for president on a message of giving a voice to the voiceless first entered public office not by leveling the playing field , but by clearing it . " [ 73 ]
As one of Obama 's four opponents , eliminated through his ballot challenges , would put it :
“ " Why say you 're for a new tomorrow , then do old - style Chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates ?
He talks about honor and democracy , but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot - free ?
Why not let the people decide ? " — Gha-is Askia , 1996 Illinois Senate candidate [ 74 ] ”
Mark Ewell , another candidate , filed 1,286 signatures , and Obama 's challenges left him 86 short of the minimum requirement ( 757 ) .
Ewell filed a federal lawsuit contesting the election board 's decision but Tom Johnson intervened , and Ewell 's case was dismissed just a few days later .
Ewell and other Obama opponents were using early 1995 polling sheets to verify signatures of registered voters , but city authorities had just purged 15,871 unqualified people from the 13th district list , and Obama 's challenges used the more recent , updated list .
Askia was left 69 signatures short of the requirement .
If names were printed instead of signed in cursive , they were declared invalid .
If they were good but the person registering the signatures was n't a registered voter ( e.g. underage ) they were invalid .
Palmer had according to Obama campaign consult Ronald Davis , used two children to help gather her petition signatures .
To this day Palmer denies the challenges were valid , and maintains she could have overcome the objections with more time and resources .
Thanks to his lawyers , Obama would win the election without a single other candidate on the ballot .
2000 election
In 2000 , Obama lost his only political election when he chose to run against experienced incumbent and former Black Panther Bobby L. Rush for the U.S. Congress in a 65 % black district .
Rush 's name recognition began at 90 % , Obama 's at 11 % .
Michelle Obama opposed taking on such an iconic figure dear to the community and threatened divorce . [ 77 ]
Establishment Democrats considered Obama " a white man in blackface " . [ 78 ]
Rush said of Obama , " He went to Harvard and became an educated fool , " adding , " We ’re not impressed with these folks with these eastern elite degrees . " [ 79 ]
Todd Spivak would give voice to this impression of Obama , noting that
“ " My view of Obama then was n't all that different from the image he projects now ....
One thing I can say is , I never heard him launch into the preacher - man voice he now employs during speeches .
He sounded vanilla , and activists in his mostly black district often chided him for it . " [ 75 ] ”
Rush would go on to win the Primary with 61.02 % of the vote ; Obama received 30.36 % . [ 80 ]
The loss led to Obama considering dropping out of politics altogether , particularly after the September 11 , 2001 attacks , since his name sounds similar to " Osama bin Laden " . [ 21 ]
State Senate voting record
Obama entered the Illinois Senate promising change to a corrupt system .
He mixed often radical votes with more pragmatic agreements .
Possibly one of his most radical votes was against requiring medical care for aborted children who survive the procedure – in fact , the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council ascribed him a 100 % rating for his consistently pro-choice votes . [ 81 ]
He was criticized for using the statehouse as a stepping stone for a more illustrious career : Steven J. Rauschenberger , a Republican , said prior to Obama 's election as president : “ He is a very bright but very ambitious person who has always had his eyes on the prize , and it was n’t Springfield .
If he deserves to be president , it is not because he was a great legislator . ” [ 82 ]
The statehouse was majority Republican , so the Senator was sometimes forced to compromise .
He formed allegiances across party lines to pass campaign finance reform that banned most gifts by lobbyists , prohibited spending campaign money for legislators ’ personal use and required electronic filing of campaign disclosure reports . [ 82 ]
Obama also helped pass a so - called “ driving - while - black bill ” , which required the police to collect data on the race of drivers they stopped as a way to monitor racial profiling . [ 82 ]
Obama established himself as a chief spokesperson in opposition to the War on Terror during an October 2002 rally at Federal Plaza in Chicago [ 83 ] organized by veteran Maoist and webmaster of Progressives for Obama , [ 84 ] Carl Davidson .
2003 Emil Jones deal
Main Article : 2003 Barack Obama deal with Emil Jones
When Illinois ' U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald announced he would be retiring in April 2003 , Obama jumped at the opportunity , declaring that he would be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004 . [ 21 ]
To boost his chances Obama approached the newly crowned president of the Illinois Senate , Emil Jones Jr. , with a proposal .
According to Jones , whom Obama has since called his " godfather " [ 85 ] the conversation went as follows :
“ " After I was elected president , in 2003 , he came to see me , a couple months later .
And he said to me , he said , ‘ You ’re the senate president now , and with that , you have a lot of pow - er . ’
And I told Barack , ‘ You think I got a lot of pow - er now ? , ’ and he said , ‘ Yeah , you got a lot of pow - er . ’
And I said , ‘ What kind of pow - er do I have ? ’
He said , ‘ You have the pow - er to make a United States sen - a - tor ! ’
I said to Barack , I said , ‘ That sounds good ! ’
I said , ‘ I have n’t even thought of that . ’
I said , ‘ Do you have someone in mind you think I could make ? , ’ and he said , ‘ Yeah . Me . ’" [ 54 ] ”
Because of the deal , Obama 's entire Illinois Senate legislative record was , as longtime Obama reporter Todd Spivak put it , built in a single year .
During his 7th and final year in the Illinois Senate , Obama sponsored an incredible 26 bills into law , including many he now points to when criticized as inexperienced [ 75 ] — as CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux observed , " With help from on high , Obama got his name on hundreds of bills that he pushed through . " [ 32 ]
Jones not only had Obama craft legislation addressing daily tragedies to raise his political profile , [ 85 ] he also appointed Obama head of almost all high - profile legislation in the Illinois Senate , angering other state legislators with more seniority who'd spent years supporting the bills . [ 75 ]
Illinois State Senator Rickey Hendon , the original sponsor of the famous racial profiling bill requiring videotaped confessions in police interrogations , complained bitterly about Jones ' decision . [ 86 ]
Jones ' influence had a major impact on Obama 's chances in the 2004 elections , preventing major political players from backing Obama 's opponents .
To quote Emil Jones ,
“ " He knew if he had me in the run for the Senate , it would put a block on the current mayor .
The current mayor and the father of the controller , which was Dan Hynes , they were roommates in Springfield when the mayor was a state senator , so they had a relationship .
Another big financial backer for the governor was Blair Hull .
Barack knew if he had me it would checkmate the governor , ’ cause the governor could n’t come out and go with Blair Hull , ’ cause the governor needs me .
Same with the mayor .
So he had analyzed and figured all of that out .
He knew I could help him with labor support .
And I could put a checkmate on some of the local politicians that did n’t know him , but they could n’t really go against me . " — Emil Jones [ 33 ] ”
2004–2008 : U.S. Senate
Senator Barack Obama
Obama was a relatively undistinguished Senator .
2004 Primary election Despite initially trailing in the polls to frontrunner Blair Hull , [ 87 ]
Obama greatly benefited from what the Chicago Tribune called " the most inglorious campaign implosion in Illinois political history " [ 88 ] when pressure from journalists and opposing candidates , just weeks before the election , forced the unsealing of Hull 's messy divorce files . [ 89 ]
The files revealed Hull 's ex-wife 's accusations of verbal and physical abuse . [ 75 ]
Hull would afterward criticize the media , stating , " As for the press , I will never read the newspaper the same way again . " [ 88 ]
Obama would go on to win the Primary with 53 % of the vote . [ 89 ]
Obama 's unexpected victory led to him being termed a " rising star " by the media . [ 90 ]
2004 General election , Jack Ryan
Once again Obama found himself trailing to popular front - runner Jack Ryan , and once again a candidate 's campaign imploded thanks to media intervention .
In an unprecedented move , the Chicago Tribune and local TV station WLS sued to force the unsealing of Ryan 's divorce files , despite opposition from both Ryan and his wife , Jeri Ryan , who in the files accused Jack Ryan of trying to coerce her to perform sex acts in public .
Though Ryan advisors told him he could still win if using a negative attack on Obama , Ryan refused to engage in what he considered dirty politics . [ 91 ]
Ryan then dropped out of the race ( per request by the Illinois GOP [ 92 ] ) , following which the Illinois GOP scrambled to find a replacement , leaving Obama uncontested for weeks to campaign and build up public support .
On top of all this , Obama was selected to give the keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention ( July 27[ 93 ] ) , catapulting him into the national spotlight , and leading to further media publicity terming him a " rising star " . [ 94 ]
2004 General election , Alan Keyes
Main Article : Obama born alive controversy
After a number of candidates including former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka declined to run , [ 95 ] the Illinois GOP finally settled on fiery Alan Keyes , a former Ambassador to the Economic and Social Counsel of the United Nations , [ 75 ] with less than 3 months left before the November 2004 election . [ 21 ]
His sudden entrance into the state for the election was initially attacked in the press as " carpetbagging " . [ 96 ]
Keyes repeatedly claimed his primary motivation for entering a race he had seemingly no chance of winning was his disgust at Obama 's votes on the popular Born Alive bills . [ 97 ]
Keyes , from his first day of arriving in Illinois ( August 9 , 2004 ) , [ 98 ] accused Obama of having voted against bills mandating medical care for newborn children , and supporting " infanticide " ( the term twice used in the Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act [ 99 ] ) where hospitals left newborn infants to die like garbage .
[ 100 ]
Obama in a debate on October 13 , 2004 , defended himself against Keyes ' accusations of infanticide by claiming that Illinois law was already sufficient .
[ 101 ]
However , Keyes ' rhetoric , calling Obama 's votes " the slaveholder 's position " [ 98 ] and saying " Jesus Christ would not vote for Obama " [ 102 ] was widely ridiculed by the press .
Keyes ' unabashed criticism of homosexuality as " selfish hedonism " was also targeted .
[ 103 ]
Obama would ultimately win the election , 70 % to 27 % . [ 104 ]
U.S. Senate voting record Obama 's incomplete term in the U.S. Senate was largely not noteworthy .
In voting against raising the debt limit in 2006 Obama famously said , " The fact that we are here today to debate raising America ’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure .
It is a sign that the U.S. government can’t pay its own bills .
... I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America ’s debt limit . " [ 105 ]
In 2008 as candidate for president Obama called George W. Bush 's request to raise the debt limit " irresponsible " and " unpatriotic " .
[ 106 ]
The National Journal ranked him the most liberal senator in 2007 . [ 107 ]
Obama frequently used the filibuster to obstruct the operations of government , [ 108 ] and voted against the minimum wage bill [ 109 ] he introduced because it included a provision to pay active duty U.S. troops .
He voted for the $ 700 billion TARP program to bailout the big banks after receiving more than $ 120,000 in contributions from Fannie Mae , a government - sponsored entity [ 110 ] taken into conservatorship for mismanaging its affairs and responsible for all the big banks ' problems .
According to Opensecrets.org , of the 671,269 contributions to Obama during his time in the Senate , Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , Citigroup , and Morgan Stanley were among the top 20 biggest money donors to his campaigns .
[ 111 ]
All four subsequently received approximately $ 70 billion in taxpayer assisted bailout money from the TARP program he voted for . [ 112 ] UBS AG , a foreign bank and the 12th largest donor to Obama , [ 113 ] was fined $ 780 billion in February 2009 in a U.S. Federal Court on charges it helped thousands of Americans evade taxes . [ 114 ]
After just four short years , Obama still ranks number one over all time of Big Pharma money recipients with slightly under $ 5 million , followed by Hillary Clinton with a little more than $ 3.5 million . [ 115 ]
Since entering the Senate , prescription opioid deaths in the U.S. rose from 12,000 per year to over 46,000 per year . [ 116 ]
Presidential campaigns
Contrary to popular myth at the end of the Cold War , Communism did not die , it only went into remission .
The rise of Barack Obama and passage of the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) signaled a renewed attack on basic constitutional rights and a revival of a spectre haunting humanity .
2008
Main article : Barack Hussein Obama 2008 Presidential campaign
Unlike Democrat contenders Hillary Clinton and John Kerry , Obama 's hands were not " stained " with the Iraqi war resolution ; a number of Democrats wanted to punish candidates for acting bi-partisan and called for his candidacy .
His only career accomplishment until then had been the delivery of a speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention .
Through heavy use of early voting by the Democrat political machine , Obama was elected president in 2008 in the midst of a severe economic meltdown and a foreign policy crisis .
Obama outspent John McCain by hundreds of millions of dollars in 2008 , [ 117 ] and spending more than a billion dollars from special interests to snag reelection in 2012 .
[ 118 ]
Former Democrat Presidential candidate Joe Lieberman endorsed Obama 's opponent John McCain in 2008 and declined to endorse Obama for the 2012 presidential election . [ 119 ]
Primary election
In 2007 –08 , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton competed for the Democrat nomination .
Hillary Clinton cleverly resurrected the " Born Alive " controversy surrounding Obama that had lain largely dormant since 2004 ( notwithstanding the continuing mentions by Jill Stanek ) , by accusing Obama of not being pro-choice for voting " Present " on a number of abortion - related bills [ 120 ] — including the Born Alive ones , [ 121 ] and cowardly ducking the votes . [ 122 ]
This led to criticism of Obama by two pro-choice organizations , Emily 's List , and the National Organization for Women . [ 123 ]
However , Pam Sutherland , the long - time head of Illinois Planned Parenthood , came to Obama 's aid , criticizing Clinton for making the attack , and stating repeatedly that Obama 's present votes were part of a broader strategy used by Planned Parenthood to keep Illinois voters from knowing their state senators were voting against the controversial and popular bills . [ 124 ] [ 125 ]
“ " He came to me and said : ‘ My members are being attacked .
We need to figure out a way to protect members and to protect women .
A ‘ present ’ vote was hard to pigeonhole which is exactly what Obama wanted .
What it did was give cover to moderate Democrats who wanted to vote with us but were afraid to do so " because of how their votes would be used against them electorally .
A ‘ present ’ vote would protect them .
Your senator voted ‘ present . ’
Most of the electorate is not going to know what that means . "
- Pam Sutherland , President / CEO of Illinois Planned Parenthood Council , 1980 - 2012 [ 126 ] ”
As the contest in Iowa drew near and the former First Lady 's inevitability was being usurped by a challenger , Hillary Clinton organizers began circulating rumors that Obama was secretly a Muslim .
Clinton also made the claim repeatedly that while Obama was leading in Delegates she was winning the Popular Vote , though this was in part because Obama had n't been registered in Michigan .
Obama 's advantage with super - delegates over Clinton was about 2 - to - 1. Obama was able to attract the support of liberals by pointing out that he had come out against the Iraq War " from the beginning " whereas Clinton had voted in favor of the war in 2002 .
On June 7 , 2008 , Hillary Clinton withdrew from the Primaries , conceding the race and endorsing her opponent , when Obama passed the 2,118 Delegates required ; winning 2,201 delegates to Clinton 's 1,896 .
Jeremiah Wright controversy
President Obama in Evergreen Chapel
See also : Barack Obama and Liberation Theology
One major dilemma that arose for Obama during his campaign was his connection to his preacher Jeremiah Wright .
Obama and his wife ( raised a Baptist ) were members of the Trinity United Church of Christ [ 138 ] in Chicago , a church that embraced black liberation theology and its emphasis on empowering so - called " oppressed groups " against " establishment forces " .
This denomination was the first in America to ordain gays as ministers . [ 139 ]
Church pastor Jeremiah Wright had been making inflammatory comments and posting his sermons online for sale .
These include the statement " G - d damn America , " and in describing the September 11th attacks , " We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans , and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards .
America 's chickens are coming home to roost . " [ 140 ]
In addition , Rev. Wright blamed America saying " We supported Zionism shamelessly while ignoring the Palestinians and branding anybody who spoke out against it as being anti-Semitic . "
In April 2008 , after 20 years in the church , candidate Obama made public statements poised to set him at odds with the man who conducted his wedding and baptized his children .
With the negative publicity persisting , a month later Obama ended the friendship , left Wright 's church , and blamed the media . [ 141 ]
Obama claimed “ It ’s not fair to the other members of the church who seek to worship in peace ... " , and distanced himself from Wright 's sermons as " a bunch of rants that are n't grounded in the truth . " [ 142 ] [ 143 ]
Born Alive record resurfaces
On June 30 , 2008 , Obama 's voting record on the " Born Alive " bills came once more to the forefront when CNN gave voice to the growing controversy and revealed the defense Obama had been using since 2004–2008 , that the Illinois bills he'd voted against were different from the federal bill , was false , since he'd brought up for a vote a bill word for word identical to the federal bill in the Health and Human Services Committee he chaired , and voted against it , defeating it . [ 144 ] [ 145 ]
This led in August to a confrontation between Obama and the NRLC . [ 146 ]
After Obama accused critics of ' lying ' [ 147 ] the NRLC challenged the assertion , and the Obama campaign conceded he " misspoke " and had voted against an identical bill to the " federal bill that everybody supported " but focused on Obama 's new claim , that Illinois law was already sufficient to protect newborn children . [ 148 ]
The NRLC promptly declared " Senator Barack Obama 's four - year effort to cover up his full role in killing legislation to protect born - alive survivors of abortions continues to unravel . " [ 149 ]
Result Obama made an effort to portray John McCain as similar to George W. Bush , drawing attention to McCain 's refusal to criticize the unpopular president .
McCain was particularly criticized for saying of how many years we should be willing to stay in Iraq , " Make it a hundred . " [ 150 ]
“ " John McCain went on television and said that there has been great progress economically over the last seven - and - a - half years .
John McCain thinks our economy has made great progress under George W. Bush ?
How could somebody who has been traveling across this country , somebody who came to Erie , Pennsylvania , say we ’ve made great progress ? " - Barack Obama [ 151 ] ”
On August 22 , Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate for the vice presidency , which would be contrasted one week later with John McCain 's selection of Sarah Palin
On November 2 , 2008 , Barack Obama won the presidential election with 365 electoral votes to John McCain 's 173 . [ 154 ] Obama received 53 % of the popular vote to John McCain 's 46 % . [ 155 ]
2012
Main article : Presidential Election 2012
During his campaigns , Obama said that he intended to " spread the wealth around " and was portrayed as saying that entrepreneurs and employers deserve no credit for building their businesses . [ 156 ]
On March 1 , 2013 Obama issued executive orders to implement his sequester of budget cuts which [ 157 ] has been widely criticized for destroying jobs in what was an anemic and fragile recovery . [ 158 ]
Warren L. Dean Jr. , an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center , wrote :
Washington has done more during Mr. Obama ’s term in office to promote wealth and income inequality than at any other time in history . [ 159 ]
Obama 's illegal domestic spying on political opponents and FISA abuse began in June 2012 before the November 2012 presidential election and was continued beyond his term of office by holdovers . [ 160 ]
According to a NBC News poll , from August 2014 , Obama 's approval rating was a dismal 40 % , [ 161 ] showing that six in ten Americans disapproved of his liberal policies .
Given that liberals frequently engage in deceit , the actual approval ratings could be much lower .
When Obama left office , the same pollsters who prognosticated a blowout win for Hillary Clinton maintained Obama 's approval rating was above 50 % .
Birth certificate controversies
On April 27 , 2011 , [ 162 ] a long - running controversy surrounding Obama 's birth was largely put to rest [ 163 ] when Obama had his long - form birth certificate posted at WhiteHouse.gov . [ 164 ] Donald Trump , who had been critical of Obama for allowing the divisiveness to linger was then leading Republicans in polls for the upcoming GOP primary [ 165 ] and has been credited with bringing final resolution to the issue .
The birth certificates of Michelle Robinson , which would disclosure her birth - sex , and the two children which would clarify their birth parentage , however , remain undisclosed .
The following is a synopsis of previous events leading up to the release :
Hillary Clinton top advisor Sidney Blumenthal , and his son , Max Blumenthal , were the origin of the rumors in 2008 that Barack Hussein Obama was a Muslim in order to stir up fear among white Democrats and women , intended for Hillary 's benefit .
[ 166 ] McClatchy Washington Bureau Chief James
Asher relayed , " Mr. Blumenthal and I met together in my office and he strongly urged me to investigate the exact place of President Obama ’s birth , which he suggested was in Kenya . " [ 167 ]
Snope 's has identified a claim that a 1991 promotional booklet by Barack Obama 's then - literary agency , Acton & Dystel , touted Obama as " born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii " as being true . [ 168 ]
Hillary Clinton 's 2008 campaign team then began spreading Islamophobic rumors that Obama was a Muslim schooled in a madrassa as a child in Indonesia . [ 169 ] [ 170 ]
A group registered as People United Means Action ( PUMA ) was made up of Hillary Clinton supporters who not only opposed Barack Obama 's nomination but also sought to delegitimize his presidency .
[ 171 ] PUMA members charged that the media directed sexism and misogyny at Clinton during the 2008 primary campaign and expressed anger at Democratic Party leaders ' failure to speak out or otherwise respond appropriately .
Hillary Clinton had received a majority of votes in the 2008 Democratic primaries and PUMA felt the Superdelegates robbed Hillary of the nomination .
Retribution killings
Obama transformed the Bush administration War on Terror from a preventative measure against terrorism to a cry for vengeance , mob bloodlust , and retribution killings which spawned a fresh , new , and larger cycle of violence .
On May 1 , 2011 , Obama misled the public when he announced [ 172 ] [ 173 ] that Osama bin Laden was " killed in a firefight " after a U.S. special operations group infiltrated a compound in Abottobad , Pakistan . [ 174 ]
Attacks , murders , and kidnappings of Americans have since escalated as reprisals for bin Laden 's death .
Al Qaeda , once broken and on the run , operates openly as the jihad has now become global .
Relations with Pakistan , a longtime ally throughout the Cold War and War on Terror , became strained .
The government of Pakistan denied White House claims it allowed Americans to kill Muslims on its territory .
[ 175 ]
For all his duplicity and criticism of the War on Terror , Obama experienced only a temporary blip in approval ratings .
[ 176 ] [ 177 ]
An NBC investigation revealed Obama was informed of bin Laden 's whereabouts one full year before he attempted to use it as an election year issue .
NBC further reported that there was no " firefight " at all , contradicting what the president told the nation .
[ 178 ]
As early as the day after bin Laden was executed , it was learned bin Laden was not armed in the alleged " firefight " that Obama claimed took place .
Defends Mohammad
After the Benghazi terrorist attack which his administration knowingly and fraudulently blamed on the creator of an irreverent YouTube video critical of the founder of Islam , Obama made a speech at the UN in which he said ,
“ The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam . [ 179 ] ”
Four Americans died in the terrorist action intended to commemorate the 9/11 attacks .
The attack occurred on the US Consulate at Benghazi , part of the territory of the United States .
Administration officials did nothing to repel the attack in progress while huddling to discuss the domestic political ramifications for the upcoming presidential election , less than two months away .
The creator of the video was jailed on bogus charges unrelated to the video .
In 2015 , a series of terrorist attacks in France , Denmark and the United States claimed the lives of at least 15 people with dozens injured , including security and police officers , motivated by Muslim extremists defending what , in their view were , unflattering depictions of the founder of Islam , Mohammad .
Voting irregularities
According to Stanley Kurtz - author of Radical - in - Chief : Barack Obama and the Untold Story of American Socialism ( 2010 ) Obama in 1995 sought and obtained the endorsement of a left - wing third party , the New Party in his quest to be elected to the Illinois State Senate . [ 180 ]
Obama 's " Fight the Smears " campaign has denied this , as has Politico 's Ben Smith . [ 181 ]
Others who claim he was affiliated with the New Party / ACORN include The Blaze 's Billy Hallowell , [ 182 ] Breitbart 's Joel Pollack , Human Events ' Erick Erickson , [ 183 ] Newsbusters ' P.J. Gladnick , [ 184 ] Rick Moran at AmericanThinker.com , [ 185 ] and various writers at Discover the Networks ( which include Kurtz and Erickson ) . [ 186 ]
Kurtz in 2012 has claimed to find minutes of the New Party Chicago chapter that say , " Barack Obama , candidate for State Senate in the 13th Legislative District , gave a statement to the membership and answered questions .
He signed the New Party ' Candidate Contract ' and requested an endorsement from the New Party .
He also joined the New Party . " [ 181 ]
Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod responded to Kurtz with silence and when asked if that meant " yes or no " , Axelrod stated , " You can take that as I have no idea what you are talking about . " [ 187 ]
" You did n't build that " ===
For a more detailed treatment , see You did n't build that .
On July 13 , 2012 , at a campaign event in Virginia , Obama attacked capitalism in a speech that immediately stirred up controversy .
Speaking about the government 's role in the success of private business , he said : [ 188 ]
“ If you were successful , somebody along the line gave you some help .
There was a great teacher somewhere in your life .
Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive .
Somebody invested in roads and bridges .
If you ’ve got a business - you did n’t build that .
Somebody else made that happen . ”
The Romney campaign has used " If you ’ve got a business — you did n’t build that " in ads to show America that Obama believes it is government that creates business rather than hard - working individuals .
The Obama campaign has alternatively stated that the sentenced was poorly worded since he was not giving a scripted speech and that when Obama said " that " he was referring to roads and bridges .
Obama points to a later portion of his speech in which he said , " The point is , is that when we succeed , we succeed because of our individual initiative , but also because we do things together , " to support his claim .
Results
On November 6 , 2012 Barack Obama won reelection with 332 electoral votes to Mitt Romney 's 206. [ 189 ]
Obama received 51 % of the popular vote ( 65,899,660 votes ) to Romney 's 47 % ( 60,932,152 votes ) .

2009 –2017 : Presidency
Main article : Obama administration
The liberal claptrap that elected Obama seems silly today .
It was claimed , for example , that Obama had millions of followers on Twitter , when allegedly some 70 % of them were fake .
[ 191 ]
And although the lamestream media promoted Obama as a great orator , in fact , he relied almost entirely on teleprompters for his speeches and press conferences , and at one point even had teleprompters set up for him in a middle school classroom in order to speak to the media .

Five years into Obama 's presidency the number of people holding jobs still was 3 million below the all - time high of 138 million [ 192 ] workers – despite an increase of 10 million people in population over the same period of time .
[ 193 ]
Despite the " Hope and Change " rhetoric , from 2007 to 2017 , the rate of Americans ages 10 to 24 who died by suicide rose by 56 percent , from 6.8 deaths per 100,000 persons to 10.6 . [ 194 ] Under Obama and Senate Democrats [ 195 ] budget management , the United States suffered its largest deficits [ 196 ] in history and its credit - worthiness downgraded from Standard and Poor's .
Obama assured Americans that unemployment would not rise above 8 % if his economic stimulus program was adopted , however , it rose and stagnated in the 8 - 10 % range [ 197 ] [ 198 ] for the entirety of his first term .
Patrick H. Caddell and Douglas E. Schoen , writing in the Wall Street Journal , noted , " Rather than being a unifier , Mr. Obama has divided America on the basis of race , class and partisanship . "
The commentators also note Obama 's approach to governance has encouraged radical leftists to pursue a similar strategy on his behalf .
Mary Frances Berry , former head of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission , acknowledged that the Obama administration has taken to polarizing America around the issue of race as a means of diverting attention from other issues , saying , " Having one 's opponent rebut charges of racism is far better than discussing joblessness . " [ 199 ] Caddell and Schoen , who worked for President Carter and Clinton , respectively , further stated , " Mr. Obama has also cynically divided the country on class lines .
He has taken to playing the populist card time and time again .
He bashes Wall Street and insurance companies whenever convenient to advance his programs , yet he has been eager to accept campaign contributions and negotiate with these very same banks and corporations behind closed doors in order to advance his political agenda ...
President Obama 's divisive approach to governance has weakened us as a people and paralyzed our political culture . " [ 200 ]
Obama appointed numerous communists and red diaper babies to important administration positions .
[ 201 ]
He abused his presidential power several times during his presidency . [ 202 ]
Domestic policy
Obama 's economic stimulus package in response to the Crash of 2008 took seven years to return unemployment to historically acceptable levels .
Economic growth remained below 2.0 % throughout his two terms as poverty and income inequality increased .
Obama sought to end the " schoolhouse - to - jailhouse pipeline " by bribing public school districts through grants for not having law enforcement authorities arrest students for arrestable offenses – this policy led to a major school shooting in Florida over a year after he left office . [ 203 ]
Under Barack Obama 's lack of leadership , an Inspector General appointed by Obama discovered , for the first time in history , that the top two personnel appointed by Obama to head the FBI had both violated the law .
[ 204 ]
Additionally , the Obama Administration prosecuted more whistleblowers as spies than other administrations . [ 205 ]

Main article : Obamacare
Not wanting the Financial crisis of 2008 " to go to waste , " America embarked on a grand socialist experiment .
Thanks to " stupidity of the American voter " in the words of the bill 's author , Obama passed his signature legislation , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) on March 10 , 2010 .
Also known as Obamacare .
In keeping with his progressive ideals , the bill used coercive measures to force Americans to buy insurance they did n't want or need .
The employer mandate – the requirement that employers pay 50 % of a workers insurance – held down new job creation and wages .
Overall GDP growth barely exceeded 1 % throughout Obama 's years , while population continued to grow at a 2.5 % rate , thus steadily impoverishing the nation as a whole .
The act originated in the Democrat - controlled House , was amended and passed the Senate just prior to Sen .
Ted Kennedy 's death with no Republicans and 44 Democrats voting to oppose .
60 Democrats in total lost their seats afterward in the 2010 Midterms .
In what was construed as a de facto rejection of the bill , Massachusetts voters elected a Republican candidate , Scott Brown , who promised to vote against the bill if given the chance .
[ 208 ]
After Obama made a promise to issue an executive order that would ultimately prohibit the use of taxpayer subsidies to pay for abortion services , [ 209 ] the Democratic House of Representatives would pass the bill as it left the Senate 219 – 212 , with 34 Democrats and all other parties dissenting . [ 210 ]
The individual mandate required everyone to purchase health care insurance or suffer punitive measures , with the typical Marxist provisions for exemptions and transfer payments from taxpayers to protected classes of Democrat voters .
The individual mandate was upheld by the Supreme Court with Chief Justice John Roberts – himself the victim of Obama era FISA abuse – casting the tie - breaking vote .
The forced transfer of wealth from job creation to healthcare ( including illegal immigrants ) impoverished the country and left a generation of younger Obama supporters unemployed or underemployed .

Critics of the Obama administration have coined the word " Obamunism " to describe Barack Obama 's socialistic and " fascism light " economic planning policies .
[ 215 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ]
Obamunism can also refer to Obama 's ruinous fiscal policies and reckless monetary policies .
[ 218 ] [ 219 ] [ 220 ]
As seen in his own actions , Barack Obama instructed his advisors to find loopholes that would enable the president to act as a dictator by pushing through legislation and increases in spending without congressional authority . [ 221 ]
Nevertheless , budgets passed under President Obama have included the smallest average annualized growth of federal spending ( 1.4 % ) since before President Reagan .
Federal spending grew an average of 8.7 % per year during Reagan 's first term and an average of 8.1 % per year during George W. Bush 's second term . [ 222 ]
Wall Street firms and banks that were bailed out were among Obama 's biggest campaign supporters . [ 223 ]
Therefore , the Obama administration bailouts of corrupt , unproductive , and reckless Wall Street firms was hardly surprising , and many argue that it was not helpful in making the United States economy more productive and prosperous by encouraging more risk taking through letting banks off with a slap on the wrist .
Others argue that bailing out the banks kept credit flowing and prevented a much deeper recession and a total collapse of the financial system .
The government will recoup some though not all of its capital infusions over time .
A 2005 study found that government corporate bailouts are often done for mere political considerations and the economic resources allocated exhibit significantly worse economic performance than resources allocated using purely business considerations . [ 224 ]
Proponents of free market capitalism said Bernanke should not have bailed out failing firms and instead should have allowed free market capitalism to quickly recover as it did in the depression of 1920 without government intervention ( free market capitalists assert that government intervention drags out economic recessions and depressions ) . [ 225 ]
The Obama administration has been sharply criticized for its massive deficit spending and its reckless monetary policy via vast increases in the money supply , although inflation under Bernanke has been below the historic mean . [ 218 ] [ 219 ] [ 226 ]
Celente predicts that if a " second American Revolution " occurs in a peaceful and productive manner , it may include a third party movement of governance that will advocate a more free market capitalism approach to the American economy and a more strict interpretation of the United States Constitution as far as the authors ' original intent .
During what the White House billed as Recovery Summer , one half million workers per week continued losing their jobs .
His signature legislative achievement , ObamaCare , has been found to be unconstitutional [ 227 ] by several judges and constitutional by others , and is credited as a major cause of uncertainty , high unemployment , [ 228 ] lagging job creation , [ 229 ] and risk of a credit default crisis . [ 230 ] [ 231 ]
His 2012
Budget plan has been roundly criticized in the mainstream and liberal press as not a serious effort to deal with the nation 's economic crisis . [ 232 ]
Jeffrey Tucker wrote , " President Obama 's economic policy has been catastrophic for liberty , enterprise , and the American dream — the very archetype of what not to do to end recession . " [ 233 ]
According to conservative investigative journalist Peter Schweizer , Obama weaponized the regulatory process to help his friends buy businesses that had been devalued through Obama Administration policies . [ 234 ]
Stimulus
Black Unemployment under Barack Obama and the veto - proof Democrat congress .
See also : Recovery Summer
In early 2009 , Obama lobbied Congress and the public to pass a sweeping Stimulus package [ 235 ] known as The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( H.R. 1 ) . [ 236 ]
The report of the Congressional Budget Office mandated by law stated that the legislation would ultimately harm the economy . [ 237 ]
Contrary to his promise of bipartisanship , [ 238 ] the bill passed the House 244–188 on January 28 , 2009 , with 11 Democrats voting with the entire Republican caucus against , [ 239 ] and received just 3 Republican votes when passing the Senate 61 –37 . [ 240 ]
One third of the massive $ 838 billion bill consisted of backdoor tax expenditures [ 241 ] and the rest direct new spending on " just about every pent - up Democratic proposal of the last 40 years . " [ 242 ]
In responding to criticism of the broken bipartisanship promise at the time , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously quipped , " We won the election .
We wrote the bill . " [ 243 ]
On February 18 , 2009 , the Stimulus was signed into law by Obama . [ 244 ]
In August 2009 , Republicans and Democratic Senator David Obey drew attention to mistakes on the Recovery.gov site claiming millions of Stimulus jobs created that did n't exist .
Obama responded by saying the errors just indicate his accounting is an " inexact science " . [ 245 ]
Sequestration
According to Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Bob Woodward of the Washington Post , Obama misled the American people in a Presidential debate only two weeks before the 2012 election when he said , " The sequester is not something that I ’ve proposed , ” [ 246 ] when in fact his chief budget negotiator and current Chief of Staff , Jack Lew , made a call to Democrat Harry Reid at 2:30 pm on July 27 , 2011 with the proposal after clearing it with Obama , [ 247 ] as fully documented in Woodward 's book , The Price of Politics .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned of immediate jobloss of about 750,000 jobs – about the same level as under George W. Bush [ 248 ] – if Obama 's budget and economic plans were allowed to take effect . [ 249 ]
Woodward , who 's reporting on Watergate is credited with toppling the administration of Richard Nixon , told Wolf Blitzer of CNN he was told by a senior White House official he'd regret talking about the President Obama 's positions on the sequester . [ 250 ]
Spreading poverty and raising the debt
Following the 2011 debt ceiling standoff between Obama and House Republicans , [ 251 ] the United States Government 's credit rating was , for the first time in its history , downgraded from AAA to AA+ , and poverty [ 252 ] increased markedly .
By and large , his programs , said to combat the recession , unemployment , slow growth , and deficits , have failed [ 253 ] leaving the country saddled with an $ 18 trillion national debt and climbing . [ 254 ]
One of his most well - known tactics was blaming someone else , such as George W. Bush , for all his failures instead of taking responsibility .
Also on the domestic front , Obama passed an expensive health care bill in 2010 with no national consensus or bipartisan support and 34 Democrats dissenting .
Recently , the Congressional Budget Office wrote an open letter to John Boehner , the Speaker of the House , outlining the effects of repealing Obamacare and explaining why a net loss of over 100 billion dollars would occur from the repeal . [ 255 ]
During Obama 's presidency , the national debt nearly doubled , going from $ 10.6 trillion to $ 19.9 trillion . [ 256 ]
Illegal immigration
[ 257 ] [ 258 ] A U.N. report cited Obama for holding 100,000 children in cages .
The Obama Administration was weak on illegal immigration .
It established the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ( DACA ) [ 259 ] [ 260 ] [ 261 ] in 2012 , which gave protection and work permits ( jobs which could have gone to American citizens ) to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children .
In his 2013 memoir , liberal Democrat U.S. Representative Luis Gutiérrez , an ally of Obama on immigration issues , stated that Obama did not believe that DACA was legally possible until he enacted it . [ 262 ]
The Obama Administration was able to give green cards to about 40,000 of those DACA illegals . [ 263 ] [ 264 ]
Additionally , it was reported the administration let 2.2 million deportable illegal immigrants , including 400,000 with criminal convictions , remain on the streets , [ 265 ] while releasing 68,000 with criminal records in 2013 alone . [ 266 ]
He nearly doubled the number of illegal immigrant juveniles with the EB - 4 visa , which gave them legal status . [ 267 ]
The Administration " administratively closed " up to 200,000 deportation cases , meaning those illegal immigrants were free to go where they wanted in the U.S. [ 268 ]
The administration also obstructed deportation cases [ 269 ] and blocked 550,000 illegals from deportation .
[ 270 ]
The Obama Administration issued 140,000 U visas , which are given to illegal immigrants who testify against criminals in court and allow them to eventually gain citizenship , massively expanding the program . [ 271 ]
The Obama Administration 's failure to close an immigration loophole caused over 250,000 illegal minors to be separated from their parents , [ 272 ] [ 273 ] [ 274 ] and those minors faced significantly worse conditions in their holding facilities than under the Trump Administration , which also took tougher action . [ 275 ]
In 2014 , President Obama announced the DAPA program , which would have expanded protections from deportation to a total of about 5 million illegal immigrants .
This order was blocked by a federal judge , [ 276 ] upheld by an appeals court , [ 277 ] and a split 4 – 4 Supreme Court ruling upheld the appeals court ruling .
[ 278 ]
Under President Obama , Immigration and Customs Enforcement released 564 convicted sex offender illegal immigrants , in many cases because various countries refused to accept them back .
[ 279 ]
In May 2017 , a whistleblower revealed that the Obama Administration knowingly let illegal immigrant MS - 13 gang members into the country .
[ 280 ] [ 281 ]
In January 2018 , the DHS inspector general reported that the Obama Administration did not identify and arrest terrorist aliens classified as " highest risk " due to them not being screened .
[ 282 ] [ 283 ]
The Obama Administration moved illegal migrant teens across state lines so they could have abortions . [ 284 ]
Its policies led to an increase in illegal immigration . [ 285 ]
After assuming office in 2017 , the Trump Administration made a large change in its policies towards illegal immigration compared to the Obama Administration . [ 286 ]
Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly of the Trump Administration strongly criticized the Obama Administration for its failures regarding illegal immigration and national security .
[ 287 ] [ 288 ]
Rising migration levels
Because of the Obama Administration 's open borders policies , total migration into the U.S. in 2016 and 2017 reached record high levels , at 1.75 million people per year . [ 289 ] [ 290 ]
Soft - on - crime
The Obama Administration failed to act upon warnings by federal drug investigators and state officials about the growing problem of illegal fentanyl as the drug killed 70,000 people between 2013 and 2017 .
[ 291 ]
In fact , the administration softened its enforcement against " low - level nonviolent drug offenses . " [ 291 ] [ 292 ]
War on police
See also : Riots during the Obama Administration
Cop killings increased dramatically in Obama 's final years .
[ 293 ]
But the groundwork was laid in the early months of Obama 's presidency when he made a televised statement that the police " acted stupidly " .
Obama gave encouragement to Black Lives Matter and the Antifa terrorist organization .
Attacks on Christian religious freedom
No Higher Power : Obama ’s War on Religious Freedom documents Obama 's attack on religious freedom . [ 294 ]
Phyllis Schlafly 's bookdocuments Obama 's attack on religious freedom .
When first running for office Obama angered religious conservatives with his comment about working - class voters in old industrial towns .
Obama said , " They get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . " [ 295 ]
The Obama administration has been widely criticized for his policies which encroach on religious freedom in areas such as : health care , freedom to dissent on matters relating to the homosexual agenda , religious freedom in the military and religious freedom in other spheres of American life . [ 296 ]
In addition , the Obama administration has been criticized for promoting religious freedom for Muslims and restricting religious freedom for Christians . [ 297 ]
Environment and energy
See also : Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster
President Obama authorized offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico [ 298 ] stating , " oil rigs today generally do n’t cause spills " [ 299 ] and was widely criticized for his mishandling of the " worst environmental disaster in US history . " [ 300 ] [ 301 ]
The Administration spend vast sums of taxpayer money on futile environmentalist efforts , including $ 4.1 million on a study that attempted to find a connection between pollution and obesity . [ 302 ]
The Obama Administration enacted many environmental regulations and used scientific studies to back up the supposed need for the regulations , but after the Trump Administration began undoing the Obama - era rules , many of the merits of the studies were found to be dubious . [ 303 ]
Labor law
Obama 's first act of office was to sign the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act – effectively nullifying the Supreme Court case Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , which ruled that Ledbetter had to have filed a pay discrimination suit within 180 days of the first time Ledbetter was paid less than her male peers ; [ 304 ] the law made corporations subject to suit within 180 days of each time the employee was unfairly paid .
[ 305 ]
9/11 responders
On January 2 , 2011 , Obama signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Healthcare and Compensation Act. [ 306 ]
The act , which afforded 9/11 first responders who were sickened by the dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center health care and compensation , passed Congress after its sponsors agreed to scale down the pricing from 7.4 to 4.2 billion dollars . [ 307 ]
Diversity over safety
During the Obama Administration , the Federal Aviation Administration issued new hiring rules for air traffic controllers which placed achieving diversity over ensuring that new employees were talented , educated , and even knew what they were doing .
[ 308 ]
Meeting with an atheist group
See also : Atheism and American politics
The Obama administration became the first administration to met with an atheist group .
It met with the Secularism Coalition for America which is a coalition which represents the American Atheists , the American Humanist Association , and the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers .
According to the USA Today , the group met with the White House officials to " discuss problems that they believe are fueled by religion . " [ 309 ]
Among the issues the group discussed were the issues of " military proselytizing " by evangelical Christian members of the military and faith - based initiatives [ 309 ]
Gender politics
Candidate Obama promised to repeal a policy that originated with President Clinton and passed by a Democrat - controlled Congress that prohibited inquiries into military personnel 's sexual orientation while barring openly gay homosexuals from serving in the military .
Liberals expressed anger when time passed and no effort to repeal the law was seen ; [ 310 ] in fact , Obama 's justice department , as part of their duty to defend all laws passed by any administration , filed a brief arguing against the Supreme Court granting a writ of certiorari to a gay soldier challenging the law ( the writ was not granted ) .
In response , the soldier , James Pietrangelo II , a former Army infantryman and lawyer , said , " ( Obama 's ) a coward , a bigot and a pathological liar .
This is a guy who spent more time picking out his dog , Bo , and playing with him on the White House lawn than he has working for equality for gay people . " [ 311 ]
On December 15 , 2010 , a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives to repeal the law – it passed a day later by a vote of 250 – 175 ; [ 312 ] it passed the Senate three days later 65 – 31. [ 313 ]
Obama signed the Don't Ask , Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 on December 22 . [ 314 ]
The Pentagon itself could not immediately implement the repeal and questioned whether it would hurt combat readiness . [ 314 ]
On the day Rev. Jim Jones left for Jonestown , Harvey Milk wrote to Jones and said " my name is cut into stone in support of you - and your people . " [ 315 ]
President Obama honored Milk posthumously with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on the anniversary on his death . [ 316 ]
Civil service corruption and the revolving door
Obama criticized the " revolving door " of government and business . [ 317 ]
After appointing Peter Orszag his first Budget Director to dole out the stimulus cash , Orszag resigned to become Citigroup 's Vice Chairman of Global Banking .
Citigroup was the recipient of $ 476 billion in bailout money - more than any other bank - after the disastrous Financial crisis of 2008 . [ 318 ]
Before the bailout , Orszag 's expert opinion of the chances of a mortgage meltdown was 1 in 500,000 . [ 319 ]
Foreign policy
Ben Rhodes is the Assistant to the President for Strategic Communications and Speechwriting , and Deputy National Security Advisor to Susan Rice .
Rhodes is also the brother of David Rhodes , President of CBS News .
Obama launched a global anti-Christian jihad with his support for al - Qaeda and the Islamic State to overthrow the governments of Libya and Syria .
The Black African slave trade was revived in Libya after Obama removed Muammar Gaddafi , an ally in the War on Terror . [ 320 ] [ 321 ]
Obama , who was raised a Muslim [ 322 ] [ 323 ] and is not a descendant of slaves , criticized Christians and the Crusades as reports of thousands of women and girls being captured , sold , and raped flooded in . [ 324 ] [ 325 ]
Additionally , Obama overemphasized political correctness in U.S. national security policy , something disliked by CIA officials . [ 326 ]
The number of jihadis worldwide has grown by a factor of 4 or 5 at least , since Obama took the reins of power as Commander - in - Chief . [ 327 ]
Remarkably , the New York Times was critical of Obama 's incessant boasting about the killing of bin Laden . [ 328 ]
With the complete disengagement of American troops from Iraq and the assassination of Osama bin Laden , the Islamic State arose and recruitment of global jihadis multiplied exponentially .
Obama entered his second term mocking and ridiculing the idea that Russia was America 's prime geo-strategic competitor ; by the closing days of his presidency , Obama was in a panic fanning the flames of a Third Red Scare .
Vladimir Putin and Russia had thoroughly embarrassed Barack Obama on the world stage as Obama withdrew America from its traditional role of global leadership and repudiated the idea of American exceptionalism .
Respect for America degenerated in the world as issues such as transexual bathrooms occupied more of Obama 's time and attention than the 12 million homeless refugees Obama had driven from their homes in his failed " Arab Spring " policy .
Having been thoroughly rebuked politically with the election of Donald Trump , as a lameduck Obama attempted to coverup DNC scandals uncovered by Wikileaks by scapegoating Vladimir Putin and fostering an atmosphere of paranoia about Russia , the future , and a Trump presidency .
Commander - in-chief
As Senator , Obama was highly critical of President Bush and promised change .
As President , Obama tripled down in Afghanistan , widened the war into Pakistan , multiplied by drone attacks , bombed Yemen and Somalia , and started an undeclared NATO war in Libya .
On presidential war powers , surveillance questions , Guantanamo , detention policy and habeas corpus , Obama similarly stayed the course or expanded Bush 's precedents .
In a speech on May 19 , 2011 , Obama fully embraced the Bush Doctrine of preventative war . [ 329 ]
From the Boston Globe :
' The New America Foundation , which tracks the strikes , has listed 23 raids since the beginning of April 2011 , all but one in Pakistan ’s tribal regions of North and South Waziristan .
A June 20 attack was reported in Kurram , an area north of North Waziristan along the Afghanistan border . '
' The drone program has become increasingly controversial as the Obama administration has expanded its use beyond the Afghanistan and Iraq wars .
Lethal missiles have been launched from unmanned aircraft in at least five countries in addition to Pakistan : Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , Yemen , and , most recently , Somalia .
The military ’s Joint Special Operations Command used a drone last June to attack what officials said were two senior members of the Al Shabab militant group on the Somali coast . ' [ 330 ]
A commentator says :
' Obama is commendable when he says he wants to avoid war .
His policies , however , favor war by destabilizing the Middle East making it extremely hostile and favoring radical Islam over America ’s ally , Israel , and American interests in the region ...
The president has chosen a very dangerous path for every American and one that promises great difficulty for Israel . ' [ 331 ]
By Obama 's third year as Commander - in - Chief , over 1200 American troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan - significantly more than the number who died during President George W. Bush 's term of office .
And growing numbers of civilian contractors also have fallen .
In the first half of 2010 , 250 contractors reportedly died in Iraq and Afghanistan - more than the 235 military personnel who fell during the same period . [ 332 ]
National Defense
President Obama signed into U.S. law the National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) , only after his administration successfully lobbied to remove language from the bill that would have protected American citizens from being detained indefinitely without trial . [ 333 ]
After the legislation cleared Congress , the ACLU commented that if President Obama signed the bill it " will damage both his legacy and American ’s reputation for upholding the rule of law , " while executive director of the Human Rights Watch blasted the President for being ‘ on the wrong side of history , ’ noting that " Obama will go down in history as the president who enshrined indefinite detention without trial in US law . " [ 334 ] [ 335 ]
Section 1031 of the NDAA bill , which itself defines the entirety of the United States as a “ battlefield , ” allows American citizens to be snatched from the streets , carted off to a foreign detention camp and held indefinitely without trial .
As reported by Infowars.com , the bill states that “ any person who has committed a belligerent act ” faces indefinite detention , but no trial or evidence has to be presented , the White House merely needs to make the accusation . [ 336 ] [ 337 ] [ 338 ]
The Obama Administration accidentally allowed the chipmaker AMD to ship sensitive and important technology to China , despite the significant national security risks . [ 339 ]
Escalates Afghan conflict
Main article : Afghanistan War
American deaths in Afghanistan more than doubled in Obama 's first few years compared with the preceding eight years of George Bush [ 340 ] as he increased troop strength for no discernible purpose and to " win " unstated objectives .
Against his own Defense Secretary 's advice , Obama attacked Libya and forced regime change without Congressional authorization in violation of the post - Nixon era reform measure , the War Powers Act .
After he took personal credit for killing Osama bin Laden , the U.S. State Department warned of increased risk to the lives and safety of Americans . [ 341 ]
Bin Laden 's successor , Ayman al - Zawahiri confirmed the Benghazi Attack which took place on the anniversary of 9/11 and killed more Americans , was motivated by al - Qaeda 's desire for revenge . [ 342 ]
Bin Laden 's death , as Obama 's advisers warned , freed up jihadis who swore an oath of allegiance to the 9/11 mastermind to swear allegiance to rival and competing factions .
The competing factions advocated the immediate establishment of the Islamic State , rather than after the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy and retaking of Mecca .
As was well known , bin Laden always held a controversial and minority position among jihadis on the strategy for global jihad by attacking the United States first .
Bin Laden 's killing , intended as an election year gimmick , brought Obama no improvement in approval ratings and spawned unprecedented growth in global terror and jihadi recruiting .
Obama needlessly escalated troop strength [ 343 ] and defense costs in Afghanistan from $ 43.5 billion in George Bush 's last year to $ 113.7 billion for 2011 . [ 344 ]
Adviser to General Stanley McChrystal David Kilcullen wrote , " One of the big strategic shifts is the use of language now which talks about Pakistan and Afghanistan as the same theater .
Now we talked about Af - Pak long before the Obama administration came about , but the public use of that term , and the description of it as the Afghanistan - Pakistan campaign , sends a new message to people about how the administration is going to think about Afghanistan and Pakistan . " [ 343 ]
Libya and rebirth of the slave trade
Main article : Libyan uprising 2011
In February 2011 , the political unrest that spread through the Arab world showed up as protests in Libya .
Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , leader of Libya for 41 years , responded to the violence [ 345 ] with legitimate steps . [ 346 ]
The United Nations Security Council voted to impose sanctions , and later passed a resolution to protect civilians .
Obama , without approval from Congress and over the objections of his own National Security staff , [ 347 ] directed American forces to take out Libya 's air defense system . [ 346 ]
Secretary of Defence Robert Gates , National Security Adviser Tom Donilon , Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough , and White House counterterrorism chief John O. Brennan all opposed the action .
Obama later said , " if we waited one more day Benghazi , a city nearly the size of Charlotte , could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world . " [ 348 ]
Alan J. Kuperman , in an editorial for the Boston Globe , suggested this statement was false , writing , " intervention did not prevent genocide , because no such bloodbath was in the offing .
To the contrary , by emboldening rebellion , US interference has prolonged Libya ’s civil war and the resultant suffering of innocents . " [ 349 ]
Kuperman , a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas who authored a book called The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention , further stated that the rebels had tricked the world into thinking a bloodbath was at hand and that Obama had lied to the American people in order to act on this theory . [ 349 ]
Gaddafi [ never ] threaten[ed ] civilian massacre in Benghazi , as Obama alleged .
The “ no mercy ’ ’ warning , of March 17 , targeted rebels only , as reported by The New York Times , which noted that Libya ’s leader promised amnesty for those “ who throw their weapons away . ’’
Gaddafi even offered the rebels an escape route and open border to Egypt , to avoid a fight “ to the bitter end . ’’ [ 350 ]
Gaddafi wrote to Obama and told him he bore no ill will .
" We have been hurt more morally than physically because of what had happened against us in both deeds and words by you , " he wrote .
" Despite all this you will always remain our son whatever happened .
We still pray that you continue to be president of the USA .
We endeavour and hope that you will gain victory in the new election campaign . " [ 351 ]
Syria and Obama 's " red line "
In 2012 , during the Syrian Civil War , President Obama stated that if the Syrian dictator , President Bashar al - Assad used chemical weapons against Syrians , that would be unacceptable and cross a red line .
However , after it was confirmed that Assad did use weapons against his people , Obama did practically nothing .
He went to Congress to authorize a military strike , but this request was rejected ( he had the ability to order a military strike without Congress 's approval ) .
Later , the Obama Administration ( particularly Susan Rice ) [ 352 ] and the mainstream media [ 353 ] claimed they had worked with Syria to remove its chemical weapons .
In April 2017 , Syria again used chemical weapons against its people , proving their claim wrong . [ 352 ]
The new president , Donald Trump , unlike Obama , quickly ordered a large airstrike against a Syrian airbase . [ 354 ]
Turkey
President Obama attempted to overthrow the legitimate government of Turkey , a vital NATO ally .
Turkish President Recep Erdoğan repeatedly warned Obama 's support of Kurdish forces and ISIL threatened the NATO alliance .
Turkey slowly began establishing closer ties with Russia .
Hillary Clinton and the FBI 's collusion with Russia

One bribery scandal
Obama and his administration had a weak stance on Russia . [ 355 ]
He and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to " reset " relations with Russia , and he mocked Mitt Romney for calling Russia the most dangerous geopolitical threat to the U.S. in a 2012 debate .
According to Brett Bruen , the White House director of global engagement from 2013 to 2015 , the Obama Administration ignored his warnings about Russia . [ 356 ]
Obama criticized president of Russia , Vladimir Putin for carrying out a referendum for the seizure of Crimea to Russia . [ 357 ]
After taking office in 2017 , Donald Trump took several actions against Russia that Obama never went so far as to do . [ 358 ]
Cuba
During his presidency , Obama instituted a major détente with the oppressive Communist dictatorship of Cuba , despite its failed leftist governance and human rights violations .
[ 359 ] [ 360 ]
In August 2015 , the U.S. and Cuba reopened each other 's embassies . [ 361 ] [ 362 ]
In September 2016 , Obama nominated the first U.S. Ambassador to Cuba in 55 years . [ 363 ]
Obama did everything in his power to normalize relations with the failed dictatorship , but the U.S. embargo against Cuba remained in place due to opposition from the Republican - controlled Congress . [ 364 ]
No one knows the extent of underground bunkers of Soviet - era weapons consisting of AK - 47s and MANPADS stockpiled between 1959 – 1986 when the collective stated foreign policy aims of Cuba and the Soviet Union were armed revolution and violent overthrow of the United States government and the capitalist system .
The United States remains unprepared for trade talks and lifting travel restrictions on tourists .
Despite Obama 's support for mass immigration and amnesty for those who immigrated illegally , he ended the " wet foot , dry foot " policy that allowed Cuban refugees to legally stay in the U.S. [ 365 ]
Liberal mainstream media regarded Obama 's private meetings with the murderous thugs who run Cuba as a breakthrough in relations .
Guantanamo Bay
Main article : Guantanamo Bay
One of Obama 's campaign promises was that he would close the American detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba - detainees would be flown to other countries while the ones awaiting trial would enter the American court system .
Two days after taking office he signed an order directing the military to do so . [ 366 ]
But , in November 2009 Obama admitted that his self - imposed deadline of January 2010 would be missed , and in March 2011 the president went back on his campaign promise , signing an executive order to create a formal system of indefinite detention for the prisoners . [ 366 ]
Obama ultimately failed to close Guantanamo Bay , although he continually attempted to reduce the number of detained terrorists held at the base , even in the last days of his presidency . [ 367 ] [ 368 ]
Anti-Israel policies
Obama has had very poor relations with the conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , and he disregarded U.S. commitments to the country . [ 369 ]
During the very tight and closely - watched 2015 elections , the Obama Administration attempted to influence the election — in order to elect a pro-Hamas leftist government in the nation and defeat Netanyahu — by financing a liberal pro-Palestinian political organization .
[ 370 ]
Netanyahu decisively won the election , despite opposition from left - wing world leaders such as Obama . [ 371 ]
On December 23 , 2016 , Obama broke over 35 years of American policy by abstaining from a UN vote and allowing a blatantly anti-Israel resolution to pass , showing his true anti-Israel stance . [ 372 ] [ 373 ]
On December 28 , 2016 , just a few weeks before the Trump Administration was to take office and a few days after the anti-Israel resolution was adopted , Kerry gave a major 72 - minute [ 374 ] speech viciously attacking Israel and paying worthless lip - service to American " support " for the nation .
[ 375 ]
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded harshly but appropriately to the Administration 's blatant betrayal . [ 376 ]
Despite these actions , the U.S. House passed a motion on January 5 , 2017 , condemning Obama 's allowing of the UN resolution . [ 377 ] [ 378 ]
Additionally , Republican President - elect Donald Trump voiced strong support for Israel during this time . [ 379 ] [ 380 ]
Soon before leaving office , Obama bypassed Congress and gave the State of Palestine $ 221 million . [ 381 ]
Pro-Iranian policies
In contrast to his anti-Israel policies , Obama took a friendly stance toward Iran , helping negotiate the Iran nuclear deal with the country , something Obama 's successor , President Trump , chose to reverse .
The Obama Administration actively worked to give Iran access to American banks , and Iran got $ 150,000,000,000 from Obama , and they gave it to terrorists . [ 382 ]
According to a high - ranking Iranian official in 2018 , the Obama Administration granted U.S. citizenship to 2,500 Iranians during the nuclear deal negotiations , including the friends and family of Iranian government leaders . [ 383 ]
An Iranian militia leader who led an attack on the U.S. embassy in Iraq in 2019 had been invited to the White House by the Obama Administration in 2011 . [ 384 ]
Opposition to U.S. sovereignty
See also : War on Sovereignty
Preferring international cooperation and equality to American sovereignty and independence ( despite the U.S. 's obviously superior geopolitical position ) , Obama intentionally reduced American power and strength during his presidency .
One of his actions as president was to give up the nation 's control of internet domain name system and transfer control over to an international organization in 2016 . [ 385 ] [ 386 ]
Obama also entered the U.S. into the Paris climate agreement and attempted to have it join the Trans - Pacific Partnership , which was under negotiation .
Both of these agreements would have reduced American sovereignty and self - governance .
Obama also endorsed the United Nations 2030 Agenda in 2015 , which called for " a ' new universal agenda ' for all of humanity " and served as a major step toward a one - world government . [ 387 ]
Congressional relations
Obama has maintained tense relations with Congress throughout his term as president .
Each of his budgets was voted down , and many of his judicial appointments have not come to a vote .
When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died on February 13 , 2016 , Obama made a point of addressing the nation to say that he would nominate a replacement , which drew criticism and rebuke from Republican Senators and Presidential candidates .
Obama executive action in areas such as immigration policy drew extensive criticism as infringing upon Congressional legislative powers .
Scandals
Obama turned the Justice Department into a cesspool of corruption . [ 388 ]
Obama was complicit in the whitewash of Hillary Clinton 's email investigation .
In fact , Obama himself crafted the language of " careless , " reducing the charge of gross negligence punishable by 10 years in prison down to nothing .
Obama himself had much to hide ; he knew of Hillary 's illegal email server .
Obama communicated with Hillary on her illegal server at least 30 times , including from the territory of a " hostile foreign power , " presumably Russia , where their communication was most certainly hacked .
When the disgraced Obama appointee as FBI director whitewashed the incident by saying Hillary communicated with " a senior government official , " it was Obama himself and his complicity in the reckless handling of classified information that Comey was covering up , not just Hillary .
Over the course of his presidency , Obama cost taxpayers $ 35 million to cover his Christmas vacations .
[ 389 ]
FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe 's special counsel Lisa Page 's sworn congressional testimony confirms that the FBI was acting on orders from the Obama Justice Department to clear Hillary Clinton of felonious behavior and violations of the Espionage Act so that she could be nominated as the DNC 2016 presidential candidate .

2006 62 2007 2,837 2008 6,844 2009 11,753 2010 19,546 2011 24,068 2012 18,061 ( by October 31 , 2012 ) 2013 23,640 killed in 2013 ( through to March 2014 )
Before Obama 's Fast and Furious operation was exposed , the number of dead victims in drug cartel violence has been estimated as high as 160,000 deaths .
The Washington Post reported that White House officials stopped a requirement for gun dealers to report bulk sales of high - powered semiautomatic rifles commonly used by illegal drug cartels .
Justice Department officials had asked for White House approval to require thousands of gun dealers along the border to report the purchases to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms and Explosives .
ATF investigators expected to get leads on suspected arms traffickers .
Senior law enforcement sources said the proposal from the ATF was held up by then White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel . [ 393 ]
Gun dealers had been required for decades to report the sales of multiple handguns to the ATF .

Aid to Benghazi rebels
A March 29 , 2011 article in the Washington Post included these paragraphs :
“ " It ’s almost a certitude that at least part ” of the Libyan opposition includes members of al - Qaeda , said Bruce Riedel , a former senior CIA analyst and adviser to President Obama .
Riedel said that anti-Gaddafi elements in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi have had “ very close associations with al - Qaeda ” dating back years .... I would hope that we now have a good sense of the opposition in Libya and can say that this is 2 percent , not 20 percent , ” Riedel said .
“ If we do n’t , then we are running the risk of helping to bring to power a regime that could be very dangerous . [ 394 ] ”
Gadaffi was an ally of the US against the jihadis until Obama armed the jihadis to overthrow Gadaffi .
One of their first acts was the mass beheading of Christians .
This set off a fierce debate in the Obama administration over the wisdom of arming terrorists .
[ 395 ]
It is now known sometime prior to March 31 , 2011 , [ 396 ] at the urging of Hillary Clinton [ 397 ] and over the objections of his National Security Council , Obama signed a Presidential Finding authorizing support for the rebel jihadis . [ 398 ]
By October 2011 , Libyan rebel fighting groups with support from NATO overtook the capital and toppled the government .
Gaddafi was captured and brutally and sadistically murdered .
[ 399 ]
The jihadis were immediately recognized by the U.S. and the U.N. as the new legitimate government .
Mustafa Abdul - Jalil , chairman of the National Transitional Council , announced Sharia will be the source for all legislation and all laws conflicting with Sharia are null and void .
[ 400 ]
Abdel Rahim al - Kib , the country 's interim prime minister , echoed Jalil 's words days later . [ 401 ]
The al Qaeda flag was flown above the Benghazi courthouse , and reports surfaced that the Libyan jihadis had imposed Sharia law in some parts of the country even earlier .
[ 400 ]
By February 17 , 2013 , four foreign nationals were arrested for distributing Christian literature , a charge that could carry the death penalty . [ 402 ]
In 2014 , the Obama Administration gave a $ 200,000 grant to a Sudanese group with ties to Al Qaeda . [ 403 ] [ 404 ]
Benghazi massacre
[ 405 ] Amb .
Stevens was specifically in Benghazi to oversee and facilitate transfer of captured weapons from the Gadaffi regime to groups in Syria which ultimately became the Islamic State .
Few people had knowledge of this program beyond Stevens , Clinton , and Obama .
Once the mission was completed , Stevens was expendable .
For a more detailed treatment , see Benghazi Attack .
With several U.S. embassies besieged on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney declared there was no reason to believe the attack on the sovereign territory of the United States consulate in Benghazi , less than two months before the 2012 Presidential election which killed Americans , was a terrorist attack .
“ The unrest that we ’ve seen around the region has been in reaction to a video that Muslims , many Muslims , find offensive . ”
This became the official White House line .
Between laughs with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central , Obama said the death of Americans was " not optimal " .
[ 406 ]
When pressed by reporters , who pointed out evidence that the violence in Benghazi was a terrorist attack , Press Secretary Carney argued “ the unrest around the region has been in response to this video . ”
Leading suspected jihadis in the murders and terrorist attack were the local Benghazi branch of Ansar al - Shariah , known to have ties to al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb . [ 407 ]
A commander of the terrorist group boasted jovially about the attack over drinks with reporters for the New York Times in Benghazi . [ 408 ] [ 409 ]
Funding the Islamic State
Two more Americans were killed , along with 35 others , after being taken hostage by rebel jihadists in Mali shortly after the Libyan upheaval . [ 410 ]
Hillary Clinton testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the wake of the Benghazi murders under her stewardship , that weapons and fighters equipped by the Obama administration made their way to Mali and Algeria :
“ There is no doubt that the Algerian terrorists had weapons from Libya .
There is no doubt that the Malian remnants of AQIM [ Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ] have weapons from Libya . [ 411 ] ”
1MDB scandal
After the 2012 election , Obama 's chief fundraiser continued raising money for Democratic candidates .
Frank White , Jr. and Pras Michel formed a joint venture with 1 Malaysian Development Berhad ( 1MDB ) , wholly owned by the Malaysian government .
The venture supposedly was to invest in green technology and solar panels , but corrupt officials of 1MDB were more interested in buying influence with the Obama administration and the Democratic party , [ 412 ] and White and Pras likewise were not interested in providing a renewable source of electricity or solving the problems of poverty for Malaysia 's 30 million people .
Malaysians have a median household income of $ 4500 , so the theft of $ 4.5 Billion by globalists pushing green technology and Democrats looking for foreign money to finance their campaigns cause they can't sell their ideas at home , had a devastating impact on the Malaysian people , economy , and political culture .
White and Pras got two anonymous investors to lend a half of a Trillion dollars for a little over a two - year period .
They formed a joint partnership agreement with 1MDB to build a green technology solar plant .
White and Pras owned 49 % , 1MDB controlled 51 % .
White was supposed to have provided financial advice .
His advice turned out to be for 1MBD to buy out his 49 % for $ 69 million six months after the agreement was signed , without White 's entities investing any of the half Trillion he borrowed .
[ 413 ]
Portions of the $ 69 million were then donated to Democrat Senate , Congressional , and Gubernatorial candidates .
The $ 69 million Democrats stole from the people of Malaysia during the Obama presidency is only a fraction of the corrupt deals 1MDB did all over the planet .
Much of the $ 4.5 Billion embezzled was laundered through U.S. banks , and has become the largest investigation ever under the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Act . [ 414 ]
Biden - Ukraine scandal
Vice President Joe Biden oversaw the disbursement of $ 1 billion allocated by the U.S. to the new government of Ukraine .
In 2014 , Biden 's son Hunter Biden , was appointed to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings , the largest oil and gas company in Ukraine .
Hunter Biden was hired by Mykola Zlochevsky , who served as Ukraine 's ecology minister in the previous administration .
Hunter Biden was paid $ 166,000 per month .
The money was split with the nephew of Whitey Bulger .
Zlochevsky came under investigation by the new administration for alleged embezzlement of $ 5 billion while ecology minister .

Animal remains at a site near Stonehenge suggest neolithic people from as far away as Wales brought their own livestock to barbecue at cultural events
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
Stone age people drove animals hundreds of miles to a site close to Stonehenge to be slaughtered for ritual feasts , according to scientists who have examined the chemical signatures of animal remains buried there .
The research suggests that Neolithic people travelled further than archaeologists had previously realised in order to attend cultural events .
Durrington
Walls is a stone - age village containing the remains of numerous cattle and pigs which are thought to have been buried there after successive ritual feasts .
The site is two miles north east of Stonehenge and dates from around 3000 BC , 500 years before the first stones were erected .
" We are looking at communication networks and rituals that are bringing people from a large area of southern England to the Stonehenge area before the Stonehenge stones were in place , " said Dr Jane Evans at the British Geological Survey in Nottingham .
" I think what we are seeing is basically a sort of bring - your - own - beef barbecue at Durrington Walls . "
The evidence points to groups of people driving animals from as far away as Wales for the feast events .
Evans ' team analysed the strontium content in the enamel of teeth from the cattle remains .
The ratio of different atomic forms or ' isotopes ' of the element gives an indication of where the animals were raised .
" What you eat has a strontium isotope composition dependent on where it was grown .
Broadly speaking the older the rocks the higher the strontium values , " she said .
Only one animal was raised on the chalk - lands around Stonehenge , the rest came from much farther away .
Although archaeologists believe the stones that make up Stonehenge came from Wales , the new evidence suggests that people were travelling long distances to visit the site much earlier .
There was no farming in and around Durrington Walls at the time , so travellers brought their own animals for eating at feasts .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Larry Horsley loves that he does n't buy much gas , even though he drives his ' 95 Chevy S - 10 back and forth to work each day .
Larry Horsley 's pickup has a set of neatly arranged electronics where his engine once was .
Horsley , a self - described do - it - yourselfer , simply plugs his truck into an electric wall outlet in his Douglasville , Georgia , garage and charges it overnight , instead of buying gasoline refined from mostly imported oil .
" If I can keep a dollar from going overseas , I 'll spend two dollars , " he said .
The whole conversion , including the truck , cost him about $ 12,000 , which parts dealers say is about standard .
Another Atlanta - area tinkerer , David Kennington , converted his Honda Civic del Sol from gasoline to electric for a different reason : " I'm a raging greenie , " he said .
Both Horsley and Kennington are fed up .
They 're among a growing number of Americans who are refusing to wait for big - car manufacturers to deliver mainstream electric vehicles , called EVs .
Not only have they rebelled against the status quo by ripping out their gas - guzzling engines and replacing them with zero-emission electric motors , they say just about anyone can do it .
Another electric DYI - er in Wolfeboro , New Hampshire , Bob Batson , has formed a company called Electric Vehicles of America that sells vehicle parts for other anti-gasoline rebels looking to convert .
Batson said business has more than tripled in the past year .
" Sales trends are definitely up as the price of gasoline goes up , " he said .
60 mph on 20 batteries
Outside his metal roofing business , Horsley opened up the hood of his converted Chevy truck to show how he did it .
How do the engines work ?
We explain »
The entire process is " basically straightforward , " he said , after four months driving it on electric .
" Anyone who has basic mechanical skills can build one of these , " Horsley said .
" But it takes time , " he said , about three months .
Most of that period was spent waiting for the parts to be shipped .
He 's got the motor of his maroon S - 10 pickup set up to run on 20 six - volt batteries , the same kind used in golf carts .
The motor connects to an existing manual transmission to propel the truck up to 60 mph .
Horsley removed the vehicle 's radiator to make room under the hood for a few of the batteries .
The rest are concealed in the back , under the pickup 's bed .
Other components such as a fuel injector were replaced with their electric counterparts and some , like the exhaust system , were removed completely .
Horsley started the conversion amid cool temperatures in January , so he did n't install air conditioning .
But in August , sweltering in Georgia 's brutal 90 - degree heat and humidity , Horsley calls that decision a mistake -- one he wo n't make next time .
He said his wife wo n't let him convert her car , but he 's looking for another used truck to convert .
The truck can travel about 40 miles without damaging the lead - acid batteries before the vehicle needs recharging , Horsley said .
But he said 40 miles is enough to get to and from work and run errands around town .
While limited range is the main disadvantage of electric vehicles , most people do n't need to drive very far on a regular basis , said Batson .
" What people do n't always realize is that the average person only drives 20 miles per day , " he said .
Cost versus savings
For his part , Kennington describes his sports - car red Honda as a " science experiment . "
He first converted the two - seater into an electric vehicle four years ago and has been tinkering with it ever since .
He 's swapped out components and tried multiple battery configurations .
With his current nine - battery setup Kennington gets about 20 miles per charge , so he only drives it on short trips a couple times a week from his Austell , Georgia , home .
" I did it for the learning experience , " he said .
Kennington said he 's waiting for better battery technologies , like nickel - metal - hydride and lithium - ion , to become more affordable .
Those batteries can provide more power with less weight for increased range , but currently cost $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 per set , compared with about $ 2,000 for lead acid batteries , he said .
" I hope at some point that I will be able to drive it on a more regular basis and that it will be more useful , " he said .
" Do I expect it to someday to be my only car ?
No . "
He said most people who own electric cars also have a gasoline or hybrid vehicle for longer trips .
Kennington is president of the EV Club of the South , a group of electric vehicle owners and enthusiasts .
He said interest in EVs is directly tied to gas prices .
" When gas goes up , more people call me and more people come to the meetings , " he said .
Horsley estimated that he has saved $ 700 since switching to electric four months ago .
He 's quick to point out that that 's just the savings on gas .
He also does n't have to pay for oil or filter changes , since there is no engine oil or fuel filters to change .
" I was originally skeptical , " he said .
" But now I 'm convinced . "

Do You Have a Good App Idea But No Programming Skills ?
Here ’s
What to Do
Do you have a lot of good ideas for making an app that may find success ?
Are you looking to bring your good app idea to life someday ?
Well , you do n’t need to learn how to read , write , or speak programming languages to make that dream a reality .
Between the millions of apps on the Apple Store and Google Play , you can find an app for almost anything today .
This is important , especially for 81 % of U.S. adults that have smartphones .
However , you can always expect newer , better apps to come out .
If you ’ve got an awesome app idea , this is your moment to go through with making it .
This guide will give you some ideas on how to create an app without having to learn how to develop apps .
Keep reading to learn more about actualizing your good mobile app ideas .
1. Understand the Problem First
Before you go on with your app idea , you need to know if it answers or solves a problem .
Does your app address a problem that a niche or a general market is facing ?
Is your app idea likely to turn into a trend that may fade from people ’s minds after a short period ?
The answers to these questions can help you understand what hurdles are in store for you later .
What are some good app ideas that are likely to be useful and relevant in the long - term ?
If it ’s going to be an app that has only seasonal use , how will you profit from it ?
This problem - solving stage may take a while .
You have to look at all possible angles and how your app may face problems from each one .
You are n’t only aiming to solve a problem with your app , but also to solve your app ’s probable problems .
2. Conceptualize and Sketch Out Your Good App Idea
Now , let ’s take a break from theorizing possible problems .
Let ’s take a concrete step to progress .
The next step is to conceptualize the app idea and make a prototype .
If you do n’t know where to start , grab a piece of paper and pen .
Take notes and start describing what functions and features you want your app to have .
Do n’t focus on finding good app name ideas yet , but note how you want your app to work instead .
You can also start sketching out how you want the app to look like .
You can use prototyping tools like Adobe XD , Sketch , or Origami Studio .
It does n’t need to look grand , but it needs to look like a solid and proper prototype of your idea .
3. As Always , Research Is Key
Every good app idea needs to have even better research behind it .
You want to focus more on the statistics that will affect the success of your app .
That includes researching the market and checking out your competition .
Find out what makes the most successful competitor stand out .
What trends are the biggest today and what trends may come next ?
How do users in various demographics behave ?
Next , try to focus on your app .
Look at the successful apps in the market and ask yourself how yours will compare .
This step is also where you further develop your app ’s unique features or services .
For example , you want to create an app that ’ll help people sleep faster and better .
31 % of Americans are sleeping less because of anxiety caused by the pandemic .
Figure out how your app will stand out from all the other sleep - help apps out there .
4. Outsource an App Developer
We now move forward to the stage where you create the app .
The first option is to hire a developer to create the app for you .
However , it ’s not going to be as easy as hiring a plumber to fix your sink .
You do n’t want to present your app idea to anybody and everybody .
Some people may steal the idea and profit from it instead .
Also , some may charge high fees for subpar skills while others may be out of your league .
To fix this problem , take time to get familiar with the world of developers .
You ’d also want to hold video calls with the developers rather than speak through chat or messages only .
It ’d help you communicate your wishes and ideas better as well as develop trust .
5. Use an App - Building Program
If you do n’t have time to find and hire a programmer to build the app , use an app builder instead .
Also , this is a great solution if you ca n’t afford to hire developers .
Building the app yourself will also help you see and appreciate the app - building process to some degree .
You can find several app - building programs online .
Easy - to - use programs are often those with drag - and - drop features .
Some examples include AppyPie , GoodBarber , and MobileRoadie .
However , if you want more control over your app builder , use programs like Crowdbotics .
You can customize the app with or without writing codes .
It also works well if you want to scale your app .
A disadvantage of using app builders is that there is a learning curve .
Also , you may hit walls that the app builders can’t help you with .
Unless you know how to code , you may not break through those walls .
6. Learn How to Make an App
Finally , the best and surest way of making your good app ideas come to life is to learn how to make them .
This option will give you full control over the app and how it ’ll turn out .
The drawback is that you ’ll have to invest time , money , and effort into learning how to code first .
It ’s a good option if you are n’t in a rush to make the app and if you have the budget .
It ’ll also help develop a new skill for you .
Plus , it ’s a more cost - effective and wiser choice for the long run .
Find an online course that best suits your schedule and budget .
Learning to build an app is not as hard as you think .
Also , you never know if you might have to create a new app later after the success of the first one .
Grow Your Good App From an Idea
Now you know how to develop and realize a good app idea !
We hope that you got some inspiration to make your app ideas a reality .
Take your time to go through these steps and find the best way to get it done .

In the interview , McCain is asked about Hugo Chavez , the situation in Bolivia and then about Raul Castro .
He responds to each of these with expected answers about standing up to America 's enemies , etc .
Then the interviewer switches gears and asks about Zapatero , the Spanish Prime Minister .
And McCain replies -- very loose translation -- that he 'll establish close relations with our friends and stand up to those who want to do us harm .
The interviewer has a double take and seems to think McCain might be confused .
So she asks it again .
But McCain sticks to the same evasive answer .
Did John McCain just diss the Prime Minister of Spain ?
Josh Marshall has the original interview here where Sen.
McCain is interviewed by a reporter on a Spanish - language station here in Miami in English , and then gets translated into Spanish .
Here 's a summation
The folks at TPM have been following this story and have come to the conclusion that Mr. McCain does not know who the prime minister of Spain is or that Spain is in Europe , not Latin America .
The interview was conducted entirely in English ( with Spanish translations inserted later ) , so there 's no excuse that the question got lost in translation , and it's not like Spain is an insignificant little country , so he 's probably heard of it before now .
And it does n't sound like a " gotcha " kind of question , either ; after all , the program was conducted by a Spanish - language station here in Miami , which is the one of the few places in the country where Republicans have a strong affiliation in the Latino community .
If Mr. McCain does n't know who the prime minister of Spain is or where Spain itself is , then .
Or , as I 'm sure someone else noted , the reign in Spain falls mainly on McCain . :
Here is the original interview as conducted in English Cross - posted . )
Announcing FS 0.1.0 , a Python file - system
This is something I have been hacking together for a while now ; FS is a file - system abstraction for Python .
It has reached a stable state and is worthy of an official ( 0.1.0 ) release .
First , a brief history of the project .
A while back , I was working mainly with desktop applications in wxPython .
I found that I had a number of sources for files ; there were read - only resources such as images , per-user files and per-installation config files .
The location of these files would change depending on whether I was debugging or building a release version .
The logic required to manage all this was pretty ugly and error - prone .
So I wrote a collection of classes to bring all these disparate locations for files under a single virtual file - system .
For example , to open a config file I could just read ' user / settings.cfg ' , and to open an image resource I could just read from ' resources /logo.png ' and the virtual file - system would do the right thing and return a file - like object .
This turned out to be insanely useful , and I used it for a number of projects .
I also used it while working for ICC , and I had the opportunity to enhance it based on feedback from colleagues .
In the last few months I have re-written it from scratch , because I wanted to avoid any copyright issues , but mainly because I could make a better job of it the second time around .
Getting Started
You can install FS with the command ' easy_install fs ' , or manually by downloading the latest release from ( http://code.google.com/p/pyfilesystem/downloads/list) and running ' python setup.py install ' .
FS has been checked on Linux and Windows , but should run anywhere since ultimately it uses the standard library .
There is no documentation other than the docstrings at the moment , so this post will have to suffice till I write up the API .
The main module is called fs , and there are a number of sub-modules :
fs.osfs Contains the class OSFS , which is a simple layer around the operating systems own file - system .
Contains the class OSFS , which is a simple layer around the operating systems own file - system .
fs.memoryfs
Contains the class MemoryFS , which is a file - system that exists only in memory .
Contains the class MemoryFS , which is a file - system that exists only in memory .
fs.mountfs
Contains the class MountFS which can be used to mount other file - systems at various places in the directory structure .
Contains the class MountFS which can be used to mount other file - systems at various places in the directory structure .
fs.multifs
Contains the class MultiFS which creates a file - system from other file - systems which are tried in - order till a file operation succeeds .
Contains the class MultiFS which creates a file - system from other file - systems which are tried in - order till a file operation succeeds .
fs.zipfs
Contains the class ZipFS which creates a file - system from a zip file .
Contains the class ZipFS which creates a file - system from a zip file .
fs. tempfs
Contains the class TempFS which create a temporary file - sytem that can be automatically cleaned up .
Contains the class TempFS which create a temporary file - sytem that can be automatically cleaned up .
fs.utils Contains a number of functions for dealing with FS objects .
Contains a number of functions for dealing with FS objects .
fs. browsewin
Contains the ' browse ' function which opens a tree view of the file - system passed to it .
This is mainly a debugging aid .
Requires wxPython .
Examples
In lieu of documentation , I 'm just going to run through an interactive session that shows a few features .
>>> from fs import * >>> home = osfs .
OSFS ( '~/' ) >>> from fs.browsewin import browse >>> browse ( home )
This creates an object called ' home ' which represents your home directory ( use a different path if you are on a non-linux system ) .
You can use it to open files , list directory contents , copy files etc .
But it can never access files that are n't under your home directory , so it could be considered a sand box view on to the underlaying file - system of the OS .
The root of the home object is re-positioned , so the path " / readme.txt " would map to " ~/home/readme.txt " .
Most of the methods of an FS object are pretty self - explanatory , but there are a few that require explanation .
Try the following for example :
>>> projects = home .
opendir ( ' projects ' ) #
Assumes there is a directory called ~/ projects >>> projects < SubFS : / projects in < OSFS : /home / will >> >>> browse ( projects )
There is no concept of a working directory for FS objects .
Rather than something like ' chdir ' there is an opendir method that returns a new FS object representing everything under the sub - directory root .
So if you were to do projects.open ( " test.py " ) , it would return a file object for " ~/projects/test.py " .
Have you ever wondered how much space the .py files take up in your home directory ?
Give this a try :
>>> print sum ( home .
getsize ( path ) for path in home .
walkfiles ( wildcard = " *. py " ) )
Here 's how you could use ZipFS to archive your projects folder :
>>> projects_archive = zipfs .
ZipFS ( ' projects.zip ' , 'w ' ) >>> from fs.utils import copydir >>> copydir ( projects , projects_archive ) >>> projects_archive . close ()
If you are interested in learning more , have a look at the docstrings in base .py , or just ask me .
I promise to get proper documentation up soon .
FS is politeware , you can use it for any purpose you like , as long as you say thanks !

Unsecured loans can be used for almost any use .
What is the difference between unsecured loans or unsecured lines of credit and secured loans ?
Why are unsecured loans an advantage to the borrower ?
When a borrower pledges property as security to the lender for a loan , the loan is “ secured ” .
The security or personal property that is obligated can become the lenders if the loan is considered by law delinquent .
This is common with foreclosures .
The home being pledged as security and received as secondary payment when a contract is breeched .
Collateral loans , also known as HELOC or home equity lines of credit , are less risky to the lender .
Whith such collateral considered as secondary payment options , it is considered a “ good risk ” by the credit company .
Quick Unsecured loans or lines of credit are favored by borrowers because no collateral is necessary to obtain the loan .
Common with instant unsecured personal loans , the decision is based on the credit profile of the borrower alone !
There is not a secondary payment for the lender to fall back on .
And , unlike a traditional secured loan , unsecured loans or quick loans can close as soon as two bussiness days .
This is due to little documentation required by the lending institution .
Just another highlight of instant unsecured personal loans .
Because there is no collateral , there will be no delay in funding due to appraisals .
Little paperwork is another reason fast unsecured personal loans close generally within two business days .
Unsecured loans or lines of credit can be used for almost any use and are a great fit for individuals with a proven credit history .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
What may be the world 's busiest grocery store is a Carrefour " hypermarket " in the Gubei area of Shanghai 's Changning District .
Seven days a week , from 8:30 A.M. to 11 P.M. , customers jam the aisles of this 126,000 - square - foot market and fill their baskets with a dizzying array of produce , meats , and electronics from around the world .
Last year six million people - more than twice the population of Chicago - shopped here and dropped $ 155 million along the way .
There are no signs of a global slowdown in these aisles .
Carrefour 's sales in China were up 25 % in the first quarter of this year .
Sales in places like Brazil and Romania jumped more than 50 % .
Poland is hot .
So are Argentina , Turkey , and Colombia .
But the picture is n't the same in Carrefour 's home country : France grew an anemic 2.6 % last year .
" If you 're a consumer sitting in Paris and you 're reading newspapers or watching TV , it looks like the world is coming to an end , " says Carrefour executive David Shriver .
" But consumers in places like China and Brazil simply do n't see it that way . "
Welcome to the new , precariously bipolar world .
While gross domestic product growth is cooling a bit in emerging markets , the results are still tremendous compared with the U.S. and much of Western Europe .
The 54 developing markets surveyed by Global Insight will post a 6.7 % jump in real GDP this year , down from 7.5 % last year .
The 31 developed countries will grow an estimated 1.6 % .
The difference in growth rates represents the largest spread between developed and developing markets in the 37 - year history of the survey .
" The fact that the U.S. is no longer the locomotive of growth it was a few years ago , " says Nariman Behravesh , Global Insight 's chief economist , " does n't seem to be that important anymore . "
Put another way , the American consumer is still hungry , but the world consumer is voracious .
Consider the growing middle class in China , which is expected to multiply sevenfold by 2020 , to 700 million people , according to Euromonitor , and India , where the number of middle - income folks will grow more than tenfold , to 583 million , says consultancy McKinsey & Co .
First they want new homes with electricity - witness the quadrupling prices since 2000 of steel , oil , and copper .
Then , as incomes rise , so does demand for everything from toothpaste to telephones , from automobiles to airplanes .
At first blush this sounds like great news for Global 500 companies : Chinese and Indian consumers essentially offsetting belt - tightening by Americans and Western Europeans .
And indeed , overseas growth has been a bright spot - so far - for many of the world 's largest corporations .
Wal - Mart's ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) international sales grew 17.5 % this year - triple what it saw Stateside - and now constitute 24 % of the company 's total revenue , up from 8.9 % a decade ago .
Roughly half of GE's ( GE , Fortune 500 ) gas turbines produced in Greenville , S.C. , end up in Saudi Arabia , which is building four new cities ; rival Abu Dhabi is spending $ 200 billion on attractions , including a Guggenheim museum .
" There is still a lot of double - digit growth out there , " says John Rice , GE 's vice chairman .
" The clearly tougher financial markets in the U.S. do n't appear to be impacting global demand for everything . "
But double - digit growth is also creating double - digit inflation .
Americans whine about $ 4 gasoline and $ 5 Cheerios , but elsewhere in the world the reaction is much more serious .
Truckers in South Korea , France , and Spain have blocked highways to protest high fuel prices , and angry Egyptians barricaded roads after a cut in flour subsidies .
In India inflation rose to above 8 % in May from below 4 % last August .
Chinese inflation was 7.7 % in May , up from 1 % in early 2006 .
It 's worse in the smaller markets : Inflation now exceeds 30 % in Ukraine and Venezuela and 25 % in Vietnam .
This translates into some pretty jaw - dropping price increases : Rents are up 82 % in Dubai in 12 months , and rice prices in India have nearly tripled since January .
Such rapid inflation can stifle growing economies , and many analysts think the great global boom eventually will flame out - or at least dramatically slow .
And let 's not forget that many of the countries experiencing strong growth today depend on exports to the U.S. to keep their economies humming ; a slowdown in U.S. spending surely will have ripple effects in places like India , China , Vietnam , and Mexico .
The problem is how to fix it .
Most experts believe that to break the back of double - digit inflation , central bankers have to raise interest rates dramatically , which can result in higher fuel prices , rising unemployment , and eventually a recession .
" This kind of situation always ends in tears , " says Global Insight 's Behravesh .
" If you let inflation get out of control , it hurts .
If you try to clamp down , it hurts . "
For the rest of the planet , a slowdown in the emerging world would be a double - edged sword :
Once - hot markets for , say , L'Or�al lipstick or Tide detergent would cool , hurting corporate growth prospects .
A less ravenous China or India , though , would surely lead to a drop in the price of many commodities , including oil , offering much - needed relief to pocketbooks worldwide .
What is the CEO of a Global 500 company to do ?
Listen to the doom - and - gloom economists and act cautiously , or keep pushing into fast - growing but fragile economies ?
Smart executives are doing a bit of both , seeking new growth markets with the full understanding that their plans will be shaped and changed by global forces .
Some of those trends are huge and long - lasting , like the rise of the global middle class .
Others are not : Carrefour , for example , almost had a disaster on its hands when Chinese consumers threatened to boycott the chain over an event it could not foresee or control : A pro-Tibetan protester in Paris assaulted a wheelchair - bound Chinese Olympic torchbearer .
Robert McDonald , Procter & Gamble 's ( PG , Fortune 500 ) chief operating officer , has borrowed a military term to describe this new business world order : " It 's a VUCA world , " he says - volatile , uncertain , complex , and ambiguous .
" The idea that a butterfly flaps its wings in Africa and an earthquake occurs somewhere else in the world is our reality .
It 's no longer just a nice book that Thomas Friedman wrote , " he adds , referring to the New York Times columnist 's book on globalization .
" It 's my life . "
" He came from school asked me , " mother what can I eat , I am hungry " .
I had nothing for him .
I told him " son I have no food for you .
I can only boil some grass for you to eat . "
My son shook his head and said " I am no longer hungry . "
He went to his room .
Some minutes passed he did n't come out .
I went to the room to see what he was doing .
I will never forget what I saw .
I saw my sweet little boy hanged himself from the sealing .
He hanged himself because he could no longer remain hungry . "
( A Mother from Faryab province , 2008 ) This mother is one of many enjoying the fruits of " democracy " in Afghanistan .
There are thousands starving of hunger while others commit suicide .
The people that commit suicide fall in two categories .
The first category includes parents that commit suicide not to see the death of their own children , while the second category includes children who could not endure hunger and commit suicide .
Another example of this type of a tragedy : " We ( the children ) did n't eat for a number of days .
Our parents tried to get us whatever they could find but all of their efforts did not produce enough for us to eat .
In the morning , when we woke up very hungry , we looked for our parents .
We called their names but they did not respond .
We walked to the kitchen where both of our parents had taken poison and committed suicide .
They committed suicide because they did n't want to see us starve to death . "
( Children in Badakhshan , 2008 ) Afghanistan has become a disaster beyond imagination .
The invasion by the US has not only condemned the population to daily death and destruction , but it has created conditions that perpetuated death and misery on daily basis .
The US - NATO bombing in the south , southwestern , and eastern Afghanistan murder civilians in villages and towns while those that remain alive are forced to abandon their villages due to fear of death and loss of dignity .
The internally displaced come to large cities with the hope to find something to eat .
However , they come to large cities only to be homeless and face starvation .
To fully understand the magnitude of this disaster , it is instructive to compare salary of a government employee to the price of flour in cities .
A government employee in Afghanistan earns about $ 60 a month while a sack of flour supporting a family of five costs $ 70 ; hence , a government employee can not even afford dry bread .
Now , a family of five that has no earning could not possibly afford basic sustenance instead face starvation .
Consequently , families that have no earning have to starve to death or sell their children in order for the remaining of their children to survive .
Especially , widows of those families that are displaced internally due to the US - NATO bombing campaigns sit near major streets begging to raise some money for bread but only to return empty handed to their hungry children in makeshift tents littered major cities all over Afghanistan .
For example , I came across an older lady sitting by the side of the road in Kabul in May 2008 and I asked her what she was doing by the side of the road and whether she had any male member of the family to earn her living , she replied : " My husband and son were killed by the American bombs in Helmand province and I brought my daughter in law and grandchildren to Kabul since radio programs were talking about humanitarian programs but we found none and are stranded begging to survive .
My granddaughter age 7 starved to death last week .
I hate these people . "
I am going to Afghanistan in two weeks hoping to help few of these poor souls .
I am attempting to raise funds for flour , tents and blankets in order to help a few of these victims .
The government of the US has brought disaster , pain and death to them under the guise of democracy .
If any of you good people wish to help these poor souls , please donate at the following website : www.afghanistanafterdemocracy.com or you may send it to the following address : Dr Miraki 5347 North Ravenswood Avenue Chicago , IL 60640 USA
Some of you have helped in the past and I thank you for that , however , the needs of the people of Afghanistan are much more acute and we need substantial funds to purchase flour , tents and blankets .
I thank you in advance on behalf of the many victims in Afghanistan .
Sincerely , Mohammed Daud Miraki , MA , MA , PhD mdmiraki@ameritech.net www.afghanistanafterdemocracy.com
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has pardoned three men who had been found guilty of gang raping a woman in the northern province of Samangan .
The woman , Sara , and her family found out about the pardon only when they saw the rapists back in their village .
“ Everyone was shocked , ” said Sara ’s husband , Dilawar , who like many Afghans uses only one name .
“ These were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the Supreme Court , walking around freely . ”
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sara ’s case highlights concerns about the close relationship between the Afghan president and men accused of war crimes and human rights abuses .
The men were freed discreetly but the rape itself was public and brutal .
It took place in September 2005 , in the run up to Afghanistan ’s first democratic parliamentary elections .
The most powerful local commander , Mawlawi Islam , was running for office despite being accused of scores of murders committed while he had been a mujahedeen commander in the 1980s and a Taliban governor in the 1990s , and since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 .
Sara said one of his sub-commanders and body guards had been looking for young men to help in the election campaign .
“ It was evening , around the time for the last prayer , when armed men came and took my son , Islamuddin , by force .
I have eye - witness statements from nine people that he was there .
From that night until now , my son has never been seen . ”
Dilawar said his wife publicly harangued the commander twice about their missing son .
After the second time , he said , they came for her .
“ The commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200 metres away and , in front of these witnesses , raped her . ”
Dilawar has a sheaf of legal papers , including a doctors ’ report , which said she had a 17 mm wound in her private parts cut with a bayonet .
Sara was left to stumble home , bleeding and without her trousers .
When I met the couple in May 2006 , they were in hiding and struggling to pursue the four men through the courts , petitioning the parliament , the president , human rights organisations and the United Nations .
Sara and Dilawar say that one of the men involved in the attack used money and connections to repeatedly evade justice , particularly after his boss , Mawlawi Islam , became an MP and , they allege , was fully able to protect him .

In January 2007 , Mawlawi Islam was assassinated .
However , the other three men accused of the gang rape were put on trial , found guilty and sentenced to 11 years in prison .
Abdul Basir died in jail .
The other two rapists , Nur Mohammad and Kheir Mohammad , were released last May .
The commander was found not guilty .
A copy of the pardon was numbered , dated in May and appeared to bear the personal signature of Hamid Karzai .
It recommended the men ’s release because , it said , “ they had been forced to confess to their crimes . ”
When showed copies of the presidential pardon and court papers , President Karzai ’s spokesman , Hamayun Hamidzada , was visibly shocked and said that if the documents proved genuine , Mr Karzai would be “ upset and appalled . ”
He said it was impossible that President Karzai could knowingly have signed a pardon for rapists , but refused to speculate on how the pardon could have come about .
He promised an investigation into all aspects of the case , including the - as yet unsolved - mystery of Sara ’s missing son .
He denied that there was one law for the rich and well - connected in Afghanistan and another for people like Sara .
“ There are difficulties - we ’re rebuilding institutions , including our justice institutions and there are shortcomings , but the president and the government are committed to the rule of law on all equally . ”
A UN human rights official said that , although she could not remember a similar case of the president giving a pardon in such a serious case , corruption in the police and courts was endemic .
The MP , Mir Ahmad Joyenda , said cases similar to Sara ’s were actually becoming more common .
The police and the courts , he said , were usually under the sway of local commanders .
“ The commanders , the war criminals , still have armed groups , ” he said .
“ They ’re in the government .
Karzai , the Americans , the British sit down with them .
They have impunity .
They ’ve become very courageous and can do whatever crimes they like . ”
Sara and Dilawar are again in hiding , having felt too vulnerable to stay in their village .
Dilawar was prepared to discuss the case .
In Afghanistan , speaking about rape means risking further dishonour , but when asked whether he minded Sara ’s story being publicised , Dilawar said , “ We ’ve already lost our son , our honour , we ’ve sold our land to pay for legal costs and we ’ve lost our home – what else can we lose ? ”
Green diesel is produced either from hydrotreating or hydrocracking plant oils or animal fats ( Neste , Petrobras , and COP ) or via the BTL reaction ( Choren ) .
Green diesel is chemically different from biodiesel .
Green diesel has chemical properties identical to petroleum diesel , while biodiesel is not a pure hydrocarbon ( it contains oxygen atoms , hence the somewhat different physical properties ) .
I have written periodically on ' green diesel ' , which is not to be confused with biodiesel .
Neste , Petrobras , and ConocoPhillips ( in a venture with Tyson foods ) , have all entered the green diesel arena .
( See a bit on announced projects from these companies here ; explore previous green diesel stories I have written here ) .
On Friday the 13th , Neste issued a press release announcing that they will build a facility in the Netherlands :
Neste Oil to build a NExBTL renewable diesel plant in Rotterdam
Neste Oil is to build an 800,000 t/ a plant to produce NExBTL renewable diesel in Rotterdam in the Netherlands .
Construction will start immediately and the facility is scheduled to be completed in 2011 .
Total cost of the investment is projected to be €670 million .
Neste Oil announced its decision to go ahead with a similar - sized plant in Singapore in November 2007 .
Both plants are linked to Neste Oil ’s goal of becoming the world ’s leading producer of renewable diesel fuel .
NExBTL renewable diesel is based on Neste Oil ’s proprietary technology , which can use a wide range of raw materials .
In its plant in Finland , the company currently uses a mix of palm oil , rapeseed oil , and animal fat to produce renewable diesel .
Offering excellent product quality - even better than fossil diesel - NExBTL can be used in all diesel engines .
Neste Oil has a major R&D program under way to develop new renewable raw materials for fuel production , and is working towards a target of completely non -food raw material use by 2020 .
Neste Oil is cooperating with over 20 universities and research institutions globally as part of this program , which is divided into six areas , including non -food vegetable oil , wood - based materials , and algae .
Regarding the NExBTL diesel , Neste says :
NExBTL renewable diesel is an advanced fuel based on renewable raw materials that performs more efficiently and has a lower level of environmental impact than fossil diesel or FAME - type biodiesel .
Neste Oil requires its raw material suppliers to observe a responsible approach to sustainability .
Feedstock of this type ensures that NExBTL renewable diesel has a 40 - 60 % lower level of greenhouse gas emissions over its entire lifecycle compared to fossil diesel .
NExBTL renewable diesel can be blended with conventional diesel fuel or used as such , and is suitable for all diesel engines .
Neste Oil is the leader in renewable diesel production .
The company ’s first NExBTL facility was commissioned in Finland at Neste Oil ’s Porvoo refinery in summer 2007 .
Second facility is due to come on stream there in 2009 .
They both have a capacity of 170 000 t/ a .
In addition Neste Oil is building 800 000 t/a plants in Singapore and Rotterdam .
Singapore facility is due to be completed by the end of 2010 and Rotterdam facility in 2011 .
While this is an improvement , in my opinion , over biodiesel , they are still going to rely on oil crops such as palm oil .
Destruction of rain forests in Malaysia and Indonesia to plant palm oil plantations poses a serious environmental threat .
The future of green diesel needs to be based on non-food crops - especially those like jatropha that can be grown on marginal land - and waste materials such as biomass that is currently destined for landfills .
I was curious about the costs per barrel , so I worked that out .
A barrel of oil weighs 0.137 metric tons ( and has density similar to pure diesel ) .
Then 800,000 t/yr is equal to 5.8 million bbl / year ( 16,000 bbl / day ) .
For perspective , a mid-sized oil refinery will be around 250,000 bbl / day , but the Neste facility is certainly of a respectable size .
The cost is projected to be €670 million .
If I convert that to dollars , I can compare the cost to various other fuel technologies .
A Euro is currently worth $ 1.53 , so the project is going to cost US $ 1.025 billion .
That works out to $ 64,000 per daily barrel .
Again , for perspective the recently announced 400,000 bbl / day Jubail Refinery Project that Total is building with Saudi Aramco is currently estimated at $ 10 billion ( $ 25,000 / daily barrel ) .
Capital Costs of Fuel Facilities
Source : EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2006
To be honest , if Neste pulls the project off for that , it will come in at a competitive cost relative to other fuel technologies .
See the above EIA figure for estimated costs of various fuel facilities .
And that was from a couple of years ago , when stainless steel prices were significantly lower .
So , on the one hand I hope Neste pulls this off , but on the other they need to source a different feedstock than edible oils for the facility .

A series of portraits of American soldiers set to adorn roadside billboards in Minneapolis , site of next week 's Republican convention , was abruptly cancelled by the billboards ' owners , which feared they would be deemed disrespectful to the US military .
Although the artworks neither display images of violence nor are gruesome , the media company that owns the billboards said it feared pedestrians and motorists would mistake them for images of war dead .
The photographs show the faces and close - cropped heads of nine youthful soldiers lying peaceful and prone , flat against a surface .
" They do n't look dead , " said Suzanne Opton , the photographer of the series , entitled Soldiers ' Faces .
" It 's like you see someone opposite of you with their head on the pillow .
We see our lovers and our children in that pose .
They look like the heads of fallen statues , and they afford the viewer an intimate look at the face of the young person whose life is at risk , and that was the point .
" When you see soldiers on the news you have no idea who they are .
They 're representing the United States and they have all that gear on .
I wanted to get past all that " .
The shots of troops in between deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan by a New York City artist were to run in five US cities .
But CBS
Outdoor abruptly changed course and has refused to post the billboards in Minneapolis , Miami , Florida ; and Houston , Texas .
A separate company has agreed to display the images on billboards in Atlanta .
Curiously for the artists , the images remain up in Denver , site of this week 's Democratic national convention .
The Democratic party , under presidential nominee Barack Obama , is against the war in Iraq and advocates withdrawing US combat forces .
When thousands of Republicans and hoards of journalists arrive in the Minneapolis area this weekend , they will not see the images as they shuttle between the Xcel Energy Centre , site of the convention proceedings , and the hotels , restaurants and parties accommodating them .
" We understand that ' Soldier ' represents a political art project , and that the individuals depicted are actual soldiers , " Jodi Senese , CBS Outdoor 's executive vice - president of marketing , wrote in an e-mail to Susan Reynolds , a curator and collaborator with Opton .
" Out of context [ neither in a museum setting or website ] the images , as stand - alone highway or city billboards , appear to be deceased soldiers .
The presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces . "
Senese acknowledged in her email that the decision was based not on the artist 's intent but " how the image would be perceived by a motorist passing it in transit " .
Senese did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
Opton and Reynolds insist the work is neither a partisan statement nor does it advocate against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Any time you talk about a war , it 's political , " Opton said .
" It 's not an anti-war statement , it 's about soldiers . "
The photographs were taken in 2004 and 2005 at Fort Drum in New York state , with the permission of the soldiers and their commanders , the collaborators said .
The images have been shown in the Brooklyn Museum , the Cleveland ( Ohio ) Museum of Art , and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston .
The project is sponsored by the New York Foundation for the Arts .
Opton said the photographs ran on billboards in Syracuse , New York , near where the soldiers were based .
In early August the foundation signed a contract to pay CBS Outdoor $ 5,000 to run images on five billboards in Minneapolis for about a month beginning on Monday .
Last week the company cancelled that contracts there , in Houston and Miami , Reynolds said .
Reynolds said CBS Outdoor , which is owned by CBS Corporation , owner of the US television network , wants to avoid controversy .
" I 've been censored , " Reynolds said .
" It 's not a strong advocacy for any partisan point of view .
We do n't see soldiers in this very individualised human way in the press or media in this country .
A soldier is one thing :
They 're in camouflage , holding a rifle .
Here they 're individuals with personalities . "
America is beefing up its troops in Afghanistan
The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff has called for a new strategy in Afghanistan to deny militants bases across the border in Pakistan .
Speaking on the eve of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , Admiral Mike Mullen called for a military strategy that covered both sides of the border .
The US must work closely with Pakistan to " eliminate [ the enemy 's ] safe havens " , he told Congress .
But Pakistan insists it will not allow foreign forces onto its territory .
" There is no question of any agreement or understanding with the coalition forces whereby they are allowed to conduct operations on our side of the border , " Pakistan 's Chief of Army Staff , Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , said .
9/11 : THE NEW FRONTIER
Mapping the militant nexus New patterns of militancy Voices from unstable borders More coverage throughout the day on BBC World News and BBC World Service
BBC World Service coverage Pakistan 's top military commanders met in Rawalpindi on Friday , and high on the agenda was thought to be a ground assault by coalition forces in South Waziristan on 4 September , which Pakistan says killed more than a dozen civilians .
In an interview with the BBC , Pakistan 's Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi said such attacks were unproductive and alienated the local population .
' Inextricably linked ' Adm Mullen 's call for a new strategy came a day after US President George Bush announced that about 4,500 extra US troops would be sent to Afghanistan by February 2009 , bolstering the 33,000 currently stationed in the country .
Until we work more closely with the Pakistani government to eliminate the safe havens from which they operate , the enemy will only keep coming
Adm Mike Mullen
Deadly attack on Pakistan mosque Press considers 9/11 Adm Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee he was not convinced the US was winning in Afghanistan and that a new strategy was needed to address the issue of militants in Pakistan .
" In my view , these two nations are inextricably linked in a common insurgency that crosses the border between them , " he said .
" We can hunt down and kill extremists as they cross over the border from Pakistan ... but until we work more closely with the Pakistani government to eliminate the safe havens from which they operate , the enemy will only keep coming . "
Adm Mullen conceded the challenge was great , pointing to Afghanistan 's drugs and economic problems , and the " significant political uncertainty " in Pakistan .
James Glassman , a senior US diplomat , told the BBC 's HardTALK programme the US was " trying to help to fight these forces that threaten the very existence of a democratic country in Pakistan " .
" I think the world would be a much , much less safe place if we were simply to abandon Pakistan and stop helping the Pakistanis defend themselves , " he said .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has supported this stance , saying Pakistan needs international help to tackle the problem of Taleban enclaves in its tribal areas .
Mr Karzai told the BBC that Afghanistan had asked for help from the international community to combat terrorism , and said Pakistan should do the same .
' More assertive '
The New York Times newspaper reported on Wednesday that President George Bush had approved orders in July to allow US Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without Pakistani approval .
" The situation in the tribal areas is not tolerable , " an unnamed senior US official told the newspaper .
" We have to be more assertive .
Orders have been given . "
But a surge of US attacks in Pakistan 's border region over the past week has prompted outrage from Pakistan 's government and army .
Now stating it as a strategy will only add to the pressure on Pakistan 's new President , Asif Ali Zardari , as he grapples with the militants , the BBC's James Coomarasamy reports from Washington .
The White House said on Wednesday that the failure to capture al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden showed the limitations of US military and intelligence operations .
On the eve of the seventh anniversary of 9/11 , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said President Bush would have liked to see the al - Qaeda leader brought to justice , but that the US authorities did not have " super- powers " .
In another development , Canada confirmed its troops would leave Afghanistan by 2011 .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Wednesday that his nation - which suffered significant losses in Afghanistan in recent years - had no appetite for keeping its troops on in Afghanistan past a 2011 deadline imposed in March by parliament .

Recently the focus of the election has shifted to John McCain ’s “ dirty politics ” and his inability to tell the truth .
Many have begun criticizing him for this ( although still not nearly enough ) , but they ’re overlooking his big problem : if McCain starts telling the truth , he will lose .
There is no way to sugar - coat that .
John McCain cannot win this election without deceiving the American people into believing his false accusations against Barack Obama .
At the beginning of this race , both candidates promised clean campaigns that focused on the issues .
Obama has held his promise ; McCain has n’t .
Obama has said that McCain would rather lose his integrity than lose this election , and he is absolutely right .
John McCain has gone from a man of high integrity , or at least higher than the average politician , to being a sleazy liar who thinks America is dumb enough to believe him .
The only problem for us lies in the fact that he is right .
America is dumb enough to believe him .
The average voter does n’t care enough to do research on the facts .
They see McCain ’s dishonest campaign ads and assume that it ’s all true .
Usually , the mainstream media has to be the one to call a politician out on their lies , but for some reason , they have chosen to ignore McCain ’s smear campaign .
This is why I find it hilarious when people complain that the media is liberally biased .
They covered McCain ’s pick of Sarah Palin negatively because it was a stupid decision .
I suppose when the cable news networks were all frantically reporting news of Barack Obama being a secret Muslim , that was a rare moment of fairness and balance , right ?
I really do n’t like calling America stupid , mostly because I wish it was n’t the case .
But I look at the polls and see that 32 % of Americans still think Bush has done a good job , and 12 % of voters think Barack Obama is a Muslim … not to mention the number of voters who think being a Muslim is actually a bad thing .
( HINT : it ’s like Christianity , but you are n’t allowed to draw their Jesus )
Honestly , people , please show McCain that he is n’t going to win this way .
If he does , then that is the future we have to look forward to : more politicians winning based on lies that we refuse to call them out on … and it ’ll be exactly what we deserve .

WASHINGTON  Pakistani and American ground troops exchanged fire along the border with Afghanistan on Thursday , a top American military official said , ratcheting up tensions as the United States increases its attacks against militants in Pakistan ’s restive tribal areas .
The clash started after the Pakistanis fired shots or flares at two American helicopters that Pakistan says had crossed its border .
The two American OH - 58 Kiowa reconnaissance helicopters were not damaged and no casualties were reported .
But American and Pakistani officials agreed on little else about what happened .
American and NATO officials said that the two helicopters were flying about one mile inside Afghan airspace to protect an American and Afghan patrol on the ground when the aircraft were fired on by troops at a Pakistani military checkpoint near the Tanai district in Khost Province .
The officials said small - caliber arms were used .
It ’s been a while since I awarded the Veruca Salt Award .
Not because there has n’t been anyone deserving the Award — we ’ll never be that good — but because I ’m so jaded nothing has really taken my breath away like it used to .
Laziness is in there too , one of the top five reasons for sure .
Here ’s a re-cap of what the Veruca Salt Award is about :
The Veruca Salt Award is named in honor of the character from the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory .
Veruca is a spoiled rotten child , whose parents treat her like a princess , who thinks she can take whatever she wants whenever she wants it , and her wants and desires rise above all else .
She embodies the Deadly Sin of Greed , with touches of Envy and Wrath .
A thoroughly unpleasant character , naturally she ends up in the garbage chute .
Who is Henry M. Paulson Jr , and why has he been chosen for this prestigious award ?
I ’m glad you asked .
Mr Paulson is the current Secretary of the Treasury under George W. Bush , and
really , if you do n’t know who he is , you ’re seriously not paying attention .
Paulson comes from a nice family in Illinois , Eagle Scout , English major at Dartmouth , MBA from Harvard Business School ( slightly tarnished ) , Staff Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense under Nixon , assistant to John Erlichman ( uh oh ) , former CEO of Goldman Sachs , husband , father , grandfather , and bird - watcher .
Soooo , if you ’ve been living in a cave in the mountains of Idaho , and only had basic cable , you might not have heard about a certain crisis in our financial institutions , which are in need of a monstrous bailout — to the tune of $ 700 billion — yes , BILLION .
Mr Paulson put together a legislative proposal to allow the Treasury to purchase all those worthless mortgages , and bailout the financial institutions who have been on a drunken speculation joyride for years , and finally had two wheels hanging over the edge of Depression Cliff .
Here ’s the breath - taking , award - winning section :
Sec. 8 . Review .
Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
Wow .
I mean , just how big are Mr Paulson ’s balls anyway ?
Got a wheelbarrow … ?
Paulson sez : Give me $ 700 BILLION of your tax dollars , and I ’ll fix everything .
Trust me .
Really , would I lie to you ?
Mr Hubris Paulson , here ’s your prize .

When I think about the rules of grammar I sometimes recall the story — and it's a true one — about a lecture given in the 1950s by an eminent British philosopher of language .
He remarked that in some languages two negatives make a positive , but in no language do two positives make a negative .
A voice from the back of the room piped up , " Yeah , yeah . " 
Do n't we all sometimes feel like that voice from the back of the room ?
When some grammatical purist insists , for example , that the subject has to go before the verb , are n't we tempted to reply , " Sez you ! " ?
English is not so much a human invention as it is a force of nature , one that endures and flourishes despite our best attempts to ruin it .
And believe it or not , the real principles of English grammar — the ones that promote clarity and sense — were n't invented by despots but have emerged from the nature of the language itself .
And they actually make sense !
So when you think about the rules of grammar , try to think like that guy in the back of the room , and never be afraid to challenge what seems silly or useless .
Because what seems silly or useless probably is n't a real rule at all .
It 's probably a misconception that grammarians have tried for years to correct .
There are dozens of ersatz " rules "  of English grammar .
Let 's start with Public Enemy Number 1 .
Myth # 1 : Do n't Split an Infinitive .
" Split "  all you want , because this old superstition has never been legit .
Writers of English have been doing it since the 1300s .
Where did the notion come from ?
We can blame Henry Alford , a 19th - century Latinist and Dean of Canterbury , for trying to criminalize the split infinitive .
( Latin , by the way , is a recurring theme in the mythology of English grammar . )
In 1864 , Alford published a very popular grammar book , A Plea for the Queen 's English , in which he declared that to was part of the infinitive and that the parts were inseparable .
( False on both counts . )
He was probably influenced by the fact that the infinitive , the simplest form of a verb , is one word in Latin and thus can't be split .
So , for example , you should n't put an adverb , like boldly , in the middle of the infinitive phrase to go — as in to boldly go .
( Tell that to Gene Roddenberry ! )
Grammarians began challenging Alford almost immediately .
By the early 20th century , the most respected authorities on English ( the linguist Otto Jespersen , the lexicographer Henry Fowler , the grammarian George O. Curme , and others ) were vigorously debunking the split - infinitive myth , and explaining that " splitting "  is not only acceptable but often preferable .
Besides , you can't really split an infinitive , since to is just a prepositional marker and not part of the infinitive itself .
In fact , sometimes it 's not needed at all .
In sentences like " She helped him to write , "  or " Jack helped me to move , "  the to could easily be dropped .
But against all reason , this notorious myth of English grammar lives on — in the public imagination if nowhere else .
This was n't the first time that the forces of Latinism had tried to graft Latin models of sentence structure onto English , a Germanic language .
Read on .
Myth # 2 : Do n't End a Sentence With a Preposition .
An 18th - century Anglican bishop named Robert Lowth wrote the first popular grammar book to claim that a preposition did n't belong at the end of a sentence ( as in , What was this guy up to ? ) .
Others before him had made the same claim , notably the poet John Dryden .
This affectation , like the one about not " splitting "  infinitives , proved popular with Latin- educated schoolmasters , probably because Latin sentences do n't end in prepositions .
But the pedants were forgetting one small detail : English is n't a Latinate language , it 's Germanic .
And in Germanic languages , sentences routinely end in prepositions .
Great English literature from Chaucer to Milton to Shakespeare to the King James version of the Bible is stuffed with these " terminal prepositions . " 
Probably the word " preposition , "  from the Latin for " position before , "  suggested to pedagogues that a preposition must never come last .
Be that as it may , Curme and Jespersen recognized the final preposition as natural and instinctive , and Fowler went further : " The legitimacy of the prepositional ending in literary English must be uncompromisingly maintained , "  he wrote .
Amen !
Myth # 3 : And Do n't Start a Sentence with a Conjunction .
We 've all heard this one too , right ?
Does it make sense ?
No .
And here 's why .
Conjunctions like and and but and or have been used to start English sentences since as far back as the 10th century .
This feels natural because it is natural .
Over the years , some English teachers have enforced the notion that conjunctions should be used only to join elements within a sentence , not to join one sentence with another .
But there 's never been any evidence for this belief .
Modern grammarians have insisted for years that conjunctions are properly used to join words , phrases , clauses or sentences .
And do n't let anyone tell you otherwise .
Myth # 4 : None Is Always Singular .
This is nonesense .
Though none can be singular , it 's much more likely to be plural , as Fowler and many others have pointed out .
Why ?
Because we commonly use it to make a negative statement about all of the members of a class .
See which one sounds more reasonable to you : " None of the dogs bites "  ( singular ) , or " None of the dogs bite "  ( plural ) .
See what I mean ?
Anyone who prefers the first sentence was probably taught ( mistakenly ) that none is derived etymologically from " not one "  and always means " not one . " 
But authorities including the Oxford English Dictionary trace the origins of none to the Old English word nan ( or nane ) , a pronoun that meant " not any of a number of things "  and was commonly plural .
It also appears in some Old English texts to mean " no people , "  with the singular form expressed as " no one . " 
Consequently , in most cases none is plural and takes a plural verb , as in " None of the windows are broken . " 
None is singular only when it means " none of it " — that is , " no amount . " 
( " None of the glass is cracked . " )
If you really do mean " not one , "  it 's better to say " not one . " 
Myth # 5 : Whose Can Only Refer to People .
One last hobgoblin .
A great many educated people insist that we should n't use the word whose to refer to an inanimate object .
True believers would never say , " Do n't buy a car whose engine is shot . " 
They 'd insist on " Do n't buy a car the engine of which is shot . " 
Please .
This is not only a silly rule — it 's a damned awkward one .
This prohibition is a bigger lemon than the car .
If you do n't believe it , check Fowler .
The inanimate " whose , "  he said , has history , common sense and convenience on its side .
And the Oxford English Dictionary says that whose has been used for centuries as the genitive ( or possessive ) form of what as well as who .
The lesson here ?
The sillier rules of English grammar are n't genuine rules at all , just misconceptions .
When in doubt , go ahead and doubt !
A little research may show that while English is a peculiar language , it 's not as peculiar as all that .

US Financial Crisis ' The World As We Know It Is Going Down '
Panic is the word of the hour on Wall Street .
Now even Morgan Stanley is fighting for survival .
The commercial bank Wachovia and China 's Bank Citic are being discussed as possible rescuers .
The crisis has led President Bush to cancel a trip .
Most people had never heard of Sarah Palin when she was named Republican VP nominee .
But I ’d been hearing her name all too often , because I belong to a group called Defenders of Wildlife–and in her time as governor of Alaska , Palin has used her position as governor of Alaska to ruin the Alaskan wilderness in every way she could .
Her most recent “ victory ” came on August 26 when Alaska ’s voters defeated Measure 2 , an initiative that would have banned hunting wolves from airplanes for sport .
Palin organized a campaign against Measure 2 , and funded it with $ 400,000 of state money .
For most of us , the idea of zooming around in a private airplane over snowbound wilderness just for the chance to spot a terrified wild dog and blow it apart with a high - powered rifle is insane .
But there ’s a whole culture out there in love with the idea .
Palin did her part by playing the tired old Alaskan pioneer card , saying that lower - 48 naysayers who dared to object to the idea of divebombing wildlife did n’t “ understand rural Alaska . ”
Alaska is n’t really very hard to understand .
It consists of a minority that loves the wilderness and an overwhelmingly Republican majority that wants to squeeze all the cash it can get out of the state before the oil dries up , the fish die out , and the wildlife disappears .
Nowhere else does the Republican formula of manipulating the suckers by playing on their silly hatreds and even sillier vanities play out more clearly than in Alaska .
To get an idea of Palin ’s core constituency , just go to the homepage Safari Club International , one of the groups that fought hardest against Measure 2 — and is now gloating loudest over this proud victory .
http://www.scifirstforhunters.org/
From the 2008 Safari Club Convention :
At the “ Sensory Safari ” exhibit little Johnnie learns to laugh at dead animals , part of the required training on growing up to be as sleazy as his Alaskan parents .
Even the name is a little skewed — “ safari ” ?
When was the last time you heard that word ?
Most people are trying hard to forget the “ safari ” era , when rich white jerks had themselves carried into the African wilderness by nameless black servants , at vast expense , to kill animals they could barely identify .
But for Palin ’s core constituency , “ safari ” is still the dream .
And Measure 2 would have interfered with that dream , the dream of strafing social canids from a Cessna .
Alaska politics runs on the vast opportunities for graft offered by a small , easily manipulated constituency addicted to subsidies and self - delusion .
Alaskans like to imagine themselves the last pioneers , hardy individualists , etc. — which makes them classic suckers for Republican propaganda .
And they also like the petty cash that trickles down to them from the mining companies , timber companies , and hunting guides who make the real money .
Palin , an undistinguished parttime sportscaster on a local TV station , was a perfect non-threatening mouthpiece for the companies that want to gouge as much oil , ore and timber from Alaska as they can — while it lasts .
Palin is totally consistent in her anti-environmental stance .
She not only wants to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling , but actually vowed to sue the EPA if it dared to declare polar bears an endangered species .
It ’s hard for most people to understand this sort of hatred for the great mammal species struggling to hang on at the edges of this continent .
But then , Palin is an Alaska Republican .
And Alaska ’s Republican politicians are the most corrupt , ignorant and generally loathsome political clique in America , bar none .
The so - called “ dean ” of the gang is Senator Ted Stevens , finally indicted this year after a lifetime of graft .
One of the crimes of which Stevens is accused sums up the relationship between Alaska ’s Republican ruling gang and their big - money backers : a construction crew hired by an oil company called Veco jacked Stevens ’s house up on stilts and added a whole new floor featuring two bedrooms and a bathroom — just returning all the legislative favors Stevens had done for them over the years .
Sarah Palin was one of the founding members of Stevens ’s 527 corporate slush fund , which skated around campaign finance laws to allow the Senator to raise unlimited funds from big oil and other exploiters .
Stevens ’s bore the self - parodying name , “ Ted Stevens Excellence in Public Service , Inc ” — which is pretty droll , considering that Stevens is not only corrupt but one of the stupidest people in the Republican Party , no small feat in itself .
In fact , Stevens ’s only claim to the attention of the American people before he finally met his fate was for defining the internet as “ a series of tubes . ”
Thanks to YouTube , you can actually hear Senator Stevens dithering for several minutes before uttering that famous phrase .
A warning , though : listening to Stevens will cure you forever of the idea that America is a meritocracy .
Sen .
Ted Stevens may be down on his indicted luck now , but with his pupil Sarah Palin rising to the top , he knows his dream of a sleaze - dominated America will live on
On August 26 , 2008 , Alaska ’s Republican voters showed their ethical level by choosing Ted Stevens , this utterly loathsome , brainless greed monster , as their nominee to represent the State the state for another six years .
The fact that Stevens had been indicted for corruption four weeks before the election did n’t faze them a bit .
Sarah Palin summed up her long , sleazy and profitable association with Stevens by saying that the two of them were “ singing from the same sheet of music . ”
Is n’t that quaint , that “ sheet of music ” metaphor , with its hint of the hymnal and the pew ?
Well , that ’s Alaska ’s republicans for you : a thin coating of hokey populist rhetoric over a vast subterranean reserve of sleaze .
Palin ’s predecessor as Governor was Republican Frank Murkowski , another nature - hater who spent a long , sleazy career in the pockets of the oil , mining and “ safari ” industries .
Murkowski’s “ endless ethical lapses ” included the attempt to get the state to buy him a jet , and climaxed with his appointment of his daughter , Lisa Murkowski , to the U.S. Senate .
That sort of unashamed nepotism was a bit much even for Alaskans , who made Murkowski the most despised governor in the country , with an approval rating of 14 percent .
Lisa has been busy in Washington , keeping up the family tradition of selling Alaska ’s natural resources as quickly and sleazily as she can .
In 2006 she got an astounding 2 percent rating on environmental issues from Republicans for Environmental Protection .
In Alaska Republican Party circles , a rating like that is a badge of honor .
Palin fits right in with this slime .
She has served the oil , mining and hunting interests from the minute she won the governorship .
This summer , she showed herself willing to poison whole watersheds , and destroy a huge , lucrative salmon fishery , by opposing Measure 4 . 4 aimed to stop the proposed Pebble Mine , a huge operation , from discharging huge amounts of cyanide and mining waste into streams which flow into Bristol Bay , site of the world ’s largest sockeye salmon fishery .
Of course , Sarah Palin did her best to ensure the mining interests won .
At first she had a bit of a problem : under Alaska law , the governor is n’t allowed to take a position on ballot initiatives .
Palin squirmed her way around that rule in classic Republican style , by speaking as a private citizen , with true George W. Bush eloquence : “ Let me take my governor ’s hat off just for a minute and tell you personally , Prop 4 — I vote no on that . ”
As one of the supporters of the initiative said , Palin and the rest of the state ’s Department of Natural Resources ( DNR ) staff were so comfortably in bed with the mining industry that they borrowed a propaganda slideshow from their industry backers when making the case against Measure 4 .
“ The slideshow [ DNR ] had up on the screen … is straight from the one [ mining - industry representatives ] use in their presentations around the state , ” said Art Hackney of Alaskans for Clean Water .
“ I think it ’s absolutely outrageous — and somehow , unfortunately , it does n’t surprise me . ”
The reason Hackney is n’t surprised is that fronting for anti-environmental exploiters is what Palin does .
It ’s her job .
So naturally , she spewed up the necessary lie , proclaiming that she had “ all the confidence in the world ” in the integrity of the Department of Natural Resources that was using the mining industry ’s own slideshow .
Perhaps the saddest aspect of Palin ’s disgusting record on environmental issues is the fact that it ’s hardly even being mentioned in the debate about her nomination .
Most of the focus , for an audience of suckers weaned on celebrity gossip , seems to be about her mothering skills , her daughter ’s pregnancy , and whether she was Miss Congeniality or just a runner - up in some beauty pageant .
The fact that she makes her living helping to wipe out whole species , poison productive watersheds , and play to the stupidest great - white - hunter fantasies of her constituency hardly even seems worth a mention .

PETAH TIKVA , Israel ( Reuters ) – An Israeli city is using DNA analysis of dog droppings to reward and punish pet owners .
Under a six - month trial programme launched this week , the city of Petah Tikva , a suburb of Tel Aviv , is asking dog owners to take their animal to a municipal veterinarian , who then swabs its mouth and collects DNA .
The city will use the DNA database it is building to match feces to a registered dog and identify its owner .
But droppings found underfoot in the street and matched through the DNA database to a registered pet could earn its owner a municipal fine .
“ My goal is to get the residents involved , and tell them that together , we can make our environment clean , ” said Tika Bar - On , the city ’s chief veterinarian who came up with the idea for the DNA experiment .
Bar - On said the DNA database could also help veterinarians research genetic diseases in dogs , investigate canine pedigree and identify stray animals , replacing the need for electronic chip identification .
She said Petah Tikva would consider making it mandatory for pet owners to provide DNA samples from their dogs if the trial programme is successful .

The official criminals were attending the Olympics or were otherwise occupied when the American backed , Zionist supported Georgians , attacked their fellow countrymen and women ­ and killed a dozen Russian Peace Keepers ­ in their failed attempt to oust the Russian influence from their country once and for all .
But the Russian Bear smashed the would be invaders , and continued to pulverize the state that had sponsored this shoddy aggression .
Thousands of people have died in this colossally bungled attempt by the CIA , MI6 and Mossad to use the Olympic Games to cover what they thought would be a quick and successful romp through a Russian affiliated state , while everyone else was busy being exhaustively entertained .
This provided the American pretenders to the throne of American Empire with a golden and unscripted moment to show the world exactly what they are made of - and they - much like the invasion of Georgia itself , failed miserably !
Smash - mouth McCain blustered , then mumbled his demands for action like some comic - book ex-general ; while the inexperienced Obama sought refuge in advisors , and both failed completely to grasp what really happened , as well as who was to blame for what .
These creatures have been playing at the role of " president " now for nearly two years , and they have yet to distinguish themselves in any area .
They are truly repulsive candidates for anything , but since the job they 're bidding for is one that no longer is bound by any laws , it would be sheer folly to allow either of these rank amateurs anywhere near that office - ever !
Russia has taken the high ground throughout , even going so far as to provide food and assistance to the survivors , while the attacking ' governments ' are running around in circles demanding UN intervention .
What remains of their armed forces is being blown to bits by superior Russian forces .
All because Georgian leaders listened to the likes of Cheney - Bush , and Olmert , and Brown !
Part of this " preview " also had its more serious moments when there were conflicts between campaign " officials " with conflicts of interest that called the veracity of their advice , and their candidate 's judgment for appointing them in the first place ; into question .
But since this was not WWIII , but just another of the continuous outbreaks in the unending - WAR that the current players created for us all to enjoy as a featured side - bar in our journey into absolute poverty , beneath the shadow of outright slavery :
We all had the chance to test - drive the candidates , only to discover that neither of these " dogs " can hunt !
What if this had been real ( to us ) and not just another failure elsewhere by the Owners and their mercenary armies ?
This ' Sneak Preview ' told anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear that ' The American Pretenders to the Oval Office ' are blatantly unqualified for any office where responsibility must be shouldered , and life & death decisions made .
Being a ' Leader ' means being able to tell the difference between the truth and the rumors that surround everything that happens in this world !
But the really " great news " coming from this cascade of denials and lies has been the writing of Karl Schwarz , see the links below , and there are also many more available on www.rense.com!
However there is another major event coming to the global stage tomorrow , when Pakistan begins impeachment proceedings against Musharraf .
" ISLAMABAD ( AFP ) - Pakistan 's embattled President Pervez Musharraf was under mounting pressure to quit , with his allies joining ruling coalition calls for him to go before impeachment proceedings begin on Monday . "
" More than 100 militants have been killed in four days of heavy fighting in a tribal area near Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan , officials say .
Pakistan said nine of its soldiers were killed in the battles in Bajaur .
Fighter jets , helicopter gunships and artillery were all reportedly used to pound the militants ' positions in the strategically important area .
The Pakistani Taliban say that only seven of their men died .
Neither claim has been independently verified .
Security has deteriorated sharply in recent weeks along the frontier , which the Afghan government and NATO say is a haven for al - Qaeda and Taliban militants . "
( 1 ) So between the rebellions brewing within Pakistan now , and the pending resignation or impeachment of Musharraf the current American puppet :
It appears that the Afghan battlefield will soon be greatly increased with even more intensely angry people that will die rather than bow to our outrageous and illegal demands !
What remains to be seen , inbetween the gossip and the sports on MSM , just what exactly the two main pretenders for the Oval Office will suggest be done with regard to Pakistan .
As neither will be responsible for whatever they say , now would be a great time to find out if they are even capable of thinking - much less whether they can come up with anything resembling a real solution .
Pakistan is a nation that not only has nuclear weapons , but it is also a country that sells both the technology and the weapons to other nations , as well .
So between these two " previews " of the behavior we can expect from the two imposters running for Dictator ; the important question is who is going to protect you or the world from any of these two major expansions of the War upon Americans !
Have we forgotten how to DEMAND answers from those who supposedly work for us !

Senator Hillary Clinton is sounding the alarm and calling out President Bush and his administration for " quietly putting ideology before science and women 's health . "
The Bush
Administration is up to its old tricks again , quietly putting ideology before
science and women ’s health .
The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services is poised to put in place new barriers to accessing common forms of
contraception like birth control pills , emergency contraception and IUDs by
labeling them " abortion . "
These proposed regulations set to be
released next week will allow healthcare providers to refuse to provide
contraception to women who need it .
We ca n’t let them get away with this
underhanded move to undermine women ’s health and that ’s why I am sounding the
alarm .
These rules
pose a serious threat to providers and uninsured and low - income Americans
seeking care .
They could prevent providers of federally - funded family
planning services , like Medicaid and Title X , from guaranteeing their patients
access to the full range of comprehensive family planning services .
They ’ll also build significant barriers to counseling , education , contraception
and preventive health services for those who need it most : low - income and
uninsured women and men .
The regulations
could even invalidate state laws that currently ensure access to contraception
for many Americans .
In fact , they describe New York
and California’s
laws requiring prescription drug insurance plans to provide coverage for
contraceptives as part of " the problem . "
These rules would even
interfere with New York
State law that ensures
survivors of sexual assault and rape receive emergency contraception in
hospital emergency rooms .
We ’ve seen this
kind of ideologically driven move from the Bush Administration before .
Senator Patty Murray and I went toe to toe with the Bush Administration to
demand a decision on Plan B by the FDA .
We won that fight and we need to
win this one too .

When I learned
about these proposed rules , I immediately joined with Senator Murray to call on

My Sudoku solver ( in Common Lisp ) 2008-02-04
I do realise this has been done multiple times already , but I wanted to publish something really programming - related in this blog finally .
It ’s almost uncommented , but should be understandable in spite of that because I used mostly very short functions with ( hopefully ) speaking names .
So here ’s my code :

For a lot of years , I ’ve respected and admired Arizona Senator John McCain , and even though he is a Republican , he seemed to be more moderate than his right - wing compatriots .
That changed today when I read that he has proposed construction of 45 new nuclear reactors by 2030 .
Adding insult to injury , he told a Missouri State University audience that he ’d pledge $ 2 billion a year in federal funds to make clean coal a reality .
All in the name of reducing dependence on foreign oil and fostering a cleaner environment .
Here we go again with the nuclear crap
He tells the worn out tale of reactors being clean and non-polluting .
Interestingly , and certainly not surprisingly , he did n’t mention anything about cleaning up the messes left by earlier uranium mining .
Nor did he propose on how to get rid of , store , neutralize or make safe , the huge stockpile of nuclear waste piling up every day .
And let ’s not forget the environmental damage to be done by mining more uranium to feed those reactors .
He gave that subject the same brush - off every nuclear energy proponent does , with the statement that more needs to be done to safely transport and store spent materials .
Do n’t let anyone try to tell you the in - situ leaching process is environmentally clean .
Being an underground process , it has , under certain conditions , the ability to contaminate ground water .
45 more reactors and “ clean coal ” , what a wonderful promise for our future .

Mutts are getting a whole lot more respect .
Already riding a surge of unprecedented popularity , dogs of mixed or unknown heritage are getting another boost .
Whether short - legged , spotted , curly - haired , barrel - chested , pointy - eared or snub - nosed — or a combination of all of them — multi- breed mongrels will be welcomed and extolled at a new registry and Web community launching this week at muttigrees.org .
HUMANE EDUCATION :
The fight against animal cruelty reaches new fronts
The American Mutt - i- grees Club — created by the Pet Savers Foundation , the developmental arm of the massive North Shore Animal League America in Port Washington , N.Y. — will give voice to the estimated 25 million owners of mixed - breed dogs , send mutt certificates to their pets and ultimately elevate the mixed - breed choice in the public consciousness , says J. John Stevenson , president of NSALA and managing director of the foundation .
" People are incredibly proud of their mixed breeds , and the time is ripe for there to be a way for them to communicate , share ideas and celebrate their choice , " Stevenson says .
A parade of proud owners
Indeed , mixed - breed ownership has become something of a badge of honor in some quarters in the past decade or so .
Many people who in previous years would not have considered anything other than a purebred now proudly parade about with an obvious mongrel at the end of a leash .
They join the millions of mixed - breed owners who have long been almost rhapsodic in singing the praises of their mystery - breed canines .
Stevenson figures that the new club for mongrel lovers will not only be appreciated , but will " change , over time , the way many people view mixed - breed dogs in shelters . "
The club 's efforts will be coupled with upcoming outreach initiatives by the more than 2,000 NSALA partner shelters across the country and educational programs to be launched next year .
The fact is that purebreds that enter shelters nationwide ( 25 % to 30 % of the intake numbers at most facilities ) are generally adopted far faster than the mixed breeds .
And it is believed that the vast majority of approximately 3 million dogs euthanized in shelters every year are mixed breeds .
They are either the result of random encounters between neighborhood dogs , or the overflow from breeders and puppy mill operations that have begun creating litters of specific mixes called hybrids , such as the union of beagles and pugs ( known as puggles ) or Labradors and poodles ( known as Labradoodles ) .
" Everything we 're doing is an effort to promote the desirability of mixed - breed dogs , " Stevenson says .
There are already some join - up opportunities for owners of mixed - breed dogs , including registration operations that issue paperwork for hybrids not recognized by the American Kennel Club , and organizations that exist primarily to put on competitive events for mixed - breed dogs .
Mutt - i- grees will " occupy a very different space " from the existing registries and clubs , says Stevenson .
" We want to become somewhat the AARP of mixed - breed dogs .
Just as AARP advocates issues relevant to seniors by aggregating a tremendous number of members , we , too , want to channel the voice of 25 million mixed - breed owners , to raise awareness and promote regulation to diminish the stronghold of puppy mills and irresponsible breeders . "
' Sharing the love '
The proliferation of dog clubs , registries and communities is indicative of " the evolution in the way we view dogs in our society , " says Stephen Zawistowski of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
" There was a time when owning a dog was a thing you did by yourself .
Now dogs are part of the social fabric of people 's lives . "
Being able to connect with others of like mind " is part of the belonging - ness of dog ownerships , another way of sharing the love , " he says .
Children have not been left out of Mutt - i - grees ' plans .
Pet Savers has put together " Mutt - i - grees Cares , " a program that is designed to heighten children 's awareness of mutts and shelter animals .
And next fall , a humane - education curriculum that Pet Savers developed in partnership with Yale University 's School of the 21st Century Program , operating in 1,300 schools across the country , will be rolled out to about 650,000 kids in pre-kindergarten through ninth grade .
All of the elements , Stevenson says , are intended to " elevate the status of mixed - breed animals " in the minds of those who have n't yet gone that route , and , just as important , send the message that " if you want a dog , you come to a shelter . "
Even so , purebreds are n't denigrated .
" We 're not taking a stand against purebreds .
We 're not saying people should n't have a purebred if that 's what they want , " says Stevenson , adding that he wants the shelter route to be a " top - of - mind option , and a mixed - breed seriously considered . "
Mutt - i - grees program organizers expect 250,000 people to sign up on the website in the next 12 months .
The free membership includes access to health tips , blogs , expert advice and cross- discussion among members ; the $ 25 and $ 100 memberships provide merchandise discounts and special offers .

Share views and tales of your Fido below :
Now that oil is over $ 100 - and in my opinion will be much higher in 5 or 10 years ( T. Boone Pickens predicts $ 300 / bbl in 10 years ) - we will have tightened our belts a good deal by the time any of this oil could actually reach the market .
Therefore , I think now is the time for Congressional hearings on opening up these areas .
Let 's have an open debate on the issue .
However , if these areas are opened for drilling , I have a compromise that should be very attractive to those in opposition .
Hopefully this essay conveys a pragmatic approach designed to bring two sides in this debate closer together .
At present it is hard to imagine that they could be further apart .
A big part of the reason for the chasm between views is that there is a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding the issues .
I hope to address those in this essay .
A recent sampling of letters to the New York Times gives a flavor of the views of the opposing sides :
To Drill or Not to Drill ?
There ’s the Rub
First a letter opposed to further drilling :
Allowing offshore drilling for gas as a solution to high fuel costs , as President Bush urges Congress to do , is as sensible as growing more food in response to rising levels of obesity or robbing a bank in response to overspending one ’s budget .
While it is not popular , the clear answer , as it is in the case of overeating and overspending , is to cut back in the consumption of food , in the consumption of one ’s salary and in the consumption of fuel .
Painful as it is , I applaud the $ 4 gallon because it is the one thing that has finally gotten the public to focus on the fact that we need to consume less .
For the first time , one hears from every quarter , turn off the lights in rooms you are not in , recycle that paper , drive less and take public transportation or ride your bike .
That is the kind of talk political leaders should be encouraging , not new ways to keep up the old habits .
And one in favor :
As a 40 - year Alaskan , I can tell you that opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the most sensible solution for America ’s oil problems .
Most of the people who are trying to stop drilling in the refuge have never been in our state .
You have no idea how little space they are talking about .
Take a regular envelope , pretend that is the refuge ... now where you would put the stamp , that is the area they want to open .
Alyeska Pipeline has worked , the gas pipeline is in the process , and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge should be .
Congress is making this a party fight .
How about putting that energy into fighting for all Americans , as oil prices do n’t care whether you are Republican or Democrat ?
So , where does the truth reside ?
Is it not worth the effort ?
Or can we " drill here , drill now " and make a significant step toward energy independence ?
Let 's investigate .
What is the Objective ?
This is the key to the entire debate .
Different groups have different agendas , and desires are often based on misinformation .
Take a couple of extreme examples .
I consider myself an environmentalist , but one who is practical , and informed on energy issues .
Let 's take an environmentalist who may be less - informed .
Like me , they are concerned about the impact of continued fossil fuel consumption on our environment .
When they think of drilling , they envision oil slicks washing up on the shore , and a polluted ANWR .
They see oil companies - not ordinary citizens - as the primary beneficiaries if drilling is allowed .
They are optimistic about the ability of alternative fuels to rapidly scale up and replace depleting fossil fuel reserves .
Or , they do n't fully understand the implications of falling fossil fuel reserves , or in an extreme case they do n't care and think the earth could use a healthy die - off of the human population .
Each of these groups is going to be vehemently opposed to opening up areas to additional drilling .
They simply do n't think there is a need , and that it will simply delay our transition to alternatives .
Those in Congress who are so outspoken against additional exploration likely fall into the category of ' alternative fuel optimist . '
If they can only keep the ban in place , alternatives , mass transit , and conservation will rise to the challenge .
The key to this approach is that the alternatives must deliver when they are needed , and they must cover severe shortfalls .
What if they do n't ?
What is Plan B? Shortages ?
Rationing ?
For our other extreme example , let 's consider the Hummer - driving , non-negotiable lifestyle mentality .
The majority of this group is also not very informed on energy .
They believe that underneath U.S. territory lies an ocean of oil , waiting to be tapped - if those darned environmentalists would only get out of the way .
They are prepared to drill through a polar bear 's head if it will mean cheap gasoline - which they know it will .
These people are going to be very outspoken about the need to drill anywhere , anytime .
This approach suffers from a very similar problem as the previous approach :
What if the oil that is available simply can't cover any severe shortfalls ?
What if the expectations of these vast oceans of oil lead us to delay actions on alternatives ?
Again , what is Plan B? Military action ?
The majority of us fall somewhere in between , but it breaks pretty sharply along party lines .
Democrats do n't want to drill , Republicans think we should drill .
Perhaps we should first develop an idea of the stakes .
How Much Oil is at Stake ?
That 's a big problem .
We do n't know .
All we have right now are ' educated ' guesses .
Multiple government agencies have made assessments .
The Minerals Management Service in the Department of the Interior estimated in 2006 :
The MMS estimates that the quantity of undiscovered technically recoverable resources ranges from 66.6 to 115.3 billion barrels of oil and 326.4 to 565.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
The mean or average estimate is 85.9 billion barrels of oil and 419.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
Of that , they estimate that reserves in areas currently off - limits to exploration amount to just under 18 billion barrels .
Based on the 2007 U.S. consumption rate of 20.7 million barrels of oil per day , 18 billion barrels would last just under 2.5 years .
The EIA estimate from areas currently off - limits to exploration was very similar at just over 18 billion barrels :
Impacts of Increased Access to Oil and Natural Gas Resources in the Lower 48 Federal Outer Continental Shelf
This graphic was recently used in a post at Grist by Joseph Romm , who argued that the amount of oil that is off limits has been greatly exaggerated .
Based on the above graphic , Romm has a point , as the amount of undiscovered oil in areas open to exploration is more than twice the estimate from areas off limits to exploration .
However , much of that oil is mile - deep water that will be very expensive to develop .
So the comparison is n't necessarily apples to apples .
Estimates of recoverable oil from ANWR are of a similar magnitude .
The Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) in a 2008 report noted :
In the mean oil resource case , the total volume of technically recoverable crude oil projected to be found within the coastal plain area is 10.4 billion barrels , compared to 5.7 billion barrels for the 95 - percent probability estimate , and 16.0 billion barrels for the 5 - percent probability estimate .
The EIA also presumes that it will take 10 years to scale up and bring production online :
At the present time , there has been no crude oil production in the ANWR coastal plain region .
This analysis assumes that enactment of the legislation in 2008 would result in first production from the ANWR area in 10 years , i.e. , 2018 .
The primary constraints to a rapid development of ANWR oil resources are the limited weather “ windows ” for collecting seismic data and drilling wells ( a 3 - to - 4 month winter window ) and for ocean barging of heavy infrastructure equipment to the well site ( a 2 - to - 3 month summer window ) .
The timeline broke down as 2 to 3 years to obtain leases , 2 to 3 years to drill an exploratory well , 1 to 2 years to develop a production development plan , and 3 to 4 years to build infrastructure .
What 's the bottom line ?
With an estimated 18 billion barrels of oil offshore and 10 billion barrels in ANWR , there is potentially enough oil there to meet four years of U.S. demand .
However , in terms of imports , currently around 13 million barrels a day , there is potentially enough there to eliminate oil imports for nearly 6 years .
Further , based on my proposal below , there may be enough there to eliminate imports for 20 years .
Finally , consider the economic ramifications .
If we do nothing , despite well - intentioned calls for conservation , our insatiable demand for oil imports will continue .
With production from some of our major suppliers having peaked ( e.g. , Mexico ) and with internal consumption in other countries negatively affecting their exports , the price of oil will be under constant upward pressure over the long term .
If we do n't produce those 28 billion barrels of oil , we will go and buy those barrels on the open market .
At today 's oil price , that means that about $ 3.5 trillion will leave this country , much of it flowing into countries that are hostile to the U.S.
By keeping that money at home , we can not only create jobs , but we have an opportunity here to fund a transition away from oil , and to more sustainable options .
Let 's Compromise
Both sides generally agree that our dependence on petroleum is a problem .
Among the arguments from both sides is that this dependence puts our national security at risk and that it endangers the environment .
I think both sides would agree that a long - term solution to the problem could be a combination of conservation , along with alternative options such as higher efficiency vehicles , electric transport , and mass transit .
Where large numbers will start to disagree is whether this is achievable in the short - term , or whether it is going to take a few more years and a few more technological developments .
I fall into the latter category , for a variety of reasons .
I am pretty familiar with a lot of the alternatives , and they are simply not competitive even at gasoline prices of > $ 4/ gallon .
To illustrate that point , consider Europe , where gasoline prices in many locations are now approaching $ 10 / gallon .
Even at that price , fossil fuels remain the dominant choice for transportation .
It is going to take more than price - or at a minimum much higher prices than Americans probably anticipate - to drive us away from a very high level of dependence upon fossil fuels .
So how about a compromise ?
I propose that we open up some of the more promising areas to exploration , and then devote the royalties to funding fossil fuel alternatives .
We could subsidize public transportation .
We could provide a tax credit of $ 1,000 for each person who purchases a car that gets over 40 mpg .
We could borrow a page from T. Boone Pickens ' plan , use these oil revenues to fund wind and solar power , and displace natural gas which could then be used to displace petroleum .
It is true that the oil wo n't flow from these areas for perhaps a decade , but by then we are likely to be in very bad need of it .
Prices will probably be very high , which means the royalties from the oil will provide a lot of money for funding alternatives .
This should be a compromise that parties from both sides could agree to .
If not , then what 's going to happen is that as prices continue to rise , so will the pressure to drill , and Congress will eventually cave in to these demands .
But by failing to earmark the money for alternatives , it will just postpone the inevitable .
So now is an opportune time to hold open Congressional hearings on the subject .
That 's a compromise I prefer .
However , one that would have even greater support behind it would be to return an oil dividend to U.S. citizens ( as Alaska has historically done ) .
That is tangible for people , whereas funding the alternatives may not be .
However , while I think this compromise would find wide support among many people with stretched budgets , it does nothing to address the problem of oil dependence .
That , in my opinion , must be part of any solution .
A final excerpt from those New York Times letters summed it up best , in my opinion :
People say we should have a Manhattan Project - style program to develop alternative energy .
That is fine , but while the Manhattan Project was continuing , we did not put World War II on hold while we waited for the atom bomb .
The conventional war was continually fought throughout that time .
Conclusion
As I recently calculated , we could displace a great deal of our fossil fuel consumption with solar power , but it will ultimately take a multi-trillion dollar investment .
We could borrow from T. Boone Pickens ' plan and use wind and solar power to displace natural gas that is currently used to produce electricity .
That natural gas could then be used in CNG vehicles to displace petroleum .
The net impact would be a large reduction in our fossil fuel consumption ( and note that it is much easier to produce natural gas from biomass than it is to produce liquid fuels ) .
We sit on top of trillions of dollars of oil .
We should use it – sparingly – to wean ourselves from oil dependence .
The realistic alternative to this is that we continue to be highly dependent upon petroleum .
As a result , we will watch those dollars flow out of the U.S. - right up until the point that our imports dry up and we watch a new generation of sons and daughters march off to fight resource wars because of our failure to plan ahead .

Metaclasses in Five Minutes
It Ain't Such Black Magic Really
" Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99 % of users should ever worry about .
If you wonder whether you need them , you do n't . "
— Tim Peters
Note
There is a video of me giving this as a presentation at PyCon 2009 , 11 minutes into this video : Lightning Talks at PyCon 2009
Originally a lightning talk first given at PyCon UK 2008 .
Metaclasses have a reputation for being ' deep - black - magic ' in Python .
The cases where you need them are genuinely rare ( unless you program with Zope ... ) , but the basic principles are surprisingly easy to understand .
Everything is an Object Everything is an object
Everything has a type
No real difference between ' class ' and ' type '
Classes are objects
Their type is type Typically the term type is used for the built - in types and the term class for user - defined classes .
Since Python 2.2 there has been no real difference and ' class ' and ' type ' are synonyms .
For classic ( old - style ) classes , their type is types .
ClassType .
Honestly , it 's True Python 2.5 .1 ( r251 : 54869 , Apr 18 2007 , 22 : 0 8 : 04 )
>> > class Something ( object ) :
. . . pass
. . .
>> >
Something
< class ' __main__.Something ' >
>> > type ( Something )
< type ' type ' >
Here we can see that a class created at the interactive interpreter is a first class object .
The Class of a Class is ...
Its metaclass ...
Just as an object is an instance of its class ; a class is an instance of its metaclass .
The metaclass is called to create the class .
In exactly the same way as any other object in Python .
So when you create a class ...
The interpreter calls the metaclass to create it ...
For a normal class that inherits from object this means that type is called to create the class : >>> help ( type )
Help on class type in module __builtin__ : class type ( object ) | type ( object ) -> the object 's type | type ( name , bases , dict ) -> a new type
It is this second usage of type that is important .
When the Python interpreter executes a class statement ( like in the example with the interactive interpreter from a couple of sections back ) , it calls type with the following arguments :
The name of the class as a string
A tuple of base classes - for our example this is the ' one - pl ' ( object , )
A dictionary containing members of the class ( class attributes , methods , etc ) mapped by their names
Easy to Demonstrate >> > def __init__ ( self ) :
. . . self .
message = ' Hello World '
. . .
>> > def say_hello ( self ) :
. . . print self .
message
. . .
>> > attrs = { ' __init__ ' : __init__ , ' say_hello ' : say_hello }
>> > bases = ( object , )
>> >
Hello = type ( ' Hello ' , bases , attrs )
>> >
Hello
< class ' __main__.
Hello ' >
>> > h = Hello ( )
>> > h . say_hello ( )
Hello World
This code creates a dictionary of class attributes , and then calls type to create a class called Hello .
The Magic of __metaclass__
We can provide a custom metaclass by setting __metaclass__ in a class definition to any callable that takes the same arguments as type .
The normal way to do this is to inherit from type : class PointlessMetaclass ( type ) :
def __new__ ( meta , name , bases , attrs ) :
return type .
__new__ ( meta , name , bases , attrs )
The important thing is that inside the body of the __new__ method we have access to the arguments passed to create the new class .
We can introspect the dictionary of attributes and modify , add or remove members .
It is important to override __new__ rather than __init__ .
When you instantiate a class both __init__ and __new__ are called .
__init__ initialises an instance - but __new__ is responsible for creating it .
So if our metaclass is going to customise class creation we need to override __new__ on type .
The reason to use a new type rather than just a factory function is that if you use a factory function ( that just calls type ) then the metaclass wo n't be inherited .
In Action ... >> > class WhizzBang ( object ) :
. . .
__metaclass__ = PointlessMetaclass
. . .
>> > WhizzBang
< class ' __main__.WhizzBang ' >
>> > type ( WhizzBang )
< class ' __main__.PointlessMetaClass ' >
WhizzBang is a class , but instead of being an instance of type the class object is now an instance of our custom metaclass ...
What can we do with this ?
Well ( I 'm glad you asked ) ... our metaclass will be called whenever a new class is created that uses it .
Here are some ideas : Decorate all methods in a class for logging , or profiling .
Automatically mix - in new methods .
Register classes as they are created .
( Auto - register plugins or create a db schema from class members for example . )
Provide interface registration , auto - discovery of features and interface adaptation .
Class verification : prevent subclassing , verify all methods have docstrings .
The important things is that the class is only actually created by the final call to type in the metaclass - so you are free to modify the dictionary of attributes as you see fit ( and the name plus the tuple of base classes of course ) .
Several of the popular Python ORM ( Object Relational Mappers for working with databases ) use metaclasses in these ways .
Oh , and because metaclasses are inherited so you can provide a base - class that uses your metaclass and sub-classes inherit it without explicitly having to declare it .

US politicians have announced a $ 700 bn deal to rescue America 's financial system and end the credit crunch .
The move , backed by both Republican and Democratic leaders , allows the Treasury to spend up to $ 700 bn ( £ 380 bn ) buying bad debts from ailing banks in the US .
President George W Bush urged lawmakers to support the bill , which needs approval by both houses of Congress .
Some Republicans have voiced objections to massive state intervention in the financial sector .
The deal was announced after days of high - level wrangling between Republicans and Democrats in Congress over the content of the bill .
Both parties had vigorous objections to a proposal submitted last week by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that would have given him sweeping powers over how the money was spent .
Every American has an interest in fixing this crisis - inaction would paralyse the economy
Harry Reid
Senate majority leader
Announcement in quotes Santander to buy parts of B&B Q&A : Bail - out plan
His plan was prompted by a string of failures in large US financial institutions , including the government bail - out of insurance giant AIG .
If approved by the Senate and House , the revised plan will lead to the biggest intervention in the markets since the Great Depression in the 1930s .
Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives , said the agreement was " not a bailout of Wall Street " , but designed to ensure pensions , savings and jobs would be safe .
Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid said the deal was a big improvement on the initial proposal .
" They wanted a blank cheque and we could n't give them one ...
Now we have to get the votes . "
' Necessary tools '
The negotiations had lasted all weekend and were so intense that at one point Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson suffered what was described as a " woozy spell " .

The US administration had wanted a deal to be announced before markets opened in Asia , but Asian investors appear yet to be convinced about the rescue plan 's impact .
By Monday afternoon trading in Japan , Tokyo's main Nikkei 225 index was down 118 points or 0.8 % to 11,776 .
The fall on Hong Kong 's Hang Seng was even more pronounced , down 383 points or 2 % to 18,230 .
No golden parachutes
The deal addresses several of the key concerns raised by both Democrats and Republicans :
The government will get the money in tranches - $ 250 bn straight away , and $ 100bn at the request of the White House ; Congress can veto the release of the remaining $ 350 bn
Banks that accept bail - out money will have to hand over shares in return , which allows tax payers to benefit from the banks ' recovery
Top bankers , meanwhile , will see their pay limited , and " golden parachutes " - huge payments when they leave the firm - will be banned
The banking industry will have to help finance the bail - out if the money can not be recovered from the struggling banks themselves
Four agencies will monitor the deal , including an independent Inspector General and a bipartisan oversight board
Banks will be obliged to join an insurance programme to protect them against the losses of mortgage - backed securities
The bill , called the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 , faces its first hurdle later on Monday when the House votes on it , says the BBC 's Justin Webb in Washington .
It goes before the Senate later in the week .
The proposed legislation was now " frozen " , said Ms Pelosi , which means critics can not strike out individual provisions that they do not like .
However , several key critics of the deal called on their fellow legislators to block it .
Financial woes
The Bush administration submitted its initial proposal after several financial institutions got into trouble - unable to free up the money to keep their daily business going .
The liquidity problems have not been limited to the US .
In the United States ' largest bank failure , Washington Mutual was taken over by regulators and sold on to JPMorgan Chase
Lehman Brothers collapsed , Merrill Lynch sought refuge in a takeover by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley secured a large capital injection from a Japanese rival
US insurance giant AIG had to be bailed out by the US government , which in effect took an 80 % stake in the firm
In the UK , meanwhile , mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley is set to be nationalised , with the savings part of the business to be sold to Spanish banking group Santander
The governments of Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed late on Sunday evening to invest 11.2bn euro in huge financial services group Fortis , in effect nationalising it .

ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
Republicans launched a full - throated counterpunch at the media 's scrutiny of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on Wednesday and accused the media of wanting to " destroy " John McCain 's vice presidential pick .
Gov. Sarah Palin campaigns in Missouri the weekend before the National Republican Convention .
The accusation comes as Palin is set to take center stage at the Republican National Convention Wednesday night in the Xcel Energy Center in downtown St. Paul , Minnesota .
She will address the delegates in prime time with what many analysts call the most important speech of her political career so far .
The McCain campaign has been engaged in an increasingly fierce offensive against media coverage of McCain 's choice of running mate .
The media is examining whether the first - term governor and former small - town mayor 's experience has prepared her for the vice presidency and whether the McCain camp spent enough time vetting her background .
In a memo released Wednesday , McCain 's campaign called the scrutiny of Palin a " faux media scandal designed to destroy the first female Republican " vice presidential nominee .
" Gov. Sarah Palin is an exceptional governor with a record of accomplishment that exceeds , by far , the governing accomplishments of Sen . [ Barack ] Obama , " Steve Schmidt , a senior McCain adviser , wrote in a memo , referring to the Democratic presidential candidate .
" Her selection came after a six - month - long , rigorous vetting process where her extraordinary credentials and exceptionalism became clear .

" This vetting controversy is a faux media scandal designed to destroy the first female Republican nominee for vice president of the United States who has never been a part of the old boys ' network that has come to dominate the news establishment in this country , " the memo said .

During a contentious news conference near the convention site , a group of Republican women said the media 's questions about Palin were rooted in sexism -- and told the media to stop " messing with us . "

" All of us up here have been subjected to the stereotype of show horse , not work horse .
...
They are trying to treat her as a show horse , to say ' nice little girl , nice show horse , but not qualified , ' " she said , adding that she was shocked that some in the media would choose to " belittle , " " demean " and " demonize " Palin .

Several speakers criticized the media for reporting on Palin 's family , though they pointed to the governor 's experience as a working mother as a vital part of her experience .
" You know , who better than her to understand the challenges that we have as career women trying to balance work and family , " former U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin said .
" Yet what we have is a media that has said things about her that they would never dare to say about a man , " Marin said .
" I am outraged .
I am insulted .
I am offended .
And I know I represent millions of working women , millions of working mothers " who feel the same .
Pennsylvania Republican Party leader Renee Amore said that as an African - American woman , " I understand racism and I understand sexism .
...
These smears are meant to distract the American people from the fact that Gov. Palin has more executive experience than Barack Obama . "
When asked to name a specific time when she considered the mainstream media 's reporting to be sexist , Amore could not name one , pointing instead to the general tone of the coverage .
Over the past several days , the McCain campaign has been questioned about the Palins ' business dealings and political affiliations , and the governor 's reformer record .
Over the past several days , the McCain campaign has been questioned about the Palins ' business dealings and political affiliations , and what the governor calls her reformer record .
The Palins and the campaign have issued statements on the pregnancy of 17 - year - old daughter Bristol and the two - decade - old DUI arrest of the governor 's husband , Todd .
Palin's office is also being investigated to see whether Palin or any of her staff pressured an Alaska public safety commissioner to fire Alaska state trooper Mike Wooten , who had been in a messy divorce and child custody battle with Palin 's sister .

The McCain campaign , which has been complaining about news coverage of the presidential race all summer , has spent the past few days pushing back on blogosphere rumors , including the release of a blizzard of memos and documents , many of which had not been reported in mainstream media outlets .
McCain 's choice of running mate surprised many in the political world .
She was rarely mentioned as being on McCain 's short list of running mates before he announced his pick in Ohio on Friday .
Many expected a more conventional pick , such as Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty or former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
Both were finalists in the selection process , according to campaign sources .
The Washington Post reported that McCain 's chief vetter , A.C. Culvahouse , had his first extensive interview with Palin on August 27 , one day before McCain made his decision to tap her as his running mate .
As reporters continue to press for details on the thoroughness of McCain 's vice presidential vetting process , Schmidt , a former senior adviser for President Bush 's 2004 re-election team , said the Arizona senator " picked his governing partner after a long and thorough search . "
" The McCain campaign will have no further comment about our long and thorough process .
This nonsense is over .
The American people get to do the vetting now on Election Day , " November 4 .

All About Sarah Palin • Barack Obama • John McCain
Ed O’Callaghan , erstwhile top terrorism prosecutor from Washington D.C. , now holed up in Anchorage Alaska giving legal advice in the Troopergate investigation , announced that the “ First Dude ” will not be cooperating .
He will ignore his subpoena , O’Callaghan says , because he no longer believes the investigation is “ legitimate . ”
Why ?
Did n’t say .
It must have something to do with that hideously partisan unanimous vote by a council of 8 Republicans and 4 Democrats .
Those damned Democrats wielding their minority power all over the place , forcing consensus !
Who do they think they are ?
( Big red “ Illegitimate ” stamp slams down on document )
Those buncha < grumble grumble grumble >…..
Todd , along with other witnesses , can stall without penalty for months , pushing this investigation well past election day .
To bring contempt charges , which are punishable by a fine up to $ 500 , or up to six months in jail , the full Legislature must be in session .
That happens after Christmas .
Surely there will be other nuggets of intrigue to come , but few doubt at this point that the final chapter of the Troopergate tale will be told until after November 4 . ( puts reading glasses away , and closes the Troopergate book .
For now . )
The damage that this stonewalling has had on Sarah Palin ’s “ image , ” that the out - of - state lawyers and the McCain campaign were trying so fervently to craft , has yet to be measured .
Former Maxis man and now one man development company , Cliff Harris , has told SPOnG that Electronic Arts " screwed up " with its use of SecuROM digital rights management technology ( DRM ) in Spore .
Talking about the tech and the consumer backlash it provoked the developer , who now runs his own indie studio , Positech , to say , " I think EA have screwed up here , for several reasons .
"
Firstly , SecuROM did n't even work , as the game was pirated before release .
Secondly , this game was much anticipated by gamers as one of the most significant releases of the year , so the idea that you could not have a single worldwide release date , and expect people in North America to resist the temptation to pirate it was just silly .
" Also , they have thrown away a lot of the goodwill that gamers have towards Will Wright .
I understand why they think the DRM is a good idea , but they have n't even tried to make it ' good ' DRM , by defending their position , making it clear when and if the DRM will be removed , or abandoning it the day it got pirated .
" From a PR point of view , this is a disaster , as they have come across like they have their fingers in their ears and are n't listening .
Ultimately I think it 's sad , because this was a very original , high budget PC game release that could have been a great shot in the arm for PC gaming .
Everyone loses as a result of this , EA , Maxis , and PC gamers .
the only people celebrating this are the people who make a dishonest living from selling advertising impressions on pirate websites .
It 's a totally avoidable disaster .
" The SecuROM software in Spore will only allow the game to be installed onto a PC five times , provoking a huge backlash from consumers .
While it has a Metacritic average score of 86 , a staggering 1,324 out of 1,418 reviewers on Amazon gave it just one star out of five , citing the DRM as the reason .
As well as having worked at Maxis , Harris knows a bit about piracy .
He 's the chap who pulled his finger out and asked the pirates why they do it .
You can find more of his thoughts on indie development in his SPOnG column EA , however , has confirmed that it will continue to use SecuROM , albeit in a more " lenient " form , attempting to justify its use .
When asked why he robbed banks , Willie Sutton famously replied , “ Because that ’s where the money is . ”
The same logic explains the call by John Edwards , the Democratic presidential candidate , for higher taxes on top earners to underwrite his proposal for universal health coverage .
Providing universal coverage will be expensive .
With the median wage , adjusted for inflation , lower now than in 1980 , most middle - class families cannot afford additional taxes .
In contrast , the top tenth of 1 percent of earners today make about four times as much as in 1980 , while those higher up have enjoyed even larger gains .
Chief executives of large American companies , for example , earn more than 10 times what they did in 1980 .
In short , top earners are where the money is .
Universal health coverage cannot happen unless they pay higher taxes .
Trickle - down theorists are quick to object that higher taxes would cause top earners to work less and take fewer risks , thereby stifling economic growth .
In their familiar rhetorical flourish , they insist that a more progressive tax system would kill the geese that lay the golden eggs .
On close examination , however , this claim is supported neither by economic theory nor by empirical evidence .
The surface plausibility of trickle - down theory owes much to the fact that it appears to follow from the time - honored belief that people respond to incentives .
Because higher taxes on top earners reduce the reward for effort , it seems reasonable that they would induce people to work less , as trickle - down theorists claim .
As every economics textbook makes clear , however , a decline in after - tax wages also exerts a second , opposing effect .
By making people feel poorer , it provides them with an incentive to recoup their income loss by working harder than before .
Economic theory says nothing about which of these offsetting effects may dominate .
Update 9/24/08 – Responding to consumer complaints , Electronic
Arts has relaxed the digital rights management restrictions on “ Spore . ”
If the backlash to Electronic Arts ’ new game “ Spore ” serves as a sign of things to come , strict digital rights management ( DRM ) restrictions are transforming from consumer annoyances into full - fledged business mistakes .
From Forbes :
In just the 24 - hour period between Wednesday [ 9/10 ] and Thursday [ 9/11 ] , illegal downloaders snagged more than 35,000 copies , and , as of Thursday evening , that rate of downloads was still accelerating .
“ The numbers are extraordinary , ” [ Eric ] Garland [ CEO of Big Champagne ] says .
“ This is a very high level of torrent activity even for an immensely popular game title . ”
Electronic
Arts had hoped to limit users to installing the game only three times through its use of digital rights management software , or DRM .
But not only have those constraints failed , says Garland , they may have inadvertently spurred the pirates on .
On Amazon , “ Spore ’s ” one - star customer rating is driven by anti-DRM sentiment rather than analysis of the game itself .
It ’s likely only a small percentage of “ Spore ’s ” potential customer base knows or cares about DRM , but Amazon ’s star - system shorthand makes no distinction between reviewers passing judgement on the game and those engaging in DRM activism .
Deserved or not , a one - star rating averaged from thousands of reviews is the very definition of caveat emptor , particularly for casual shoppers who encounter “ Spore ’s ” listing down the road .
The combination of “ Spore ’s ” long history on the gaming world ’s radar and the publicity push surrounding its release will undoubtedly lead to good sales in the early going ( anecdotal evidence suggests this is already the case ) .
But “ Spore ” is one of those hyper - immersive games that ’s shaped by its users , and this DRM flap may ultimately limit adoption and future product opportunities .

Earlier today Opera Software introduced their new default skin for the upcoming Opera 9.5 release .
It is dark , got some shiny and glassy effects , kind of Windows Vista style , though bit too light for that .
In case you have n’t seen it yet , check the screenshot below .
OK , checked ?
Let ’s start the review now , shall we ?
Click on the picture to enlarge .
Installation …
Not much to say there , it just looks better than the previous ones …
Reminder that it ’s a beta ?
OK , all finished .
Let ’s begin .
If I were a newbie , would probably say that this button is a print screen replacement .
It just looks like a print screen button and says nothing about it ’s real function .
Someone should change it .
If you would click “ Closed ” tabs button , it will look like this :
It just does n’t fit the current interface .
Do n’t you think so ?
Bad color + square …
Menu icons are way too dark , looks pretty much the same , are not attractive and confusing
Now not sure if this is a skin related bug , but Opera cuts half of the text when viewing previous visited pages :
Here is probably one of the worst skin bugs .
As you can see , it has a little X in the top right corner
There ’s nothing wrong with that .
But what happens when you open one more tab ?
They disappear .
This is a feature ( same as in Opera 9 ) , maybe limit should be increased a bit ?
There is still a plenty of space for the X button .
By clicking a small icon in the left corner , you can open panels ( bug : when opening them via menu , scrollbar in the bottom appears ) which look like this :
Icons issue again , there are no colors , looks the same …
I hope they are not experiencing any kind of depression and decided to remove colors for some other reasons .
Star could be yellow , little gear blue , etc .
There should be some colors so users would find the one they want faster .
Buttons on click effect is burning eyes a bit and should be changed .
Maybe I am nagging too much , but tabs icon looks like an iPhone
One more icons problem .
All are the same , makes it hard to find the one user wants .
Forced to read all that text .
Just a small tip here : make the following button removable .
CTRL+T works fine here .
If you have decided to remove top left icon before the tabs , it will look something like this :
Bit too close , 2 - 5 px spacing would make a difference .
Status bar now has a small gradient , it actually makes the text bit harder to read .
Not a big issue .
Same icons problem here :
And finally , transfers bar .
Blue progress bar does n’t match this color scheme anymore and on click effect is kind of odd .
Conclusion ?
As for now , previous skin looks much better .
Tabs color is too dark compared to the whole interface , ( would actually prefer even darker tabs panel background if interface would match it ) loaded sites text on tabs are blue ( hard to read ) and the issues mentioned above .
I like their new style though .
7/10
Hope Opera team will also read this , improve their skin design , give me some credit or reveal a “ top secret ” Opera 10 feature so I can write about it here :-)
What ’s your verdict ?
Update :
So I went to my mom ’s house ( really new pc user ) and installed Opera 9.5 there .
Her first reaction was something like : “ huh , what ’s that ? ”
After a little explanation she began using it …
Instead of opening a new tab , mom typed an address on the same one .
Why ?
Because she could n’t find anything in the left corner ( where new tab icon always was ) .
Had to show tiny plus button in the right .
Now not sure if this has anything to do with the sight , but she have n’t noticed close tabs icon as well ( old one was big and this one is very tiny ) .
As requested , I ’m now installing Opera 9.27 there …
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - The Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , has been admitted to a hospital in India with “ abdominal discomfort ” but there was no cause for concern , doctors said on Thursday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The spiritual leader , who cancelled two foreign trips after he complained of fatigue was “ cheerful ” after reaching the hospital in Mumbai , a hospital spokesman said .
“ He has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort , investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern , ” Mohan Rajan , the spokesman , said from Mumbai .
“ We can not tell you for how many days he will stay in the hospital at the moment . ”
The Nobel Peace Prize winner returned to Dharamsala , the north Indian town where Tibet ’s self - proclaimed government - in - exile is based , on Sunday after a two - week visit to France .
The visit focused mainly on lectures on Buddhism , but during it he also criticized Chinese policies in Tibet .
He told Le Monde in an interview that Chinese troops had fired on protesters in eastern Tibet on August 18 , and that since protests against Chinese rule broke out in March , 400 people had been killed in the Lhasa area alone .
On Wednesday an aide told Reuters the 73 - year - old was due to travel to Mumbai , India ’s financial centre , to undergo “ routine medical tests ” in hospital .
“ All I can say is that he is fine , ” Chhime Chhoekyapa , the Dalai Lama ’s aide told Reuters from Mumbai on Thursday .
On arrival , the Dalai Lama was escorted by hospital officials to his room , where doctors carried out a preliminary check - up , his aide said .
“ He is resting and has not had any visitor since he reached the hospital , ” Chhoekyapa , who accompanied the Dalai Lama , said by telephone .
The Dalai Lama spends several months of the year away from Dharamsala , delivering religious lectures and speaking about what he calls the suffering of Tibetan people under Chinese rule .
In recent years , doctors have increased medical checks to ensure that the Lama was in good health .
“ His holiness is in good health , he retires early in the evening and gets up early in the morning , ” Chhoekyapa said .

Astronomers are looking to identify Earth - like watery worlds circling distant stars from a glint of light seen through an optical space telescope and a mathematical method developed by researchers at Penn State and the University of Hawaii .
" We are looking for Earth - like planets in the habitable zone of their star , a band not too hot nor too cold for life to exist , " says Darren M. Williams , associate professor of physics and astronomy , Penn State Erie , the Behrend College .
" We also want to know if there is water on these planets . "
For life to exist , planets must have habitable temperatures throughout a period long enough for life to evolve .
For life as we know it , the planet must have a significant amount of water .
Scientists already know how to determine the distance a planet orbits from its star , and analysis of light interacting with molecules in the atmosphere can indicate if water exists .
However , Williams and Eric Gaidos , associate professor of geobiology , University of Hawaii , want to identify planets with water on their surfaces .
The researchers ' method , reported in an upcoming issue of Icarus and currently available online , relies on the reflective properties of water .
" A planet like Venus , with a dense atmosphere , will scatter the sunlight in all directions , " Williams says .
" If you look at Venus in phases , when it is full , it is brightest and when it is crescent , it is faintest . "
When a planet is full in respect to its sun with the whole disk illuminated , water would actually be darker than dirt .
However , when a planet is in crescent , with the sun glancing off the watery surface , the reflection will be brightest .
The image of the Blue Marble , taken by Apollo 17 in December 1972 , is striking because the Earth is 70 percent covered in water .
The researchers believe that large enough amounts of water will provide a glint of light visible in the infrared and visible spectrum if they watch the planet for long enough .
" We are going to look at the planets for a long time , " says Williams .
" They reflect one billionth or one ten billionth of their sun .
To gain enough light to see a dot requires observation over two weeks with the kinds of telescopes we are imagining .
If we stare that long , unless the planet is rotating very slowly , different sides of the planet will come through our field of view .
If the planet is a mix of water , we are going to see the mix travel around the planet . "
The researchers want to monitor the light curve of a distant planet as the planet spins on its axis and moves around its star .
By looking at the changes in brightness , correlated to the planet 's phase , they should be able to tell if the planet has liquid oceans .
If the temperatures are correct , the liquid is probably water .
While there are currently no telescopes capable of identifying watery planets , astronomers hope that a terrestrial planet finder telescope will orbit the earth in the next 10 to 20 years .
In the meantime , the Penn State researcher has arranged for the current Mars Express and Venus Express missions of the European Space Agency , to look back at the Earth occasionally from a great distance and observe what our watery planet looks like in various phases .
" Any time that the Earth is in a crescent phase as viewed by a distant space vehicle , we should take advantage of the situation and look back at the Earth , " says Williams .
Firefox 3 , GTK and a downside of Enterprise Linux distros .
N.B. On 6/8/09 Novell updated Firefox in SLED 10 to version 3.0.12 .
They packaged up newer versions of GTK etc and supplied them as packages with names like firefox3 - gtk2 .
I guess they got tired of backporting security fixes in to Firefox 2 , or it became too difficult or just impossible to do anymore .
So Firefox 3 is released today .
This is a Good Thing but also highlights a downside of using an ' Enterprise ' Linux distro .
The Linux version of Firefox has a dependency on the GTK toolkit and Firefox 3 requires GTK 2.10 or higher .
If you 're using a Linux distro that has an older version of GTK then Firefox pops up a message about how it needs GTK 2.10 + then exits .
Given that part of the point of Enterprise distros is that they do n't change things like library versions for years at a time , ( thus providing a stability lacking in distros that release a new version every 6 months or so ) , this leaves anyone using a version of an Enterprise distro that has GTK older than 2.10 with something of a problem if they want Firefox 3 .
I am one such person as my main work machine runs Novell 's SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 , which has GTK 2.8 .
There is of course a solution .
( Aside from hoping that someone will release Firefox 3 packages for the version of your distro you 're using , which for an Enterprise distro seems unlikley . )
Get a new version of GTK and point Firefox 3 at it .
Except it may not be that simple since GTK depends on various other libraries , possibly newer versions of those libraries than a distro with a version of GTK older than 2.10 includes .
Anyway , this is how I got Firefox 3 running on SLED 10 .
It should be useful as a guide for other distros though some adaption may be required .
Install some packages
You 'll need the following packages installed : openssl - devel , libjpeg - devel , libtiff - devel , libpng - devel .
The versions that are included with your distro should do .
The names may be slightly different if you 're not using SLED 10 .
Debian and Ubuntu tend to use - dev rather than - devel in package names for example .
There 's probably other - devel packages you 'll need apart from those I 've listed and which I already had installed , but you 'll find out if that 's the case when you try and build stuff .
Download source code for GTK and dependencies .
These are the versions I used . :
Glib - http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/2.16/glib-2.16.3.tar.bz2
Cairo - http://www.cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.2.6.tar.gz
Pango - http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pango/1.20/pango-1.20.3.tar.bz2
ATK - http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/atk/1.22/atk-1.22.0.tar.bz2
GTK - http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtk+/2.12/gtk+-2.12.10.tar.bz2
I used Cairo 1.2.6 because it's new enough that Pango 1.20.3 will use it and old enough that it did n't require me to also build pixman .
Set some environment variables
I found I had to set the following environment variables to get the build to work .
Note that the paths reflect where I installed the libraries so change to where ever you decide to install stuff .
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/local/opt/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/local/opt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export PATH= / local / opt/bin: $ PATH
$ export CPPFLAGS= " - I/local/opt/gtk/include "
$ export LDFLAGS= " -L/local/opt/gtk/lib "
Build and install
In the order they 're listed above , unpack the source code , build and install .
The build command is the same for all :
$ ./ configure -- prefix= / local / opt && make && make install
I installed the packages in to / local / opt since obviously I want to keep it all separate to the libraries that come with SLED 10 , that 's somewhere non-root users can write to on my machine and not doing this as root eliminates the chance of a typo overwritting already installed libaries .
You may of course find some libraries do n't build because you do n't have some package or other installed so you may find you have to install a - devel package and try again .
Edit :
If something fails to configure or build then read the errors .
Look at what libraries are mentioned then see if you have the - devel packages for those libraries installed .
If not install them then try again .
If you get an error about cups - config not being present then install the cups - devel package .
Also read the comments and see if someone else had the same problem and a solution is suggested .
Make a wrapper script to run Firefox
You 'll need to run Firefox via a wrapper script .
This is what I use .
If you 're not using SLED 10 remove or alter the MOZ_PLUGIN_DIR value as appropriate .
Replace / path - to - firefox / with where you unpacked Firefox 3 and / local / opt with where ever you installed stuff .
#!/bin/bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/local/opt/lib
export MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=/path-to-firefox/plugins:/usr/lib/browser-plugins
/ path-to-firefox / firefox
Edit : I 've just realised the MOZ_PLUGIN_DIR does n't have any effect .
I could have sworn that it did .
Will have to look in to that .
Edit : Sorted out how to make Firefox 3 uses plugins in /usr / lib / browser - plugins and updated wrapper script .

Alternatively , you can uninstall the Flash plugin entirely and use Chrome 's self - contained version when you need it .
This has the added advantage of loading HTML5 on some sites , like YouTube , when using Flashblock would just block the original Flash instead of serving the new HTML5 content .

Notes : IE is n't horrible ( in fact , version 9 has made a few improvements ) , but it always seems behind the times compared to every other browser in existence .
Unless it 's the only browser that can load a specific webapp , it 's not worth your time .
Use IE to download a more extensible , feature - filled browser and forget about it .

Application (s ) to Avoid : Browser Toolbars
Indictment : I do n't even know where to start .
They 'll change your home page , track your browsing habits , take up space , and offer you features you do n't want in return .
Superior Alternative(s ) : Not installing toolbars .
Notes :
There are a few exceptions to this rule , but in general , you want to avoid browser toolbars at all costs .
Toolbars often come packaged with other software and hijack the crap out of your browser , so any time you see a checkbox with the words " Ask Toolbar " next to it , do whatever it takes to keep that thing off your system .
Application to Avoid : Windows Media Player
Indictment : Lack of format support , crappy interface
Superior Alternative(s ) : VLC , KMPlayer , Media Player Classic
Notes : Windows Media
Player is n't all bad , but rarely is it preferable over simpler video players like VLC and KMPlayer .

Application to Avoid : QuickTime
Indictment : Unnecessary , comes with the annoying Apple Software Update
Superior Alternative(s ) : QT Lite , VLC , KMPlayer , Media Player Classic
Notes :
If you use iTunes , you need QuickTime on your system , but QuickTime has some annoying habits ( like taking over some of your file types ) .
QT
Lite is a great QuickTime replacement that 'll work with iTunes .
If you 're not going to use iTunes , though , you can play QuickTime videos in VLC without a problem .
VLC and Media Player Classic even come with a browser plugin on the off chance you come across a QuickTime - only format video embedded in a web page .

Application to Avoid : WinZip and WinRAR
Indictment : Pricey , Unnecessary
Superior Alternative(s ) : 7 - Zip , among others
Notes : WinZip is completely unnecessary on modern Windows machines , since it has ZIP support built - in .
On the rare occasion ZIP is n't good enough , RARs provide great compression , but WinRAR is shareware , and RAR is n't that much better than 7 - Zip 's 7z format .

Application to Avoid : Nero Burning ROM , Roxio Creator , and other bloated CD / DVD burners
Indictment : Pricey , bloated
Superior Alternative(s ) : ImgBurn
Notes : Suites like Nero and Roxio are certainly more advanced than their freeware counterparts , but the majority of users will never need their more advanced features — especially considering their cost ( both in dollars and in bloat ) .
Plus , between smartphones and thumb drives , how often do you burn optical media , anyway ?

Application to Avoid : Paint
Indictment : Is it still 1995 ?
Superior Alternative(s ) : Paint.NET , GIMP
Notes :
If you ever have to do any basic image editing , you 've probably realized Microsoft Paint is an incredibly primitive ( almost childish ) program .
Paint.NET will serve your basic image editing needs , while GIMP provides more advanced features .
Application to Avoid : AIM , Windows Live Messenger
Indictment :
Only support one network at a time , filled with ads
Superior Alternative(s ) : Pidgin , Miranda , Trillian , Digsby
Notes :
We can't recommend Pidgin enough , though if you do n't like it , Trillian and Digsby are also feature - filled , multi-protocol options .
However , both contain either ads or bundled crapware , which is the exact problem we 're trying to solve today .
They 're certainly better than AIM and Live Messenger , just be aware they 're still dangerously close to being adware and crapware .

Application to Avoid : Windows Picture Viewer
Indictment : Does n't support every format , very basic
Superior Alternative(s ) : IrfanView , XnView
Notes : Windows Picture Viewer is okay , but if you want support for other formats and extra features like keyboard shortcuts , IrfanView is a great replacement .
Application to Avoid : Skype
Indictment : Difficult to quit , runs at startup , horrible interface
Superior Alternative(s ) : Google Video Chat
Notes :
This one 's a little harder to escape , since everyone else you know probably uses Skype .
But it 's such a pain in the butt , it 's worth trying to get all your friends to convert , since Skype probably annoys them just as much as it does you .

Application to Avoid : Microsoft Office
Indictment : Pricey , painfully slow , difficult to use
Superior Alternative(s ) : LibreOffice , Google Docs
Notes : Office suites have never been the poster children for blinding speed , but Microsoft Office is one of the worst offenders .
It feels like you stare at that splash screen for hours before you actually get to start working .
If you do n't absolutely need Microsoft Office , LibreOffice is a great , free replacement that can handle most users ' needs , though Google Docs'll also get the job done for more adventurous users .

Indictment : Severely lacking in features
Superior Alternative(s ) : Notepad ++ , Notepad2
Notes :
It 's fine for one - off text edits , but if you ever spend any time in text editors , you know how painfully basic Windows ' Notepad is .
Notepad ++ is is packed with useful features that make it stand out over Notepad .
If you really want to complete the transition away from Notepad , a few system tweaks can make sure you never have to deal with it again .

Superior Alternative(s ) : Cygwin + Console2 , PowerShell
Notes :
If you rarely visit the command prompt , Windows ' built - in offering is probably fine .
But if you 're a heavy command line user , you 'll want something a bit more advanced .
Users familiar with Windows commands will love PowerShell , which is bundled with Windows 7 , while UNIX veterans will love the Cygwin shell coupled with a better terminal program like Console2 .

Tell us about it ( and its superior alternative ) in the comments .
This tasty fruit salad also has the same genes as insects , animals and viruses .
Thanks to GMOs .
Genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) have been in our food system since 1996 .
For about twelve years we have been consuming food that involves the splicing of genes from one species to another in a lab .
What is striking about GE food is the lack of public debate and media coverage in North America , particularly in the US and Canada .
If you compare this to the last election in France where a central issue of the candidates ' platforms were GM foods , and more broadly the extent to which GM foods are dealt with in Europe , there leaves a lot to be desired here in Canada .
The tricky thing with addressing GMOs is that they require addressing economic , social and ethical issues .
Bringing these issues into a Canadian context requires asking who should be making decisions over what Canadians eat .
One would think in one of the most highly regarded democracies in the world Canadians would be able to at least have a say over whether they should eat strawberries with fish genes .
In the least case Canadians should at least have the right to know whether the food they are ingesting has been genetically modified .
Unfortunately in both Canada and the US regulations over genetically modified food are made by industry , and industry has all the scientists gaining from these new developments .
Our country has been addressing GMOs with what has been called the principle of substantial equivalence .
This means that no new regulations are made on food that has the same taste , look , and nutritional content as trh traditional one .
The Canadian government feels that it need not be accountable of its citizens in an issue that affects everyone and has not been around long enough for anyone to see potential effects in the long term .
Sixty years ago smoking was thought to have no adverse health effects , yet look what we know now .
Maybe GMOs are perfectly healthy for the average person to consume , but until that day Canadians should have a choice on whether they eat GM foods or not .
Labeling GM and GM - free food in Europe has had such a strong effect on the food market that many supermarkets no longer carry GM foods simply because people do n't want them .
Maybe the EU is a little too strict with its importation laws and anyone who has read about the huge stink the US is making on how it cannot sell its soy ( which is 90 % GMO ) or corn ( 70 % GMO ) in the EU will know what I 'm talking about .
However , the EU 's stance as a precautionary actor is in my opinion admirable and in the least sense prudent .
The basic idea around the EU 's precautionary principle is that since there is no extensive information on GE foods and there is the potential for irreparable damage .
The lengths they have gone with process based labeling is extremely impressive .
This means that every ingredient in a food is traced back to its origin , literally from the farm to the fork , and labeled accordingly .
Ultimately , the Canadian government should take the initiative that realizes the stakes GMOs have for society .
This arena 's not only is a key component to future scientific progress , the control of future food and seed supplies but it is already affecting the direction of Canada ’s economic growth .
The decisions that Canada is making over GMOs ( and those its not ) are creating an identity that Canada might not necessarily want in the future .
Nevertheless , it 's important to also acknowledge that , GMO ’s do have the potential to do a lot of good in this world .
The testing currently being done in this field is astounding with prototypes for foods with enhanced nutritients and further down the road even pharmaceutical plants that could cure common colds or even more serious diseases .
The potential these foods have in serving the developing world is boundless , but every potential risk must be addressed before we should truly trust GM foods .
Burger King Helped Robert Downey Jr. Beat Drug Addiction

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Pop quiz !
Which one is worse : years of crippling drugs abuse or a single meal from that far - from - green fast food eatery , Burger King .
If you ask Robert Downey Jr. he ’d tell you option B .
Downey recently told Empire magazine that it was Burger King that helped him kick his terrible drug addiction back in 2003 .
Downey recalls driving with “ tons of f*** ing dope ” in his car when he stopped at Burger King for a burger , but the food made him feel so bad he thought he had overdosed .
He said : “ I have to thank Burger King .
It was such a disgusting burger I ordered .
I had that , and this big soda , and I thought something really bad was going to happen . ”
Robert immediately threw all his drugs into the sea and decided to turn his life around .
Now not everyone can say that Burger King helped them with their drug addiction , instead a lot of people go to rehab centres .
Celebrities in particular have to go through such public humiliation as a result of choosing to get this help , I bet they wish they could do things in a much more low key fashion to give them some much needed peace during this difficult time .
Regardless of what kind of treatment you need , whether it ’s meth addiction treatment or alcohol treatment , make sure it is from professionals .
That ’s easy to understand when you take into account that a Burger King Double Whooper with Cheese has 1,010 calories and 67 grams of fat , a large fry has 590 calories and 30 grams of fat , and a medium Sprite has 260 calories .
Assuming he also had the fries , that ’s loading your body with a whopping 1,860 calories and 97 grams of fat in one sitting .
Yeah , I totally believe that could outdo a mighty dose of nose candy .
So for the first time ever , let me congratulate you Burger King on being so effing gross that you trick people into fake drug overdoses .
AWESOME !!

Income Concentration at Highest Level Since 1928 , New Analysis Shows :
Average pre-tax incomes in 2006 jumped by about $ 60,000 ( 5.8 percent ) for the top 1 percent of households , but just $ 430 ( 1.4 percent ) for the bottom 90 percent , after adjusting for inflation , according to a new update in the groundbreaking series on income inequality by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez .
Their analysis of newly released IRS data shows that in 2006 , the shares of the nation ’s income flowing to the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent of households were higher than in any year since 1928 ...

How to reform a winner - takes - all economy : Two of President George W. Bush ’s economic goals ... will be to convince anxious American workers that they should not lose faith in an open , global economy and that they should support tax reform that moves the US closer to eliminating all taxation on investment .
What must be recognised , however , is the growing degree to which these two policy goals are in conflict .
While the president is essentially right to stress that we cannot turn our back on open markets and globalisation , his rhetoric and policy framework ignore the increasing winner - takes - all and loser - loses - all tendencies in the US economy .
Last year , the wealth of the richest 400 Americans climbed to nearly double the 1982 level as a share of US gross domestic product ; but we also saw those suffering losses taking steeper falls .
Jacob Hacker of Yale University has found that when US families suffer a drop in income , they face 40 per cent declines on average .
At the same time , Lawrence Katz , the Harvard economist , has documented the increasing polarisation in the US labour market as earnings grow at the high end while opportunities for middle - class jobs dry up .
Such extreme gains and losses are often due to significant differences in education or skill but as Robert Shiller , the Yale economist , has written , the unpredictability , speed and vastness of global markets have also enhanced the role of luck , or slight timing advantages , in determining who falls into the winners or losers circles .
Consider twin brothers with equivalent education and work histories , who each took good jobs six years ago -- one , fortunately , with Google , the other , less fortunately , with Lucent .
Since the investment community was still betting on Lucent in early 2000 and Google was just getting established , it is hard to say that skill led one worker to $ 2 m in stock options and the other to a pink slip and a job retraining programme .
Even though such differential outcomes can seem unfair to many , this is a price we gladly pay for a free market economy .
Our progressive tax system has been part of the way the US has balanced the desire for a free economy with the values of equity .
Yet , eliminating taxation on investment income exacerbates -- not moderates - - winner - takes - all outcomes .
Consider our brothers .
If the one at Lucent finds a new , $ 60,000 a year job , he could pay about 25 per cent in federal taxes ( including payroll taxes ) .
Yet , under Mr Bush ’s tax policy , if his twin at Google can find a solid 6 per cent return investing his $ 2 m , he can make at least $ 120,000 a year while paying a lower 15 per cent tax rate .
If we move closer to Mr Bush ’s vision of zero taxes on dividends , capital gains and inheritances , the Google twin could watch his gains accumulate tax - free year after year and then pass on his wealth to an heir , tax free .
Moving the US tax code in this direction is wrongheaded on both economic growth and value grounds .
Progressive taxation is critical to marshall the resources to ensure that those who end up at Lucent or Delphi have the support and education to get second and third chances in the global economy .
Without a greater cushion against falls in the global economy , workers may opt to take less risk on their future , just as entrepreneurs would risk less if they thought a single bankruptcy would land them in debtors prison .
Furthermore , a tax system that eases the Google ’s tax - free wealth accumulation but forces his brother to pay higher taxes on income earned through labour betrays American values that honour the hard work of the middle class over policies that perpetuate an economic elite .
A better tax reform plan would prevent the most privileged Americans from paying lower taxes on their investment than typical families pay on their wages , while encouraging savings and wealth creation for struggling workers .
We could start by ending our current system of giving those in the highest tax brackets more than twice the tax deduction of typical workers and creating a flat tax incentive for savings â€ “ a 30 per cent credit for everyone .
More important , we should provide automatic matching credits for moderate income workers to save -- essentially creating a universal 401 ( k ) plan for retirement savings accounts for all Americans .
So if the president really wants to build support for greater openness in the economy , he needs to focus on tax reform that expands the winners circle , not reform that expands the current winners fortunes .

The next major advance in computer processors will likely be the move from today 's two - dimensional chips to three - dimensional circuits , and the first three - dimensional synchronization circuitry is now running at 1.4 gigahertz at the University of Rochester .
Unlike past attempts at 3 - D chips , the Rochester chip is not simply a number of regular processors stacked on top of one another .
It was designed and built specifically to optimize all key processing functions vertically , through multiple layers of processors , the same way ordinary chips optimize functions horizontally .
The design means tasks such as synchronicity , power distribution , and long - distance signaling are all fully functioning in three dimensions for the first time .
" I call it a cube now , because it 's not just a chip anymore , " says Eby Friedman , Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rochester and faculty director of the pro of the processor .
" This is the way computing is going to have to be done in the future .
When the chips are flush against each other , they can do things you could never do with a regular 2 - D chip . "
Friedman , working with engineering student Vasilis Pavlidis , says that many in the integrated circuit industry are talking about the limits of miniaturization , a point at which it will be impossible to pack more chips next to each other and thus limit the capabilities of future processors ' .
He says a number of integrated circuit designers anticipate someday expanding into the third dimension , stacking transistors on top of each other .
But with vertical expansion will come a host of difficulties , and Friedman says the key is to design a 3 - D chip where all the layers interact like a single system .
Friedman says getting all three levels of the 3 - D chip to act in harmony is like trying to devise a traffic control system for the entire United States -- and then layering two more United States above the first and somehow getting every bit of traffic from any point on any level to its destination on any other level -- while simultaneously coordinating the traffic of millions of other drivers .
Complicate that by changing the two United States layers to something like China and India where the driving laws and roads are quite different , and the complexity and challenge of designing a single control system to work in any chip begins to become apparent , says Friedman .
Since each layer could be a different processor with a different function , such as converting MP3 files to audio or detecting light for a digital camera , Friedman says that the 3 - D chip is essentially an entire circuit board folded up into a tiny package .
He says the chips inside something like an iPod could be compacted to a tenth their current size with ten times the speed .
What makes it all possible is the architecture Friedman and his students designed , which uses many of the tricks of regular processors , but also accounts for different impedances that might occur from chip to chip , different operating speeds , and different power requirements .
The fabrication of the chip is unique as well .
Manufactured at MIT , the chip must have millions of holes drilled into the insulation that separates the layers in order to allow for the myriad vertical connections between transistors in different layers .
" Are we going to hit a point where we can't scale integrated circuits any smaller ?
Horizontally , yes , " says Friedman .
" But we 're going to start scaling vertically , and that will never end .
At least not in my lifetime .
Talk to my grandchildren about that . "

Abelardo Rosas served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan .
He 'd been hit by 13 improvised bombs , suffered head trauma and was diagnosed with severe post - traumatic stress disorder .
A couple of months ago , he barely spoke to anyone .
He was sullen and surly and not responding to treatment at the PTSD clinic at the Veterans Affairs health center in Menlo Park .
Then he met Vegas , a sweet , good - natured golden retriever with a shiny coat and sad eyes .
Rosas had volunteered to participate in a pilot program - veterans at the clinic would train canines to become assistance dogs to aid disabled veterans , those who had lost limbs or are confined to wheelchairs .
Something about the dog touched Rosas .
He 'd grown up with dogs ; he has seven of his own back in Texas .
He 's the kind of guy who picks up strays from the side of the road .
When he had to take care of Vegas , and learn to train him , his emotions re-emerged .
" He has a constant need for attention , " Rosas said of Vegas .
" You can't ignore him .
All I want to do is hang out with Vegas . "
Rosas is one of nine veterans at the clinic who have been learning to train the dogs as part of a program called " Paws for Purple Hearts . "
The program is the brainchild of Rick Yount , a trainer with the Assistance Dog Institute of Santa Rosa .
Yount has been involved with assistance dog training for years and had recently worked with at - risk youths who were given dogs to train for people with disabilities .
He saw stories about veterans with PTSD , and those who have lost limbs .
Why not develop a program in which veterans with PTSD would train assistance dogs , he thought ?
They would benefit from the emotional connection with a kind and loving animal while providing for veterans who need the assistance of a dog .
Yount proposed the idea to the Veterans Affairs department and eventually worked up a program involving veterans at the Menlo Park PTSD clinic .
The program started in July , and so far , nine veterans have worked with the three dogs - in - training , Vegas , Venuto and Verde , who are brothers .
Yount trains the veterans , using a combination of lectures and hands - on experience .
As the dogs complete their training , they will be handed over to disabled veterans .
Each dog needs about 1 1/2 years of training .
Yount said handling and training dogs is valuable in the treatment of PTSD because the animals help the veterans connect with their emotions .
The dogs counteract feelings of isolation .
They have to take the dogs out into the community , he said , and other people inevitably want to pet the dogs and talk to the person handling them .
" The dog also reinforces the need to assist someone else , " he said .
" This is important for a lot of veterans because most of them joined the military to help people . "
Eventually , Yount said , he hopes to expand the program to other VA clinics .
The veterans spend about 12 hours a day taking care of the dogs and training them in a variety of tasks : how to open doors , turn on lights , pull wheelchairs , pick things up off the ground and serve as a brace for those times when the dog 's guardian needs help getting up or back into a wheelchair .
Ryan Briones , who served two tours in Iraq in his four years in the Marines , volunteered for the program after he saw other veterans in the clinic working with them .
He found the animals calming in ways that no person or therapy could .
" It 's hard to explain , but just petting the dog is soothing , " he said .
" There 's no anger there . "
Chuck Marino , who served in Iraq with the Nevada National Guard , said training the dogs has taught him patience .
Working with Vento , he would bark out orders to " sit " as if speaking to a stubborn private , and the faster he spoke , the more excited and less obedient Vento became .
Yount showed him how to slow down , speak clearly to the dog , and be assertive without being aggressive .
" They 're like teenagers , " Marino said .
Richard Hagan , 57 , of Palo Alto knows about the value of a service dog .
He 's a veteran of the war in Vietnam , having been a machine - gunner with the 101st Airborne Division and wounded twice .
Now he uses a wheelchair because of multiple sclerosis .
He got his dog through a different program a couple of years ago .
His dog is a sweet - natured black Labrador named Kovin .
Kovin is never far from Hagan 's side .
He appears to be a pet , but he 's also ready for whatever Hagan needs .
He is also the only dog allowed into the traumatic brain injury clinic at the VA , said Hagan , who likes to take the dog there to provide some help to the injured veterans .
The dog represents some kind of normalcy , Hagan said .
The veterans will hold pieces of kibble in their fingers , and Kovin will gently lick and nudge their hands until he gets the treat .
" It 's that physical touch that means so much , " Hagan said .
" Kovin is a good dog , but he 's more than just a service dog to me .
He means so much more . "

Democratic leaders in Congress promised swift action , but also want to throw a lifeline to homeowners , not just Wall Street .
With the economy issue No. 1 in an election less than six weeks away , lawmakers are striving to get a plan in place by week 's end , fearful that delay could send markets reeling .
" This is a new phenomenon for every major player in this place and there are no dress rehearsals .
That is why the market is so jittery .
This has to work the first time , " said Peter Kenny , managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City , New Jersey .
Altogether , the plan could end up costing $ 1.8 trillion .

The bailout plan follows a wrenching week that transformed Wall Street with Lehman Brothers ' failure , the agreed sale of Merrill Lynchand a government takeover of ailing insurer AIG .
It was also possible that within days one of the two remaining U.S. investment banks -- Morgan Stanley — would accept a partner .
Two key questions remained unanswered even after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson appeared on four television talk shows to press his case for emergency action .
For Investors
What price will the United States pay for these toxic debts , which have spawned the worst financial storm since the Great Depression ?
When will it start buying them ?
" I 'm confident that the credit market will improve but it will improve slowly .
It just seems a lot of details have not been answered yet , " said Jack Ablin , chief investment officer with Harris Private Bank in Chicago .
Paulson painted the proposed market intervention as a necessary evil , arguing the consequences of inaction would be so dire that the large burden on taxpayers would be worth it .
" This is not something that we wanted to do .
This was something that was very necessary , " Paulson said on the NBC Sunday program " Meet the Press . "
" We did this to protect the taxpayer . "
Bisphenol A is commonly used in food packaging Higher levels of a chemical often found in plastic food and drink packaging are associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes , a study has suggested .
The group with the highest levels of Bisphenol A ( BPA ) in their urine were found to be more than twice as likely to have diabetes or heart disease .
But the Journal of the American Medical Association research did not show that Bisphenol A caused the conditions .
And a UK toxicology expert stressed the study 's findings were " preliminary " .
Over two million tonnes of BPA were produced in 2003 , although usage of the chemical is starting to decline .
BISPHENOL A Used in the industrial production of plastics , two types in particular : Polycarbonate plastic :
A lightweight , rigid and reusable plastic used in products including CDs and DVDs , electronics equipment , sports equipment and reusable food and drink containers Epoxy resins :
Used in protective coatings , paints and adhesives , and protective liners for metal food and drink cans
As well as being present in packaging , people are exposed to BPA through drinking water , on their skin and in household dust .
Previous research in the US found detectable levels of BPA in more than 90 % of the population .
Animal tests had raised concerns about the possible effects in humans - such as disruption to hormone production - but were inconclusive because people process the chemical differently .
The study by researchers from the UK's Peninsula Medical School in Exeter looked at BPA levels in the urine of 1,400 US adults , and whether they had ever been diagnosed with one of eight major diseases , including arthritis , stroke and thyroid disease .
No strong link was found aside from that with cardiovascular disease and diabetes , although higher BPA concentrations were associated with clinically abnormal concentrations of three liver enzymes .
Obesity link People who were obese , and therefore already at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes , had higher BPA levels - and the researchers said it was possible that eating more was simply linked to a higher intake of the chemical .
TESTING AND SAFETY
Some lab and animal tests have suggested potential problems , with BPA disrupting hormone balance in the body Specifically BPA has been found to mimic the female sex hormone oestrogen - with implications for development and reproduction Lobby groups , mainly in Canada and US have called for a ban Canada has become the first country to move towards reducing levels of BPA exposure in the population
But they said the link between higher levels of the chemical and the conditions remained true , even when they took body mass index levels and waist measurements into account , Dr David Melzer , who led the study , said : " These findings add to the evidence suggesting adverse effects of low - dose BPA in animals .
" Independent replication and follow - up studies are needed to confirm these findings and to provide evidence on whether the associations are causal . "
He added : " Given the substantial negative effects on adult health that may be associated with increased BPA concentrations and also given the potential for reducing human exposure , our findings deserve scientific follow - up . "
Hearing
The study is being published to coincide with a hearing on BPA by the influential US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
A spokesperson from the UK's Food Standards Agency said an expert panel was keeping the safety of BPA under review .
" The FSA will continue to closely monitor scientific reports about the health effects of BPA in the body and will take action to further protect consumers if it becomes necessary . "
Professor Alan Boobis , a toxicology expert based at Imperial College in London , said the study did not fit with previous research into the chemical .
" It 's an interesting finding , which we can't ignore .
But it is preliminary , and requires following up . "
He added : " It may be that the association is the inverse of what they are suggesting ; not that the BPA is causing cardiovascular disease and diabetes , but that these diseases result in a higher level of BPA , or that there may be a common cause - like something going wrong with the kidneys .
" Or it could be a chance finding . "
Professor Richard Sharpe , of the University of Edinburgh , said for some people a raised risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes could simply be down to drinking too many high sugar canned drinks .
These people would also be exposed to higher levels of BPA from the lining of drinks cans - but that could be purely incidental .
He said more research was needed to tease out the truth before BPA could be labelled as the prime suspect .
In a joint statement , the British Soft Drinks Association ( BSDA ) and the Food and Drink Federation ( FDF ) said bisphenol A had been approved as safe for use in food and drink containers by the regulatory authorities , and its use was closely monitored and regulated .
Levels of bisphenol A in food and drink can linings that did include the chemical were well below safety levels set by the European Food Safety Authority .

ECONOMISTS uniformly agree on very little when it comes to macroeconomics .
Off hand I can think of two things in particular : bad monetary policy wreaks havoc and innovation , ultimately , is the engine of economic growth .
I like to believe we have learned enough that the days of hopelessly misguided monetary policy are behind us and the future will be full a new innovation .
But , so long as we have innovation we will also have business cycles .
Innovation by definition creates uncertainty .
The uncertainty reveals itself in a Schumpeterian sense , over investment which inevitably leads to contraction .
But most recently it has caused problems because innovation out - paced the infrastructure it needs to work properly .
The new financial derivatives , what makes up the so called “ shadow banking system ” , have frequently been named the villain in the latest financial crisis .
They rely on complex mathematical models , not accessible to the non-quantitative .
The perception has become that this makes them opaque and difficult , if not impossible , to regulate .
Whenever anything comes along that is unfamiliar , but not yet fully understood , there exists a temptation to label it as uncategorically dangerous .
But limiting innovation because of uncertainty constrains growth .
The market for derivatives has allowed investors to take positions they never could before .
But that is not necessarily a bad thing .
Allowing investors to take the risky position they desire makes more than just Wall Street traders better off .
For example , innovation in the market for derivatives of commodities has increased the flow of energy and commodity products around the world .
In particular , emerging markets have gained better access to these resources .
This has in turn resulted in the huge improvement in real estate , infrastructure , and the general quality of life for the people of China , India ( these two alone represent over 1/3 of the world 's population ) , and many other countries .
An eminent economist I spoke with recently made the following analogy : derivatives are like a car with four wheel drive .
Four wheel drive makes driving safer , but it also means people will be more likely to drive in the snow .
If someone has an accident in the snow does that mean we should get rid of cars with four wheel drive or restrict their use ?
The market for financial derivatives grew exponentially in the last ten years because there was a demand for them .
Risk is always rampant in finance ; derivatives made it possible to better price and allocate it more efficiently .
However , they did not eliminate risk entirely .
The growth of the market out - paced the infrastructure to properly understand the implications and how to best regulate it .
Things have recently gone badly , but that is not justification for excessive regulation .
This will only make the problem worse .
The market exists for these products .
Regulation may only give people an incentive to come up with even more opaque products , which will lead to even greater uncertainty .
Uncertainty and risk is inherent in financial markets .
This means they will always be prone to a crisis .
But restricting the use of derivatives now would be as sensible as restricting investing in equity in 1929 .
The financial crisis bailout talks ( negotiations , cabal , whatever you ’d like to call it ) are having the headlines in England .
They have their own debacle , too and closely watch developments in Washington therefore .
But there are impressions from the debate as well , so here we go :
The Times ’ Simon Jenkins writes :
Since McCain , above all , could not afford to lose , but had come to seem an old and uncertain man , “ a conviction politician without convictions ” , he emerged from the event , in my view , with his standing enhanced .
Obama was the Obama we know : smooth , responsible but slightly ponderous , almost an elder statesman before his time .
But the debate is not Simon Jenkins ’ main concern , he goes on :
For all this , watching the debate was like asking Mrs Lincoln about the play .
Outside the chamber , a politically existential event was unfolding .
Never was globalisation more vividly on show than in pictures of world stock markets hanging on every intonation and nuance of the inquiry into the $ 700 billion rescue package for American banking .( read more )
The Independent ’s Rupert Cornwell , seems to have enjoyed the show :
It was the debate that was almost swept away by a financial tempest .
But when John McCain and Barack Obama did square up to each other on Friday night , they produced one of the best , and almost certainly the most watched , presidential debates ever .
How many minds they changed is another matter .
In this battle pitting age against youth , experience against promise , the two clashed on the economy , Iraq , al - Qa’ida and Iran .
But there was no knock - out blow .
and he conludes :
On Friday in Mississippi , the 20th century was pitted against the 21st .
Which man will Americans prefer ?
In 37 days ’ time , the answer will be known .
( read more )
The Telegraph ’s Phil Sherwell also points to the generational gap :
Mr McCain ran through his record on a series of foreign policy crises from 1983 , alluded to his time in Vietnam , mentioned his 35 - year friendship with Henry Kissinger and cited the experience of General Dwight D Eisenhower on the eve of the Normandy landings in 1944 .
Mr Obama by contrast promised voters the chance to study the federal budget on a “ Google for government ” and criticised Mr McCain for his “ 20th century mindset ” – arguably a harsh charge when we are only eight years into the 21st .

The Guardian ’s Dan Kennedy runs through a round - up of press reactions and concludes :
Obama , though , was steadier still .
Like Nixon 48 years ago , McCain demonstrated that he knows his stuff , perhaps to a greater extent than his opponent .
But like Kennedy , Obama proved that he can hold his own – and that may be more important in the end .
( read more )
The Economist reports that both candidates did rather well :
The biggest difference between the two men was in the tone that each used .
Mr McCain repeatedly offered some version of the phrase “ Senator Obama does n’t understand ” .
He presumably hoped to emphasise that Mr Obama lacks foreign - policy experience .
He may have scored points by criticising Russia while emphasising his longstanding support for Georgia .
But he sometimes seemed to sneer .
Mr Obama , although he sharpened his tone from the Democratic debates , was the calmer of the two .
When he felt criticised unfairly , he would often smile .
He gently needled Mr McCain but he did not savagely lay into his opponent .
Mr Obama is an articulate advocate of his foreign - policy views , in command of detail .
That he avoided any gaffes may have been enough to reassure many voters .
But foreign policy is generally considered a strength for the more experienced Mr McCain .

As things are with Washington and the opening of the Asian markets only a few hours away , it is well possible that this debate will soon be pushed aside by more pressing matters in people ’s minds .
: : : : : : : : : :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Russia pressed the United States on Wednesday to choose between " a real partnership " with Moscow or an " illusory " relationship with U.S. ally Georgia .
Washington said it 's sticking with Georgia .
" As to choosing , the United States has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of Georgia , " Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday .
She spelled out the Bush administration 's stance after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called Georgia 's government " a special project for the United States . "
" And we are aware that the U.S. is uptight about this project , " Lavrov said in remarks broadcast on Russian television .
" But a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts . "
Rice , amid reports that Russian troops remained on the move Wednesday , pushed Russia to abide by a cease - fire signed Tuesday by the Russian and Georgian presidents .
Russian military action in Georgia " must stop and must stop now , " Rice said .
Rice said Moscow already faced " quite significant " diplomatic consequences over its conflict with Georgia before Tuesday 's cease - fire agreement , which calls for Russian and Georgian troops to return to pre-conflict positions .
Bush said reports he had received were contrary to Russian assurances that it had halted military operations .
Bush said he was told the Russian military had blocked Georgia 's major east - west highway , and had soldiers at the main port at Poti .
There were reports that some ships had been attacked , he said .

U.S. may seek to punish Russia for Georgia conflict Georgia agrees to Russian - French plan to settle conflict
Russia has likely moved additional troops into the disputed Georgian provinces and into Georgia proper over the past several days , several administration officials told CNN on Wednesday .
The officials said the United States now believes Russia may have 15,000 or more troops in the region .
That would be an increase from the 8,000 - 10,000 the U.S. government estimated when the fighting began .
A Bush administration official stressed that the scope of Russia 's military effort remains unclear .
Any violations of the cease - fire would call into question Russia 's " suitability " as an international partner , Rice told reporters before leaving on a diplomatic trip to Europe .
Bush administration officials told CNN the United States and its European allies were considering kicking Russia out of the G - 8 , the group of the world 's largest industrial economies , and other international organizations as punishment for its actions in Georgia .
Rice discounted concerns that Moscow would no longer assist Washington on thorny diplomatic issues such as efforts to halt nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea , saying it had its own interests at stake .
" Let 's be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that Russia and the United States have engaged in on Iran or North Korea , " she said .
" Again , it 's not a favor to the United States . "
Russia sent troops and tanks into the breakaway Georgia region of South Ossetia last week after Georgia 's military acted to clamp down on Russian - linked separatists there .
Separatists in South Ossetia want independence -- or unification with North Ossetia , which is in Russia .
The conflict quickly spread to other parts of Georgia , including Abkhazia , another separatist region .
Georgia has been a close U.S. ally , contributing troops to the war in Iraq and seeking to join NATO with Washington 's support .
In a CNN interview Wednesday , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili criticized the United States for not doing more to help his nation .
Watch Saakashvili fault the U.S. response »
" America is losing the whole region , and this is the region of eastern and central Europe , " said Saakashvili , who called for the United States and European powers to send peacekeepers to the region .
" This is much bigger than any other place where there is American influence , and this is the most natural allies of America . "
But later Wednesday , in an interview with CNN's " Situation Room , " Saakashvili seemed to have a change of heart .
He said that after speaking with President Bush earlier in the day , he felt " there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity . "
" I never accused the United States in the first place of anything , " he said .
" I just said that the Russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels . "
Rice defended the administration 's response to the fighting .
Watch Bush express support for Georgia 's democracy »
" I do n't think you can have any doubt but that the United States has , from the very beginning , believed that the South Ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully , as we 've been working for months and months and months to do , but that Russia seriously overreached , that Russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in South Ossetia , " she said .
U.S. officials said they warned Saakashvili not to provoke Russia militarily by sending Georgian troops into South Ossetia and they had ruled out any U.S. military action to defend Georgia .
Rice spoke after Bush 's announcement that U.S. aircraft and ships would deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the fighting .
Bush and Rice warned Russia not to interfere with the delivery of humanitarian aid , noting that Tuesday 's French - brokered cease - fire allows for the delivery of international relief , and expressed concern over reports that Russian units were continuing to advance into Georgian cities despite Tuesday 's cease - fire .
Watch Russian tanks move toward Tbilisi »
" We expect Russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in Georgia , and we expect all Russian forces that entered Georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country , " Bush said .
Rice will travel to France and then head to Tbilisi , Bush said .
Next week , Rice will travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels , Belgium .
Russia 's move into Georgia came amid a struggle between the United States and Russia for influence within Eastern Europe .
From Russia 's point of view , American support for Georgia is a direct threat to its influence .
By striking heavily in Georgia , Moscow is sending a signal to other former Soviet republics , such as Ukraine and Moldova , said Sarah Mendelson , the director of the Human Rights and Security Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
" If I were a neighbor of Russia and I saw what Russia had done in Georgia , I would be very nervous , " Mendelson said .
" I think those countries that are leaning toward the West are very nervous today . "

SPOKANE , Wash . — Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin attended five colleges in six years before graduating from the University of Idaho in 1987 .
Federal privacy laws prohibit the schools from disclosing her grades , and none of the schools contacted by The Associated Press could say why she transferred .
There was no indication any of them were contacted as part of the background investigation of Palin by presidential candidate John McCain ’s campaign .
“ Our office was not contacted by anyone , ” said Tania Thompson , spokeswoman for the University of Idaho in Moscow .
Palin , the governor of Alaska , was born in Idaho .
Her family moved when she was only a few months old to Alaska , where she was raised .
She began college at Hawaii Pacific University , a private , nonsectarian school in Honolulu .
She attended only as a freshman during the fall of 1982 , school spokeswoman Crystale Lopez said .
Then known as Sarah Louise Heath , she was in the business administration program as a full - time student , Lopez said .
“ We ’re trying to track down someone who knew her , ” Lopez added .
From Hawaii Pacific , Palin transferred to North Idaho College , a two - year school in Coeur d’Alene , about 30 miles east of Spokane .
She attended the college as a general studies major for two semesters , in spring 1983 and fall 1983 , spokeswoman Stacy Hudson said .
“ We were not able to track down club affiliations or anything , ” Hudson said .
The school identified one of her professors but he did not remember her , Hudson said .
Prior to her selection by McCain , the North Idaho College Alumni Association notified Palin in June she would be the recipient of its 2008 - 2009 Distinguished Alumni of the Year Award .
From North Idaho College , Palin transferred 70 miles south to the University of Idaho , the state ’s flagship institution .
She majored in journalism with an emphasis in broadcast news .
She attended Idaho , whose mascot is the Vandals , from fall 1984 to spring 1985 .
She then returned to Alaska to attend Matanuska - Susitna College in Palmer in fall 1985 .
Then she returned to Idaho , for spring 1986 , fall 1986 and spring 1987 , when she graduated .
Despite her journalism degree , she does not appear to have worked for the college newspaper or campus television station , school officials said .
She worked briefly as a sportscaster for KTUU in Anchorage after she graduated college .
The McCain campaign did not have an immediate comment on Palin ’s higher education record .
In a recent interview with the school ’s alumni magazine , before her selection to run on the GOP ticket , she explained that her curiosity and love of writing made journalism a natural choice .
“ I was always asking everyone the questions , and I still am today , ” Palin told the magazine .
The University of Idaho is taking advantage of Palin ’s nomination .
A prominent photograph of her is featured on the school ’s Web site .
5 Reasons Why the Future of Business is Going to Be Rad
Business ownership is almost a right of passage in the United States .
Over 30 million people have answered the call of entrepreneurship in America .
There ’s simply something about being your own boss that aligns wonderfully with the freedoms promised in the American charter .
Not only can running a business today be a rewarding experience , but the future of business and how it will make running a company tomorrow could be even better .
There are five key things we ’re predicting the future will bring to fruition that has us entrepreneurs excited .
Here they are , in no particular order .
1. Fewer Barriers , More Customers
Globalization is here to stay and will pick up momentum in 2021 and beyond .
It used to be that your customer base was whoever was in driving distance of your organization .
Now , thanks to the internet and improved logistics infrastructures , you could have a hot sauce stand in West Hollywood that has “ regulars ” in Manila .
Look for more businesses to explore selling in developing markets globally , thanks to lax trade laws and improved communications .
2. Lower Payroll Expenses
This is a big win for the future of business if you ’re an entrepreneur .
It ’s not so great if you ’re a worker .
In any case , good or bad , the need for employees is going to take a downturn as tech experts create more automated work solutions .
We ’re already seeing Chatbots do fantastic jobs of informing customers on websites and through automated phone support .
Expect machine learning to get better and automated tasks to increasingly catch up to what a human can do .
3. Better , Cheaper Accounting
If you ’ve run a small business before , keeping up with taxes and bookkeeping has probably ranked among your least favorite things to do .
After pouring through hundreds of articles on Freshbooks vs QuickBooks , what self - employment taxes are , quarterly taxes , etc. , things can feel overwhelming .
Fortunately , we ’re seeing automated financial services get better and many great programs offering free tiers to new businesses .
Also , accountants are having to offer their services at better rates to stay competitive which is a win for you !
4. Lighting - Fast Wireless Internet
If your company is set up like most , when you ’re able to access the internet , you ’re able to do work .
The trouble with that is many areas do n’t give your 4g connection the kind of speed it needs to do many of the tasks that are integral to your operation .
With the advent and spread of 5g , that ’s going to be a thing of the past .
Expect global WIFI - quality connections while you ’re on the move !
5. Personalized Marketing
Personalized marketing is already a business reality with the way ads are targeted at consumers online .
Expect to see this targeting carry over into the physical world where billboards will change during times of day , signs will switch based on who is looking at them , and more .
The Future of Business Is Bright
The speculation we ’ve shared regarding the future of business barely scratches the surface of what ’s to come .
What we hope you ’ve taken away from this post is that there are a lot of exciting advancements that are going to make becoming profitable easier .
So , start building your company today and prepare to reap incredible benefits tomorrow !

Restoring the Human Body ’s Ability To Make Vitamin C
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
Utilizing gene therapy , researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario ( Canada ) report , for the first time , that they have successfully restored the ability to make vitamin C in a genetic strain of mice that no longer produces vitamin C as most animals do , suggesting a future day when this lost capability can be restored to humans .
Utilizing a harmless virus as a vector ( delivery agent ) , a working copy of the gulonolactone oxidase gene was re-inserted into mouse liver cells and their ability to naturally produce vitamin C was restored , enough to increase their blood levels by 6 - fold in just four days , and within 23 days blood concentrations were 20 - fold higher .
Gene therapy was so effective , vitamin C levels in the genetically defective mice were similar to normal mice who naturally produce vitamin C throughout the day .
Only a small number of animals , guinea pigs , fruit bats , primate monkeys and humans , do not produce vitamin C naturally by enzymatic conversion of blood sugar to ascorbate , the type of vitamin C that is continually produced in the liver of most animals .
For example , a 160 - pound goat , about the same weight as a human , will synthesize about 13,000 milligrams of vitamin C per day .
Modern humans , by comparison , produce no vitamin C and consume only about 110 milligrams of vitamin C from their daily diet .
Early hunter - gatherers who foraged for food are believed to have consumed around 640 mg of vitamin C per day from fruits and vegetables .
Vitamin C deficiency is universal in humans and is caused by a single gene defect .
This genetic defect is believed to have occurred long ago in human history and was transferred to all succeeding generations .
The gene that makes the enzyme gulonolactone oxidase , which is currently found in all humans , is dysfunctional .
This finding gives rise to speculation that early humans once produced their own vitamin C as most animals do today .
While humans can consume vitamin C supplements to boost vitamin C blood levels , it is often difficult to achieve high concentrations needed to prevent or even treat disease .
Researchers speculate that if the ability to continually synthesize vitamin C in humans could be restored , humans would likely live far longer , and experience fewer cataracts , gallstones , aneurysms ( bulging blood vessels ) , as well as less cancer , diabetes and heart disease .
Animals that produce vitamin C naturally live on average about 8 — 12 times beyond their age when childhood growth ceases .
For comparison , humans live only 2 — 3.5 times beyond their age of physical maturation ( ~ age 18 years ) and live about 60 — 75 years .
This research suggests a day when humans might live hundreds of disease - free years of life .
This report comes on the heels of recent studies showing intravenous vitamin C therapy may be promising for treatment of cancer .
The mouse gene therapy study was published in an advanced online edition of Human Gene Therapy .
Lead researcher Herb E. Schellhorn of the Department of Biology at McMaster University , said the future of this type of research may depend upon the acceptance of gene therapy altogether , since earlier gene therapy involving humans have been disappointing .
But he reports researchers around the world are eager to learn more about his work and fellow researchers at McMaster University are vying to conduct further studies .
Schellhorn is currently seeking funding to proceed with follow - up studies .

Whatever the events of this week mean , nobody should believe the overblown claims that the market crisis signals the death of " free market " ideology .
Free market ideology has always been a servant to the interests of capital , and its presence ebbs and flows depending on its usefulness to those interests .
During boom times , it 's profitable to preach laissez faire , because an absentee government allows speculative bubbles to inflate .
When those bubbles burst , the ideology becomes a hindrance , and it goes dormant while big government rides to the rescue .
But rest assured : the ideology will come roaring back when the bailouts are done .
The massive debts the public is accumulating to bail out the speculators will then become part of a global budget crisis that will be the rationalisation for deep cuts to social programmes , and for a renewed push to privatise what is left of the public sector .
We will also be told that our hopes for a green future are , sadly , too costly .
What we do n't know is how the public will respond .
Consider that in North America , everybody under the age of 40 grew up being told that the government can't intervene to improve our lives , that government is the problem not the solution , that laissez faire was the only option .
Now , we are suddenly seeing an extremely activist , intensely interventionist government , seemingly willing to do whatever it takes to save investors from themselves .
This spectacle necessarily raises the question : if the state can intervene to save corporations that took reckless risks in the housing markets , why can't it intervene to prevent millions of Americans from imminent foreclosure ?
By the same token , if $ 85 bn can be made instantly available to buy the insurance giant AIG , why is single - payer health care – which would protect Americans from the predatory practices of health - care insurance companies – seemingly such an unattainable dream ?
And if ever more corporations need taxpayer funds to stay afloat , why can't taxpayers make demands in return – like caps on executive pay , and a guarantee against more job losses ?
Now that it 's clear that governments can indeed act in times of crises , it will become much harder for them to plead powerlessness in the future .
Another potential shift has to do with market hopes for future privatisations .
For years , the global investment banks have been lobbying politicians for two new markets : one that would come from privatising public pensions and the other that would come from a new wave of privatised or partially privatised roads , bridges and water systems .
Both of these dreams have just become much harder to sell : Americans are in no mood to trust more of their individual and collective assets to the reckless gamblers on Wall Street , especially because it seems more than likely that taxpayers will have to pay to buy back their own assets when the next bubble bursts .
With the World Trade Organisation talks off the rails , this crisis could also be a catalyst for a radically alternative approach to regulating world markets and financial systems .
Already , we are seeing a move towards " food sovereignty " in the developing world , rather than leaving access to food to the whims of commodity traders .
The time may finally have come for ideas like taxing trading , which would slow speculative investment , as well as other global capital controls .
And now that nationalisation is not a dirty word , the oil and gas companies should watch out : someone needs to pay for the shift to a greener future , and it makes most sense for the bulk of the funds to come from the highly profitable sector that is most responsible for our climate crisis .
It certainly makes more sense than creating another dangerous bubble in carbon trading .
But the crisis we are seeing calls for even deeper changes than that .
The reason these junk loans were allowed to proliferate was not just because the regulators did n't understand the risk .
It is because we have an economic system that measures our collective health based exclusively on GDP growth .
So long as the junk loans were fuelling economic growth , our governments actively supported them .
So what is really being called into question by the crisis is the unquestioned commitment to growth at all costs .
Where this crisis should lead us is to a radically different way for our societies to measure health and progress .
None of this , however , will happen without huge public pressure placed on politicians in this key period .
And not polite lobbying but a return to the streets and the kind of direct action that ushered in the New Deal in the 1930s .
Without it , there will be superficial changes and a return , as quickly as possible , to business as usual .
A few months ago , I signed up for the mailing list of a site that has the chutzpah to call itself “ Real Magic Spells “ .
Practically every single day since , I ’ve gotten a highly entertaining e-mail from the site ’s proprietor , one Frank Stevens , who endlessly boasts about how he ’s the real deal , how his voodoo spells really work ( unlike all the other fraudulent sites out there ) , how much labor and danger he had to go through to learn this , how the powerful elders of voodoo magic are furious with him for revealing their deepest secrets , and so on .
His offer to teach the world to cast genuine black magic spells is complete nonsense , of course , and I ’m sure he knows that quite well .
But if he ever wants to consider an alternative career , I ’d bet he could make a good living as a screenwriter or a fantasy novelist .
Here ’s an excerpt from one of his letters , which begins with the subject : “ Lift a Car with One Arm ! ”
Question : Can we human beings tap into this type of super - human strength on command ?
Answer :
Yes and no .
Yes , we can do seemingly incredible things at will .
Yes , we can improve whatever we are doing – and do so instantly .
Yes , we can make what appear to be quantum leaps forward .
But no , we can not make these leaps unless we learn how to harness the power of mental pictures and ….
Harness the power of magic .

* Bonus 7 : Horse ’s Healing Spell .
This healing spell regularly performs miracles .
Another e-mail along the same lines claims that , if “ you want $ 500 for that new air conditioner , ” you can perform the “ Financial Spell ” and “ proceed to find $ 500 in 3 minutes flat ” .
I have to admit I ’m curious .
Plenty of magic believers claim they can acquire wealth supernaturally , but even so , the claim is usually that it arrives through mundane means in due time .
But in three minutes ?
How does this work ?
Do bags of money just materialize next to you , or do they drop from the sky on command ?
( Also , do “ Voodoo Defense ” and the “ Revenge Spell ” cancel each other out ?
What happens if one person performs one and the target performs the other ? )
As usual , there are dismissive words for the skeptics :
The main reason people do not test their belief in magic is because they are afraid that it is NOT real .
OR …
They are afraid that it is real and that they will have to give up their excuses for failure .
Are you brave enough to take the power of real magic and make it your own ?
One might think Mr. Stevens is going out on a limb by making such specific and testable claims about his supposed magical powers , but I assume the risk is small .
There will always be those who think that the confidence with which a claim is advanced is a reliable guide to its truth .
And those who deeply invest their identity in any kind of supernaturalism will always find excuses and rationalizations for the method ’s failure – “ it was my fault for not believing enough ” is a perenially common one .
To take advantage of a promised refund in the event of failure would be admitting to themselves that what they trusted and believed in is not real .
Most fervent believers would rather give up a few dollars than face that upsetting truth .
No surprise , there are plenty of con artists who make a handsome living by skimming off the top of that tendency .
Will the bacon sarnie ever seem the same again ?
The McDonald sandwich - named after its creator Scott McDonald , the chef at London department store Selfridges - is said to be the world 's most expensive .

There have been at least five advance orders placed for the 21 oz ( 595g ) meal .
If you are a food lover , this represents great value for money

The ingredients of the sandwich are : Wagyu beef , fresh lobe foie gras , black truffle mayonnaise , brie de meaux , rocket , red pepper and mustard confit and English plum tomatoes .
