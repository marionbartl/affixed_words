Kevin Rudd has been admitted to hospital for an operation to have his gall bladder removed but has promised to campaign to help Julia Gillard when he is released .
Mr Rudd 's office released a statement this afternoon saying the former prime minister would be happy , upon his release , not just to campaign in his seat of Griffith but across Australia to help Ms Gillard .
Mr Rudd will have the operation later today , the statement says .
" Mr Rudd 's doctors advise he is likely to be in hospital for a couple of days before returning home , " it says .

When the first Penguin paperbacks appeared they cost just sixpence – the price of a packet of cigarettes – and were hardly intended to be enduring items .
But as the publisher celebrates its 75th birthday , Penguin titles are not only among the most recognisable in literature but also a magnet for collectors .
Penguin was launched on 30 July 1935 after publisher Allen Lane , travelling home from a weekend visiting Agatha Christie in Devon , was appalled by the lack of cheap but good quality contemporary fiction available at Exeter station .
He came up with the concept of the Penguin paperback , bringing out a host of the colour - coded titles that summer ( orange for fiction , blue for biography , green for crime ) , with works by Ernest Hemingway , André Maurois and Christie herself part of the launch list .
" Allen Lane did n't get much wrong [ but ] he thought Penguins would be ephemeral , disposable objects , " said Steve Hare , owner of about 15,000 Penguins – he believes he has the largest collection in private hands in the world – and a trustee of the Penguin Collectors Society , which numbers 500 members today .
Hare owns the first 2,000 Penguins published , and is " most of the way through the third thousand , but there are some which are very difficult to obtain " , particularly some titles published during the war .
" The great thing about them was that the economics of them meant that it only worked with huge numbers at cheap prices , so most of them are still around , " said Hare .
" But there are some great rarities , and it is not unknown for particularly rare copies to fetch around £ 500 . "
He points to one " classic rarity " , Biggles Flies Again , which is " almost impossible to find " , and to the " hugely rare " titles sent out to prisoners of war , such as Adrian Bell 's The Cherry Tree and HG Wells 's A Short History of the World .
But no one " collects [ Penguins ] because they 're valuable , or to get rich " , Hare says .
An orange - striped 1937 first edition of HE Bates 's The Poacher , numbered 83 in the main series , might sell for £ 5 to £ 8 , depending on condition ; a 1935 first edition of The Informer by Liam O'Flaherty – 17 in the main series –could make £ 6 .
The sheer range of Penguin titles means there are many niches to covet .
James Pardey , another member of the Penguin Collectors Society , has more than 400 science fiction titles , acquired for between £ 1 and £ 4 each .
A lover of modern art , he was drawn in after coming across a 1960s science fiction title with a Paul Klee painting on the cover and discovering it was part of a series with covers by contemporary painters .
His most prized possession is a 1976 John Wyndham boxed set with a slip - case depicting the author metamorphosing into a leaf .
" It is obviously inspired by Magritte 's leaf paintings from the late 1940s but it made Wyndham look morbidly ill [ he had in fact died seven years earlier ] and his brother was deeply upset by it , " said Pardey .
" The latter wrote to Penguin and I guess they withdrew the set because it is virtually impossible to find today .
I only acquired a copy very recently . "
Hare 's collection – 45 years in the making – has spilled out of his house into a garden shed and the attic , and keeps on growing as Penguin continues to publish titles he wants to include .
He estimates the publisher has released " at least " 100,000 editions .
" Penguin went through a fairly sorry time in the 1980s in terms of design but now they 've got a couple of really good art directors , turning out books which are collectible objects , such as the Great Ideas series .
Curse Penguin for still bringing out books . "
Celebrations for today 's 75th anniversary , taking place at Penguin 's offshoots around the world , are only likely to add to his woes .
Penguin US has asked tattooists to reinterpret the covers of six classic titles – from JM Coetzee 's Waiting for the Barbarians to Martin Amis 's Money – to mark the birthday year , while in the UK the publisher has chosen the novels it believes shaped Britain from the 1950s to the 1980s , bringing them out as the Penguin Decades series .
The Penguin Collectors Society , launched 40 years ago , is keen to reach out to a new generation of book collectors .
" We 're an educational charity , not a bunch of sad anoraks , " said Hare . " [ We 're ] not simply about collecting , but for anyone interested in graphic design , publishing history , illustration , and the joys and pleasures of the physical book . "

( AP ) -- Scientists are reporting early signs that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is altering the marine food web by killing or tainting some creatures and spurring the growth of others more suited to a fouled environment .
Near the spill site , researchers have documented a massive die - off of pyrosomes - cucumber - shaped , gelatinous organisms fed on by endangered sea turtles .
Along the coast , droplets of oil are being found inside the shells of young crabs that are a mainstay in the diet of fish , turtles and shorebirds .
And at the base of the food web , tiny organisms that consume oil and gas are proliferating .
If such impacts continue , the scientists warn of a grim reshuffling of sealife that could over time cascade through the ecosystem and imperil the region 's multibillion - dollar fishing industry .
Federal wildlife officials say the impacts are not irreversible , and no tainted seafood has yet been found .
But Rep. Ed Markey , D - Mass. , who chairs a House committee investigating the spill , warned Tuesday that the problem is just unfolding and toxic oil could be entering seafood stocks as predators eat contaminated marine life .
" You change the base of the food web , it 's going to ripple through the entire food web , " said marine scientist Rob Condon , who found oil - loving bacteria off the Alabama coastline , more than 90 miles from BP 's collapsed Deepwater Horizon drill rig .
" Ultimately it 's going to impact fishing and introduce a lot of contaminants into the food web . "
The food web is the fundamental fabric of life in the Gulf .
Once referred to as the food chain , the updated term reflects the cyclical nature of a process in which even the largest predator becomes a food source as it dies and decomposes .
What has emerged from research done to date are snapshots of disruption across a swath of the northern Gulf of Mexico .
It stretches from the 5,000 - feet deep waters at the spill site to the continental shelf off Alabama and the shallow coastal marshes of Louisiana .
Much of the spill - estimated at up to 176 million gallons of oil and almost 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas - was broken into small droplets by chemical dispersants at the site of the leaking well head .
That reduced the direct impact to the shoreline and kept much of the oil and natural gas suspended in the water .
But immature crabs born offshore are suspected to be bringing that oil - tucked into their shells - into coastal estuaries from Pensacola , Fla. , to Galveston , Texas .
Oil being carried by small organisms for long distances means the spill 's effects could be wider than previously suspected , said Tulane professor Caz Taylor .
Chemical oceanographer John Kessler from Texas A&M University and geochemist David Valentine from the University of California - Santa Barbara recently spent about two weeks sampling the waters in a six - mile radius around the BP - operated Deepwater Horizon rig .
More than 3,000 feet below the surface , they found natural gas levels have reached about 100,000 times normal , Kessler said .
Already those concentrations are pushing down oxygen levels as the gas gets broken down by bacteria , Kessler and Valentine said .
When oxygen levels drop low enough , the breakdown of oil and gas grinds to a halt and most life can't be sustained .
The researchers also found dead pyrosomes covering the Gulf 's surface in and around the spill site .
" There were thousands of these guys dead on the surface , just a mass eradication of them , " Kessler said .
Scientists said they believe the pyrosomes - six inches to a foot in length - have been killed by the toxins in the oil because there have no other explanation , though they plan further testing .
The researchers say the dead creatures probably are floating to the surface rather than sinking because they have absorbed gas bubbles as they filtered water for food .
The death of pyrosomes could set off a ripple effect .
One species that could be directly affected by what is happening to the pyrosomes would be sea turtles , said Laurence Madin , a research director at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Cape Cod , Mass .
Some larger fish , such as tuna , may also feed on pyrosomes .
" If the pyrosomes are dying because they 've got hydrocarbons in their tissues and then they 're getting eaten by turtles , it 's going to get into the turtles , " said Madin .
It was uncertain whether that would kill or sicken the turtles .
The BP spill also is altering the food web by providing vast food for bacteria that consume oil and gas , allowing them to flourish .
At the same time , the surface slick is blocking sunlight needed to sustain plant - like phytoplankton , which under normal circumstances would be at the base of the food web .
Phytoplankton are food for small bait fish such as menhaden , and a decline in those fish could reduce tuna , red snapper and other populations important to the Gulf 's fishing industries , said Condon , a researcher with Alabama 's Dauphin Island Sea Lab .
Seafood safety tests on hundreds of fish , shrimp and other marine life that could make it into the food supply so far have turned up negative for dangerous oil contamination .
Assuming the BP gusher is stopped and the cleanup successful , government and fishing industry scientists said the Gulf still could rebound to a healthy condition .
Ron Luken , chief scientist for Omega Protein , a Houston - based company that harvests menhaden to extract fish oil , says most adult fish could avoid the spill by swimming to areas untainted by crude .
Young fish and other small creatures already in those clean waters could later repopulate the impacted areas .
" I do n't think anybody has documented wholesale changes , " said Steve Murawski , chief scientist for the National Marine Fisheries Service .
" If that actually occurs , that has a potentially great ramification for life at the higher end of the food web . "

Since the end of the Cold War , unconditional American support for military dictators has diminished and democracy promotion has taken center stage in US foreign policy , making putsches less acceptable .
Militaries also have had to adapt to a world where foreign investment has made the image of a government more important and new forms of communication have made it harder to simply install a servile prime minister and crack down on the populace .
Instead , militaries today find it is easier to function as kingmakers rather than kings , while still maintaining the fiction that the armed forces are neutral in politics .
The armed forces walk this fine line by using their influence , in the background , to keep governments in power or topple them .
At other times , the military uses its expertise in handling dangerous security threats like drug trafficking or terrorism to build up its power again .
Now military leaders are increasingly controlling governments from behind the scenes .
From 1950 to 1990 , there were more than 100 coups or coup attempts worldwide .
Since the 1990s , however , violent military takeovers have dropped in number , and there have only been eight coups since 2005 .
The Mexican military ’s quiet power grab is emblematic of a new and disturbing trend throughout the developing world .
In the past , when the military took control , it was obvious .
The armed forces claimed the entire government , forced out the president or the prime minister , and then either ran the country themselves or appointed a servile leader .
In this way , General Alvaro Obregón used the Mexican military to oust president Venustiano Carranza at the end of the Mexican revolution .
Throughout the 20th century , Mexico ’s neighbors , from Guatemala to Chile to Argentina , experienced bloody coups as military leaders took control of the government by force .
During the Cold War , in fact , the idea of military men running governments became almost commonplace , from Idi Amin in Uganda to Zia ul - Haq in Pakistan .
In several Mexican states , in fact , the military essentially commands the area , dominating law enforcement and other civilian institutions .
The Mexican armed forces now contain nearly 260,000 troops , an enormous leap from just 150,000 men in uniform in 1990 .
Military personnel now occupy hundreds of positions traditionally held by civilian personnel , especially those in law enforcement .
“ The military is becoming the supreme authority — in some cases the only authority — in parts of some states , ” Mexican political analyst Denise Dresser told the Senate Judiciary Committee last year .
Over the past two decades , Mexico has been touted as a democratic success story .
After decades of single - party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party , known as PRI , the country developed vibrant political contests , leading to the landmark election of several non-PRI presidents .
But Mexico ’s political system has also gone backwards in one key area : the role of its military .
As the Latin American drug trade has blossomed and its neighbors have become less stable , the military has stepped in , and used its leverage to control an ever - widening sphere of the civilian political system .
Thailand was hardly unique .
In next - door Burma , the ruling junta , which seems to manage most of the economy , has essentially run a once - promising country into the ground , according to a study by Sean Turnell of Macquarie University in Australia .
Indeed , as capital has become more globalized , major developing nations have become more dependent on trade , foreign investment , and tourism , and need far more sophisticated economic management than a few generals can provide .
Over the past three decades , developing regions like East Asia and Latin America have enacted a range of free trade deals , from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - China agreement to the Mercosur trade deal in South America , all of which have had the effect of liberalizing trade among developing nations .
After a wave of anti-Thaksin protests by elites in Bangkok in 2006 , the Thai military took over , forcing Thaksin out .
But the army soon ran into setbacks .
Its installed prime minister , a former general , appeared to have little idea how to manage Thailand ’s complex and globalized economy .
It threatened capital controls , which scared off foreign investors and precipitated a run on the stock market .
It also failed to enact policies to boost Thailand ’s global competitiveness , even as neighboring countries like Vietnam were attracting more investment .
Two years after the coup , Thailand ’s top military leader at the time , Supreme Commander General Boonsrang Niumpradit , told reporters , “ Under the current situation , problems in the country are too complex to be easily tackled by a coup . ”
For decades , Thailand ’s military played politics the old - fashioned way :
When it wanted to run the government , it just took over .
Between 1932 , the end of Thailand ’s absolute monarchy , and today , the country has witnessed 18 coups or attempted coups .
But after the last coup , which deposed the populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006 , the army realized the old days were gone for good .
It ’s a dangerous kind of power .
Armies can commit abuses virtually unpunished , dragging down developing democracies that seemed to be beyond the era of military influence .
And , by presenting themselves as the only institutions with long - term stability — even as they simultaneously undermine that very stability — the new generation of military men undermine civilian leaders in another way :
They make themselves indispensable to foreign partners like the United States .
Call it military rule 2.0 .
And as a result , in many developing countries the military is more powerful than it has been in years .
Thailand , where the military once seemed to have retreated to the barracks , now finds the armed forces playing a critical role in the current political standoff .
In Pakistan , which also appeared headed toward democracy a decade ago , the military has returned to its role as the central power base .
From Mexico to Peru to Honduras , Latin America has over the past five years witnessed a weakening of civilian rule over the military , as the armed forces act with increasing impunity .
From Mexico to Peru to the Philippines , armies have learned to portray themselves to beleaguered civilian leaders as the only chance to defeat the security challenges — so long as the government agrees to the military ’s demands for greater funding , more autonomy , and a larger role in politics .
In Pakistan , the armed forces last year grudgingly launched an offensive into Waziristan , an Islamist hotbed .
And in so doing the army gained enough clout to sandbag several of Zardari ’s major objectives , including better ties to India , according to Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid .
During the Cold War , Washington was willing to sanction outright coups by military men who ( at least theoretically ) shared America ’s anticommunist stance .
Yet US policies often still aid militaries that seek more control of their governments .
With Pakistan , the Obama administration , while rhetorically supporting the government of President Asif Ali Zardari — Obama ’s envoy to Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , last year told Congress the White House “ unambiguously ” backs Zardari — has in reality conducted much of the relationship through Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Kayani , according to press reports in both the United States and Pakistan .
In so doing , the White House seems to have bought into the Pakistani army ’s line that civilian governments are inherently unstable and the armed forces alone can provide the continuity Washington needs .
Of course , militaries can still effectively rule outright small , very poor nations like tiny Guinea Bissau in West Africa , which weathered a coup in early April , since these countries are less dependent on foreign capital and less connected to the global economy .
The list of successful and lasting coups over the past decade consists mostly of small and poor African states , such as Mauritania , the Central African Republic , and Guinea .
For example , following an attempted coup in Venezuela in 2002 , supporters of Hugo Chavez were able to quickly link up and rally for him , helping install him back in power within 48 hours .
And , after a military intervention in Bangladesh in early 2007 , many private organizations that did not even exist during previous generations of military rule mobilized to fight the army takeover .
Even in Burma , one of the most isolated countries in the world , local journalists in 2007 were able to get images of the military crackdown on monks ’
“ Saffron Revolution ” out to international media outlets .
Compared to the 1960s or 1970s , too , militaries in developing countries can no longer effectively control the media , nongovernmental organizations , unions , or other avenues of dissent .
New communications technology , including social networking , cellphones , and the Internet , allow the media in most countries to get around censorship ; a flowering of nongovernmental organizations , many with links to the West , are much harder to control than the small number of nonprofits in developing countries in the 1960s or 1970s .
In other cases , militaries have learned that by uniting behind a certain politician , or by threatening to withhold their backing for a government without actually staging a coup , they can control civilian leaders .
For example , in Nigeria , according to a study by John Campbell of the Council on Foreign Relations , a group of senior generals recently played a major role in maneuvering into power vice president Goodluck Jonathan , who took over for the ailing president Umaru Yar’adua .
( Yar ’adua died May 5 . )
Similarly , because drug trafficking is a priority in US - Mexican relations , much of the relationship between the United States and Mexico has been built through their defense establishments .
A majority of the $ 1.4 billion approved by Congress as part of the Merida Initiative will go to equipment and funding for the Mexican military .
Coupled with a close training relationship between the militaries and frequent visits to Mexico by top US military officials , this aid gives the Mexican military even more leverage over civilian institutions .
The return of the men in green has many dangerous implications .
In its latest report on the state of global freedom , monitoring group Freedom House noted that freedom and human rights declined in 2009 , marking four years in a row of setbacks , the longest continuous slide in 40 years — and the result , in part , of weakening civilian control of militaries .
And over the past decade , military spending worldwide has grown by over 45 percent , according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , a sign of the renewed clout of armed forces .
This decline of democracy is one of the most unsettling trends in the world today .
Wielding the power to make or break governments , armed forces also become virtually immune to criticism or critical investigations , allowing them to perpetrate abuses .
In Thailand , the military in the winter of 2008 - 9 reportedly intercepted rickety boats carrying refugees from neighboring Burma , and then pushed many of these desperate men and women back to sea , where they died .
No punishments were meted out .
In perhaps the most egregious example , human rights groups accuse the Mexican military of disappearances , torturing suspects with electric shocks , and widespread extrajudicial killings .
A recent report by Amnesty International chronicled a litany of human rights abuses by the security forces , conducted in an environment where , as one Amnesty interviewee says , “ No one will do anything to us because we ’re soldiers . ”
Worse , behind - the - scenes military rule stunts the growth of other institutions that might be able to handle security threats more effectively .
In Mexico , the militarization of the drug fight has not delivered many victories — Ciudad Juarez is now the murder capital of the world , and a blue ribbon panel led by former Latin American leaders last year reported that the drug war is a “ failed war ” — and that the militarization has marginalized the Mexican police and courts , which desperately need to be modernized , not ignored .
The return of military influence is not inevitable .
In countries like Turkey and Indonesia , popular and politically savvy civilian leaders have drawn upon their popular appeal , and popular suspicion of the armed forces , to create laws restraining the armed forces and to finally convince some military officers that they are no longer needed as a stabilizing force in politics .
Not coincidentally , Indonesia now has leapfrogged countries like Thailand to become the most vibrant democracy in Southeast Asia , while Turkey has in the past decade strengthened its democracy and become a major political player in its region .
For now , though , Indonesia and Turkey remain very much the exception .

He ’s still on Britain ’s least - wanted list .
Talk radio host Michael Savage has waged a vigorous fight against the British government , hoping to have his name removed from a list of 16 “ undesirables ” banned from the country on May 5 , 2009 , by then British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
The list included Islamist terrorists , neo -Nazis and Russian gang members — and Mr. Savage says he ’s still on the new version , despite his efforts to persuade British officials that his inclusion is unwarranted and unfair .
All governments are essentially amoral , ” he told The Washington Times on Monday .
“ I had hopes but did not expect this ‘ new ’ UK government to restore sanity to Britain .
They are still pandering to the Muslim masses .
To continue to martyr me by including me on a list of known murderers and terrorists is bad enough but for the U.S. and Western media which considers itself ‘ progressive ’ to continue to ignore this outrage against freedom of speech is indicative that the media and governments are one and the same .
This includes so - called conservatives .
Has freedom of the press become greed - om of the press ? ” he concluded .
The British government described Mr. Savage as a “ controversial daily radio host .
Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behavior by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence . ”
Prime Minister David Cameron has informed Mr. Savage that his name will remain on the banned list unless he “ repudiates ” currently unspecified broadcast statements that Britain “ deemed a threat to public security . ”
Mr. Savage , who is heard by about 8 million listeners a week , sued Ms. Smith and the Home Office for defamation , attempted to enlist the help of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , and devoted many hours of airtime to freedom of speech issues and the “ arbitrary and capricious ” nature of the list itself .
His book “ Banned in Britain : Beating the Liberal Blacklist , ” published in late 2009 , presents the case that his name was included on the roster of public enemies in order to “ balance ” the list — which was primarily composed of Muslims .
The talk radio host is also irked by the fact that Britain has issued an eight - page guide to officials that recommends they not use such words as “ Islamist , ” “ jihadi ” and “ fundamentalist , ” and avoid making “ explicit ” links between Muslims and terrorism .

[ For full coverage of the World People 's Conference on Climate Change , including the full text of the documents , click HERE . ]
By Daniel Tanuro and Sandra Invernizzi
June 2010 -- International Viewpoint --
The World People 's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth , which met in Cochabamba ( Bolivia ) from April 20 - 22 , 2010 , at the invitation of Bolivia 's President Evo Morales , was an enormous success .
Thirty - thousand participants discussed for several days the various facets of the climate crisis and adopted a series of very interesting documents , from a resolutely anti-capitalist standpoint .
The " People 's Agreement " , the final declaration of the summit [ 1 ] , which synthesises this work , constitutes an important advance on the road of a convergence of social and environmental struggles from an anti-productivist and internationalist point of view .
As ecosocialist militants , we can only express our satisfaction .
At the same time , we think it is necessary to begin a fraternal debate on some lacunae in the document , which ought to be surmounted in the future , on the occasion of a future meeting of this type .
Following the declarations of Evo Morales and Venezuella 's President Hugo Chavez at the United Nations Summit , in December in Copenhagen , the Final Declaration of the conference clearly points to the capitalist origin of the deregulation of the climate that is taking place .
The document denounces governments which discuss climate change as a simple question of temperature , as if the problem could be settled without calling into question the socioeconomic system responsible for it .
It underlines the complete incompatibility between a model based on the logic of competition , therefore of unlimited growth , on the one hand , and on the other the pressing need to respect the limits of the ecosystems and their rhythms :
the capitalist system has imposed on us a logic of competition , … and of unlimited growth .
This mode of production and consumption seeks profit without limits , by separating human beings from nature , by establishing a logic of domination over nature , by converting everything into commodities : water , land , the human genome , ancestral cultures , biodiversity , justice , ethics , the rights of the people , death and life themselves .
After having stigmatised the transformation of natural resources and human beings into commodities , the declaration denounces imperialist colonisation , then concludes logically that it would be “ irresponsible to leave in the hands of the market the care ( cuidado ) and protection of humankind and of our Mother Earth ” .
This strategic positioning is then translated into a series of concrete demands which link the ecological and the social : against the market in carbon , the REDD mechanism [ 2 ] (+ and ++ ) , biofuels , GMOs , intellectual property laws on living organisms , free - trade treaties ; for a world fund for adaptation and funds for clean technologies ; for water to be recognised as a fundamental human right ; for the respect of the rights of Indigenous peoples , for support for peasant agriculture …
Uncovering the cynicism of governments which do not envisage doing anything , while 100 million people could become “ climatic refugees ” in the next decades , the document demands the end of the restrictive and repressive immigration policies of Western countries , and demands that the funds assigned to military budgets be invested in the protection of the climate .
It also denounces the flexible mechanisms which , under cover of technology transfers , actually aim at allowing the big companies of the North to continue to pollute , while making superprofits on the market in carbon .
Faced with this new form of colonial exploitation , the declaration affirms that “ knowledge is universal and can in no case be an object of private property and private use ” .
Consequently it argues for the sharing of technologies and their development in the service of " living well " .
Finally , the document proposes concretely the installation of a sovereign international legal framework , equitably run by the populations of the world , whose goal would be to put an end to aberrations concerning the overexploitation of resources , environmental irresponsibility and inhuman treatment of migrant populations .
Oil , gas and coal oligarchies ?
Although this anti-capitalist position is remarkable , we must however criticise certain lacunae .
The most striking point is that the oil , gas and coal oligarchies , as well as the big multinationals of the energy sector , are not accused of anything , nor even mentioned , whereas their responsibility for climate change is overwhelming .
The document goes into detail on the harmful role of agribusiness in the degradation of the climate , but the word “ oil ” appears only once in the declaration , and even then only within the framework of the demand for non-exploitation of the deposits located in forest zones , in the name of the protection of the forests and the rights of Indigenous people ( which is a correct and legitimate but completely insufficient demand ) .
The words “ coal ” and “ natural gas ” are simply not mentioned .
The expression “ renewable energies ” is also absent .
Moreover , the document contains neither rejection of nuclear power nor advice to be prudent about the possible risks of geological storage of CO2 …
Putting all that together , we cannot avoid having the impression that the People 's Agreement overlooks the struggle against the capitalist energy lobbies and the sectors linked to it ( cars , petrochemicals , shipbuilding , the aeronautics industry , transport … ) , whereas this is obviously the key question in the framework of an anti-capitalist strategy of stabilisation of the climate .
We can also see the astonishing contrast between this absence and the radical nature of the objective of reduction in greenhouse gases that is advocated by the agreement .
It proposes , without touching on the question of the choice of energy resources , to commit itself to a reduction on a much greater scale than the most radical of the scenarios of the IPCC : 300 CO2 equivalents ppm , not to exceed 1 °C of rise in temperature compared to the preindustrial era .
However , to reach this level of stabilisation , it is necessary to follow a series of stages that are impossible to circumvent , which relate mainly to the energy sector and the question of resources :
the obligation to abandon fossil energy in the short term ;
the need to plan the replacement of fossil energy by renewable energy ;
the need to reduce the overall production and transport of raw materials so that this replacement is possible in practice ;
to do all of the above while bearing in mind the risk of obstructing the satisfaction of the legitimate needs of the 3 billion human beings who lack the essentials of life ;
to solve this problem in a human way , it is necessary and urgent to make energy common property , so that investments can be carried out according to needs and independently of costs , without social conflict ;
finally , putting energy under social ownership must be coupled with a redistribution of wealth , in order to mobilise the resources that are essential for the energy transition .
Of all that , the People 's Agreement says nothing .
However , without these radical measures , it will be quite simply impossible to stabilise the climate on the best possible level , not to mention satisfy the legitimate rights of the global South with a development centred on the needs of the populations .
Limit of a 1 °C rise ?
We can understand that the ultra-radical objective of 300 ppm CO2 equivalent is put forward with the aim of limiting to the maximum the injustice of climate change for the populations which do not have any responsibility for the damage done .
But unfortunately truth requires us to say that the limit of a 1 °C rise can no longer be attained : the temperature has increased by 0.8 °C since 1850 , an additional rise of 0.6°C is “ in the pipeline ” ( delayed only by thermal inertia from the oceans ) and every year we add 2 to 3 ppm CO2 to the atmosphere …
In fact , even a rise of 2 °C can probably no longer be avoided .
The atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases ( all such gases ) is currently higher than 460 ppm CO2 equivalent .
The most radical of the stabilisation scenarios mentioned in the fourth report of the IPCC estimates that there will be a concentration of between 445 and 490 ppm in 2050 , corresponding to a rise in temperature of between 2 and 2.4°C and to a rise of the level of the oceans of between 0.4 and 1.4 m ( on balance ) .
We could possibly return one day to 300 ppm , and a difference in temperature of 1 °C compared to the preindustrial era , as the declaration demands , but certainly not in the course of this century : that will demand a very long - term effort .
This problem is related to that of the distribution of effort between the developed countries and the rest of the world .
As is known , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCC ) urges taking account of the fact that the responsibility for global warming is common but differentiated .
The respect of this principle is obviously crucial for the countries of the global South , but the contradiction is that the more drastic the objective of stabilisation is , the more it is necessary that the developing countries take part in the effort .
Thus the most radical scenario of the IPCC implies that the developed countries reduce their emissions by between 80 and 95 per cent between now and 2050 ( including a reduction of between 25 and 40 per cent by 2020 ) , which means , roughly speaking , that they have 40 years to dispense with fossil fuels and to reduce by half their final consumption of energy .
In the name of the precaution principle , it is only logical and right to demand that the global North make at least 40 per cent of reduction by 2020 and 95 per cent by 2050 , not counting the purchases of carbon credits .
But two remarks need to be made : 1 ) in this scenario , the effort of the countries of the global South is not negligible , since their emissions should differ by between 15 and 30 per cent compared to the scenario of reference ; 2 ) to go further , the countries of the global North would need to have recourse to dangerous and socially doubtful technologies such as clean coal , biofuels and nuclear power … without even being certain that that would be enough .
So there is something unrealistic about the People 's Agreement when it demands that the countries of the North not only go further than the most radical scenario of the IPCC , but are furthermore the only ones who have to make an effort .
A precise figure is proposed : 50 per cent reduction in the developed capitalist countries between now and 2017 .
Even though we understand and share the indignation of the People 's Agreement concerning the governments of these countries , we cannot remain silent on the exaggerated nature of this scenario .
For it to be practicable , it would in fact be necessary for an anti-productivist socialist revolution to triumph tomorrow , simultaneously in all the developed capitalist countries ( and even then ! ) .
This possibility is unfortunately not very probable , so that the question is : how do we address the working class of global North so that it becomes aware of its crucial responsibility for the rescue of the climate ?
United struggle
To this question , the People 's Agreement does not answer in a convincing way .
The reason for this is that it establishes a dichotomy between the exploiting North and the exploited South , and thus fails to grasp the urgency of unifying the struggles of the exploited in the “ developed ” and “ developing ” countries .
In the case of the global South , the way in which the agreement proposes to concretise the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities tends to ignore the necessary criticism of the productivist development strategies of certain ruling classes , such as those of Brazil , China or … Venezuela , for example , as a large oil producer .
This “ third - worldist ” manner of tackling the question is likely to provoke a reaction of rejection among the exploited of the North , who fear for their jobs or have already lost them because of the economic crisis .
However , the fight for the climate will not progress if the exploited of all countries do not fight in a unified way .
Rather than launching the not very realistic figure of 50 per cent of reduction by 2017 , this unity could be encouraged by pointing out that the countries of the global South are already committed to doing almost the utmost of what is necessary to stabilise the climate , while the countries of the global North are making less than half of the effort which is assigned to them .
According to the IPCC , indeed , the developing countries should take measures so that their emissions in 2020 are between 15 and 30 per cent below “ business as usual ” projections .
However , we see from the 120 climate plans communicated to the secretariat of the UNFCC in the framework of the " Copenhagen Accord " that the commitments of the South are equivalent to an average difference of 25 per cent ( almost the maximum , therefore ) .
On the other hand , the climate plans communicated by the developed countries scarcely correspond to a reduction in emissions of 15 per cent compared to 1990 , whereas the IPCC proposes for them a range of between 25 and 40 per cent .
So we are not in a situation where the global South needs to continue not to make any effort , as one might think from the People 's Agreement .
On the contrary , we are in a situation where the global South is making a more than correct share of the effort and where the global North is not doing anything , although it is the North that is responsible historically !
This reality provides a solid justification of the need for a drastic reduction in the emissions of the developed capitalist countries .
Moreover , it cuts the grass from under the feet of all the demagogues who want to stir up the victims of the crisis in the North by making scapegoats of the peoples of the South .
Mother Earth ?
Some progressive people who supported in general the approach taken by the World People 's Conference expressed reservations concerning an approach to climate justice based on the rights of Mother Earth .
On reading the People 's Agreement , however , we have to recognise that this conception of Mother Earth as the source of all life and of its right to exist in a balanced way introduces a completely new and interesting approach to “ the right to live in a healthy environment ” .
Without necessarily adhering to the spiritual or mystical conception that the Indigenous populations of Latin America have of their relationship with Pachamama , one can only note that , over and above the different cultural references , the very clear points that the People 's Agreement develops concerning international policies of commoditisation and the plundering of nature make it possible for completely different cultures to come together around a common objective : to push back the logic of profit and exploitation which is endangering the right of people to live in a stable climatic situation .
As regards the environmental crisis , it is undeniable that the cosmological vision of Indigenous people , based on the idea that matter and energy circulate unceasingly within nature considered as a whole , constitutes an invaluable contribution , which must be appreciated at its true value .
But , however valid it is , this dynamic vision of the interrelationships between humanity and the rest of nature cannot replace precise demands such as the pure and simple expropriation of the monopolies , initially in the energy sector .
Without this expropriation , indeed , the respect of the rhythms and cycles of the biosphere will remain a chimera , for the simple reason that it will not be possible to implement radical and internationally equitable policies of energy and productive transition .
From this point of view , the text is in fact at a crossroads between a radical , revolutionary refusal of the capitalist system , on the one hand , and on the other a positioning which is more ambiguous than it seems at first sight , favourable to a “ change that has to be made to the present capitalist system ” .
The World Peoples ' Conference , let us repeat , constitutes a remarkable step forward towards a climatic strategy worthy of the name , i.e. an anti-capitalist strategy .
All the exploited and oppressed of the world are indebted to the Bolivian people who took the initiative for this event , through their elected president .
They are indebted in particular to Indigenous people , who play a leading role by showing that another relation between humanity and nature is possible and necessary .
It is within the framework of this eminently positive assessment that we wish to contribute to a constructive debate .

What is your search engine of choice ?
Google ?
Yahoo ?
Bing ?
Try Twitter .
According to cofounder Biz Stone , who spoke yesterday at the Aspen Ideas Festival , Twitter now reaches some 800 million search queries per day .
That ’s over 24 billion searches per month , more than Bing ( 4.1 billion ) and Yahoo ( 9.4 billion ) combined .
While Stone ’s company is still a long way off from Google , which supports around 88 billion search queries per month , Twitter is quickly catching up .
Since last April , Twitter searches are up 33 % .
To put that in perspective , a study by Nielsen last year concluded that Bing was the fastest - growing search engine in the U.S. after it ballooned over 22 % .
Now it seems
Twitter has taken the title .
And this is something the service has been angling for .
Last month , at the the World Innovation Forum , Stone argued that Twitter is “ not a social network , ” though many people view it as one .
“ That ’s been a myth since the beginning , ” he explained .
“ We ’re much more like an information network or a source of news . ”
With 24 billion search queries a month , perhaps Twitter and Stone are onto something .
Luxury cars worth hundreds of thousands of dirhams can be found gathering dust on roadsides across Dubai , the remnants of the city - state ’s economic boom that was brought to an abrupt halt by the global financial crisis .
The financial crisis forced many companies to slash jobs and those made redundant who had taken advantage of easy credit during the boom found themselves unable to meet car payments ...
Dubai Municipality said 1,476 vehicles were recovered in the year to July 31 , compared to 1,227 during the same period in 2008 ...
... Throughout Dubai there are dust - covered cars with violation notices stuck to the windscreens , warning the owners that their vehicles will be removed in 15 days .
Once removed the municipality stores them at the Al - Qusais scrap yard .
In a sand pit in one affluent Dubai neighbourhood , the Springs , a Land Rover Discovery sits motionless covered in dust with " another one bites the dust " written on a grimy side window ...
... A few miles down the road in another residential district called Al - Barsha , a Porsche Boxster is parked with keys in the ignition .
On the passenger seat are documents for a 144,000 - dirham ( $ 39,200 ) loan taken out at a Dubai bank .
The number of vehicles that have been abandoned in Dubai as become the stuff urban legend , with rumours of thousands of cars being dumped at the airport as debt - laden , high - flying execs flee the emirate after losing their jobs in the global financial crisis ...
There is a " regular astonishing sight " at Dubai 's international airport , says Mark Hollingsworth in ES Magazine : dozens of luxury cars – Mercedes , Porsches , BMWs , etc – abandoned with their keys still in the ignition .
In some cases , notes of apology are taped to the windscreens .
The owners of these vehicles are mainly British expatriates , who have left in a hurry because they faced " crippling debts " as a result of Dubai 's financial meltdown and their own profligate behaviour .
Many of them , says Hollingsworth , have defaulted on loans ; rather than risk arrest and jail , they drove at top speed to the airport where they jumped on the first flight to London .
A few short years ago , Dubai was the epicenter of conspicuous consumption .
Its mammoth hotels , opulent resorts and over - the - top shopping centers represented the manifestation of man 's insatiable hunger for energy .
Today , with a global financial crisis underway and oil prices halved from their highs , even Dubai has fallen on hard times .
As unemployment takes its toll , the number of abandoned vehicles has risen by 20 % .
And if you 're looking for bargains , word has it that prices on used luxury cars dropped 40 % from January to March .
Sony Pictures Animation has picked up rights to the Atari videogame RollerCoaster Tycoon , with Harald Zwart ( The Karate Kid remake ) heading up the development of the project .
According to , Zwart may also direct the film adaptation .
Norbit writers David Ronn and Jay Scherick will script what is envisioned to be a combination of live - action and CGI .
The pair also wrote The Smurfs for Sony , another live - action / CGI mix .
RollerCoaster Tycoon is a series of games where the player gets to design -- no duh -- roller coasters and also manage amusement parks .

For when the Reader monad seems hopelessly clunky
The Reader monad ( also known as the Environment monad ) and implicit parameters are remarkably similar even though the former is the standard repertoire of a working Haskell programmer while the latter is a GHC language extension used sparingly by those who know about it .
Both allow the programmer to code as if they had access to a global environment that can still change at runtime .
However , implicit parameters are remarkably well suited for cases when you would have used a stack of reader transformers .
Unfortunately , unlike many type system extensions , GHC cannot suggest that you enable ImplicitParams because the code you innocently wrote is not valid Haskell98 but would be valid if you enabled this extension .
This post intends to demonstrate one way to discover implicit parameters , with a little nudging .
Reader monad in practice .
The Reader monad is really quite simple : after all , it is isomorphic to ( -> ) r , the only real difference being a newtype .
Because of this , in engineering contexts , it is rarely used as - is ; in particular :
It is used as a transformer , endowing an “ environment ” to whatever application - specific monad you are building , and
It is used with a record type , because an environment of only one primitive value is usually not very interesting .
These choices impose some constraints on how code written for a Reader monad can be used .
In particular , baking in the environment type r of ReaderT r means that your monadic code will not play nicely with some other monadic code ReaderT r2 without some coaxing ; additionally , I ca n’t build up a complicated record type Record { field1 :: Int ; field2 :: String ; field3 :: Bool} incrementally as I find out values of the environment .
I could have my record type be a map of some sort , in which case I could place arbitrarily values in it , but in this case I have no static assurances of what values will or will not be in the map at a given point in time .
Stacked Reader transformers .
To allow ourselves to incrementally build up our environment , one might consider stacking the Reader monad transformers .
Consider the type ReaderT a ( ReaderT b ( ReaderT c IO ) ) ( ) .
If we desugar this into function application , we find a -> ( b -> ( c -> IO ( ) ) ) , which can be further simplified to a -> b -> c -> IO ( ) .
If a , b and c happen to be the same type , we do n’t have any way of distinguishing the different values , except for the location in the list of arguments .
However , instead of writing out the parameters explicitly in our function signature ( which , indeed , we are trying to avoid with the reader monad ) , we find ourselves having to lift ask repeatedly ( zero times for a , once for b and twice for c ) .
Unlike the record with three fields , there is no name for each environment variable : we have to refer to them by using some number of lifts .
Aside .
In fact , this is a De Bruijn index , which Oleg helpfully pointed in out in an email conversation we had after my post about nested loops and continuations .
The number of lifts is the index ( well , the Wikipedia article is 1 - indexed , in which case add one ) which tells us how many reader binding scopes we need to pop out of .
So if I have : runReaderT ( runReaderT ( runReaderT ( lift ask ) c ) b) a \------- outermost / furthest context ( 3 ) ------------/
\--- referenced context ( 2 ; one lift ) -/ \--- inner context ( 1 ) -/ I get the value of b .
This turns out to be wonderful for the lambda - calculus theoreticians ( who are cackling gleefully at trouble - free α- conversion ) , but not so wonderful for software engineers , for whom De Bruijn indexes are equivalent to the famous antipattern , the magic number .
With typeclass tricks , we can get back names to some extent : for example , Dan Piponi renames the transformers with singleton data types or “ tags ” , bringing in the heavy guns of OverlappingInstances in the process .
Oleg uses lexical variables that are typed to the layer they belong to to identify different layers , although such an approach is not really useful for a Reader monad stack , since the point of the Reader monad is not to have to pass any lexical variables around , whether or not they are the actual variables or specially typed variables .
Implicit parameters .
In many ways , implicit parameters are a cheat : while Dan and Oleg ’s approaches leverage existing type - level programming facilities , implicit parameters define a “ global ” namespace ( well known to Lispers as the dynamic scope ) that we can stick variables in , and furthermore it extends the type system so we can express what variables in this namespace any given function call expects to exist ( without needing to use monads , the moxy ! )
Instead of an anonymous environment , we assign the variable a name :
f :: ReaderT r IO a f ' :: ( ? implicit_r :: r ) => IO a
f ' is still monadic , but the monad does n’t express what is in the environment anymore : it ’s entirely upon the type signature to determine if an implicit variable is passed along :
f = print " foobar " >> g 42 -- Environment always passed on f ' = print " foobar " >> g 42 -- Not so clear !
Indeed , g could have just as well been a pure computation :
f ' = print ( g 42 )
However , if the type of is :
g :: IO a
the implicit variable is lost , while if it is :
g :: ( ? implicit_r :: r ) => IO a
the variable is available .
While runReader ( T ) was our method for specifying the environment , we now have a custom let syntax :
runReaderT f value_of_r let ?
implicit_r = value_of_r in f
Besides having ditched our monadic restraints , we can now easily express our incremental environment :
run = let ?implicit_a = a ?implicit_b = b ?implicit_c = c in h h :: ( ?implicit_a :: a , ?implicit_b :: b , ?implicit_c :: c ) => b h = ?implicit_b
You can also use where .
Note that , while this looks deceptively like a normal let binding , it is quite different : you ca n’t mix implicit and normal variable bindings , and if you have similarly named implicit bindings on the right - hand side , they refer to their values outside of the let .
No recursion for you !
( Recall runReaderT : the values that we supply in the second argument are pure variables and not values in the Reader monad , though with >>= you could instrument things that way . )
Good practices .
With monadic structure gone , there are fewer source - level hints on how the monomorphism restriction and polymorphic recursion apply .
Non-polymorphic recursion will compile , and cause unexpected results , such as your implicit parameter not changing when you expect it to .
You can play things relatively safely by making sure you always supply type signatures with all the implicit parameters you are expecting .
I hope to do a follow - up post explaining more carefully what these semantics are , based off of formal description of types in the relevant paper .
The bone - dry wood creaks as the book opens at a page representing the course of the moon , framed by black balls and red crescents .
The manuscript contains 132 pages of Arab astronomy bound in well - worn leather , a 15th - century treasure stored , with similar items , in a cardboard box in a traditional dwelling in Chinguetti .
This historic town , on the Adrar plateau in Mauritania , holds some of the finest collections of old Arabo - Berber books , but now the desert libraries are disappearing .
With a sudden decline in tourism , Mauritania is spending all available resources on security and combating al - Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb .
The government has no time for heritage .
" It 's not been a priority in recent years , " the arts minister , Cissé Mint Cheikh Ould Boide , acknowledges .
Handed down from generation to generation the manuscripts , some of which date from the 10th century , still belong to families and are dispersed around four main centres , Chinguetti , Ouadane , Oulatane and Tichitt .
The towns have been on the Unesco World Heritage list since 1996 .
On the route of pilgrims travelling to Mecca and of caravans loaded with dates and salt serving a vast area from northern Mauritania to Sudan , the towns used to be a major tourist attraction .
But visitors are scarce and the books are being forgotten .
" Until the colonial era they were the only form of reading matter , often consulted and sometimes copied .
But with our modern ways they are increasingly regarded as mere relics , " says Jiyid Ould Abdi , the head of Mauritania 's Scientific Research Institute .
To remedy this situation the government is planning a big event – Nouakchott , Capital of Islamic Art – for 2011 .
It hopes to form an international panel to select 35 projects and attract foreign capital .
The scheme will focus largely on Moorish civilisation , disregarding black Mauritanian culture represented by the Pular , Wolof and Soninke ethnic groups .
The institute , located next to the National Museum in the capital , lacks the resources to protect the manuscripts .
Only a handful have been restored , with the date and author cited on the final page recorded in a database .
The modern laboratory , set up in adjoining premises with help from Italy , is just ticking over .
A technician cautiously gives us a demonstration , placing the book in a glove - box and using a brush to clean each page , a little pump sucking up the desert sand .
Then the manuscript is transferred to a plastic pouch containing no oxygen , and is set aside for three weeks , long enough to kill any bacteria .
A simple carton binding is fitted and the original cover is scanned and returned to its owner .
Out of more than 33,000 ancient Arabic manuscripts identified at the end of the 1990s in Mauritania barely a tenth have reached the museum .
Most of the books are still in the hands of private owners .
" We have tried everything .
We have offered to compensate the families or just look after them [ the books ] with a guarantee of property , but it makes no difference , " Abdi says .
" It is a legacy from their ancestors and an honour to keep them .
Everyone does their best [ storing the books ] in trunks or boxes .
It is storage , not conservation . "
Even a German - sponsored project to record the manuscripts on microfilm ran into opposition .
About 600 km north - east of the capital , in Chinguetti , once a centre of Islamic learning , the Habott family owns one of the finest private libraries , with 1,400 books covering a dozen subjects such as the Qur'an and the Hadith ( the words of the Prophet ) , astronomy , mathematics , geometry , law and grammar .
The oldest tome , written on Chinese paper , dates from the 11th century .
Four generations have watched over the fine collection started by Sidi Ould Mohamed Habott in the 19th century .
Their ancestor travelled by camel to Mecca to find these treasures – " six months there , six months back " – following in the footsteps of the scholars who handed down , exchanged and copied the books in the course of their caravan journeys .
Indeed , this is how Islam took root in Mauritania .
" With neither agriculture nor raw materials , the country coalesced around its culture , " Abdi explains .
" All the scholars had their own library , " wrote the French ethnologist Odette du Puigaudeau in reference to the " leather - bound books brought back from North Africa , Egypt and Syria [ … ] by pilgrims and messengers " .
Every year the Habott family meets to appoint a custodian for the manuscripts .
The library fittings are rudimentary , comprising metal cabinets , archive boxes and large jars of water in the four corners of the room to release some moisture into this sandy world .
Sand is everywhere , a fearsome enemy , surrounding the town and advancing several metres a year .
Across the square it has engulfed the old citadel , leaving only a few walls and a mosque .
In a nearby house Seif Islam , the manager of the local secondary school , watches over another library with about 700 dusty volumes .
" The state has been trying to lay its hands on them for years , " he says .
" Would you part with your hand or your foot ?
It [ the library ] is a part of us . "
Until recently , the desert libraries attracted many visitors , contributing to the development of Chinguetti and its sister cities .
However , since the killing of four French tourists in December 2007 and the kidnapping of other Europeans for which al - Qaida claimed responsibility , visitors have become increasingly rare .
The sandy streets are empty and the shops closed for lack of custom .
On the only paved road from Nouakchott to Akar , an hour from Chinguetti , there is little traffic .
Work is hard to find and young people are leaving for the capital , making the desert seem all the more lonely .

Hosted by Jeff Probst for two seasons each year and showcasing some of the most exotic places on Earth , the television show " Survivor " has garnered quite a fan base as well as several Emmy wins and nominations along with plenty of accolades from the television industry .
The CBS reality game show is produced by Probst along with executive producer Mark Burnett and creator Charlie Parsons .
In 1997 Parsons created the original Survivor , which was a popular Swedish TV series known as " Expedition Robinson . "
The premise of the American version of Survivor is a rather simple one , outwit , outplay and outlast all of the other players in the game .
Survivor takes ordinary people from around the country and divides them into teams , deserting them in some of the most gorgeous yet dangerous locations imaginable .
Challenges ranging from the seemingly simple to the outright complicated must be completed for rewards and for immunity from elimination .
Eventually , one lone survivor remains after the rest are voted out of the game by their peers .
The winner then receives the title of Sole Survivor along with the one million dollar prize .
The elimination process of Survivor is one of the game 's most exciting elements .
Every few days the contestants on the losing team of the most recent challenge meet during a ceremony known as Tribal Council .
There , Probst asks probing questions about things such as the mood around camp , who is in what alliance and how the players are interacting with one another in general .
Although some contestants look forward to Tribal Council , particularly if there is someone the rest of the group desperately wants out of the game , eliminating players always comes with consequences .
After the teams merge into one , players who are voted out become members of the jury , which is the panel ultimately responsible for deciding the game 's winner .
As team challenges become individual ones approximately midway through the game , the contestants play for themselves instead of together for immunity and reward .
Now is when Survivor becomes even more exciting as players work to secure a final spot in the game all while wondering who can be trusted and who can't .
Since it first premiered back on May 31 , 2000 the reality series Survivor has managed to keep its audiences interested with new twists and turns including hidden immunity idols , unexpected team switches and the return of notorious players from the past .
Survivor is a Game Show , Reality series that is currently running and has 40 seasons ( 611 episodes ) .
The series first aired on May 31 , 2000 .
It has moderate reviews from critics and viewers , who have given it an IMDb score of 7.2 .
Survivor is available for streaming on the CBS website , both individual episodes and full seasons .
You can also watch Survivor on demand at Apple TV + , CBS , Amazon Prime , Amazon , Hulu , Vudu , Microsoft Movies & TV , Google Play , iTunes online .
Our military and political leaders are still deceiving us after all these years ...

" Somehow this madness must cease . "
- Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , " Beyond Vietnam " April 4 , 1967 .
In Beyond Afghanistan , I utilized Dr King 's " Beyond Vietnam " speech to deconstruct the empty words used by our Harvard - educated President during a December 1 , 2009 , address in which he sought to justify an escalation of the war in Afghanistan .
I noted then that President Barack Obama deliberately conflated the Taliban with al Qaeda just as " President " George W. Bush conflated Saddam with al Qaeda to exploit the fear and anger engendered by 9/11 .
Robert Scheer revealed , in War of Absurdity that there were , at that time , less than 100 members of al Qaeda still inside Afghanistan , who , per General James Jones , did not retain the " ability to launch attacks on either us or our allies . "
I added :
To defeat the ignoble 100 , the U.S. is rapidly building toward an in-country presence of 100,000 American troops at a cost of $ 100 billion per year .
NATO will also add 7,000 more troops , bringing a combined total to 140,000 foreign occupiers to that impoverished nation .
To this , add some 104,000 " private contractors " aka armed mercenaries , who are paid more than three times the amount received by American troops .
Earlier , I posted a five part series on the more than 50 - year history of CIA torture .
In Part III , citing Victor Marchetti's heavily redacted The CIA & The Cult of Intelligence , I reported on how the CIA 's William Colby constructed interrogation centers whose [ emphasis added ] “ operations … consisted of torture tactics against suspected Vietcong…usually carried out by Vietnamese nationals ” ; that this morphed into the infamous Phoenix torture , then kill and dump program , in which an estimated 46,000 Vietnamese lost their lives ; that General Petreus suggested that the Phoenix Program be reinstated on a “ global scale . ”
A powerful , must - see Democracy Now segment , The New Pentagon Papers : WikiLeaks Releases 90,000 +
Secret Military Documents Painting Devastating Picture of Afghanistan War ( video below ) potently establishes that nothing has really changed .
Our current crop of military and political leaders inside the Bush and Obama administrations have erected an elaborate deception as they carry out wars of imperial conquest and war crimes , including targeted killings of suspected terrorists in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Iraq , just as our past military and political leaders in the Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon administrations erected an elaborate deception to justify the quagmire in Southeast Asia a generation ago ...
Rick Rowly 's Synopsis of the Afghan " Pentagon Papers "
While I sincerely hope readers will take the time to watch the entire video , I felt it appropriate to provide a partial transcript of Rick Rowly 's description of the significance of the newly disclosed 90,000 plus secret military documents .
Rowly stated :
The US military has been whitewashing the war in Afghanistan for years ... most of the media has been along for the ride .
They ’ve systematically covered up civilian casualties .
They ’ve covered up the successful attacks by the Taliban and their significance .
And they ’ve covered up the violent criminality of the security forces that we ’ve created there , security forces that are preying on Afghan civilians ...
The picture that emerges from these documents is ... of an insurgency that is resilient and adapting and that is winning the war on the ground , and , on the other hand , of an Afghan state that we ’ve constructed there that looks less like a government and looks more like a patchwork of warlords and criminal gangs that ’s extorting the local population and that has become more hated in many parts of the country than the Taliban who they replaced .
A third interesting thing that these documents do is they put flesh on a process that we ’ve been tracking ... of a transition to what some people call a special forces war , an entirely covert and classified war that ’s conducted with drone strikes and midnight raids and targeted assassinations , where everything is classified , there are no media embeds , and there ’s very little accountability .
Amy Goodman quoted a Stephen Grey piece from the UK Guardian which focused on the targeted assassinations of Task Force 373 , whom Grey described as having " also killed civilian men , women and children and even Afghan police officers who have strayed into its path . "
Matthew Hoh , a former Marine Corps captain in Iraq and former State Department official in Afghanistan , added : " A lot of times ... we kill the wrong people .
Well , you know , sometimes we get the right guy , but he ’s actually just somebody who ’s been turned in by someone who ’s got a grudge against him . "
That is what occurred when hundreds of innocents were turned over for the huge bounties we had offered at the outset of the war in Afghanistan ; people who were then shipped to Guantanamo where they languished for years .
But where arrest and torture led to embarrassment for the Bush regime , the military appears to now look to bury their mistakes .
Nothing new , really !
While the details contained in these Afghan " Pentagon Papers " are new , the story of our involvement in death squads , torture , assassination , drug smuggling , and support for corrupt and brutal military regimes is by no means new and different from the history I described in my earlier , five - part series on CIA torture .
What , you actually thought we were there to bring democracy and freedom to the Afghan people ?
Or did you just buy into the new iteration of the domino theory --- that we have to fight " them " over there so we wo n't have to fight " them " here ?
UPDATE : In a follow - up appearance with guest host Chris Hayes on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show ( video below ) , Rick Rowly , who had recently embedded with U.S. marines in Afghanistan , blew away the Obama administration 's attempt to spin the matter by claiming that , because the WikiLeaks documents covered a period ending in December , 2009 , they are outdated because they predate the “ new ” strategy embodied by Obama 's escalation .
Rowly not only explained how this " new " strategy was failing both militarily and politically , but said it was " shocking " that the military would attempt to dismiss the damning information as irrelevant simply because the WikiLeaks documents ran only through last December .
These documents prove that the U.S. military has been white washing the war since the beginning .
They ’ve covered up civilian casualties ; they ’ve covered up successful insurgent attacks and downplayed their significance and they ’ve covered up the violent criminality of the security forces that we ’ve created that are praying on the civilian population and turning that population against us .
UPDATE 07/27/2010 : In a public email Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) announced two important Resolutions that will come before the House this week :
The first deals with Pakistan --- House Concurrent Resolution 301 , and the second deals with supplemental funding which will provide another 33 - billion dollars to keep the War in Afghanistan going .
I would like to speak to you briefly about both of those votes .
The first vote is likely to occur this Tuesday on House Concurrent Resolution 301 , sponsored by myself and Congressman Ron Paul of Texas .
This resolution aims to cause the United States to withdraw from Pakistan .
Now , it 's not generally known that we have at least 124 Special Forces troops on the ground inside Pakistan .
It is absolutely urgent that we take a stand to stop spreading war in Pakistan .
To nip in the bud the U.S. ground presence .
We already know the U.S. has had missile strikes inside Pakistan since March of 2005 with a lot of innocent villagers killed .
All that we can do is to expand the war into Pakistan , destabilize that government and have the United States fighting on still another front .
We have to get out of Pakistan and that 's why Ron Paul and I have come together , for the first time , to force a vote on this question .
Later in the week we 'll be faced once again with the question whether to continue to fund the War in Afghanistan .
The New York Times and other news agencies have taken WikiLeaks reports and have released this news globally .
And what we 've learned in the last 24 hours is that there is another secret war going on in Afghanistan .
A war of failure .
A war of our troops getting undermined by people that we think are working with us .
This is occurring in Pakistan , it 's also happening in Afghanistan .
The Afghanistan government is a cesspool of corruption .
There is no plausible way that anything even remotely resembling a democracy can be established there .
Our presence there is an occupation fueling an insurgency .
We have to get out of Afghanistan .
We owe it to our troops .
We owe it to our national security .
We owe it to our budget .
We owe it to the American people who hope for a better life here at home .

VANIMO , PAPUA NEW GUINEA — In
His first official statement since the July 17 tsunami that claimed the lives of an estimated 3,000 Papua New Guineans , the Lord announced Monday that He killed the island villagers as part of His longtime " moving in mysterious ways " policy , calling the natural disaster " part of My unknowable , divine plan for mankind . "
The aftermath of the recent tidal wave in Papua New Guinea .

" Though the need for such a tidal wave is incomprehensible to you mortals , flawed as you are by sin , I can assure you that I had a very good reason for what I did , " God said of the disaster , whose death toll is expected to climb to 5,000 once the effects of disease , starvation and marauding crocodiles become known .
" Trust me . "
Yahweh , whose unknowable purposes have necessitated , among other things , the death of 40 million Europeans from the Bubonic Plague , 40,000 Peruvians in a 1868 earthquake , and six million of His chosen people in Nazi concentration camps , said he was " not unmoved " by the suffering of the Papua New Guinea flood victims .

" Of course I hear their prayers , " God said .
" I see every sparrow that falls .
But it is
My will that these prayers not be answered , and that life continues to be nasty , brutish and short for the majority of mankind .
And My reasons are not yours to question . "
Added God : " Where were you when I created the Heavens and the Earth ? "
World religious leaders are standing behind the Lord .
" We must not presume to know the mind of our Creator , " Rev. Billy Graham said .
" We are , as He often reminds us , His flock , and He is our shepherd .
It seems clear that the people who are criticizing Him for killing the Papua New Guineans have not fully considered the theological implications of the shepherd - sheep relationship . "

God is standing firmly behind His act .
" I honestly do not know why He wanted those people dead , " Pope John Paul II said , " but I have full faith in the wisdom and justice of His acts . "

Despite top religious leaders ' reluctance to speculate on the Lord 's motive in the killings , many contend it was an act of heathen - smiting .
" I would never presume to understand God 's plan , but it seems like more than a coincidence that these typhoons , tsunamis and earthquakes always seem to hit non-Christian countries like India and Bangladesh , " said Matthew Ellsworth , pastor for Holy Name Lutheran Church in Colorado Springs , CO .
When was the last time a tidal wave devastated France ? "

Though a majority of those who perished in the tsunami were non-Christians , God did kill several hundred of His followers .
" I must have faith that the Lord will help me , " said Aitape Bulolo , a Protestant fisherman who spent 11 days clinging to the top of a tree while waiting for flood waters to recede and watching the hogs he raised feed upon the corpses of his family .
" I know my wife and daughters are with Him now in Heaven , and that He is sparing me for some greater purpose .
This horrible tragedy has only strengthened my faith .
God is love . "

Upon hearing Bulolo 's words , God said , " I can neither confirm nor deny rumors of Aitape Bulolo 's family 's presence in My heavenly kingdom .
Be content that it is one of the many mysteries of faith , and that I am always watching over you , albeit for my own unfathomable purposes . "
" And believe Me , " God added , " never in a million years would you guess what those purposes are . "
On his Monday radio show , Glenn Beck highlighted claims that before he started targeting a little - known , left - leaning organization called the Tides Foundation on his Fox News TV show , “ nobody knew ” what the non-profit was .
Indeed , for more than a year Beck has been portraying the progressive organization as a central player in a larger , nefarious cabal of Marxist / socialist / Nazi Obama - loving outlets determined to destroy democracy in America .
Beck has routinely smeared the low - profile entity for being staffed by “ thugs ” and “ bullies ” and involved in “ the nasty of the nastiest , ” like indoctrinating schoolchildren and creating a “ mass organization to seize power . ”
As Media Matters reported , the conspiratorial host had mentioned ( read : attacked ) the little - known progressive organization nearly 30 times on his Fox program alone since it premiered in 2009 , including several mentions in the last month .
( Beck ’s the only TV talker who regularly references the foundation , according to our Nexis searches . )
So yes , Beck has done all he can to scare the hell out of people about the Tides Foundation and “ turn the light of day ” onto an organization that actually facilitates non-profit giving .
And guess what ?
Everybody in America would have found out about the Tides Foundation last week if Byron Williams had had his way .
He 's the right - wing , government - hating , gun-toting nut who strapped on his body armor , stocked a pickup truck with guns and ammo , and set off up the California coast to San Francisco in order to start killing employees at the previously obscure Tides Foundation in hopes of sparking a political revolution .
Thankfully , the planned domestic terrorist attack never came to pass because California Highway Patrol officers pulled Williams over for drunk driving on his way to his killing spree .
Williams quickly opened fire , wounding two officers during a lengthy shootout .
Luckily , Williams was n’t able to act out the ultimate goal of his dark anger -- fueled by the TV news he watched -- about how “ Congress was railroading through all these left - wing agenda items , ” as his mother put it .
Williams was n’t able to open fire inside the offices of the Tides Foundation , an organization “ nobody knew ” about until Glenn Beck started targeting it .
And thankfully , Williams was n’t able to take his place alongside a growing list of domestic , anti-government terrorists , such as the recent Pentagon shooter , the Holocaust Museum gunman , the kamikaze pilot who flew his plane into an IRS building in Austin , Texas , and the Pittsburgh cop -killer who set up an ambush because he was convinced Obama was going to take away his guns .
All the vigilante attacks appear to have been fueled by an almost pathological hatred for the U.S. government -- the same open hatred that right - wing bloggers , AM talk radio hosts , and Fox News ' lineup of anti-government prophets have been frantically fueling for the last year , pushing doomsday warnings of America 's democratic demise under President Obama .
And the sad the sad truth is we ’re going to see more like Byron Williams .
We ’re going to see more attempts at vigilante violence during the Age of Obama simply because the right - wing media , lead by Beck , continue to gleefully ( albeit irresponsibly ) stoke dangerous fires with the kind of relentlessly incendiary rhetoric that has no match in terms of modern day , mainstream use in American politics or media .
Just listen to Glenn Beck :
And do n’t forget about the unhinged response when health care reform was passed in March : “ Get down on your knees and pray .
Pray .
It 's September 11th all over again , except that we did n't have the collapsing buildings . ”
After financial reform passed last week , Beck told his audience , “ Your republic is over . ”
Meanwhile , Andrew Breitbart ’s website recently tagged Obama as the “ suicide - bomber - in - chief , ” while the conservativeWashington Times just last week published an op - ed -- by a former congressman , no less -- asserting the president poses more of a threat to America than Al Qaeda .
Note that the radicial right ’s media rhetoric is no longer even political in a partisan sense .
Instead , it ’s purely revolutionary .
It is n’t , “ We think taxes should be lower ” or “ Obama should be more hawkish overseas . ”
It ’s , “ There ’s an insidious and deadly plot afoot by Democrats and progressives to strip Americans of their freedom and this country of its greatness . ”
Obama is now theincarnation of evil ( the Antichrist ? ) , and his driving hatred for America , as well as for democracy , runs so deep that he ran for president in order to destroy the United States from inside the Oval Office .
Rush Limbaugh : " Our country is being overthrown from within . "
And this summer , the latest twist to that line of attack is that Obama is destroying America on purpose in order to exact revenge from white America for the historic sin of slavery .
( Think : Black Manchurian Candidate . )
The GOP Noise Machine is now mixing a vile cocktail by stirring revolutionary rhetoric with hateful race - baiting .
It ’s impossible to argue that today ’s avalanche of insurrectionist rhetoric does n’t have a real world effect .
Or that those on the fringes do n’t find comfort in seeing and hearing their worst fears legitimized on AM radio and Fox News .
The consequences of the doomsday programming seem entirely predictable .
As Jeffrey Jones , a professor of media and politics at Old Dominion University , recently explained to The New York Times in regard to Beck 's rhetoric , " People hear their values are under attack and they get worried .
It becomes an opportunity for them to stand up and do something . "
Indeed , the relentless message that right - wing audiences hear is unequivocal and inescapable :
Do something !
Take action !
And last week , Byron Williams , likely inspired by Glenn Beck 's Tides obsession , grabbed his guns and set out to do just that .

Have you been wondering about the chemistry behind AMC 's dramatic television series , Breaking Bad ?
Here 's a look at the science of the show .
01 of 08 Making Colored Fire AMC
In the pilot episode of Breaking Bad Walt White performs a chemistry demonstration in which he sprays chemicals onto a burner flame , causing it to change colors .
Here 's how you can do that demonstration yourself .
02 of 08 Making Crystal Meth US DEA
The premise of the series is that chemist and chemistry teacher Walt White is diagnosed with cancer and seeks to make enough money to support his family after his death so he turns to making crystal meth .
Just how hard is it to make this drug ?
Not that hard , but there are lots of reasons why you would n't want to mess with it .
03 of 08 Mercury Fulminate Tobias Maximilian Mittrach / Wikipedia Commons Mercury fulminate sort of looks like crystal meth , but is explosive .
Mercury fulminate is easy to prepare , but you wo n't find many chemists excited about mixing up a batch .
04 of 08 Hydrofluoric Acid European Chemicals Bureau
Walt uses hydrofluoric acid to dissolve a body .
This works , but if you are going to use hydrofluoric acid ( presumably not for that purpose ) , there are certain things you need to know .
05 of 08 Elements in the Body U.S. Geological Survey The third episode of Breaking Bad finds
Walt pondering what makes a man .
Is it the elements of which he is comprised ?
No , it 's the choices he makes .
Walt thinks back on his past and reviews a bit of biochemistry .
06 of 08 Cleaning Glassware Siede Preis / Getty Images
If you are going to use glassware for chemistry , it 's probably a good idea to learn how to get it clean .
Dirty glassware can lead to contamination .
You would n't want that , would you ?

The first episode of Season 2 finds
Walt making up a batch of ricin .
Ricin is bad news , but you do n't need to fear castor beans or accidental poisoning .
Public swimming pools are more dangerous than you might think , a new study suggests .
When sweat and urine , among other organics , mix with the disinfectants in pool water , the result can be hazardous to health .
The findings , announced this week , link the application of disinfectants in recreational pools to genetic cell damage that has been shown to be linked with adverse health outcomes such as asthma and bladder cancer .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Pool water represents extreme cases of disinfection that differ from the disinfection of drinking water as pools are continuously exposed to disinfectants .
But with so many people cooling off and exercising in pools and water parks ( 339 million visits across the United States each year ) , the disinfectants are a must to prevent outbreaks of infectious disease .
Chlorine and pee do n't mix
The problem occurs when the sanitizers mix with organic matter .
" All sources of water possess organic matter that comes from decaying leaves , microbes and other dead life forms , " said study researcher Michael Plewa , University of Illinois professor of genetics .
" In addition to organic matter and disinfectants , pool waters contain sweat , hair , skin , urine [ 1 in 5 adults admits peeing in the pool ] and consumer products such as cosmetics and sunscreens from swimmers . "
These consumer products are often nitrogen - rich , and when mixed with disinfectants , these products may become chemically modified and converted into more toxic agents .
Long - term exposure to these disinfection byproducts can mutate genes , induce birth defects , accelerate the aging process , cause respiratory ailments , and even induce cancer , according to the researchers .
While the new study did not examine actual effects on humans , it suggests such research might be warranted .

Of the 173 film appearances of John Wayne , The Conqueror is one of his lesser known roles , and for good reason .
In this movie , which Wayne actually asked director Dick Powell to star in , he plays the Mongolian warrior Genghis Khan .
Right off the bat it sounds ridiculous ; John Wayne playing an Asian .
They gave him makeup to make his eyes seem slanted and of course , a Fu Man Chu facial hair style .
Wayne , who needed to make only one movie to finish out his contract with RKO , was heavily dissuaded by Powell to not take up this role and with the script thrown in the trash , Wayne pulled it out and said he wanted to play Genghis Khan as a cowboy would , and Powell then famously quipped , “ Who am I to turn down John Wayne ? ”
And so they went filming , and by the time it reached theaters , word spread on how awful the film was .
As of right now , it currently has a cult - following of those dedicated to watching bad films .
It has made its way into books focusing on Razzie potential material , and is known as that project that John Wayne must have been insane to sign a contract with .
What makes this even more of a shock is that this film came out the same year as The Searchers , a film which is said by many to be the Duke ’s greatest performance .
I have seen The Conqueror only once , and would watch it again .
As bad as it is , I enjoyed it .
There are decent action scenes and the storyline is actually quite interesting .
The fact that there is not one Asian in a film about Asians kind of threw everyone off , though , but this was the 1950 ’s and that was what the times were like .
Anyway , this is not a movie review , but more of an interesting tidbit of trivia .
John
Wayne would die in 1979 , a full 23 years later , but many attribute this film to his death .
The movie was notorious for being shot in the deserts of Utah , almost ten years after the United States Army conducted nuclear bomb testing there .
Of the 220 people involved in the film , 91 would die of cancer , including Wayne , director Dick Powell , and every leading and supporting cast member : Agnes Moorehead , Susan Hayward , and John Hoyt .
Another star , Pedro Armendáriz would also be diagnosed of cancer , but commit suicide after hearing the news .
The number does not even include the extras and other people involved in filming .
Numerous American Indians who served as Mongolian warriors contracted cancer in later years , and even John Wayne ’s son Michael died in 2003 of cancer , after visiting his father on the set at age 22 .
What is also even more mind - boggling is the fact that after principle shooting was finished in Utah , the production company had 60 tons of radioactive dirt shipped to Hollywood so filming could be finished on sound stages .
Whatever became of this dirt is unknown ; it ’s probably been used as filler in a back - lot by now .
Within a year after the film debuted as a critical and commercial flop , producer Howard Hughes knew that problems were on the horizon .
Out of guilt , he purchased every single print of the movie that had ever been copied , and kept them at his mansion home .
In his later , eccentric years , he would view the film every night before going to bed , regretting each day for the rest of his life the fact that he produced the film .
Contrary to popular belief , John Wayne did not die of lung cancer , despite being a chain - smoker ( and smoking up to seven packs a day during the 1960 ’s ) , but stomach cancer .
In his later years , he would beat lung cancer and just when it seemed he would be cured and live , a new form of galloping cancer took over his stomach and he could not be saved .
Could this cancer have been the effects of the radioactive filming locations ?
There are just too many cancer - related deaths associated with this film to be coincidence .
If one can find humor in this , there was at one point a photograph in existence of John Wayne at the set holding a Geiger Counter , and there being radioactivity registering on it .
Wayne also quoted that the moral of the film was , “ Do n’t make an ass of yourself trying to play parts you are not suited for . ”
What seemed like a harmless decision may have ended up costing one of the greatest American actors his life .
In a People Magazine article from 1980 , there was a quote from the Pentagon Defense Nuclear Agency regarding this film that read , “ Please , God , do n’t let us have killed John Wayne . ”

SANDY -- Sandy police are searching in the foothills around the Bell Canyon trail for a man who stabbed a hiker on the trail with a makeshift spear and then ran off .
Police say the suspect had what appeared to be a bamboo walking stick .
He pulled off the top , exposing a metal rod with a fine tip , which he used like a spear .
" The spear , we 're calling it , actually went through the top of his arm and came out the lower portion of his arm , " said Sgt. Troy Arnold with the Sandy Police Department .
The 40 - year - old victim was walking down the trail in Bell Canyon near 10200 South and Wasatch Boulevard around 1:30 p.m. Wednesday .
He told police he met the attacker , who was walking up the trail .
They had a brief and friendly conversation , he said .
A few moments later , he noticed the suspect turned around and was following him .
When the hiker asked the man what was going on , the suspect started talking incoherently and attacked .
The hiker said the man jabbed at him several times before stabbing him completely through the arm , then running off .
" It 's an unnerving event , especially because he was just out recreating and was walking down the trail and was cordial and decent to the person , " explains Arnold .
" He just did n't understand why he would attack him unprovoked . "
The victim ran down the trail and called 911 from his cell phone .
Police were there when he reached the trailhead but were unable to capture the attacker .
" At this point we want to reassure people we are looking for the suspect , " Arnold said .
" It was a very random and unprovoked attack , and so we take it very seriously .
We want to make sure whoever this person is , that we find them , locate them and keep that area safe so people can continue to recreate up there . "
The victim was taken to Alta View hospital and was listed in fair condition .
The attacker is described as a white man in his 20s , approximately 6 feet tall with a thin build .
He had short brown hair and was wearing light colored cargo pants , a white shirt and a brown hat .

Israel police raze ' illegal ' Bedouin village in Negev Published duration 27 July 2010
media caption Police arrived at dawn and destroyed 30 to 40 makeshift homes
Around 300 Bedouins living in Israel 's Negev desert have been made homeless after police raided their village and razed their homes .
Israeli activists said 1,500 police arrived in Al - Arakib village at dawn .
They destroyed 30 to 40 makeshift homes and uprooted hundreds of olive trees belonging to the villagers , they said .
Police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said the homes had been " illegally built " and were destroyed in line with a court ruling issued 11 years ago .
" Several hundred people were taken back to the Rahat area where they originally came from , " he told the AFP news agency , referring to a nearby Bedouin town in Israel 's arid south .
More than 150,000 Bedouin live in Israel , mostly in and around the Negev desert .
Around half live in villages that are not recognised by the state , and have no access to municipal services like water and electricity .
Many live in extreme poverty .
Land battle
At dawn on Tuesday , women and children in Al - Arakib watched as Land Administration bulldozers demolished their houses , Israeli press reports said .
Minor scuffles erupted as the villagers and around 150 rights activists tried to stop the police from carrying out the demolitions , said Chaya Noach , head of the Negev Coexistence Forum , a group fighting to protect the rights of the Bedouin in the Negev .
" We were stunned to witness the violent force being used , " Al - Arakib spokesman Awad Abu - Farikh told Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot following the razing .
" This operation is the first step in the uprooting of many villages .
We shall return to our villages , build our homes and not leave this place . "

Olive trees were uprooted and orchards destroyed , activists said
The authorities say all the homes are illegal , built without permission .
The Bedouin say they have lived in the area since before the foundation of the state of Israel .
They resist efforts to re-settle them in towns and villages , saying it goes against their traditional way of life .
A Land Administration official , Shlomo Tziser , told Yediot Ahronot the officers were implementing a final court order for the evacuation of the area .
" Today we shall evacuate them and should they return we 'll do it again , " he said .
Who needs a flying car ?
The U.S. military thinks it does .
The Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) is seeking proposals for a Humvee that can fly over insurgents , conduct night raids or whisk injured soldiers away from the battlefield .
Textron , the defense company , says it has the solution — and they have the sketches to prove it .
Sure , the concept looks like a model car you might buy at Toys R ' Us , but the technology is sound , and the engineers think it could be ready to fly relatively soon , according to Steven Reid , vice president of unmanned aircraft systems at AAI , the Textron subsidiary that produced the Shadow UAV .
" Envision a Humvee - like vehicle with wings that fold out from the side and attach just above the rear door , " Reid says .
Textron 's plan is to integrate its work on military ground vehicles and unmanned aircraft like the Shadow , and combine it with licensed technology from its partnership with Carter Aviation Technologies , a small Texas - based outfit working on a personal air vehicle for the commercial market .
Textron is incorporating Carter 's slowed compound rotor technology , which uses rotors that are similar to helicopter blades but heavily weighted in the tips .
As the aircraft takes off , the rotor provides lift , but as the vehicle gains speed , the rotor slows down and the wings provide lift .
The vehicle would have a roof panel that contains wings that rotate and fold out from the sides , as well as a mast that comes up and houses the slowed rotor system .
Coming out the back of the vehicle is a shrouded , ducted fan that provides forward motion , and then a series of control surfaces that help regulate speed , as well as pitch , roll and yaw .
To win funding for the project that DARPA formally calls Transformer , the company has to meet a challenging set of demands .
The defense agency has asked companies and researchers to come up with a flyable vehicle that can carry up to four people , is capable of vertical takeoff and landing and can travel without having to refuel at ranges for 250 nautical miles ( with a combination of driving and flying ) .
While DARPA officials have talked about such a vehicle for avoiding roadside bombs , they are also considering it for a variety of missions , including " strike and raid , intervention , interdiction , insurgency and counterinsurgency , reconnaissance , medical evacuation and logistical supply . "
For veteran defense companies like Textron , the DARPA project did elicit some surprise .
" I have to admit , " recalls Reid , " we scratched our heads and asked : Is this real ? "
But if the goal of DARPA 's Transformer project to hunt down innovative technologies that may lie resident at nontraditional defense companies , then Textron 's approach , which draws heavily on Carter Aviation , may pave the way .
Despite the far - out notion of a flying Humvee , Reid says the company 's engineers are intrigued by the idea of pushing the envelope on aircraft technology , and the concept fits well with ideas they already have about combining manned and unmanned aircraft , particularly helicopters .
While Reid jokes about flying cars not being in Textron 's " five - year plan , " he says the DARPA program is exciting because it allows the company to build off Carter Aviation 's technology , and perhaps incorporate that into the Shadow UAV .
" Quite frankly , our hopes are quite modest , " Reid says .
" We do n't have visions of fleet sales of flying Humvees quite yet . "

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) leaders are attempting to distance themselves from controversial proposals published in a May 24 working paper on “ reinventing ” the media .
The report presents a suite of options through which government could step in and supposedly rescue journalism , most notably by imposing taxes .
A fee could be levied on websites such as the Drudge Report that link to the best news of the day , or a tax could be imposed on consumer electronics such as iPads , laptops and Kindles .
Funds collected would be redistributed to traditional media outlets .
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz torpedoed the device tax in testimony Wednesday before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee , saying , “ I think that ’s a terrible idea . ”
The backpedaling is not surprising , as the suggestions coming out of the headquarters at 600 Pennsylvania Ave. are about as unpopular as they come in Washington .
A poll released Tuesday by Rasmussen Reports found that three out of four of those surveyed opposed taxing gadgets .
About the same amount opposed the Drudge Tax .
“ The American people have absolutely no interest in taxing new media or consumer electronics to prop up an industry that ’s clearly on its way out , ” pollster Scott W. Rasmussen said in an interview .
Trial balloons are a fact of life inside the Beltway .
When the administration and Congress want to enact a politically controversial policy , they often punt the issue to an independent federal agency whose leadership need not face the wrath of voters .
Inside the agency , potentially unpopular ideas are presented first by staff so commissioners can jettison plans that prove untenable .
Mr. Leibowitz declined a request to comment more specifically on the Drudge Tax .
The agency ’s other commissioners referred questions to the FTC Office of Policy Planning , whose head reports to Mr. Leibowitz .
Passing the buck is a classic bureaucratic dodge .
The FTC claims that the well - developed proposals released last month were simply an enumeration of options suggested in “ public comments . ”
In fact , the agency ’s Federal Register announcement for the proceeding questioned the propriety of news - aggregator websites that “ do not pay for content ” - this document was filed long before public hearings were held .
The report ’s views also happen to match positions Mr. Leibowitz has held in the past .
Before joining the FTC , he was vice president of the Motion Picture Association of America , an organization that defends an extreme view of copyright law in order to prop up Hollywood ’s increasingly obsolete business model .
At a December workshop , Mr. Leibowitz complained that online news readers get a “ free ride instead of paying the full value - or in fact paying anything - for what they ’re consuming . ”
Despite the retreat on the electronics tax , it appears Mr. Leibowitz and his staff have not abandoned the opinion that the problems facing journalism can and should be solved by government - even if the exact form this control would take is open to negotiation .
As the Obama administration has demonstrated its willingness to ignore negative public opinion in order to expand government involvement in areas such as health care , it is important for Congress to step in and deflate the FTC ’s latest trial balloon .
Government subsidies will destroy , not save , journalism .

SEATTLE --
The Yankees stand on the verge of acquiring former Cy Young award winner Cliff Lee from the Mariners , according to a report in today 's New York Post , though it will cost top prospect Jesus Montero .
If completed , the blockbuster trade has the potential to reshape an already - tight race in the American League East and trigger a reshuffling of the Yankees pitching staff .
The addition of Lee would give the Yankees six starting pitchers , which could perhaps allow them to fix the bullpen last season , by moving Phil Hughes into a relief role .
Lee , 31 , could also help the Yankees separate themselves from the rest of the powerful AL East .
Though the Yankees remain in first place , the Rays and Red Sox are capable of pushing them .
But a top - of - the - rotation pairing featuring Lee and ace CC Sabathia -- close friends and former Indians teammates -- could be enough for the Yankees to pull away .
Not that the Yankees need a reminder of Lee 's effectiveness .
The left - hander pitched two games last in the World Series as a member of the Phillies , dominating the Yankees in Game 1 .
Lee , who is 8 - 3 with a 2.34 ERA , is slated to start tonight for the Mariners in the second of a four - game set against the Yankees .

A whole new world came to life for Alice when she followed the White Rabbit down the hole .
There was a grinning cat , a Hookah - smoking caterpillar , a Mad Hatter , and much more .
It makes you wonder ... what 's waiting down the rabbit - hole on the Moon ?
NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) is beaming back images of caverns hundreds of feet deep -- beckoning scientists to follow .
" They could be entrances to a geologic wonderland , " says Mark Robinson of Arizona State University , principal investigator for the LRO camera .
" We believe the giant holes are skylights that formed when the ceilings of underground lava tubes collapsed . "
Japan 's Kaguya spacecraft first photographed the enormous caverns last year .
Now the powerful Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera ( LROC , the same camera that photographed Apollo landers and astronauts ' tracks in the moondust ) is giving us enticing high - resolution images of the caverns ' entrances and their surroundings .
Back in the 1960s , before humans set foot on the Moon , researchers proposed the existence of a network of tunnels , relics of molten lava rivers , beneath the lunar surface .
They based their theory on early orbital photographs that revealed hundreds of long , narrow channels called rilles winding across the vast lunar plains , or maria .
Scientists believed these rilles to be surface evidence of below - ground tunnels through which lava flowed billions of years ago .
" It 's exciting that we 've now confirmed this idea , " says Robinson .
" The Kaguya and LROC photos prove that these caverns are skylights to lava tubes , so we know such tunnels can exist intact at least in small segments after several billion years . "
These Kaguya images show the Marius Hills pit in the context of a meandering system of volcanic rilles .
Because the pit is in the middle of a rille , it likely represents a collapse in the roof of a lava tube .

Lava tubes are formed when the upper layer of lava flowing from a volcano starts to cool while the lava underneath continues to flow in tubular channels .
The hardened lava above insulates the molten lava below , allowing it to retain its liquid warmth and continue flowing .
Lava tubes are found on Earth and can vary from a simple tube to a complex labyrinth that extends for miles .
If the tunnels leading off the skylights have stood the test of time and are still open , they could someday provide human visitors protection from incoming meteoroids and other perils .
" The tunnels offer a perfect radiation shield and a very benign thermal environment , " says Robinson .
" Once you get down to 2 meters under the surface of the Moon , the temperature remains fairly constant , probably around - 30 to - 40 degrees C. "
This cavern in Mare Ingenii is almost twice the size of the one in the Marius Hills .

That may sound cold , but it would be welcome news to explorers seeking to escape the temperature extremes of the lunar surface .
At the Moon 's equator , mid-day temperatures soar to 100 deg C and plunge to a frigid - 150 deg C at night .
Paul Spudis of the Lunar and Planetary Institute agrees that lunar lava tubes and chambers hold potential advantages to future explorers but says , " Hold off on booking your next vacation at the Lunar Carlsbad Hilton .
Many tunnels may have filled up with their own solidified lava . "
However , like Alice 's Queen of Hearts , who " believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast , " Spudis is keeping an open mind .
" We just can't tell , with our remote instruments , what the skylights lead to .
To find out for sure , we 'd need to go to the Moon and do some spelunking .
I 've had my share of surprises in caving .
Several years ago I was helping map a lava flow in Hawaii .
We had a nice set of vents , sort of like these skylights .
It turned out that there was a whole new cave system that was not evident from aerial photos . "
As for something similar under the lunar skylights ?
" Who knows ? " says Spudis .
" The Moon continually surprises me . "
This could be a white rabbit worth following .

Today we 're having a look at AdMob 's latest monthly mobile metrics report which includes some information that may be of interest to the Android community , especially developers .
Top 10 Android Devices
One particularly interesting piece of information is their ranking of the top ten Android smartphones in terms of market share , based on data collected by AdMob in May of this year .
You can view the list and each handset maker ’s own market share below .
Combined , HTC and Motorola are dominating the Android handset market with an 83 % share .
It 's going to be very interesting to see how the stats change in the coming months with Samsung , currently at 5 % ( at least in the top 10 list ) , gunning full speed to regain their own Android market share .
Note : Because this data was collected in May , it does not include phones released since then , most notably the HTC EVO .
Operating System Share
Among other reports , I wanted to highlight this comparison of the market share of several mobile operation systems , including iOS , Android , Symbian , RIM OS , Windows Mobile , and webOS .
Clearly , though iOS is still on top , it has dropped quite significantly since November , and Android is growing at a rate unrivaled by its competitors .
Regular Paid App Downloads
The comparisons between Android and iOS are where things get really interesting .
After surveying nearly 1000 Android , iOS , and webOS users , AdMob ’s report shows that iOS users regularly purchase apps far more often than Android users , with 50 % of iPhone users downloading at least one paid app per month , while that number is 35 % for the iPod Touch and just 21 % for Android .
Device Satisfaction Levels
According to the same survey , owners of the iPhone and iPod Touch are also more willing to recommend their device to friends than Android owners are .
91 % of iPhone owners would recommend iOS to friends , while 3 % said they would not , and 5 % said maybe .
Out of Android phone owners , 84 % said they would recommend their Android devices to friends , with 5 % saying they would not , and 12 % saying maybe .
However , it is important to note that these recommendation stats were collected in February , and things have changed drastically since then in the Android department , with the introduction of powerhouses like HTC EVO 4G and Android Froyo with Flash support and speed improvements .
The full report is available in the source link below .

Glenn Beck is a cable - news phenomenon .
His hour - long program on Fox News Channel routinely attracts more viewers than all of its competitors in the five p.m. time slot combined , sometimes reaching as many as 3.5 million people .
Fox News , however , has nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t been able to translate those huge audience numbers into premium advertisers on Beck ’s show .
ADVERTISEMENT
The reason for this paradox is BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s perpetual proximity to controversy .
His hard - core fans may cheer when the blackboard - wielding bloviator calls President Obama Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ a racist , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â dismisses Senator Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) as Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ a high - class prostitute , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  or blames the Anti-Defamation League for the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ plight of the Jewish people .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
But such talk tends to unnerve advertisers seeking the broadest possible audience for their products .
Still , Beck would probably not have lost scores of potential advertisers were it not for the activities of a third - year law student at the University of Wisconsin named Angelo Carusone .
The black - haired , sharp - featured Carusone , a 28 - year - old Long Island native and politics junkie , had been bothered by Beck for years , but he reached his breaking point on June 30 , 2009 , when Beck nodded along while his guest , former C.I.A. agent Michael Scheuer , declared that Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ the only chance we have as a country right now isÃ¢â‚ ¬Â for bin Laden to Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ detonate a major weaponÃ¢â‚ ¬Â in the U.S. Carusone figured that engaging in a war of words with the combative Beck would be to play into his hands , so he opted for a different approach :
He would target the showÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s advertisers and see if he could shame them into pulling their sponsorship dollars .
His method is simple enough .
Working from an office in his two - bedroom apartment in Madison , Wisconsin , which he shares with Brett Abrams , his partner of six years , Carusone ingests a super - size dose of Glenn Beck every dayÃ¢â‚¬â€ three hours of syndicated radio programming and one hour on Fox News .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It would be incredibly unfair of me to charge Beck with all of these claims if I did nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t get everything he says exactly right , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Carusone explains .
Armed with his homemade transcripts , Carusone then dispatches a letter or e-mail to corporate executives asking them if they are aware that their ads are running in an hour when Glenn Beck said , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ [ insert newest offensive sound bite ] .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Many times , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s enough to make advertisers pull their commercials , although Carusone admits that by now his reputation for peskiness may help grease the wheels .
He catalogues his activities on StopBeck.com , which includes one running list of sponsors that have dropped the show and another of those that have not .
ADVERTISEMENT
Critics say Carusone is trying to stifle Beck ’s constitutionally - guaranteed free speech .
Carusone , however , says he ’s not telling Beck what he can and canÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t say , only holding advertisers accountable for supporting his program .
But his campaign is an effort to target Beck ’s words using advertising dollars as leverage .
If an email fails to sway a Glenn Beck advertiser , Carusone turns to social networking .
He has more than 7,000 followers on Twitter , including such influential ones as Shoq , an anonymous persona with an active following , whom Carusone refers to as Ã¢â‚¬ Å “ the Batman of Twitter .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
The snowballing impact of thousands of outspoken Twitterers can create major headaches for a company concerned about its image .
The Twitter method is so effective that it might be tempting for Carusone to use it all the time , but he says , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ My goal is accountability , not public embarrassment .
The hope is that by bringing the problem to these companiesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ attention , it will resolve itself silently .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
ADVERTISEMENT
As a last resort , Carusone picks up the phone .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s my least flattering method of persuasion , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he says — a strange admission , considering that he has eight years of competitive debate experience , including in major national and international tournaments .
( Much of that experience came during his four years at Chaminade High School , the same private all - boys Catholic school from which BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Fox News colleague Bill OÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢Reilly graduated . )
The first major victory for the StopBeck campaign came last August , when an executive from Kraft Foods posted the following statement directly on CarusoneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s site : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We have a longstanding policy not to advertise on programs with extreme or inflammatory content on any network .
In recent years , there has been a proliferation of shows with extreme content , including on the political front .
These shows often are controversial and do not align with our company or brand values .
We do not want to become associated with controversy simply because of the placement of a 30 - second spot .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Dumbfounded , Carusone confirmed the statementÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s authenticity with Kraft before spreading the news .
ADVERTISEMENT
But it has nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t always been so easy ; some of BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s sponsors have remained impervious to CarusoneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s prodding .
1-800 - PetMeds offered a boilerplate rejection letter .
ServPro , a company that repairs fire and water damage , stated that it offers an important service that must reach the widest possible audience .
And some of his victories have been short - lived : Nutrisystem recently reversed its decision to withdraw its advertising from Beck , and the company has even gone so far as to block Carusone on Twitter so that he can no longer pester its representatives with direct messages .
All in all , however , CarusoneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s effort has been a resounding success :
So far approximately 320 companies have agreed not to support Glenn Beck with their ad dollars .
( Nearly two - thirds of them have chosen to remain anonymous , presumably for fear of retaliation from BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s legions of passionate fans ) .
Part of that success can be chalked up to good timing .
Carusone launched the campaign just a few weeks before Beck made perhaps his most outrageous comment to date , accusing President Obama of being Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ a racistÃ¢â‚ ¬Â who Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â The African - American advocacy group ColorOfChange.org promptly created their own campaign , a partnership that Carusone says Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ has been vital .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
Other advocacy groups have also contributed to the effort periodically , as their particular constituencies have found themselves in BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s line of fire .
ADVERTISEMENT
With StopBeck , Carusone tries to occupy the space between media - watchdog organizations ( such as Media Matters for America ) and issue - based activist groups ( such as the Anti-Defamation League ) .
He calls what he does Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ informed activismÃ¢â‚ ¬Â — that is , action backed by Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ informed commentary , not just tired slogans that are easy to brush off .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a formula that is well suited to CarusoneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s cause , according to Ari Rabin - Havt , vice president of research and communication at Media Matters , which has catalogued hundreds of examples of BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s false and inflammatory statements .
CarusoneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s approach Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ explicitly shows advertisers what they are supporting with their dollars , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Rabin - Havt says .
Some opponents of CarusoneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s efforts argue that heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s attempting to stifle BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s free speech .
Carusone , who has focused on First Amendment issues in his law studies , says free - speech rights are something Americans should Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ cherish and treat responsibly , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  and he is quick to point out that no one is telling Beck what he can and canÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t say .
CarusoneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s position is that someone who Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ willfully and routinely asserts distortions as factÃ¢â‚ ¬Â should not be given such a prominent platform .
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s why he goes after the advertisers — itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s an attempt , he says , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ to take away the financial incentive to lie , because the more you reward the lies with increased advertising dollars , the more lies you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll see .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â 
Other critics say that by going after Glenn BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s advertisers Carusone is barking up the wrong tree .
Why not target Fox News president Roger Ailes , or the networkÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s owner , News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch ?
Carusone has already tried that , he says — to no avail , unsurprisingly .
Says Mark Crispin Miller , a professor of media ecology at New York University , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Murdoch suffers from Nixon - like pathological stubbornness .
The more people criticize him — even if they are in his own family — the more he digs in his heels .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
ADVERTISEMENT
Fox News claims not to be worried about the Glenn Beck advertiser boycott , saying that companies have simply moved their commercials to other shows and time slots .
The commercial breaks during Glenn Beck these days are populated by lower - tier advertisers , such as the Jewelry Exchange and Sun Setter Retractable Awnings , and many of the spots run longer than the usual 30 seconds .
At one point , to save face , Fox News tried to make it look like business as usual by running free Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ bonus adsÃ¢â‚
¬
Â from sponsors that had previously pulled their spots from BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s show .
Carusone caught on to this practice quickly and brought it to the attention of the advertisers who , in turn , reiterated their positions to Fox News .
Things are even more embarrassing in the U.K. , where Glenn Beck is broadcast by News CorpÃ¢â‚¬â€œowned Sky TV .
For more than three months , the show has nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t had a single sponsor , so the network runs Sky News briefs in the slots where advertising would normally appear .
From Fox NewsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s perspective , however , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s probably worth losing the advertisers , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â says Peter Gardiner , chief media officer at Deutsch Inc. Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Beck attracts people to the network , and Fox hopes he will feed viewers to the other shows .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Gardiner adds that Murdoch can quite easily Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ deal with any lossesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â from Glenn Beck , since Fox News as a whole is hugely profitable .
As Carusone prepares to graduate from law school , he is still a bit cagey about his future plans .
He says he has nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t filed any rÃƒÂ©sumÃ ƒÂ©s with law firms ( or anywhere else , for that matter ) , and he wonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t directly answer questions as to whether he will join a media - watchdog organization or , perhaps , launch his own .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ How I can best help remains to be seen , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he says , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ but I have a few ideas .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
ADVERTISEMENT
One idea that is not on the table is giving up the StopBeck campaign .
On the contrary , Carusone is mounting similar campaigns targeting Sarah Palin , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and CNN .
Carusone only started with Glenn Beck , he says , because Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ he made himself an easy target .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â However , he insists that his motivation for launching the StopBeck campaign was not to force Glenn Beck off the air — he merely wanted to make Beck accountable and sponsors responsible for the programming they support , he says .
With BeckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s massive audience and his status as the patron saint of the Tea Party movement , heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not likely to find himself out of a job anytime soon .
But the StopBeck campaign has put Fox News in a tricky situation .
If the network continues to ignore the advertiser boycott , it will continue to lose revenue and suffer the indignity of having laughably small - time companies sponsor its second - highest - rated show ( The OÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ Reilly Factor is the highest - rated ) .
But if it asks
Beck to tone down his rabble - rousing rhetoric , it risks losing credibility with its viewers .
As Carusone says , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Ultimately , Fox hoped I would go away .
I wonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t.Ã¢â‚¬Â

We seem to be at the point now where the only new news is actually just a series of cock - ups on the part of the gaming journalists .
Playstation magazine claimed that Big and Small guns had been merged , but they also claimed that Obsidian added a * new * Energy Weapons skill .
You know , because Energy Weapons have n't been around since the start , right ?

Posted : Mon Mar 29 , 2010 1:38 am " This is more closely aligned with the PC originals - sharing characters and story elements . "
I do n't know if this is old news or what , but has anyone heard if there 's going to be recurring characters from the first and second fallouts ?
Travesty !
Bethesda's already raped the continuity , now they plan on raping the memory .
EDIT : I decided to go over these scans in detail .
" Super mutants are back - so expect to learn more about their origins . "
Wait , so there 's a different story than the one we learned in Fallout 1 ?
Apart from the usual crap , that 's all that stuck out .
To the second page .
" excellent VATS system "
" The opening is much less laborious than the birth - childhood - vault slog of Fallout 3 "
Maybe if they made the opening interesting and the characters less transparent , it would n't be such a " slog , " and players would n't want to " get out into the action quicker . "
" The most noticeable difference in New Vegas however is the extent to which your actions affect the world . "
That 's what they said about Fallout 3 is n't it ?
Why can't they just call a spade a spade and say , " Bethesda is trying to do stuff in this game which just is n't possible with their shitty engine . "
" GM hates : no dog companion ? : sad face : "

They never explained why FO3's mutants were kidnapping humans to turn them into more super mutants or how they were even organized .
What we do know however is that FO3's EEV is heavily modified gonorrhea which made their dingdongs fall off leaving a black crater between their legs and made them barely smarter than a goat effectively turning them all into girls .
The fact that 99 % of east coast mutants will attack you on sight is a side - effect of PMS .
Exhibit A .
Now we know both the smarter " male " type west coast super mutants and " female " type east coast ones will run into each other in the state of Nevada where prostitution is legal .
This had to all be part of the master 's plan , the debauchery that will ensue from such a meeting would 1 ) fulfill his tentacular fantasies and 2 ) create a new strain of Super FEV / EEV / AIDS that would produce a new super mutant capable of breeding with anything and Copyright infrigement � 2010 Bethesda Softworks LLC , a ZeniMax Media company .

If that 's the explanation given in New Vegas , I might buy it out of principle .
Wanted , to serve their country : a few ( thousand ) good dogs .
As it guards the borders and hunts for terrorists , the Department of Homeland Security relies on an elite squad of about 2,000 canines to sniff for bombs , drugs and smuggled cash .
Now the department is moving to expand its four - legged force by 3,000 — about 600 dogs a year over the next five years — according to a recent bid solicitation aimed at small breeders across the country .
Males and females ages 12 months to 36 months are eligible .
The department is looking for Labrador retrievers , golden retrievers , German shepherds , Dutch shepherds , Belgian Malinois “ or other working , herding or sporting breeds with prior approval . ”
Homeland Security says no training is necessary — their experts will handle that .
But the candidates must be “ alert , active , outgoing , confident ” and “ extremely tolerant of people , ” according to the solicitation , which sets a July 23 deadline .
Depending on their proposed uses , the dogs will be subject to a series of tests for courage and toughness , including the ability to disregard blows from a stick .
Among the biggest canine users is Customs and Border Protection , which includes the Border Patrol .
Customs officers have about 550 canine teams at ports of entry , and the Border Patrol has an additional 850 teams in the border regions .
The dogs have helped save “ literally thousands of lives a year ” by tracking illegal immigrants who have strayed into remote areas without enough food and water , said Clark Larson , who runs the customs and border agency ’s canine program “ There is no technology that trumps the cold nose of a dog . ”
Dogs also help the Federal Emergency Management Agency hunt for survivors or remains after disasters .
They board ships with the Coast Guard and sniff for bombs for the Secret Service .
The Transportation Security Administration is requesting $ 71 million this year to set up 275 new explosives - detection canine teams in airports .
Some security experts believe dogs could be cheaper and more effective in screening airline passengers than high - tech body imagers or metal detectors .
The Department of Homeland Security has not adopted that view , but Secretary Janet Napolitano did tell lawmakers earlier this year that she favors a greater reliance on man ’s best friend for all sorts of tasks .
“ Senator , I love dogs , ” she told Sen . Al Franken ( D - Minn . ) .
“ Me , too .
Me , too , ” he interjected .
“ We all love dogs , ” she said .
“ Dogs can be trained to sniff narcotics , bulk cash , arms … explosives — and we ’re using them in all those ways in airports and at ports of entry along the land . ”
She said the department is “ increasing the number of dogs as fast as we can . ”
In 2008 , the department ’s inspector general examined the customs and border agency ’s canine program and pronounced it a success .
From April 2006 through June 2007 , the agency bought 322 untrained dogs at a cost of $ 1.46 million , or an average price of $ 4,535 each — a reasonable cost , the inspector general found .
The dogs were extremely effective , the examination concluded : Although only 4 % of the Border Patrol ’s agents were canine handlers , they were credited with 60 % of drug arrests and 40 % of all other apprehensions in 2007 .
There are occasional problems .
A customs Belgian Malinois attacked a 4 - year - old girl at Dulles International Airport in February , causing wounds to her abdomen that required 20 stitches , according to news reports .
But the successes have piled up .
At Newark Airport last March , a 3 - year - old Belgian Malinois named Pistol sniffed out a duffel bag containing more than 50 pounds of cocaine with a street value of $ 1.6 million .
Dogs typically work for about 10 years , Larson said .
They are not eligible for federal retirement benefits , but they do have a golden parachute of sorts :
When they are too old to work , they often are adopted by their human partners .
“ Their pension is sitting nicely by the fireplace with the handler , ” he said .

" More than 500 million people in rural India are watching cable television and as more and more try to replicate the lifestyles they see portrayed so fleshily , they see how each child reduces the possibility of being part of this upwardly mobile curve , " he said .
Chatroulette , the anonymous video - chat service sweeping the Internet , has a problem : the penis .
Specifically , the abundance of them .
But the site 's doing something about it .
The problem , as Chatroulete users know , is that for every pianist performing on the site , there 's a dozen other - well , you know - enjoying their own performances as well .
The combination of anonymous chat and male exhibitionism can simply prove too much for some , scandalizing Barnard co-eds and doe - eyed CNET ( and former PCMag reporter ) Natali Del Conte alike .
Fortunately , there 's a solution .
Chatroulette founder Andrey Ternovskiy told AllThingsD's Drake Martinet that the site is " making some changes to the ' reporting people ' function , which is designed to cut down on the male genitalia that famously crops up throughout the site . "
A quick 30 - plus sessions proved the point , the article reports .
Unfortunately , poor Drake still faced a few upright middle fingers , supposedly an " accepted greeting " .
Oh , and Martinet also reports on some other Chatroulette 2.0 things , such as Chessroulette ( why chat when you can play ... chess ) and the difficulties of converting the site to an iPad - friendly format .
But really , who cares ?
AUSTIN — Immigration now is a wedge issue in Texas Republican politics - dividing the traditional conservative coalition , pitting social conservatives against hard - liners .
Evangelical ministers in Texas and across the nation are splitting off from the hard right , declaring immigration reform is needed that includes a path to citizenship without first deporting millions of illegal immigrants .
That aligns evangelicals with conservative Republican businessmen who want reform because they want the labor .
But it puts the evangelicals at odds with the fiscal and hard right conservatives who take the position that illegal immigrants broke the law and should be deported before being given a chance to re-enter the country .
" It may split the old conservative coalition .
It 's not going to split the new one , " said Richard Land , a Houston native who is president of the Southern Baptist Convention 's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission .
" If the conservative coalition is going to be a governing coalition , it 's going to have to include an awful lot of Hispanics , and you 're not going to bring an awful lot of Hispanics into your coalition with anti-Hispanic immigration rhetoric , " Land said .
State Rep. Leo Berman , R - Tyler , who is pushing for a tough Arizona - style immigration law for Texas , said evangelical ministers who promote immigration reform risk losing their congregations and the White House in the future .
Pursuit of balance
" It could cause a divide in the right .
There 's no question about it , " Berman said .
" The right in Texas , the Baptist , the Methodists , the Episcopalians , the people on the right , just do n't want to see that happen .
So , they might be causing problems within their own churches . "
A federal court halted implementation of major portions of the Arizona law on Wednesday .
The U.S. Pastor Council , an evangelical group based in Houston , organized ministers across America on July 4 to talk to their congregations about a " solid balance between justice ( the rule of law ) and compassion ( treating all people with dignity and respect ) . "
Rick Scarborough , an evangelical minister who runs Vision America in Lufkin said he agrees with the position of some of his fellow ministers in principle but does not believe any reform will work until the borders are secure .
Scarborough said he believes liberals are co-opting Land and others to promote amnesty for illegal immigrants .
" What the average rank and file ( evangelicals ) , 70 percent of them will tell you they want nothing done until our border is secure , " Scarborough said .
However , he added he does not believe anything will be done on immigration or border security until after this year 's elections .
" It 's as hot as it can be in the hearts and minds of the people , but the political class on neither side wants to deal with it right now , " he said .
" Both of them see it as a losing proposition . "
In the Texas governor 's race , Republican Gov. Rick Perry and Democrat Bill White have been treading carefully .
White , whom critics claim presided over a " sanctuary city " while mayor of Houston , generally does not mention immigration unless it is brought up in a question from his audience .
Perry , who has said he opposes an Arizona - style law for Texas , emphasizes border security .
During a recent visit to Aspen , Colo. , for a meeting of Republican governors he outlined a potential path to citizenship .
Need the workers
Bill Hammond , president of the Republican - leaning Texas Association of Business , said the state 's businesses need the foreign workers , especially in hospitality , agriculture and construction .
Immigration , Hammond said , is an issue that 's " dividing us from our traditional friends .
We would cross swords on this one . "
Berman said he believes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants is a path to creating Democratic voters .
" There 's 25 million in the United States - you can't listen to the 8 million to 12 million numbers that come out of Washington every day - you 're going to create an instant 25 million Democrats , " Berman said .
" I do n't think these evangelical leaders understand that . "
Land said what evangelical leaders are promoting is not amnesty .
He said immigration reform should first secure the border and then the path to citizenship should be a decade - long process of registration , paying fines , learning English and applying for citizenship behind those who followed the legal route .
" The idea that there is the political will to extricate 12 - to 14 million people and return them to their home country of origin is delusional , " Land said .
" You start thinking about all the ugly pictures that would emerge if it was tried , any political will that was mustered would be dissipated pretty quickly : parents being separated from their children ; children returned to countries they 've never seen . "
But for evangelicals , Land said there also is a practical reason to support immigration reform .
Some of the greatest growth in the Southern Baptist Church is among Hispanics who have been converted .
" We do n't ask them for their green card before we witness to them , " Land said .
" I would ultimately argue this is a Kingdom issue , an issue of the Kingdom of God . "

Why ALL drugs should be legalised , by Jane Asher
Jane Asher : ' It 's a complex argument '
She shot to fame in the Swinging Sixties but was always seen as one of that decade 's more sensible stars .
However , Jane Asher has gone against that reputation by delivering an outburst in which she called for class - A drugs to be legalised .
The 64 - year - old actress , who famously dated Sir Paul McCartney during the 1960s , says legalisation of all banned substances is ' the only hope ' for tackling
widespread addiction across Britain .
Miss
Asher made the comments after returning from Glasgow , where she had been working on the latest series of BBC1 comedy The Old Guys .
Some of the filming was at BBC Scotland 's Pacific Quay headquarters , which are close to the notoriously deprived area of Govan , home to fictional Glaswegian Rab C Nesbitt .
She said : ' I really got out and about when I was staying in Glasgow .
I'm a Londoner , I 'm a city girl , and I 'll wander through anywhere .
' I could see there were some pockets of deprivation in some areas of Glasgow , which is upsetting , but like London or any big city , it has its social problems , not just specifically Govan .
' But one of the areas we drove through to go filming on location one day was notorious for drugs . '
The actress added : ' Do n't get me started on the whole drugs thing .
They should legalise the lot of them as far as I 'm concerned .
That 's the only hope .
But it 's far too complex an argument .
' There are so many legal highs out there just now , which are incredibly dangerous because they have n't been tested and yet they are readily available to buy over the internet .
I 'm with him :
In her days as Paul McCartney 's girlfriend
' It 's a mad situation - we 're chasing after something we can never catch up with .
Anyone who pretends that the policies on drugs have worked is talking nonsense , ' she told the Daily Record .
Miss Asher lives in Chelsea with her cartoonist husband , Gerald Scarfe .
The couple have three children , Katie , 36 , Alex , 30 and Rory , 26 .
She became a household name in 1963 when she began dating Paul McCartney at the height of Beatlemania .
However , they called off their engagement in 1968 after he cheated on her with American model Francie Schwartz .
As well as acting , Miss Asher has written novels and lifestyle books .
She also runs a company that makes cakes , which led to her being dubbed ' the personification of prim ' by satirist Victor Lewis - Smith .
David Raynes , head of the National Drugs Prevention Alliance , described Miss Asher 's comments as ' irrational ' .
' If we legalise drugs , it will simply lead to more drug use , not less , ' he said .
' We should be stopping people using them . '
U.S. stock buybacks are back .
According to Morningstar , U.S. companies have already announced over $ 150 billion stock buybacks this year , which is a huge increase from the less than $ 20 billion announced during the same period last year .
While enormous , these new cash commitments are just a fraction of the $ 1 trillion U.S. non-financial companies have sitting on their balance sheets .
So is this good news or bad news ?
Well , for the stocks in the near - term , additional buying support provides price support , and if you think a company is undervalued then you should be happy with it buying back its shares since this will increase the value per share of its remaining shares .
Paying nickels for dimes is a good deal , as long as your dimes do n't turn out being pennies as was the case with many buyback programs ahead of the financial crisis .
Still though , given the depressed prices these days , buybacks are probably good deals for many U.S. companies , such as say a Pepsi ( PEP ) or McDonald 's ( MCD ) which I happen to think are undervalued relative to the enormous global franchises they are today and where they 'll be in five years .
Thing is , even if individual companies are getting a decent deal for their buybacks ( let 's assume all are for the moment ) , in terms of the greater economy right now , a surge in buybacks might signal that U.S. companies do n't see many expansion opportunities right now , or that they are n't confident in the sustainability of current U.S. GDP growth .
Money used for buybacks is money that is n't used for creating jobs , research , or new business lines .
Thus buybacks might be good for some individual stocks while at the same time signaling sluggish U.S. growth ahead .

The grill in these pictures belongs to my friend , Eric .
He brought it over for a meal a while back , and I decided to hang on to it for a few days .
I have fed him a couple times to ease the transition .
Full tummies have a tendency to demotivate people from doing things like take back their grills .
Thanks for the grill , Eric !
Good luck getting it back !
The recipe I used for this marinade is just one of thousands of possible marinades .
The key components of any marinade are salt and sugar .
These two substances , once dissolved in a liquid , are part of what gets flavor into the meat .
If you want to learn more about marinading , read my article on brining pork chops .
It is very informative , and the recipe I provide works well for poultry too .
Leaders of 21 state Tea Party groups , representing about 10,000 people , said Sunday they have been betrayed by Tom Tancredo and in an open letter beseeched the former congressman not to run for governor as a third - party candidate .
Tancredo has given Republican gubernatorial candidates until noon today to commit to pulling out of the governor ’s race after the primary if polls show the winner trailing Democrat John Hickenlooper .
If that does n’t happen , Tancredo says , he ’ll run for governor as the American Constitution Party candidate .
Tancredo ’s declaration last week — the most recent drama to plague the state ’s GOP gubernatorial primary — sparked anger among the diffuse Tea Party groups around Colorado .
Those leaders say it was Tancredo who had always urged them to work within the Republican Party , rather than splinter it .
He has long inspired fierce loyalty from the groups because of his stance on illegal immigration .
“ Together our groups strongly urge you to reconsider , withdraw your ultimatum , stay in the Republican Party , let the process play out for the governor ’s race , ” said the letter signed by 21 active Tea Party and 9.12 groups .
“ In other words , to trust and respect the newly awakened , energized and informed voters of Colorado . ”
The letter said that if Tancredo carries out his promise , it means an “ impending disaster , assuring victory for Mayor Hickenlooper and the liberal agenda in Colorado for at least four more years . ”
The letter also cited an unscientific survey of Tea Party members that suggested 66 percent would not vote for Tancredo in the governor ’s race .
Don Rodgers , leader of the Pikes Peak Patriots in Colorado Springs , said Tancredo has contradicted himself .
“ He said a third party or a minor party would be suicidal .
He encouraged us to get involved , and we had thousands of people who did just that , ” Rodgers said .
“ They became delegates .
They did it through the process .
Because
Tom did n’t like who they had chosen , he gave us this ultimatum . ”
Fallout after ultimatum
Tancredo said Sunday he received the letter and more than 100 separate e-mails .
He called Tea Partyers new members of “ the establishment . ”
Asked about the letter he wrote to the grassroots ’ groups in 2009 , encouraging them to work together , he said , “ it ’s interesting that many of them chastised me at the time for encouraging party unity .
“ I think they should use their energy to urge their candidates to accept this pledge and when they do , they do n’t have to worry about me , ” he said , noting he ’s gotten many letters of support , as well .
“ I will not be a factor .
I will walk away . ”
GOP gubernatorial hopeful Scott McInnis is weathering allegations of plagiarism after The Denver Post reported portions of a water essay he authored were nearly identical to an essay written by state Supreme Court Justice Gregory J. Hobbs .
McInnis ’ primary opponent , Dan Maes , is considered weak by GOP - establishment types , yet won a majority of the votes at the state ’s spring GOP convention among the grass roots .
“ The ballots are out , let ’s let the people have a say , ” said Jennifer Bailey , president of the Western Slope Conservative Alliance , which signed the letter .
“ I think we ’re all intelligent enough to weigh what ’s gone on and let ’s let the people speak . ”
State GOP chairman Dick Wadhams , who issued a similar plea last week , said he sympathized with the Tea Party groups and agreed with them .
“ This deadline is a phony deadline created by him only so it will give him some superficial cover to announce his candidacy , ” Wadhams said .
“ This letter from 9.12 leaders clearly shows the only person who thinks this is a good idea is Tom Tancredo . ”

However , despite the intelligence shown in their great escape , the primates appeared unsure as to what to do with their newfound freedom : the monkeys remained by the gates of the research centre and were lured back into captivity by scientists armed with peanuts .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has not commented on the bill , which he signed into law Tuesday night .
Jindal signs guns - in - church law
Louisiana GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal has signed a law allowing holders of concealed - weapons permits to carry guns into houses of worship .
The bill , signed Tuesday night , allows permit holders who take an additional eight hours of tactical training each year to bring a gun into “ any church , synagogue , mosque or other similar place of worship . ”

The bill , sponsored by GOP state Rep. Henry Burns , also requires that the head of the house of worship announce either verbally or in a weekly newsletter to the congregation that its members may be carrying weapons .
Burns ’s original bill was killed by a Senate committee , but he was able to revive the proposal by tacking it onto another bill , which extended the length of concealed weapons permits from four years to five years at an annual cost of $ 25 .
The bill will go into effect on August 15 .
Jindal has not commented on the bill , which was signed along with 940 others the state legislature sent him during the most recent session .
Black ’s Law Dictionary defines “ treason ” as ” attempting to overthrow the government of the state to which one owes allegiance , either by making war against the state or by materially supporting its enemies ” .
Submitted here are ten people who did their level best to see that America could n’t celebrate her official 234th birthday this week .
And yes , this list is “ too American . ”
10 Jane Fonda
During the height of the Vietnam war in 1972 , film starlet Jane Fonda visited North Vietnam and shilled for the North Vietnamese government , screeching that American prisoners of war ( POWs ) were being treated humanely .
She then went on to condemn all US soldiers as “ war criminals ” .
On hearing that many POWs claimed to have been tortured , Fonda denounced them as “ liars ” .
She encountered no legal or professional repercussions upon her return to the US , but claims to deeply regret her actions today .
How nice for her .
9 Adam Yahiye Gadahn
An American - born convert to Islam , Adam Yahiye Gadahn ( aka , “ Azzam the American ” ) threatened a terrorist attack on Los Angeles in a 2005 Al Qaeda video .
As a full - on member of their “ media committee ” , Gadahn served Al Qaeda as translator , video producer , cultural interpreter and spokesman .
His zeal in their propaganda was cartoonish in its intensity , but all too real .
After Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al - Zawahiri endorsed the videos — some of which referred to the United States as “ enemy soil ” –the Justice Department indicted Gadahn , the first American accused of treason since World War Two .
It is widely believed that “ Azzam the American ” is now “ Azzam the Dead American ” ; following reports that he was killed by a Predator drone in January 2008 .
8 Aldrich Ames
Aldrich Ames began working for the CIA during high school , and did so until he was discovered to be a Soviet double agent in 1994 .
He specialized in selling the identities of CIA agents , placed within the KGB , to the KGB .
In true cloak - and - dagger fashion , Ames would mark a blue postal drop box with a piece of chalk whenever he needed to contact his KGB handlers .
The damage he caused US intelligence efforts can’t really be known , but conservative estimates indicate that he exposed over 100 agents , and was directly responsible for at least 10 deaths .
A thorough accounting of his finances revealed that he and his wife made over $ 4.6 million over the course of their espionage career .
Ames explained the full extent of his activities as part of a plea bargain to mitigate his wife ’s sentence ( how gallant ) .
As a result , Ames was sentenced to life in prison , while his wife received 63 months .
7 Tokyo Rose
“ Tokyo Rose ” is a collective nickname applied to not one , but several sultry - voiced women who worked for Radio Tokyo during World War 2 .
In between popular songs , these sirens cooed Japanese propaganda designed to make American soldiers nostalgic and homesick .
UCLA grad Iva Toguri D’Aquino was the most infamous .
An American citizen of Japanese descent , she worked as a Radio Tokyo announcer from 1943 - 1945 .
Immediately after the war , D’Aquino was arrested , but released without being charged .
Authorities reopened her case with a vengeance in 1948 , and she was promptly convicted of treason in 1949 .
D’Aquino served six years in prison .
Throughout her trial she denied any disloyalty to the US , and prosecutors did n’t present a single radio broadcast as evidence against her .
In fact , critical testimony against her was later found to be false and coerced , to the extent that President Gerald Ford pardoned D’Aquino in 1977 .
6 Aaron Burr
Yes , an American Vice President was also one of its greatest traitors .
Fresh off his duel with Alexander Hamilton , Aaron Burr noticed his political career was now as dead as Hamilton was .
So he looked fondly on the Louisiana territory , with its disputed borders , and residents toying with secessionist notions .
Burr believed a small army could steal Louisiana away , so he contacted Britain ’s ambassador , offering to help Britain take the territory .
In return , Burr wanted money and ships .
But he also needed a general .
So Burr sent the infamous “ Cipher Letter ” to General James Wilkinson , Commander - in - Chief of the US Army , detailing the plot and requesting his services .
However , Wilkinson believed the plan would fail , and ratted him out to President Thomas Jefferson .
Thus , on December 9 , 1806 , the US Army seized most of Burr ’s boats and supplies .
But Burr knew it was REALLY over when he saw a New Orleans newspaper article with a verbatim copy of the Cipher Letter to Britain .
Burr appeared in court and was not initially indicted , but fled when asked to appear a second time .
After recapture , he was found not guilty , due to a very precise Supreme Court reading of the Constitution ’s definition of treason .
He then fled to Europe but returned after four years , finding work as an attorney .
5 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
In 1953 , Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were the first American civilians executed under Section 2 of the Espionage Act. Charges related to passing atomic bomb secrets to Russian agents ( the data came from Ethel ’s brother , who worked on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos ) .
Their legal prosecution was the “ Trial of the Century ” ( prior to O.J. , at least ) , and many felt the couple were unfairly convicted .
However , recently declassified cables from the Soviet Union ’s VENONA project , now support testimony that Julius was , indeed , a courier and recruiter for the USSR .
In fact , Morton Sobell , who was tried along with the Rosenbergs ( and served 17 years in prison ) , admitted in 2008 that yes , he was a spy , and that Julius Rosenberg handed atomic bomb information to the Soviets .
4 Robert Hanssen
Robert Hanssen is a former FBI agent who spied for Soviet and Russian intelligence services against the United States for 22 years ( 1979 to 2001 ) .
During his espionage career Hanssen compromised scores of investigations and operations , including the surveillance of suspected mole Felix Bloch , and completed an eavesdropping tunnel directly under the Soviet Embassy decoding room .
At one time , he even became responsible for apprehending himself , and he passed some of that off to Aldrich Ames ( above ) .
Worse , however , were his leaks to the USSR of every KGB agent contacting the FBI — conveniently identifying detected double - agents and prospective defectors alike .
The FBI was so flummoxed at finding Hanssen , they had to buy the information to put him away ( most of which they already had ) .
Cash and Hanssen ’s carelessness eventually led to his capture , and in 2001 he pled guilty to 13 counts of espionage in the United States .
He was then sentenced to life in prison , without the possibility of parole , and can be found in America ’s “ Supermax ” prison , where he remains in his cell , alone , 23 hours a day .
Many have described his activities as “ possibly the worst intelligence disaster in US history . ”
3 Nidal Malik Hasan
Nidal Malik Hasan was a U.S. Army Major , and the sole suspect in a shooting at the Fort Hood military base , only weeks before he would have deployed to Afghanistan .
Prior to the shooting , Hasan had repeatedly expressed extremist views , most of which had been communicated to his superiors and the FBI .
The Feds had even monitored his e-mails to Imam Anwar al - Awlaki , also known as the “ Bin Laden of the Internet ” .
Sadly , political correctness and a slow - moving investigation prevented the Army from taking action before Hasan murdered 13 people and wounded 30 others .
Oddly , the Pentagon never mentions Hasan ’s Islamism in its entire 86 - page review of the incident .
Never mind that during the attack , he was not in uniform , but dressed in traditional Muslim clothing , and was shooting unarmed victims while shouting “ Allah Ackbar ” .
Hasan currently resides under heavy guard at the Brooke Army Medical Center in Houston , Texas , reportedly a paraplegic .
2 John Walker , Jr.
In 1967 , Navy communications officer John Walker , Jr. snuck into the Soviet Embassy in Washington , D.C. , and offered to sell secrets .
He then handed over settings for the KL - 47 cipher machine , which decoded sensitive US Navy messages .
His motivations were purely financial , and he proved to be a screaming bargain : over the next 17 years , Walker gave the KGB the locations of all American nuclear submarines , as well as the procedures the US would follow to launch nuclear missiles at the Soviet Union in the event of war .
The Soviets also learned the locations of underwater microphones tracking Soviet nuclear submarines .
Moreover , KGB agents learned every American troop and air movement to Vietnam from 1971 - 1973 , and they passed this on to their allies , including the planned sites and times for U.S. airstrikes against North Vietnam .
According to Vitaly Yurchenko , a KGB defector , “ It was the greatest case in KGB history .
We deciphered millions of your messages .
If there had been a war , we would have won it . ”
1 Benedict Arnold
His name is synonymous with disloyalty .
During the American Revolutionary War , Arnold began the war in the Continental Army , but later defected to the British Army .
While still a general on the American side , he became Commander of the West Point fort in New York , and offered to surrender it to the British .
After the plot came to light , in September 1780 , Arnold joined the British Army as a brigadier general , with a sizable pension and £ 6,000 signing bonus .
Many believe that he was frustrated at being passed over for promotion , sickened by others taking credit for his achievements , and tired of ( groundless ) accusations that he exacted private property for the use of the army .
In fact , Congressional investigations later found Arnold had spent much of his own money on the American war effort .
Much like Aaron Burr ( above ) Arnold ’s plan unraveled due to an intercepted document : when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers revealing the proposed surrender of West Point , Arnold fled to a British ship docked on the Hudson river , narrowly escaping the forces of one highly pissed off George Washington .
Britain quickly secured Arnold ’s services , and he led British raids in Virginia , New London and Groton , Connecticut , before the war ended with the American victory at Yorktown .
Arnold died in London , and monuments to him there are ambiguous at best .

The Irish ship , MV Rachel Corrie , was tampered with by the Israeli Defense Forces according to Colonel Itzik Turgeman .
The Rachel Corrie was planned to be the first ship to arrive into Gazan waters last weekend but was delayed due to mechanical problems now suspected to be a form of sabotage .
An Israel newspaper reported “ A senior officer in the Israel Defence Forces hinted that the IDF sabotaged the engines of five ships , saying “ they took care of them . ”
The Colonel also told the newspaper that the army decided not to sabotage the Turkish ferry , Mavi Mamara which was attacked on Monday .
Currently the Rachel Corrie is in a holding position in the eastern Mediterranean Sea .
According to , Free Gaza Movement ’s , Greta Berlin the Rachel Corrie is waiting for the Challenger II ship , which was damaged during the attacks .
The Rachel Corrie will pick up more passengers , including human rights activists and journalists , before continuing their journey toward Gaza .
Perdana Global Peace Organisation ( PGPO ) chairman , Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad , who is representing the six Malaysian passengers on board the Rachel Corrie , said “ the ship was going to sail through Gaza waters and it had nothing to do with Israel .
“ They are not going to Israeli waters .
Why is it that these Israelis are going to block people going towards Gaza and not using Israeli ’s territorial waters at all ?
They have no right . ”
Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen has already said that there will be “ serious consequences ” if any harm comes to the Irish passengers on board .
Niamh Moloughney , who organized the ships sailing from Ireland , said “ I ’d say the mood on board is resilient and steadfast .
When people signed up to this they knew what might happen …
We expected we would be confronted and there would be a stand - off , but no one expected this .
But there ’s never really been a question of the boat turning back . ”
Denis Halliday , one of the crew members on board , originally from Galway , said that he had spoken to Irish Foreign Minister , Micheál Martin and the crew felt encouraged by the international support they are receiving .
“ He was very reassuring that the government was behind us and he gave us a complete green light to do what we ’re doing and he ’ll protect us as much as he can , ” siad Halliday .
Over Tuesday morning there have also been reports of the launch of Turkish naval escorts for additional humanitarian sailings and an Egyptian border crossing .
The is no direct information to show that the Turkish ships will support the Rachel Corrie and it is believed that the Egyptian ’s opening their border is simply a way of demonstrating their outrage at the situation .
The 1,200 - metric ton boat is carrying five Irish , six Malaysians and “ medical equipment , wheel chairs , school supplies and cement ” all of which had already been inspected for contraband before leaving Dundalk , Ireland .

As the first semester of 2010 comes to a close , the IP v4 address pool has dropped to 6 % .
Another year and we will probably celebrate ( mourn ? ) the end of the IANA IP v4 pool .
As Vint Cerf commented on the topic of depletion in an e-mail to Bob Hinden : ' Sic transit Gloria Mundi ' .
The view of an abyss or the fear of judgment day always focuses attention and as a result IP v6 adoption is finally picking up speed .
The Google invitational IPv6 Conference in Mountain View clearly illustrated the point .
On the transport side tier1 ISP's have their networks very much ready for the anticipated traffic surge while a rapidly increasing number of tier2 ISP 's upgrade their upstream connectivity to dual stack .
On the content side , kudos undoubtedly go to Google who progressively made its content accessible in IP v6 including Youtube since February .
Needless to say that this created a rather noticeable increase in IP v6 traffic .
Some major content providers such as Yahoo and Facebook are also coming along .
It can be easily assumed that if the top 10 of the Alexa 500 most popular websites are IP v6 accessible the long tail will follow .
The Content Distribution Networks remain relatively timid with the exception of Limelight and Netflix .
Here lies an opportunity for the early movers ; the growing IP v6 content volumes are theirs to gain .
One gaping hole remains the lack of adequate support in some major load balancing products but alternatives are available on the market .
The other front which has been creating a persistent concern is CPE , Customer Premise Equipment .
It was refreshing to hear D - Link say that 5 million of their boxes shipped are IPv6 - ready .
Installed bases of ADSL and Cable modems bases have workaround mechanisms and new ones being installed are IP v6 ready .
Outstanding issues often mentioned by everybody in the ecosystem remain lack of training of technical and support staff and the upgrade of back - office systems as well for IT staff to upgrade DNS systems , websites and e-mail systems .
A field of opportunities for consulting firms as this becomes more pressing .
While all these activities are underway to forklift the ' old internet ' , the mobile broadband internet continues to grow all around it .
The iPhone , iPad and other Androids have ushered the need for true Mobile Broadband .
This in turn forces the carriers to accelerate their LTE plans ever more .
As of june 7th the GSMA counted 80 operators in 33 countries with firm commitments , up from 64 just two months ago .
In the meantime , a further 30 operators are currently in trial mode for LTE making for a total of 110 operators in 44 countries .
The ball is undeniably rolling faster and faster .
Last weeks '
Google IP v6 gathering saw presentations by Verizon and T - Mobile which perfectly illustrated the immediate necessity of IP v6 in the mobile world .
Verizon will offer its first IP v6 phones in 2011 .
If one considers that some market researchers project that the sales of smartphones including iPad and iPadlike devices could surpass ' traditional ' devices , meaning desktops and laptops , within two or three years , we should be in for most interesting times indeed .
It is only fitting that Google CEO , Eric Schmidt , mentioned in his address at the GSM World Congress in Barcelona back in February that support of mobility is a priority in all Google product development .
IPv6 for the masses , masses of IP v6 addresses is within sight .
He was the local weatherman , sending up weather balloons twice a day above this remote community of 450 full - time residents near Bristol Bay and preparing short - term forecasts for pilots and fishermen .
She was a stay - at - home mom who drove their 4 - year - old to preschool , sang in the town choir and picked berries with her girlfriends .
She took part in the community play , in which she portrayed a fairy godmother who acted as a prosecutor in court , confronting the Big Bad Wolf for his crimes against Little Red Riding Hood , the Three Little Pigs and the Boy Who Cried Wolf .
So beloved were Paul Rockwood Jr. and his wife , Nadia , that when they left King Salmon in May to move to England , where Nadia was born , more than 30 people — pretty much their entire circle of friends — showed up at the airport .
The choir sang “ Wherever You Go , ” and “ people were just bawling , ” said Rebecca Hamon , a friend of the couple .
What none of them could have known was that FBI agents were meeting the small turboprop plane in Anchorage to question the Rockwoods on suspicion of domestic terrorism - related crimes .
This week , Paul and Nadia Rockwood pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Anchorage to one count of willfully making false statements to the FBI ; in Paul Rockwood ’s case , it was a statement about domestic terrorism .
The plea agreements state that Rockwood , 35 , had become an adherent of extremist Islam who had prepared a list of assassination targets , including U.S. service members .
And , though no plot to carry out the killings was revealed , he had researched methods of execution , including guns and explosives , the agreements say .
Federal charging papers said his wife , 36 , who is five months pregnant with the couple ’s second child , lied to investigators when she denied knowing that an envelope she took to Anchorage in April at her husband ’s request contained a list of 15 intended targets .
( None were in Alaska . )
She told FBI agents that she thought the envelope contained a letter or a book .
She gave it to an unidentified individual who her husband believed shared his radical beliefs , the FBI said .
Nadia knew exactly what was on the list and what it was for , federal authorities said .
“ Obviously we take it very seriously when somebody starts talking about building bombs and component parts and killing citizens because of a hatred that is fueled by violent Internet sites , ” said Karen L. Loeffler , U.S. attorney for Alaska .
Loeffler , who would not elaborate on how the FBI became aware of the Rockwoods , said the investigation does not involve any other terrorism suspects , and no additional charges are expected .
The plea agreements the couple signed said Paul Rockwood converted to Islam in late 2001 or early 2002 while living in Virginia and became a follower of radical U.S. - born Muslim cleric Anwar Awlaki , now believed to be living in Yemen .
“ This included a personal conviction that it was his religious responsibility to exact revenge by death on anyone who desecrated Islam , ” his agreement said .
Here in King Salmon , where the biggest thing is the annual red salmon run — it happens to be the biggest one in the world — this has the air of a poorly written movie .
“ If all terrorists were this harmless , we ’d all be living in a much less complicated world , ” said Hamon , who lived in Camarillo before moving 12 years ago to King Salmon , on the Alaska Peninsula , 280 miles southwest of Anchorage .
“ We ’ve all been in shock , ” said Mary Swain , who was friends with Nadia and baked the birthday cake for the Rockwoods ’ son ’s party last year .
“ I mean , kids would go over to her house all the time where she was teaching them ballet .
She always went to library time , she went to story time … .
Her mom would come over here from England and stay with her for a month at a time , and people got to be friends with her too . ”
King Salmon is little more than a windy cluster of homes surrounding the airport , grocery , repair shops and a handful of bars and restaurants , with emphasis , like any fishing town , on the bars .
Populated mainly by government employees year - round , it lies on limitless fields of grassy tundra and low stands of white spruce , not far from the fishing port of Naknek on Bristol Bay and world - famous Katmai National Park .
Like most of Alaska , it is accessible only by air or small boat .
The National Weather Service paid for the couple ’s move to King Salmon after hiring Paul in 2006 as a meteorological technician .
They moved into a small tract of modern government housing populated by the many federal employees working for the National Park Service , the Fish and Wildlife Service and the weather service .
In the summertime , the populations of King Salmon and especially Naknek swell with thousands of itinerant fishermen and cannery workers .
Nadia worked to become part of the close - knit permanent community , friends and neighbors said .
Paul , because of his irregular work hours , often slept during the day and was n’t as engaged in the community .
“ He was a good employee .
I never had any problems with him , ” said Debra Elliott , his supervisor at the small , two - room building next to the airport , where the weather service shares an office with the Federal Aviation Administration .
“ He was very likable . ”
The couple told neighbors they were Muslim but , other than avoiding pork , never made an issue of their religion .
Paul had a beard , but the couple never prayed publicly .
Nadia performed Christian and secular songs with the choir in performances at the local chapel ; her husband attended with his video camera .
Loukas Barton , a National Park Service archeologist who lived next door , said the couple ’s seeming reticence about discussing their religion may have been because they were , so far as anyone here can remember , the only Muslims who have ever lived in King Salmon .
“ It ’s not uncommon in a bar here to hear some moron say , ‘ I hate Barack Obama because he ’s … a terrorist and an Ay - rab . ’
And people will swear up and down that he ’s a Muslim .
Which is really well - informed , right ? ” Barton said .
“ So for families like them , you could imagine it ’d be a little tough .
Maybe that ’s why Paul was n’t all that social .
I do n’t think he’d be welcome down at Eddie ’s , or any of the other bars in town .
He certainly did n’t look Arab or Muslim , so those kind of comments would just fly freely . ”
Hamon said Nadia was a fresh - faced , lively , fun -loving woman .
She seemed determined to embrace rural life with enthusiasm .
“ I met her and we just really hit it off .
She became a really central part of our little group of girlfriends here , ” Hamon said .
“ She did set - net fishing with us to catch salmon in summer .
She learned to smoke and can salmon … .
We learned to knit about the same time .
We ’d all get together and do crafts and stuff .
We were all very welcome in each other ’s homes .
“ There was never a feeling with Nadia that there was anything funny or secretive going on .
Paul was always very comfortable with us too , ” she said .
The couple ’s garage was a clearinghouse for fresh vegetables flown in from Washington state , and neighbors were free to let themselves in to pick up their allotments when no one was home .
The couple decided to leave because Paul had a disease of the inner ear that gave him frequent bouts of vertigo , friends said .
Barton said Paul told him at the couple ’s going - away yard sale that he also was growing tired of the annual clouds of mosquitoes and biting flies that descend each summer on King Salmon .
They were planning to move near Nadia ’s mother in Kent , England , where Paul could get better medical treatment than at the small clinic in Naknek , neighbors said .
If U.S. District Judge Ralph R. Beistline accepts the plea agreements , Paul Rockwood Jr. will serve eight years in prison followed by three years of supervised release .
Nadia Rockwood , who is free and in seclusion in Anchorage , would be sentenced to five years ’ probation and return to England .
Sentencing is set for Aug. 23 .
Some of the targets on Rockwood ’s list listened in by telephone to Wednesday ’s plea hearing in Anchorage federal court , though none of them was identified and none of them spoke .
The couple said very little , beyond entering their guilty pleas .
“ We ’ve known them since Zaid was a tiny little tyke , ” Hamon said , referring to the couple ’s son .
“ Everybody was sad they had to leave .
Then when this came out , we were all completely shocked .
It ’s just impossible for me to imagine the friend that I knew being involved in anything like this . ”

We remember well the first time we managed to put an accelerometer in our possession to good use : back when the MacBook Pros started shipping with them as sudden motion sensors to protect the hard drive , someone hooked up some light saber noises to the tilt motion .
A few months later we were pretending to make light saber noises with the Wii , and then the iPhone came along and democratized the accelerometer - based light saber noise for all of humanity .

Thirty - six dancers took the stage at the House of Blues last night in the hopes of securing just 18 spots on the 2010 - 11 Boston Celtics dance team .
Judges included " American Idol " contestant Ayla Brown , Miss Massachusetts 2010 Lacey Wilson , and New England Revolution forward Taylor Twellman .
At left , the opening number was a choreographed dance routine with a " summer party music " theme .
As Kristi Sandoval , a senior at Texas State University , pumps her legs on an elliptical machine in the schools ' gym , a tiny cord transmits the energy she creates to a metal box on the wall .
From there , the pulse enters the campus power grid , where it might go to fuel the lights above Sandoval 's head or a professor 's coffee pot across campus .
For Sandoval , just the thought of it makes her run a little faster .
" On these elliptical I do more than I 've done before on any other treadmill or exercise bike , " she said .
" I think it 's wonderful that they thought of doing something like this , because a lot of people enjoy using these machines and now we 're helping save the environment a little bit . "
Texas State , in San Marcos , is one of two state universities developing the biggest " human power " plants among just a handful on campuses across the nation — converting the sweat energy of exercising students into electricity to fuel their campuses .
A new , larger plant is being developed by the University of North Texas .
After six months of capturing student workout power at Texas State , it remains unclear if the school 's investment is paying off in power cost savings .
But some school officials say that 's not really the point .
More important , they say , is teaching students about their effect on the environment and their ability to take action to preserve it .
Details of how exactly to use the power generated by UNT students wo n't be determined until the equipment is installed in August , said Laurie Klein , UNT 's assistant director of recreational sports .
At Texas State , electricity produced by exercising students is fed back into the campus electrical grid , said Glen Hanley , director of campus recreation .
The concept of using exercise equipment to generate power is fairly new ; ReRev , a Florida - based company that partnered with Texas State and North Texas , has been in business for less than two years .
Texas State was the seventh university in the nation to buy into the concept , and the first in Texas , Hanley said .
ReRev provides technology to retrofit workout equipment to convert kinetic energy into electrical power .
What normally would be lost as heat energy is captured to power lightbulbs , air conditioning and televisions .
“ Students have grown up with green and renewable energy , " said ReRev spokeswoman Beth Bennion .
" They think it 's neat , cool and progressive . "
UNT , pending approval by university administrators , will have 36 machines .
Texas State has 30 that were installed in December .
It costs each university approximately $ 20,000 to install the human power converters .
But the amount of electricity generated is relatively unknown to both the universities and to ReRev .
Hanley said ReRev estimates Texas State will break even on the investment in seven to eight years , but said university facility administrators have said it may take as long as 15 years .
The amount of energy the machines produce greatly varies and depends on the exerciser 's weight , age and gender , which determine how intense the workout is .
Those factors , combined with a lack of field test data — because of the concept 's newness — means students are not just hamsters generating the power , but guinea pigs testing the system .
According to the company 's website , a 30 - minute workout produces 50 watt hours of electricity , though Bennion said that estimate was " very rough . "
That amount of energy could power a fluorescent light bulb for about three hours or a laptop for about one hour , according to the U.S. Department of Energy .
A student would have to exercise for about an hour and a half to keep a flat screen TV on for an hour .
And it would take an endurance athlete to power a hair dryer for an hour .
That would take more than 18 hours of exercise .
But Hanley said mass - producing energy is not the goal .
“ We 're hoping [ students ] will kind of get the concept to be more environmentally aware .
We 're hoping they will turn off their TV when they 're done with it , or they 'll turn off their light in their residence hall room , " he said .
" We knew we were not going to produce enough electricity for the whole building , but we wanted the students to be aware of what we ’re doing and to do something right for the environment . "
ISRAEL IS considering extending to east Jerusalem a law on abandoned properties , allowing the state to take control of Palestinian property worth millions of euro .
If the Israeli courts approve the move , the government will be entitled to take control of east Jerusalem buildings whose owners moved to enemy states during the 1948 - 9 Arab - Israeli war , Israel ’s war of independence , and property owned by people living in the West Bank .
Israel captured east Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab - Israeli Six -Day War .
The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as the future capital of an independent state .
The fate of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues to be decided during peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
Any unilateral decision by Israel altering the delicate status quo is bound to provoke an angry response from both the Palestinians and the international community .
Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu , who views the whole of Jerusalem as Israel ’s united capital , refused to give any public pledges , but reportedly promised US officials that Israel would refrain from “ provocations ” in Jerusalem during the period of peace talks with the Palestinians .
On Sunday , European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton , speaking at a news conference after talks with Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman , voiced concern that Israeli actions in Jerusalem may jeopardise peace prospects .
“ My fear about east Jerusalem is seeing changes that will affect our capacity to come to a solution .
It continues to concern me that if we are going to get to a solution , we need to avoid measures that make it harder for us to get there . ”
Israel ’s attorney general Yehuda Weinstein recently informed the supreme court that the state plans to apply the law on abandoned properties to east Jerusalem .
In March 1950 the nascent state of Israel passed the Absentees ’ Property Law that allowed property of Palestinian Arabs who fled to neighbouring Arab states , in most cases to avoid the fighting , to be transferred to Jewish ownership .
The measure did not apply to the West Bank and east Jerusalem , which remained under Jordanian control until the 1967 war .
After 1967 the status of properties in east Jerusalem became somewhat of a grey area , with the Israeli courts alternating between accepting and rejecting attempts to confiscate Palestinian property based on the 1950 law .
In 1968 , respected jurist Meir Shamgar , who was attorney general at the time , ruled that the law should not apply to properties of Palestinians in east Jerusalem whose owners lived in the West Bank , arguing that they could not be classified as “ absentee ” .
A similar ruling was passed by attorney general Menachem Mazuz in 2005 .
“ The properties became abandoned due to a unilateral action taken by Israel . . .
Essentially these are ‘ present owners ’ , whose property rights were stripped because of a broad , technical formulation of the law . ”
A rare and endangered species of sea turtle is being burned alive in BP ’s controlled burns of the oil swirling around the Gulf of Mexico , and a boat captain tasked with saving them says the company has blocked rescue efforts .
Mike Ellis , a boat captain involved in a three - week effort to rescue as many sea turtles from unfolding disaster as possible , says BP effectively shut down the operation by preventing boats from coming out to rescue the turtles .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ They ran us out of there and then they shut us down , they would not let us get back in there , ” Ellis said in an interview with conservation biologist Catherine Craig .
Part of BP ’s efforts to contain the oil spill are controlled burns .
Fire - resistant booms are used to corral an area of oil , then the area within the boom is lit on fire , burning off the oil and whatever marine life may have been inside .
“ Once the turtles get in there they ca n’t get out , ” Ellis said .
Dr. Brian Stacey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told NPR last week that , although there are five different species of sea turtle in the Gulf of Mexico , the majority of the ones found affected by the oil spill are Kemp ’s Ridleys , “ the rarest of them all . ”
Ellis confirmed that he ’s mostly been seeing Kemp ’s Ridleys .
ADVERTISEMENT
Mike Michael at Gather.com reports that Kemp ’s Ridleys are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act .
Harming or killing one “ carries stiff fines and civil penalties ( $ 500 - $ 25,000 ) assessed for each violation .
Criminal penalties include possible prison time and fines from $ 25,000 - $ 50,000 . ”
Michael suggests that , given the size of the fines BP could face as a result of the turtle deaths , the company may be happy to let turtles burn , as it would make it impossible to calculate exactly how many turtles died .
He notes that the bodies of dead animals are being kept as evidence to determine how much in fines BP will be liable for .
“ Is BP destroying evidence to keep their liability down ? ” he asks .
“ Is anyone going to stop them ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked if he had suffered health problems as a result of being exposed to the chemicals swirling around the Gulf , boat captain Ellis said he had been suffering from “ pretty wicked headaches , ” but said he did n’t know “ if that was just from seeing everything you know just destroyed and just disgusting . ”
The following video was posted to YouTube by Catherine Craig , June 13 , 2010 .
Obama debt commission member , Republican Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , launched a scary trial balloon on ABC News .
Gregg suggested the debt commission will likely recommend a massive $ 26.7 trillion tax increase .
Here are Gregg 's actual words :
" Everything has to be on the table - there 's no question about that ...
Erskine Bowles , one of the co-chairmen of the commission , has suggested a 75 - 25 split -- 75 percent of the savings being in spending , and 25 percent in revenues ...
I think it 's likely that there will have to be a revenue component , but it should be significantly , dramatically -- and a 3 - 1 ratio is pretty dramatic -- dramatically less than the initiatives in the spending side of the ledger . "
According to an analysis by Americans for Tax Reform if Bowles wants $ 3 in spending cuts for every $ 1 in tax hikes then the tax increases will be larger than anyone expects :
" Bowles and Gregg can only be talking about cutting $ 3 in promised Social Security and Medicare benefits in exchange for $ 1 in tax increases .
In other words , 1/4 of the unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare would be paid for with tax hikes .
So how big is that ?
According to the 2009 Social Security and Medicare Actuaries ' Report , the long - run insolvency of the Social Security and Medicare systems is $ 106.8 trillion ( with a " t " ) over the infinite horizon .
To close this gap with one - quarter tax hikes is , therefore , to raise taxes by $ 26.7 trillion .
Of course , this number is undoubtedly higher since the Obama Administration is sitting on ( read : hiding ) the 2010 version of the report ( it 's nearly six months overdue ) . "
On the heels of a huge tax increases included in the over - 2000 - page ObamaCare package , together with over - 2000 - page so - called " Financial Reform Package , " together with the expiration of the Bush tax cuts , Obama 's economic policies have guaranteed a double - dip recession .
Strap on your safety belts , because the anemic economic recovery of 2010 is about to become a government - induced second recession or double - dip in 2011 .
This outcome is baked in the cake even before any tax increases from the Obama debt commission are enacted .
If they are so greedy as to also try -- by passage of a climate control bill -- increases in energy taxes then this second recession will likely lead to deflation and a collapse into a government - sponsored depression .
The economy cannot afford more money being redirected from investments toward government spending .
Clearly from this evidence alone it is plain to see that Obama is n't judging his success based on a record of economic growth , but instead he is pursuing a program of economic redistribution .
The administration has no focus on expanding the economic pie ; instead , they are concerned with devouring every piece of the pie .
Grover Norquist , the president of Americans for Tax Reform , has been watching the Obama debt commission closely , and he concluded after hearing reports of Sen .
Gregg 's comments :
" It 's been clear from the beginning that the purpose of this Commission was to put GOP fingerprints on a tax hike , likely a VAT ...
Gregg seems to be giving them all ten fingers ...
The true agenda of this commission has always been to hide the ball on a tax hike until after the November elections - hence the December reporting date .
Gregg 's gaffe today tips their hand , "
Higher taxes are never the answer .
With the economy so weak , Congress should be making the Bush tax cuts permanent .
Taxes on capital formation and investment should be eliminated all together .
America should be encouraging small business , individual investors and entrepreneurs to be taking risks to increase economic growth in the private sector .
Instead , Obama and the socialists in Congress are embarked on a dangerous expedition to punish success .
This will end badly .

Retailer Play.com has published new specifications for the final Kinect hardware .
While the information is unconfirmed via official channels , Play said that the details are direct from the manufacturer , while specs collected by Digital Foundry but not published to date tie in extremely closely with the new data .
The smart money is on this being the real deal .
Perhaps the most interesting information we can glean from this is in how the final production Kinect camera differs from the reference technology designed by Microsoft partner PrimeSense .
The Israeli company , who we interviewed back in April , provided the basic design that Microsoft adapted to create the - then Project Natal .
Its camera features much the same viewing characteristics as the final Kinect in terms of field of view , but its depth map is much more detailed : 640x480 's worth of resolution up against Microsoft 's 320x240 .
If the depth map has been scaled back , so has definition of skeletal tracking .
The new spec suggests 20 points that make up the human skeleton while our demo of Natal back at gamescom last year revealed that 48 points were used .
Having played the same game in both iterations of the hardware , it has to be said that aside from small " jumps " in the fidelity of the 1:1 skeletal tracking , the overall experience is fairly close despite the spec cut - backs .
Probably the biggest concern is the low - resolution depth map , but again , the cut - back does make sense .
In our gamescom demo , presumably using something closer to the original reference design , Kudo Tsunoda expressed reservations that hand and finger tracking would work consistently with the camera simply because human beings come in all different sorts of shapes and sizes .
There would be no way to ensure accurate tracking of a child 's fingers , for example .
Therefore , for the sake of reliability , the emphasis would shift to tracking the whole body and at that point the need for the VGA depth map was less apparent , although clearly tracking more subtle movements does become more challenging .
The lower - resolution depth map also reduces the amount of data being beamed across USB , and decreases processing overhead too .
The other major difference in the final spec compared to the reference is the inclusion of a motorised tilt function in Kinect , which was never part of the original PrimeSense design .
This is powered via a bespoke port on the new Xbox 360S , or via a bundled PSU for the older console .
The purpose of the tilt is fairly straightforward : it allows for a more flexible placement of the camera , allowing it to fit more comfortably in more environments .
During gameplay it 's never been observed to move dynamically , and it is understood that skeletal tracking functions within the 360 APIs are no longer active when the camera motor is in use .
Here 's Play.com 's data in full .

Putin says spies expelled from US had ' tough lives '
Published duration 25 July 2010
image caption Mr Putin said that the spies " had a tough life "
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he has met the Russian agents recently deported from the US - and claimed they were living " tough lives " and had been " betrayed " .
He told journalists that he had sung Soviet - era patriotic songs with the agents .
However , Mr Putin did not say where the meeting took place .
The 10 Russians admitted in a US court earlier this month to being agents for a foreign country .
More serious money laundering charges against them were dropped .
They were then flown to Vienna , where a Russian jet carrying four prisoners freed by Russia arrived around the same time - in what was America 's biggest spy swap with Russia since the Cold War .
' Betrayal '
Mr Putin , who served as a KGB agent during the Soviet era , made the comments about his meeting during a visit to Foros , Ukraine , on Saturday .
He also confirmed that Anna Chapman - who had received most of the publicity in the Western and Russian media - was among the agents present .
He said they had talked about life , and that " every one of them had a tough life " .
" First [ problem ] was to master foreign language as your own .

Asked whether he had sung karaoke with them , Mr Putin said : " We did , but not with a karaoke box .
We sang to live music and we sang ' Where the Motherland Begins ' and other such songs . "
The song became hugely popular after it featured in a 1960s film about a Russian spy working in Nazi Germany .
Mr Putin went on to say that the spy swap with the US had come about as a result of " betrayal " .
" Traitors always end badly .
They finish up as drunks , addicts , on the street , " he said .
And when asked by reporters if Moscow was planning to take revenge , he said it was incorrect to ask about it .

Yes ,
It does what it tells it does .
It may be one of the geekiest ways of wishing your friends on their birthdays .
You wo n’t have to check every morning for people having birthdays , and go on writing on their walls .
The script does it for you .
And believe me , when you wish someone using a script for the first time , it feels terrible .
You will start to see the fickleness , frailness of human relationships , freaks and fakes around us in a Web 2.0 world .
But , if you dare to go forward and test it for yourself , scroll down to see the step - by - step instructions .
Step 1 : Install cURL and Gnome - schedule
cURL is a command line tool for transferring data using various protocols .
Gnome - schedule is a GUI for managing cron-jobs .
Install them by running the famous command
sudo apt - get install curl gnome - schedule
Step 2 : Setup a new application
Goto http://www.facebook.com/developers/ and setup a new application .
Fill in all the required fields .
Do n’t forget to set ‘ Application Type ’ to ‘ Desktop ’ .
Remember the ‘ Application ID ’ and ‘ Application secret ’ given in the end of the process .
Step 3 : Request an OAuth access token with the proper permissions
Facebook Graph API authorization documentation Has a detailed explanation about this .
But if you are in a hurry ,
Enter the following URL in your browser , replacing YOUR_APPLICATION_ID with the application ID you got in the earlier step .
https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APLICATION_ID&redirect_uri=http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html&type=user_agent&display=popup&scope=offline_access,publish_stream,friends_birthday
After a successful login and granting necessary permissions , you will be given a verification code .
Save it for later use .
Enter the following URL in your browser , replacing YOUR_APPLICATION_ID with ‘ Application ID ’ and YOUR_API_SECRET with ‘ Application secret ’ you got earlier , and VERIFICATION_CODE with the code you got in the previous step .
https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?client_id=YOUR_APLICATION_ID&redirect_uri=http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html&client_secret=YOUR_API_SECRET&code=VERIFICATION_CODE
Now you will be given the precious ‘ Access Token ’ .
Save it somewhere
WARNING : Facebook does not recommend following this procedure and storing Access Tokens or Application secrets in desktop applications , because if somebody gets hold of that code , you are dead .
I mean your facebook profile security is severely compromised and can be used in any malicious way they desire .
Step 4 : Writing the script
No .
Actually you just have to copy the following script I wrote and save it in a file like ‘/home/yourName/birthdayscript.sh ’ after entering THE precious access token of yours in the proper place .
#!/bin/bash NOW =$ ( date + " %m / %d " )
# Enter your access token below within quotations ACCESS_TOKEN= " blah-blah-blah- your-precious-access - token "
# Get the names and UIDs of your unfortunate friends born on a day like today curl " https://api.facebook.com/method/fql.query?access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN&query=SELECT%20first_name,uid%20from%20user%20where%20uid%20in%20(SELECT%20uid2%20from%20friend%20where%20uid1=564121985)AND%20substr(birthday_date,0,5)%20==%20'$NOW' " > birthdaywishtemp.xml names=`sed -n -e 's /.*< first_name >\(.*\)<\/ first_name >.*/\1/p' birthdaywishtemp.xml` ids=`sed -n -e 's /.*<uid>\(.*\)<\/uid>.*/\1/p' birthdaywishtemp.xml` F_ARRAY =( `echo $ {names}` ) U_ARRAY =( `echo $ {ids}` )
# Wish each of them with the same old boring message for (( i = 0 ; i < $ {# U_ARRAY[@]} ; i++ ) ) do curl ' https://graph.facebook.com/${U_ARRAY[$i]}' curl - F ' access_token='$ ACCESS_TOKEN '' \ -F ' message=Hey , Happy Birthday ...'$ {F_ARRAY [ $i ] } \ https://graph.facebook.com/${U_ARRAY[$i]}/feed >> birthdaywishbackup.log
# Let you know the progress echo " Wished $ {F_ARRAY [ $ i]} " >> birthdaywishbackup.log done echo " Completed on $ ( date ) " >> birthdaywishbackup.log
Now you can browse to the location where you saved the script via terminal and execute the script with the command
./birthdayscript.sh
And you can see the progress in the file birthdaywishbackup.log
Step 5 : Automating the script
Yes , it is of no use if you have to run this manually each and everyday to wish somebody .
So you can schedule it to run and write automagically on walls of birthday boys / gals everyday .
If you are the geekiest type you can do it using a cron-job and you wo n’t need this tutorial anyway .
But if you are interested , you can find how to do that here .
For the ordinary geek , there ’s this dumb - simple GUI based tool called gnome - schedule .
Run the command
gnome - schedule
in a terminal and you will be able to come up with a scheduled cron-job like the following in few easy steps .
IMPORTANT : Make sure you set a time of the day that you will keep your computer switched on , because a cron-job is not god , and does n’t know how turn on the computer it is running , by itself 😀
It ’s done !!!
Enjoy being a lazy , cold - hearted nerd , who has no sense of finer things in life .
UPDATE : With all the controversial comments about this post here and in Reddit , I found an article written by another one who has thought on the same lines which totally explains my idea behind this script and blog post .

First go read John Stagliano ’s Obscenity Trial .
Now , check out this video that comes via Reason : ( Mild Content Warning ! )
Basically this whole thing boils down to this ; you either are on the side of the Religious Right that says any form of Porno is morally wrong , or you side with the libertarians that believe that Obscenity , or in this case , Porn ; is protected by the First Amendment .
Hence the clash between your Libertarian Conservatives and your Christian Religious Right , which are , for the most part , Republican .
Almost as soon as the WikiLeaks story broke on Sunday , officials and commentators were making comparisons between these 91,000 documents and the Pentagon Papers , the 4,000 page classified study on Vietnam leaked by Daniel Ellsberg in 1971 .
The White House and other critics were quick to reject the analogy .
Even supporters of WikiLeaks ’ decision to release the documents are hesitant to put this event in the same league as the Pentagon Papers , which have come to hold such an important place in progressive history .
There are important differences between WikiLeaks ’ potential influence on the war in Afghanistan and the Pentagon Papers ’ actual influence on the war in Vietnam .
But , contrary to the heroic story of the Pentagon Papers , these differences reveal the actual shortcomings of what happened in 1971 .
For all of their accomplishments , the Pentagon Papers were in key respects , a failure .
Understanding the limits as well as the achievements of the Pentagon Papers is an important step in maximizing the potential influence of the WikiLeaks documents .
This is one of those cases where the negative lessons of history are as valuable as the positive ones .
First , there is the claim that the Pentagon Papers actually revealed high - level secrets about the Vietnam War , while WikiLeaks has n’t revealed anything that was n’t already known to the public .
In truth , however , aside from the details of what officials knew and when they knew it , there was not much in the Pentagon Papers that surprised ardent critics of the war .
In many ways , the documents merely confirmed previous revelations of the war made by incisive and intrepid journalists .
By 1971 , David Halberstam and Seymour Hersh had already written books and articles that opened a window onto virtually every level of the war — from the National Security Council meetings of the Kennedy administration to the massacres at My Lai .
These and other heavy - hitting journalists were concerned not only with the specific details of Vietnam , but also with challenging the Cold War consensus that fueled it .
By 1971 , while the anti-war movement had severely weakened that consensus , it had not altogether broken it .
In fact , in response to Nixon ’s curtailment of the draft and initiation of troop withdrawals from Vietnam , opposition to the war actually subsided in the year that Ellsberg photocopied the classified documents and gave them to the New York Times and Washington Post .
Contrary to the image of an America galvanized against the war , the Pentagon Papers were released in a time of relative apathy about Vietnam .
In addition to the lull in the antiwar movement , the influence of the Pentagon Papers was paradoxically limited by the scandal that their publication prompted .
Almost from the beginning , the story of the war was marginalized by accounts of the government ’s injunction against the newspapers .
At a press conference on June 21 , 1971 , just one week after the Pentagon Papers were published , a reporter exclaimed , “ We want to emphasize the issue is not the one of the Vietnam War but rather why did n’t management support freedom of the press . ”
The landmark judgment on behalf of the newspapers was a major victory for the cause of a free press .
However , it did little to further Ellsberg ’s original intention — to end the war in Vietnam .
Ellsberg himself has lamented this much in The Most Dangerous Man , the recent film in which he tells his story .
The central failure of the Pentagon Papers is that they did not end the war in Vietnam , which continued for another four years .
For Nixon , of course , the Pentagon Papers were nothing less than fateful .
Despite the fact that the documents covered events in Vietnam only up to 1968 , before he took office , Nixon reacted to them as though he had been personally attacked .
It was the leak of the Pentagon Papers that prompted the infamous Plumbers Unit whose first task was to break into the office of Ellsberg ’s psychiatrist .
This would be good practice for the break - in of the Watergate hotel the following year .
As Ellsberg notes , the biggest accomplishment of the Pentagon Papers was indirect .
By sparking Watergate , it helped bring about an end to Nixon ’s reign .
There are at least two ways to interpret the implications of this story for WikiLeaks .
One is to conclude that , like the Pentagon Papers and Vietnam , WikiLeaks will not have a major impact on the war in Afghanistan .
The American populace remains largely disconnected from the war , which is being fought by a post - Vietnam volunteer army .
It is easy to envision how , in the coming days and weeks , the reporting and commentaries will shift the focus away from the war itself to follow the drama of WikiLeaks and the fate of suspected leaker , Bradley Manning .
But there are some signs that , in reporting on the WikiLeaks story , the press , at least , is breaking with the legacy of the Pentagon Papers .
The lead story in the New York Times on Sunday night focused on the Pakistan intelligence agency and not the leak itself .
Subsequent coverage on the paper ’s website has continued to highlight the content of the documents , even as it features stories about Assange and Manning .
Those who oppose the war in Afghanistan should keep the momentum going and use this disclosure to continue pressing the points about Pakistan ’s cross-purposes , about corruption in the Afghan government and security forces , and about the real extent of civilian casualties .
Only in this way can WikiLeaks help end the war , and in so doing , accomplish what Ellsberg could not .

Drag racer John Force just " Dixie Chicked " himself

Posted on by RingerSIX
I was enjoying watching drag racing ... the NHRA Mopar Mile - High Nationals , qualifying rounds from Denver Colorado when driver John Force was on camera complaining about a list of the all time great drivers .
Keep in mind that drag racing fans are much like country music fans .
They tend to be all American conservatives .
Just then , Force blurted out " You 're like FOX News , Hannity and Beck .
All lies .
All crap . "
I had no idea that John Force was that stupid .
And I 'm not even talking about stupid because he apparently supports the Communist takeover of the USA , but because he would spit in the face of more than 50 % of his fans .
Force is ... OK , was , the biggest name in drag racing .
His sponsors are Castrol , Ford , Auto Club , MAC Tools , Brand Source , and many others .
He 's just earned the distinction of being a non-person to me .
He 's now commie crap .

I attend a lot of drag races and have talked to Force several times .
Between his TV shows and camera stunts - he is in front of them as much as he can - he has been promoting Force burn - out with those who have the nerve to follow other drag racers .
Now , it is time to call this guy what he is : a tax loving constitution hating liberal ; I ’ll do it to his face the next time I see him .

June 22 , 2010  --
A gay business advocacy group is charging McDonald 's with hypocrisy after the global fast food giant aired a gay - themed commercial in France .
" They were looking to portray themselves as an advocate of the LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community or an ally ... when it was completely counter to what their actions here in the U.S. were , " said Justin Nelson , the president and co-founder of the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce .
" It 's completely hypocritical . "
In an e-mail , a McDonald 's rejected the criticism .
" McDonald 's has supported a variety of programs and initiatives .
We have an employee network -- The McDonald 's Gay , Lesbian & Allies Network , " the company said .
In the 45 - second spot , a young man is shown in a McDonald 's restaurant , admiring a picture of his all - male class and speaking in French to a classmate on a cell phone , telling him he misses him .
The man hangs up once his father , carrying a tray of food , arrives at the table .
The father , evidently clueless about his son's phone conversation , takes a look at the class photo and remarks how , if only his son's class was co-ed , he " could get all the girls " -- prompting a faint smile from his son .
The spot ends with the phrase " come as you are , " in French , flashing on the screen before the McDonald 's logo appears .
After it went viral , the commercial elicited a variety of reactions .
One gay blog questioned how an ad about a " closeted boy " serves the gay community , while Fox News cable channel host Bill O'Reilly asked jokingly whether McDonald 's had an al Qaeda ad that also encouraged customers to " come as you are . "
In a recent interview with The Chicago Tribune , McDonald 's chief of operations Don Thompson said the controversy over the French ad in the United States was an example of how " markets , cultures are very different around the world . "
The ad , he said , would not be airing in the United States .
In its e-mail to ABCNews.com , the company added that the " commercial was produced in France for the French market .
This is not a global ad and French - made TV ads do n't run in the U.S. , just as our company in France would n't run an ad from the U.S. "
" Each of our 117 markets around the world determines their own path on advertising and marketing , which is nothing new at McDonald's .
Advertising has always varied around the world , " the company said .
' Double - Speak ' in McDonald 's Commercial ?
Contrary to some online reports , Nelson said the NGLCC is n't offended that the commercial wo n't be broadcast on U.S. airwaves -- it 's frustrated that it was broadcast at all , given McDonald 's recent history with the NGLCC .
For McDonald 's to " continue to distance themselves ( from the gay community ) here in the states and run an ad like that in another country -- it just seemed to be a double standard or double speak , " he said .
Nelson said McDonald 's pulled support from the NGLCC -- which claims to represent 1.4 million LGBT - owned businesses in the U.S. -- after the American Family Association launched a boycott in 2008 of McDonald 's franchises .
At the time , the conservative Christian group had been calling for McDonald 's executive Richard Ellis to step down from his position as an NGLCC board member .
Ellis did later resign his chamber post , but McDonald 's officials said public pressure had nothing to do with it .
Ellis , the company said , left McDonald 's U.S. operation to work in McDonald 's Canada business .
The following year , Nelson said , McDonald 's asked to be among the $ 10,000 sponsors of the chamber 's annual national dinner .
He said the chamber agreed , but only on the condition that McDonald 's later produce a plan demonstrating how it would engage with the LGBT community through actions such as using LGBT suppliers or implementing anti-discrimination programs in the workplace .
Months later , Nelson said the chamber is still waiting for McDonald 's to provide such a plan .
This , combined with the French commercial , led the chamber to send an angry letter , dated June 3 , to McDonald 's vice chairman and CEO James Skinner .
The letter dismissed the ad as " blatant geographic pandering " and called on McDonald 's to " show suppport for LGBT people , our families and our businesses -- not just where it is politcally expedient , but around the globe . "

A Grad missile launched from the Gaza Strip landed in a central , residential area in the southern city of Ashkelon Friday morning .
Magen David Adom crews treated two people for shock .
The missile shattered numerous windows of the surrounding , multi-story buildings and vehicles in the area .
Ashkelon Mayor Benny Vaknin who arrived at the scene , said that the missile landed in the heart of a residential neighborhood and that Ashkelon citizens are unfortunately accustomed to such situations .
Vaknin emphasized that many educational institutions , schools and day - care centers in Ashkelon remain unprotected from rocket attacks and called on the Defense Ministry to continue efforts to reinforce vulnerable areas .
" I do not see how it will be possible for us to begin the school year with schools and day - cares left unprotected when a heavy cloud of lethal rocket and missile fire hovers above us , " Vaknin said .
A committee of Ashkelon parents threatened not to send their children to school at the beginning of the year if their school buildings would not be fortified , Israel Radio reported Friday .
The " color red " alert system was heard across the city prior to the rocket landing , allowing residents to enter protected areas .
Police urged residents to remain indoors for fear of additional rockets or missiles .
In a closed meeting Friday morning , Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu announced that Israel views the Grad missile attack in Ashkelon with harsh severity .
The Aza Din al - Kassem Gazan terror group claimed responsibility for the attack .

Some Reflections on ‘ The Big Society ’… .
A few people have asked me what my thoughts are on the whole ‘ Big Society ’ concept being promoted by the new British government .
I have attended a couple of events over the last week that have given me space to think about it all , so here I am with a few reflections .
Last week I attended the Community Land Trust conference , and yesterday I was at the launch of the Sustainable Development Commission ’s ‘ The Future is Local ’ report .
So , for those new to the idea , the ‘ Big Society ’ idea is David Cameron ’s big idea , focusing on localism , returning power to local communities , making central government smaller and shifting its role to the devolution of power wherever possible , calling for “ a massive , radical redistribution of power ” .
Here he is talking about it ….
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxXqkLDdOzQ
At the CLT conference , the new Housing Minister , Grant Shapps MP , gave a rousing talk about how the government is committed to CLTs ( albeit in a slightly altered version called ‘ Local Housing Trusts ’ ) , and wants to see them everywhere .
They want to see communities taking charge of creating their own housing , raising their own financing and building housing which is in community ownership in perpetuity .
All sounds great .
One part that was slightly alarming was when he said that in the forthcoming ‘ Localism Bill ’ , there will be a provision that if 90 % of a community supports a development , it will be able to bypass the planning process .
This raises a number of questions .
90 % of which population ?
Street ?
Neighbourhood ?
Parish ?
Town ?
How do they vote ?
Then , even if you did get 90 % support , is it really , at a time where the need is to promote zero carbon housing , sensible to allow housing to bypass planning ?
Will it just lead to rubbish housing ?
At the ‘ Future is Local ’ launch yesterday , the various speakers offered different insights to the whole Big Society discussion .
Will Day of the SDC said that the aim of the report is the explore “ integrated area - based approaches to upgrading infrastructure ” .
The thinking goes like this : we have x million homes that need to be retrofitted , the government has no money ( well , not much ) , and we need to promote retrofitting and use that to also create energy security , quality of life , a sustainable economy ( fascinating term that … ) and jobs .
The idea is that a piecemeal approach is n’t anywhere near as cost - effective , the ideal is to work street - by - street and to use that also as an opportunity to engage communities .
Richard McCarthy of the Department for Community and Local Government spoke next , starting by talking about why localism is important .
It is about , he said , giving people the freedom and space to develop their own responses , free of government regulation and interference .
For him , the Big Society represents “ an opportunity for things to happen at a local level ” .
The new government plans to get rid of Regional Development Agencies and of Regional Spatial Strategies , and to reprioritise Local Plans , and for those plans to focus on neighbourhood led plans .
Mike Reardon of the Greater Manchester Environment Commission spoke about the work they are doing there to retrofit the city .
He said that they are looking at the process trying to work out how to maximise the economic benefits to the city of the retrofitting work , working on , as he put it , “ the engine of retrofitting ” .
The challenges they have faced , he said , are their own capacity and capability , realising that there is a significant skills gap , and that they need a new workforce capable of delivering it , hence they are planning to create “ A Low Carbon Centre of Excellence ” ( sock darning MScs… ) .
Ged Edwards of Sustainable Blacon
Ltd talked about the fascinating work they are involved with in a suburb of Chester , which offered some insights into what a post - EDAP Transition initiative might look like .
Blacon is an area of significant disadvantage , and Sustainable Blacon are focusing on 4 things , green transport , green energy , green spaces and green social enterprises .
They are set up as a not - for - profit , with 3 functions , firstly offering services , secondly working as a regeneration consultancy , and lastly promoting Sustainable Blacon .
Their board is made up of resident stakeholders , organisational stakeholders , and expert advisors .
The last , and the most challenging speaker , was Philip Blond of Respublica , who was interviewed recently here at Transition Culture .
Blond is one of the architects of the Big Society concept , and has the ear of David Cameron , for whom he acts as a great inspiration .
I took a lot of notes of his talk , which I will reproduce here because it will inform some of the following discussion .
What , he asked , is the great difficulty with all this talk of localism ?
The fact that there is not actually much society , society has become very disassociated .
Very few people out there are ready to engage , the poorest people are 2.5 times more likely to be lonely than the wealthiest .
People , he continued , no longer associate , there has been a diminution of social capital , the different classes mix less often than they used to .
So how do we get to a more associated society ?
The answer , he argued , is to begin where people are at .
What we need is a Big Society , and that requires something for people to associate with first .
What do we do when there is no collective identity ?
How might we , in an increasingly fractured society , get people to form together in groups ?
The environmental movement has , he argued , gone about things in a very dangerous way .
It took an issue of concern to all , and captured just one part of the political spectrum which meant that those on the Right and in the Centre had no interest in it .
Secondly it has failed to communicate carbon reduction in a way that anyone can visualise and care about .
The solution , he proposed , is to begin where people are .
If their idea of environmental work is to beautify their place , or plant trees , then start there .
What people will gather around and form groups around will vary between communities , it might be crime , or it might be beautifying an ugly place .
These projects can then become hubs for other projects .
The state ’s role , he said , is to “ facilitate civil association ” .
The aim should be to create different groups with different intents , and then provide quick wins for these groups .. the role of civil servants then becomes to facilitate this .
In many ways , the new political landscape which I hope I have captured in the above snapshots looks like one in which Transition should feel instinctively at home .
Indeed , I do think that the ‘ Big Society ’ agenda creates a space in which Transition initiatives should really be stepping up to the plate , and seizing it with both hands .
Local community - led responses , delivering the low carbon agenda from the ground up , facilitating inward investment , returning power to local government and so on , all offers a new context that Transition initiatives should seize with both hands .
There is a very real difference though , between the concepts of ‘ localism ’ and ‘ localisation ’ .
Localism is about the devolution of power , a devolving of decision making to the lower levels , to communities and to local government .
Localisation is about shifting the focus of economic activity to local markets , to meeting local needs , where possible , though local production .
Localism certainly creates a more conducive context within which localisation can flourish , but localism , as promoted by the current administration , still takes place within the wider context of globalised economic growth , which in turn drives energy dependency and carbon emissions .
I do however have some problems with this new localism agenda .
As I listened to Blond ’s talk , I thought , well is it actually true that we live in a country with not much society , that society has now disassociated ?
I remember just before the election hearing Eddie Izzard , who had just run all around the country , doing 50 - something marathons for charity .
He said he did n’t believe in ‘ Broken Britain ’ ..
everywhere he had gone people were much more community focused than he had expected .
My experience from visiting Transition initiatives is that community is there , everywhere , sometimes more obvious than other places , but the point is that community will organise when it wants to , it does n’t need permission from government .
In the short film at the top of this post , Cameron says “ I do n’t believe that civil society springs up of its own accord ” .
Well there are thousands of community organisations around the country , run mostly by volunteers , Transition initiatives , Low Carbon Communities , Greening groups and so on , none of them waited for permission from government .
They certainly sprang up of their own accord .
What matters is for the State to offer such projects meaningful support , and to remove the obstacles strewn in their paths .
Perhaps they might say , for example , that for communities wanting to install community owned renewables through a community ESCO , or similar model , they will put up 50 % of the money , matching whatever the community raises through community share options or bonds .
Perhaps the £ 10 - 15,000 loans soon to be offered to homeowners for retrofits on a ‘ Pay - As - You - Save ’ basis could also be offered for individuals so as to raise the initial capital for a community energy company .
Perhaps government might give communities first refusal on land zoned for development , and allow the use of compulsory purchase orders by community groups for sites they want to develop .
Perhaps they might introduce something like the Low Carbon Fund which has run so successfully in Scotland , to which community groups can apply for anywhere between £ 1,000 and £ 1,000,000 for low carbon projects .
One of the bits I struggle with is the idea that government ’s role is to devolve responsibility to communities , to devolve leadership .
In one way , I love it .
Of course communities have a key role to play in Transition in the wider sense , and need to be given that responsibility and trusted to take some leadership .
Transition has long argued that without active communities taking leadership , national decarbonisation / resilience building will struggle .
However , climate change , and the need to cut emissions sharply , also very much need strong government .
In Germany and Denmark , emissions have been cut by decisive and focused government action , while also empowering communities .
We need the empowerment of communities , the enabling of community responses , but we also need strong , imaginative government based on a strong agenda of slashing the nation ’s emissions .
I ’m not sure that we have that .
For example , I live in Devon .
Almost every planning application for wind farms are refused by the predominantly conservative Council .
So , if the move then is towards local communities being able to decide whether they want wind farms or not , we ’ll probably end up with even less .
Without strong government , we will never get anywhere near the nation ’s targets for installed wind capacity .
We need both .
Of course the cynic might point out that the reason for the Big Society is the sweeping cuts in public spending that are only just beginning .
If you replace the word ‘ localism ’ with ‘ privatisation ’ , it is not that different in some ways from the Thatcher government ’s agenda .
There is a challenge within it around what people are actually capable of doing in their spare time .
Working full time , and also running a school ?
Working , managing a family , looking after an ailing relative , and running a Community Land Trust ?
Of course there are incredible people out there who do that , but it will have its limits unless people are supported in other ways too .
Having said that though , I welcome the potential that the Big Society represents .
It offers a context within which Transition can really step up to the plate .
It explicitly states that it wants to see communities stepping up and taking control , and that can only be to the good .
It has lots of hooks onto which Transition groups can hang their projects , and it also raises lots of questions which Transition initiatives have hard - won experience they can feed into .
We need inspired , motivated communities taking ownership and responsibility , but over that , I would argue , we also need to be laying localisation , seeing that , for example , retrofitting Manchester could stimulate not just new trainings , but also a wide range of other potential businesses and livelihoods .
While localism is a great first step , it will be when localisation is woven in too that we really start to get somewhere interesting .
When the Big Society meets the Local Economy , then we ’re really moving , and it is that localisation piece of the puzzle that Transition brings to this discussion .
This brings us to the need to redefine resilience , not as a state of maximum preparedness for the ghastly , but as a desired state , as a positive .
But that ’s a subject for a later post …
Anyway , I would love to hear your thoughts on this …
Paul J. Browne , the Police Department ’s chief spokesman , said the department could now proceed with its administrative case against the eight officers with some involvement in the episode .
Mr. Browne had no comment on the settlement .
At the federal courthouse in Downtown Brooklyn , Ms. Bell , 26 , emerged from a courtroom looking weary after two days of negotiations , arm in arm with Mr. Bell ’s mother , Valerie .
Ms. Bell said the settlement was fair but not a victory .
“ No amount of money can provide closure , no amount of money can make up for the pain , ” she said .
“ We ’ll just try to learn how to live with it and move on . ”
The money will go to her two children with Mr. Bell , Jada , 7 , and Jordyn , 4 ; she will not receive a share because she was not married to Mr. Bell ( she took his name legally after his death ) .
Ms. Bell promised to keep pushing for the passage of police reforms intended to prevent a similar episode .
Standing beside her , Mr. Guzman , 34 , said he was sure that something similar would happen again .
“ I do n’t think a black or Hispanic man ’s life means much in this city , ” he said .
Mr. Guzman had walked out of the courtroom with a noticeable limp .
“ My injuries are my injuries , ” he said .
“ I ’ve got a metal rod in my leg .
I ’ve got four bullets still in me .
I ’ve got one pushing out my back right now . ”
Mr. Benefield , 26 , was not present , but he is expected to join Ms. Bell and Mr. Guzman at a news conference Wednesday at the Brooklyn offices of one of their lawyers , Sanford A. Rubenstein .
“ It ’s a fair and reasonable settlement , ” Mr. Rubenstein said .
Michael A. Cardozo , the city ’s corporation counsel , said : “ The Sean Bell shooting highlighted the complexities our dedicated officers must face each day .
The city regrets the loss of life in this tragic case , and we share our deepest condolences with the Bell family .
The city is also settling claims with Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield .
We hope that all parties can find some measure of closure by this settlement . ”
IBM has delivered a water - cooled supercomputer to the Zurich ETH * university , saying it uses up to 40 per cent less energy than an air - cooled machine , and has a reduced carbon footprint because its waste heat is used to warm adjacent buildings .
The 6Tflop experimental system is called Aquasar and has been designed and built by IBM researchers in Zurich .
It is built from a combination of Cell and Nehalem processors , and has three chassis or frames , two of which use water - cooling .
Each chassis has 11 BladeCenter QS222 servers , each of which has two PowerXCell 8i processors , and three BladeCenter HS22 servers , each of which has two Intel NehalemEP processors .
In general the PowerXCell 8is , which are also used in the Los Alamos Roadrunner system , seem to be intended for the massive number - crunching involved in the apps that Aquasar will run .
The PowerXCell 8i , introduced in May 2008 , is based on cell microprocessor technology developed by IBM , Sony and Toshiba .
It is a high - performance , double - precision floating point product with a 65 nm feature size .
The water - cooled chassis feature water - blocks , cooling elements attached to the processors , which have water at 60 degrees C circulating through capillary tubes and picking up heat from the processors , rising to 65 degrees C and keeping the processors below their 85 degrees C upper limit .
The water then goes through a heat exchanger , goes back down to 60 degrees , passing nine kilowatts of thermal power into the ETH building heating system , and returns to the processors .
In general there 's nothing fancy here , IBM water - cooling this super - computer like it has mainframes .
But intensive effort has been put into the design of the water - blocks to maximise the heat transfer from processors to the water .
Water - cooling is more efficient than air - cooling , and overall uses less energy than an air - cooling system based on IT equipment operating inside a cooled data centre .
IBM reckons Aquasar will help it build more energy - efficient supercomputers , and quotes Professor Dimos Poulikakos , the Thermodynamics laboratory head at ETH : " In the future it will be important to measure how efficiently a computer is per watt and per gram of equivalent CO2 production . "
Aquasar is said to have its carbon footprint reduced by up to 85 per cent because its waste heat is used to warm buildings .
However , this has Aquasar 's carbon footprint offset by the saved carbon that would have been used in heating the buildings , and Aquasar 's waste heat is not much use in the summer .
The better direct measure is that the Aquasar installation uses up to 40 per cent less energy than if it were air - cooled .
IBM researchers will monitor Aquasar 's operation in ETH's Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering , comparing and contrasting the air - cooled and water - cooled chassis to further optimise the water - cooling system .
In the future it may be possible to over - clock supercomputer processors by using water - cooling to keep their temperature inside operating limits , and so gain both performance and energy consumption benefits . ®

As if the cold weather did n't already chill San Francisco 's tourists , one of the most popular boat tours has been suspended for safety precautions .
The Ride the Ducks boat tour company indefinitely suspended tours nationwide after one of is amphibious duck boats sank after catching fire and being rammed by a barge on the Delaware River in Philadelphia on Wednesday .
Two people are missing .
The company operates seven boats in San Francisco and the boats can easily transition between the water and the road .
Dozens of tours are offered each day , said General Manager Cory Roebuck .
But because of the accident those tours are canceled and hundreds of dollars of refunds have been issued , Roebuck said .
All seven of the fleet 's boats are being inspected again as officials in Pennsylvania are still investigating the cause of the accident .
Many tourists who had booked seats on the 80 - minute tour through the streets and shore of San Francisco seemed to take the cancellation in stride .
Tours are $ 32 for a regular - priced adult ticket .
Ride the Ducks offered to give those with reservations a complimentary city bus tour .
It does n't go in the water , but it 's better than nothing .
" He 's probably more disappointed than I am , " said Barbara Wilkerson , referring to her 6 - year - old son , Malcolm , who was bracing against the cold next to her on the front seat of a motorized cable car .
Wilkerson , who just arrived from Colorado , booked their trip on the Duck before they left home .
She said she hoped the rest of their trip would continue without incident .
Claudia Reif of Modesto said she came to the city with a friend specifically to ride the amphibious boat .
Reif said she had ridden the boats in a number of cities and enjoyed the view from the water .
The company called her to let her know the tour would be canceled , but she said she decided to come in to the city for the bus tour anyway .
" I 'll still get to see everything on the street , " she said .
Bay Quackers , a competitor of Ride the Ducks , continued to operate its three amphibious ducks just down the street .
But the company has no plans to capitalize on Ride the Ducks ' temporary closure , said David Perry , a company spokesman .
" We certainly would not want that sort of image to get out there , " he said .
Eli Brown , an employee at the Bay Quackers booth at Fisherman 's Wharf , said there had n't been a spike in ridership because of the competitor 's closure .
In fact , he said , business had been a little slow , which he attributed to the weather and not tourists ' safety concerns .
" Normally on days when it is overcast like this , things are usually quiet , " he said .
Roebuck , the general manager , said it was prudent for the company to temporarily suspend the tours until the accident 's cause is determined .
" We miss our Ducks and our passengers .
It 'll be back to normal soon , " he said with a sigh as a packed Bay Quackers boat drove by .
America was founded on the written word .
Its roots spring from documents — the Constitution , the Declaration of Independence and , indirectly , the Bible .
The country ’s success depended on high levels of literacy , freedom of the press , allegiance to the rule of law ( found in books ) and a common language across a continent .
American prosperity and liberty grew out of a culture of reading and writing .

But reading and writing , like all technologies , are dynamic .
In ancient times , authors often dictated their books .
Dictation sounded like an uninterrupted series of letters , so scribes wrote down the letters in one long continuous string , justastheyoccurinspeech .
Text was written without spaces between words until the 11th century .
This continuous script made books hard to read , so only a few people were accomplished at reading them aloud to others .
Being able to read silently to yourself was considered an amazing talent .
Writing was an even rarer skill .
In 15th - century Europe only one in 20 adult males could write .
After Gutenberg ’s printing press came along around 1440 , mass - produced books changed the way people read and wrote .
The technology of printing expanded the number of words available ( from about 50,000 words in Old English to a million today ) .
More word choices enlarged what could be communicated .
More media choices broadened what was written about .
Authors did not have to compose scholarly tomes but could “ waste ” inexpensive books on heart - rending love stories ( the romance novel was invented in 1740 ) , or publish memoirs even if they were not kings .
People could write tracts to oppose the prevailing consensus , and with cheap printing those unorthodox ideas could gain enough influence to topple a king , or a pope .
In time , the power of authors birthed the idea of authority and bred a culture of expertise .
Perfection was achieved “ by the book . ”
Laws were compiled into official tomes , contracts were written down and nothing was valid unless put into words .
Painting , music , architecture , dance were all important , but the heartbeat of Western culture was the turning pages of a book .
By 1910 three - quarters of the towns in America with more than 2,500 residents had a public library .
We became a people of the book .
Today some 4.5 billion digital screens illuminate our lives .
Words have migrated from wood pulp to pixels on computers , phones , laptops , game consoles , televisions , billboards and tablets .
Letters are no longer fixed in black ink on paper , but flitter on a glass surface in a rainbow of colors as fast as our eyes can blink .
Screens fill our pockets , briefcases , dashboards , living room walls and the sides of buildings .
They sit in front of us when we work — regardless of what we do .
We are now people of the screen .
And of course , these newly ubiquitous screens have changed how we read and write .
The first screens that overtook culture , several decades ago — the big , fat , warm tubes of television — reduced the time we spent reading to such an extent that it seemed as if reading and writing were over .
Educators , intellectuals , politicians and parents worried deeply that the TV generation would be unable to write .
But the interconnected cool , thin displays of the second wave of screens launched an epidemic of writing that continues to swell .
The amount of time people spend reading has almost tripled since 1980 .
By 2008 more than a trillion pages were added to the World Wide Web , and that total grows by several billion a day .
Each of these pages was written by somebody .
Right now ordinary citizens compose 1.5 million blog posts per day .
Using their thumbs instead of pens , young people in college or at work around the world collectively write 12 billion quips per day from their phones .
More screens continue to swell the volume of reading and writing .
But it is not book reading .
Or newspaper reading .
It is screen reading .
Screens are always on , and , unlike with books we never stop staring at them .
This new platform is very visual , and it is gradually merging words with moving images : words zip around , they float over images , serving as footnotes or annotations , linking to other words or images .
You might think of this new medium as books we watch , or tele­vision we read .
Screens are also intensely data - driven .
Pixels encourage numeracy and produce rivers of numbers flowing into databases .
Visualizing data is a new art , and reading charts a new literacy .
Screen culture demands fluency in all kinds of symbols , not just letters .
And it demands more than our eyes .
The most physically active we may get while reading a book is to flip the pages or dog -ear a corner .
But screens engage our bodies .
Touch screens respond to the ceaseless caress of our fingers .
Sensors in game consoles such as the Nintendo Wii track our hands and arms .
We interact with what we see .
Soon enough , screens will follow our eyes to perceive where we gaze .
A screen will know what we are paying attention to and for how long .
In the futuristic movie Minority Report ( 2002 ) , the character played by Tom Cruise stands in front of a wraparound screen and hunts through vast archives of information with the gestures of a symphony conductor .
Reading becomes almost athletic .
Just as it seemed weird five centuries ago to see someone read silently , in the future it will seem weird to read without moving your body .
Books were good at developing a contemplative mind .
Screens encourage more utilitarian thinking .
A new idea or unfamiliar fact will provoke a reflex to do something : to research the term , to query your screen “ friends ” for their opinions , to find alternative views , to create a bookmark , to interact with or tweet the thing rather than simply contemplate it .
Book reading strengthened our analytical skills , encouraging us to pursue an observation all the way down to the footnote .
Screen reading encourages rapid pattern - making , associating this idea with another , equipping us to deal with the thousands of new thoughts expressed every day .
The screen rewards , and nurtures , thinking in real time .
We review a movie while we watch it , we come up with an obscure fact in the middle of an argument , we read the owner ’s manual of a gadget we spy in a store before we purchase it rather than after we get home and discover that it ca n’t do what we need it to do .
Screens provoke action instead of persuasion .
Propaganda is less effective in a world of screens , because while misinformation travels fast , corrections do , too .
On a screen it is often easier to correct a falsehood than to tell one in the first place ; Wikipedia works so well because it removes an error in a single click .
In books we find a revealed truth ; on the screen we assemble our own truth from pieces .
On networked screens everything is linked to everything else .
The status of a new creation is determined not by the rating given to it by critics but by the degree to which it is linked to the rest of the world .
A person , artifact or fact does not “ exist ” until it is linked .
A screen can reveal the inner nature of things .
Waving the camera eye of a smartphone over the bar code of a manufactured product reveals its price , origins and even relevant comments by other owners .
It is as if the screen displays the object ’s intangible essence .
A popular kid ’s toy ( Webkinz ) instills stuffed animals with a virtual character that is “ hidden ” inside ; a screen enables children to play with this inner character online in a virtual world .
As portable screens become more powerful , lighter and larger , they will be used to view more of this inner world .
Hold an electronic tablet up as you walk along a street , and it will show an annotated overlay of the real street ahead — where the clean restrooms are , which stores sell your favorite items , where your friends are hanging out .
Computer chips are becoming so small , and screens so thin and cheap , that in the next 40 years semi­transparent eyeglasses will apply an informational layer to reality .
If you pick up an object while peering through these spectacles , the object ’s ( or place ’s ) essential information will appear in overlay text .
In this way screens will enable us to “ read ” everything , not just text .
Last year alone , five quintillion ( 10 to the power of 18 ) transistors were embedded into objects other than computers .
Very soon most manufactured items , from shoes to cans of soup , will contain a small sliver of dim intelligence , and screens will be the tool we use to interact with this transistorized information .
More important , our screens will also watch us .
They will be our mirrors , the wells into which we look to find out about ourselves .
Not to see our face , but our status .
Already millions of people use pocketable screens to input their location , what they eat , how much they weigh , their mood , their sleep patterns and what they see .
A few pioneers have begun lifelogging : recording every single detail , conversation , picture and activity .
A screen both records and displays this database of activities .
The result of this constant self - tracking is an impeccable “ memory ” of their lives and an unexpectedly objective and quantifiable view of themselves , one that no book can provide .
The screen becomes part of our identity .
We live on screens of all sizes — from the IMAX to the iPhone .
In the near future we will never be far from one .
Screens will be the first place we ’ll look for answers , for friends , for news , for meaning , for our sense of who we are and who we can be .
Kevin Kelly ’s book What Technology Wants will be published in October .
" There had been a series of rapes in the underpass on the way to the station .
Josie Long — who is a lovely woman — was playing The New Theatre .
She said to me after the show : ' So I have to walk past the abandoned shops , past the old factory with the broken windows , go through the underpass and then past the burnt - out pub to get to the train station ?
This area's a little rapey , is n't it ? '
We said we 'd walk back to the station with her . "
Alan Moore is holding court .
He has a terrifying work ethic that belies the myth of laziness often lazily ascribed to his sub-cultural fringe of writers , anarchists , psycho - geographers , psychedelic bon vivants and occultists , and he does n't usually have much time for interviews .
This said , he is extremely good company and you can tell he enjoys playing the expansive raconteur all the more because he gets little opportunity to indulge himself .
And while he is reassuringly genial , he is much bigger , more leonine and prestidigitatoresque than photos make out .
He looks more like a Brian Bolland drawing of himself than himself .
Even the permanently smouldering joints on which he tokes are much fatter and longer than you 'd credit — although filled from a soft , dark block of Moroccan hashish resin the size of a cigarette packet , not some discombobulating new strain of super skunk .
He only darkens during a brief but measured aside about sexual assaults in the area and the way in which a visiting comedian dealt with the theme during a recent stand - up routine .
Then he reveals a steeliness more in keeping with his status as the only comic book writer in the world who is regularly talked of in the same terms as some of the great novelists of the late 20th Century and beyond .
Part of this reputation is built on the 1986 comic series turned graphic novel Watchmen , which indelibly changed the face of its industry and produced a leap forward in process and potential equivalent to those realised by Citizen Kane .
That 's not bad work for a lad who was kicked out of school while a teenager for dealing acid .
He was turned - on by the hip psychedelic counterculture of the late - sixties and became a performance poet in a local multi-media collective , the Arts Lab .
He was also an autodidact who pursued his love for imported American comics ( which at the time were so worthless they were used as ballast in trans - Atlantic ships ) into writing strips for Sounds , Doctor Who Weekly and then 2000 AD .
Since his big break writing Swamp
Thing in 1983 , he has remained at the top of his field ( completely in critical terms and mainly in commercial terms ; some of his most ambitious work stalled before completion with the astounding Big Numbers frustratingly only reaching two issues ) , and he has done so by consistently kicking against the pricks .
From insisting on having strong female protagonists ( The Ballad Of Halo Jones ) , to writing about anarchy and insurrection ( V For Vendetta ) , to exposing the illusory nature of modern histories ( From Hell ) , to making pornography ( Lost Girls ) , to introducing a discourse on perceptions of reality and free will into the ' low ' form of the superhero comic ( Watchmen ) while maintaining a fiercely unpretentious and by turns disturbing , warm , profound and , at times , hilarious tone ; he has booted down numerous doors … some of which others are yet to follow him through .
As he carries on the anecdote , laying mercilessly into another figure , recognisable by his long mane of hair , distinctive beard and black goth / punk / metal clothing , you get the sense that he's not much interested in fashion but is keenly interested in how people present themselves to the world .
" A few days later we had that Russell Brand here doing stand up at the same theatre and he started doing a routine about the local rapes , " he says .
" Would n't stop , even though it was fresh in everyone 's mind .
Very daring of him . "
Whatever he talks about , it is n't long before he returns to the subject of Northampton .
This town where Moore ( also a poet , illustrator , magazine publisher , magician , spoken word artist , smoker , toker , mid-afternoon joker ) was born in 1953 may be directly in the middle of the country , but it is not Middle England .
Anyone who lives in Leith or St Helens will instinctively know this place .
Anyone from Gillingham or Swansea will recognise its pedestrianised town centre ; streets pock - marked with boarded - up units , vacant in the face of competition from rapacious out of town retail parks , their core industries long since gone and replaced with an insubstantial service industry varnish .
Places like Harlow , where the streets have no names , just numbers .
" So next time Brand comes down here , I 'm going to rape him .
And then phone his granddad up live on air to tell him about it . "
He gamely signals that , of course , he 's joking , just in case we are the sort to judge him unfairly on this and not on his body of work .
And this work , which has also taken in ritual magic , the worship of a Roman sock puppet deity called Glycon and a subversive underground magazine called Dodgem Logic , has recently come full circle .
He has returned to the spirit of the Arts Lab by releasing the spoken word piece Unearthing on LP and CD along with music by Mike Patton , Justin Broadrick , Stuart Braithwaite , Zach Hill and Crook & Flail , accompanied by a book of photographs by Mitch Jenkins .
The piece was originally commissioned by psycho- geographer / writer Iain Sinclair for his anthology London : City Of Disappearances ( 2006 ) and concerns his friend , fellow comics writer and cultist , Steve Moore .
Thirty - five years ago , Steve ( no relation ) bought an ornamental sword for use in a magic ritual , which triggered off an obsession with the Greek moon goddess Selene and the arcane history of his life - long home , Shooter 's Hill in southeast London .
It 's almost a luxury to be able to smoke indoors these days .
Alan Moore :
It 's very civilised .
I 'm not keen on having to go to places where you have to stand outside to have a smoke .
People complain about passive smoking but they do n't realise that my passive smoke has a measurable retail value .
I 'm thinking about charging people to stand next to me .
I smoke indoors .
Although since I got married to Melinda [ Gebbie , co-creator of Lost Girls ] , and she 's moved in with me , I have relented and will open a window now .
Do you think , on the quiet , you 're a lot more of a traditional Englishman than people might presume ?
AM : That depends on which English tradition you 're going for .
I like to think of myself as a traditional Englishman , at least in so far as the traditions of Northampton go .
But we have been on somebody 's shit list since about 1263 and we only made matters worse by supporting Cromwell during the Civil War and making the boots for the New Model Army — for which I do n't think we were even paid !
And then , of course , Cromwell turned out to be even worse than Charles I and he only lasted for 15 years before we had Charles II back on the throne .
He did n't look favourably on us and he pulled down our castle .
I guess he took it to heart that ' we ' had chopped his dad 's head off .
Does this ' traditionalism ' tie in with your mistrust of the internet ?
I find it slightly odd that someone who is renowned for working in speculative fiction and near - future writing is n't interested in a tool with such potential .
AM : I 'm practically Amish when it comes down to it .
I practically mistrust any technology that came after the buggy .
What I tend to think is that the internet is fine for everyone else in the world .
I can see that it may have some disadvantages .
In fact , I can see a few problems arising from it , but , by and large ... everybody in the entire world apart from me uses the internet and seems to get on quite well with it .
For my part , I do n't want to be connected to that all - pervasive kind of cyber culture any more than I want to be connected to the physical world that is around me , more than I can help it [ laughs ] .
I 'm largely a solitary creature , just by nature and by my work .
That said , I venture out into town , but I very seldom leave Northampton .
Is it important that not only is Northampton close to the physical centre of the UK but , as it has gone through the last two or three decades , it now looks like a lot of other places in Britain with its pedestrianised shopping centre , chain stores moving in , and local family - run businesses closing down ?
AM : That 's it .
You could even be forgiven for thinking that some of these councils are actually trying to divert the life and activity away from town centres to the more profitable retail parks which are surrounding most of our conurbations nowadays .
That certainly seems to be the case in Northampton .
We 're all practically living in the same place .
There has been a great levelling .
We have the same brand names reiterated in all of our shop fronts ; the same chain stores in every town .
All of them have the surveillance cameras , although probably not to the same degree to which we have them here .
We 've got ones that talk .
They say things like , ' Pick that cigarette butt up .
Yes , you , the one in the anorak . '
It 's this kind of sub -Orwellian theatrics that just make people more annoyed than anything else .
They do n't alter crime , just people 's happiness .
It 's been noted before that you successfully predicted the pervasive intrusion of CCTV cameras into all aspects of urban living as far back as 1982 , when you started V For Vendetta .
I guess you only have to look at the graffiti of figures such as Banksy and other loosely anti-capitalist aligned artists , and then onto late - adopters such as bands like Hard - Fi , to see that , two decades later , it has practically become a great pop culture icon of the times .
AM : There are an interesting number of people turning up at protests these days dressed as V [ Guy Fawkes mask - wearing protagonist of V For Vendetta ] .
I know there is the Anonymous Group down the bottom of Tottenham Court Road barracking the scientologists [ who sometimes adopt his disguise ] ... a good bunch of lads and lasses !
But I 've also seen some pictures recently from the Climate Change Summits and the anti-globalisation demos and there appears to be a growing phalanx of people wearing Guy Fawkes masks and wigs .
It 's handy , I guess , that not only does it tie in morally , philosophically and politically , but it also looks pretty fucking cool as well , right ?
AM : It 's a pretty good look , is n't it ?
And of course it preserves your identity .
Everybody is becoming [ a superhero ] .
In the past I 've tried to say , ' Look , we are all crappy superheroes , ' because personal computers and mobile phone devices are things that only Bat Man and Mr Fantastic would have owned back in the sixties .
We 've all got this immense power and we 're still sat at home watching pornography and buying scratch cards .
We 're rubbish , even though we are as gods .
I think the idea that we can all be superheroes if we want might still be contagious , like in V For Vendetta .
I 've heard of urban superheroes springing up across the world .
I think there 's one in London called Angle - grinder Man ...
Ha ha ha !
AM : I think he removes clamps from cars and things like that .
They have them in America as well , apparently .
And like in the same way serial killers would be caught with The Bible on them or a copy of John Fowles 's The Collector , there is a common link between vigilante heroes : all these little urban superheroes have copies of Watchmen !
Have you turned your back on superheroes now ?
AM : I 'm interested in the superhero in real life , but not the comic book version .
I 've had some distancing thoughts about them recently .
I 've come to the conclusion that what superheroes might be — in their current incarnation , at least — is a symbol of American reluctance to involve themselves in any kind of conflict without massive tactical superiority .
I think this is the same whether you have the advantage of carpet bombing from altitude or if you come from the planet Krypton as a baby and have increased powers in Earth 's lower gravity .
That 's not what superheroes meant to me when I was a kid .
To me , they represented a wellspring of the imagination .
Superman had a dog in a cape !
He had a city in a bottle !
It was wonderful stuff for a seven - year - old boy to think about .
But I suspect that a lot of superheroes now are basically about the unfair fight .
You know : people would n't bully me if I could turn into the Hulk .
Your latest project Unearthing has gone through a number of different stages , starting off as a piece for an anthology put together by the pyschogeographer Iain Sinclair to how it stands now with these amazing photos and music by great musicians , along with yourself doing spoken word which is like performance poetry .
I was wondering how much you 've come full circle and returned to your days back in the Arts Lab in the late - sixties .
AM : Very much so .
I suppose it could be argued that I 'd never really gotten away from the Arts Lab , but certainly over this last year I have very much returned to my roots .
The multi-media explosion of Unearthing rather took me by surprise , because it was such a strange project to begin with .
It all really commenced with Steve Moore himself — the subject of the writing .
Back in 1976 he bought a Chinese coin sword made of 108 coins all tied together and used it in this very simple magical ritual which he came up with on the spot .
He used it to ask for guidance and perhaps a confirming dream .
The next day , he woke up with a voice in his ear saying the word ' Endymion ' , which , he later found out , was the title of a John Keats poem .
This started the bizarre course that Steve 's life would take in many respects .
It began his unusual relationship with Selene , the Greek Moon Goddess .
So , in 2004 , when Iain Sinclair asked if I wanted to contribute something to his London : City Of Disappearances book , I had something to write about .
I 'm always a sucker for anything that Iain suggests , really .
Is Unearthing a work of psychogeography ?
AM : It 's more of a human excavation than the excavation of a place , but because Steve Moore has lived his entire life in one house on top of Shooter 's Hill and he currently sleeps no more than four paces from the spot where he was born , it does become a work of psychogeography as well .
So we do go very thoroughly into what Shooter 's Hill is .
The etymology of the place name ?
AM : Absolutely .
Well , right back to the basic geology of how it formed .
Apparently it was just because of a chalk fault that collapsed on the north side of the hill and that 's what created the Thames Valley .
So without that , no river Thames , no London .
And yet it 's this fairly isolated little hill , and there are lots of strange little places on it .
We look into the place , but it 's more an excavation of Steve 's peculiar life which crosses into all sorts of different areas and crosses over with my life to a certain degree .
It was certainly an odd little story that was self - referential .
I 've often found that if you write self - referential stories that feedback into your actual life then all sorts of weird things start to happen , or at least appear to start happening .
Then Mitch Jenkins called round .
I had n't seen Mitch for years , but he told me he'd got to a point in his photography career where he was pretty much at the top of his field .
He was bored of getting all these commissions to re-touch the irises of the latest American TV star , so he asked if I had any pieces of text that he might be able to turn into a series of photos .
The only thing I had lying round was Unearthing .
I said , ' Look , this is a bit big and unwieldy but there might be something in there . '
Mitch came back in a state of excitement , saying that he wanted to realise it as this huge book of photographs .
I said , ' Sounds good to me . '
How did it expand from that into music ?
AM : Mitch said he'd been talking to the people at Lex records and they suggested all these wonderful musicians , which sounded fantastic .
I came to this studio and recorded the various passages which the music was then composed around .
The piece has this ending where you describe sending the first draft of the piece to Steve and the instructions that he had to follow on opening the envelope .
You read it , or listen to it , for the first time with him ...
AM : He first read it exactly as it's described in Unearthing itself .
I sent it to him in an envelope with the ending already written that was actually telling him to go out for a walk around this neighbourhood , and he did .
He went all the way round to the burial ground and stood with his back to it , as I 'd already described in my creepy self - referential story .
He said he felt very weird .
Well , you would , would n't you !?
AM : He did actually feel a shudder run through him when he was standing with his back to the burial ground and since then his life has changed drastically .
Unearthing itself was a big part of that in that there were people Steve had known for decades , and lived with in the case of his brother , who did not know how very , very strange he is .
The thwarted love interest in the story read it and she was quite upset by it at first , but their relationship and their friendship recovered and became a lot stronger and healthier because of it .
Steve has a new love interest .
His brother contracted motor neurone disease just after Unearthing had come out and a couple of weeks ago Steve finally buried his ashes in the back garden .
I was there with a number of the characters from the story .
And , yes , this will eventually lead to a sequel .
I have told Steve that I want to write a story called Earthing ...
Would it be right to say that he 's your best friend and he 's been crucial to your career in a lot of ways ?
How did you first meet him ?
AM : Oh yeah .
Well , this was a different world , a long time ago .
It would have been around 1967 , so I would have been 13 and I was a comic fan .
Every Saturday
I 'd go out and buy all of the Marvel or DC comics that had been shipped over from the States as ballast .
And I would also buy the very few interesting British comics that were around then , which were mainly published by Odhams .
They used to re-print black and white versions of the American Marvel titles .
And there was an announcement in one of the issues of Fantastic that their new tea boy , Sunny Steve Moore , had got together with some friends and had put on the first UK comic convention .
Now , I was probably too young to attend that , but I became an associate member , which meant that I paid some money and got all the literature .
And in one of the fanzines that came in my introductory package there was an actual address for Steve Moore .
I basically began stalking him and wrote him a couple of letters and we began a correspondence that has lasted for years .
When I was starting out he was an invaluable help .
When I decided to move from being a cartoonist to being a writer , it was Steve who read through my early scripts and told me to lose half the words and gave me a lot of pointers on how to do it .
And then later it was him who inspired me to become a practising magician .
In many ways , he 's completely ruined my life !
This is n't the first musical project you 've done .
In the past , you 've been associated with David J of Bauhaus and have even released records yourself .
Is there any sense in which you are a frustrated rock star ?
AM : Well , yeah .
I mean , back in the Arts Lab days all I wanted to do was to be able to support myself through being creative .
There was a time when I thought I might be a superstar poet , then I realised that was an oxymoron and that would never happen .
Then I thought ' rock star ' , until I realised that I could n't play an instrument , so I tended to gravitate towards writing and drawing .
That just seemed to be the easy way in although , yes , I have been involved with various musical projects —
The Sinister Ducks , then with [ cult Northampton psych musician ]
Mr Liquorice of The Mystery Guests and then The Emperors of Ice Cream .
All of these names have a very psych rock feel to them .
AM : Yeah .
I am a huge exponent of psychedelic culture .
I do n't care whether it 's fashionable or not but the ethos that was around [ in the late - sixties ] was an incredibly productive and benign one .
I suppose that a lot of my work since then has been soldiering on with the same basic agenda .
As much as this could either be a cliché or a truism : to what extent do you feel that taking LSD as a teenager acted as a catalyst or a key as it were ?
AM : Of course you can never say what would have happened if it had gone otherwise .
I would say that it had a tremendous impact on my life .
When I first took acid , I saw a quality of hallucination that was only like that for a few years .
Very much like a Martin Sharp [ of _ Oz_ magazine ] illustration .
It was very liquid and drifting .
But then , a few years later — I 'm sure that the acid was exactly the same — it was the landscape that had changed .
The experience had become more crystalline and hard - edged .
A bit more paranoid .
But , yes , it made me realise that actually reality was a state of mind and that , as your mind could change , so could your reality .
This was something that would have a big influence on my later thinking , and I also think I realised that my perceptions about art and writing and music when I was in those sorts of states were wonderful .
But it did n't mean that I liked everything — far from it .
I became quite critically acute , but I would enjoy the piece of art , whatever it was , on a much more profound and glowing level .
So I think I probably resolved to try and write or draw or create for people in the same kind of condition as I probably was when I 'd created those words .
It 's a bit like Jason Spaceman and Sonic Boom from Spacemen 3 back in the day when they wrote ' Taking Drugs To Make Music To Take Drugs To ' .
I thought , ' Yeah , that 's an elegant formula and I 'm sure that an awful lot of art in the history of the world has been created in this way . '
I 'm sure that 's what Wilkie Collins was doing and I 'm sure that 's what Samuel Taylor Coleridge was doing .
Did you ever see the really bad side of acid ?
I do n't just mean feeling a bit weird or paranoid , but having the full - blown simulacra of paranoid schizophrenia ?
AM : Not quite that bad , but I did have plenty of bad trips .
I laid off the acid around the time that I got expelled from school .
I 'd already done 50 or 60 trips in a year up to that point and I was probably starting to have some strange ideas .
But this was only ever recreational .
In the West , it 's always going to be in the context of getting out of your head .
Say in the case of eighties ' rave culture … you would get kids going to raves and having a blissful experience — an experience of satori [ Buddhist term for enlightenment ] .
But after the weekend was over , they would have to go back to the council estates that they were trying to escape from .
They were still there .
And for some of them a chasm opened up between their desire and their circumstances that they fell into and did n't get back out of .
Do you still take acid ?
AM : I take magic mushrooms .
The first time I combined them with a rudimentary magical ritual ... well , that was the eye - opener .
I suddenly realised that the combination made the magic work and made the drug much , much stronger and more profound .
And since then I 've only taken mushrooms in ritual circumstances .
There just does n't seem to be any point in doing it otherwise .
You 're proud of your status as a hipster .
Do you regret the way it 's become a disparaging , pejorative term now ?
AM : Has it ?
Yeah , that 's probably true .
It used to be a fashion statement , but it was information as a fashion statement which is probably going to do you more good than the clothing you wear .
I got an incredible education starting from the point at which I was thrown out of school .
Now , I could probably hold my own intellectually with most people who have had university or college educations .
And indeed some of them will have done courses on my books .
So , despite the fact my ' education ' ended at 16 , I had hipsterism , which was wanting to be hip , and that led me to read this incredibly diverse array of books on science , mysticism , science fiction , literature , art ...
I would find out about these movements that I had heard about , and it 's given me a pretty comprehensive education .
Now I am an autodidact , which is a great word ... I learned it myself .
I guess if there 's one thing that pushed your career forward more than any other thing then it was the 12 Watchmen comics .
It was a watershed in how people looked at comics in general and shifted them into becoming acceptable for adults to read them ( as long as they were referred to as graphic novels , of course ) .
But if Watchmen kicked these particular doors off their hinges , why have n't people flooded into the room ?
AM : Er , well , I do n't know .
Initially Watchmen gained a lot of its readership because it was taking an unusual look at superheroes , but actually it was more about redefining comics than it was about redefining one particular genre .
I think both me and Dave Gibbons [ artist ] had a lot of knowledge about that scene and we were able to take it and change it around to our advantage .
And , as you say , there has n't been a more sophisticated comic released in the 25 years since , which I find profoundly depressing , because it was intended to be something that expanded the possibilities of comics rather than what it has apparently become — a massive psychological stumbling block that the rest of the industry has yet to find a way round .
It did codify a lot of things .
AM : Well , yeah .
It was n't necessarily planned at the time .
We just intended to do a really good superhero book and then when we got to issue three , we suddenly realised that we potentially had something much bigger on our hands .
Things like From Hell or Lost Girls are in some ways as complex and as subtle as Watchmen ; it 's just that they 're not in as mainstream a genre as superheroes .
You know , I would have thought that sex would have been a more mainstream preoccupation than superheroes but ... apparently not !
But , you know , at least the superhero thing is accessible to a wide variety of people .
Whereas the brutality of From Hell or the sexuality of Lost Girls might be taking people into areas which they 're not comfortable with .
When originally reading Watchmen in comic form , I got the impression that the plot was being written as it went along .
AM : Yeah , absolutely .
I think we got to issue three and , on the first page , there were all these things coming together ; there was a new way of telling a story .
We got the captions from the pirate comic [ within the comic ] .
We got the balloon from the news vendor .
The radiation sign was being screwed onto the wall on the other side of the street and they were all in this dance together .
And then we thought , ' This is new .
This is good .
We can take this further . '
And so with the next issue , we did that complicated thing with Dr Manhattan where we were slicing up time and rearranging it to achieve a kind of specific effect .
And then we made the issue that was entirely symmetrical .
Making all the scenes mirror each other from front to back .
In every issue , we were trying to push it a bit further .
We were thinking , ' Are we doing something new with the storytelling ?
Are we doing something that has n't been seen before ?'
You talked about the link between drugs and environment and culture before .
In the mid-eighties , was it serendipity that you chose to use the smiley badge on the front cover of the comics just before it was adopted wholesale by acid house fans ?
AM : That was just one of the many strange little coincidences that seemed to happen .
When Watchmen came out , Tim Simenon from Bomb The Bass put a splash of jelly across one of the eyes in homage .
But I can remember walking through town wearing an old Watchmen T - shirt with the sleeves ripped off and somebody shouting ' Aciiieeeeeeed ! ' at me from the other side of the street !
Which was a pleasant and engaging experience !
Working as a writer , one of the reasons I got into magic was because you start to notice this feedback between the writing and real life .
It might be entirely in my head , but it seems significant .
I mean , there was a conference last weekend in Northampton called Magus .
It was academics coming from all over the world to talk about me and my work .
So I went down with Melinda .
They were nice people .
One of the academics at this conference was saying that he was working on a book which was about Watchmen as a post - 9/11 text .
I can see what he means to a degree .
One of my friends over there , Bob Morales , said he'd been talking to some people on Ground Zero on September 12 , 2001 and he was asking them if they were alright and what it had been like .
Two of them , independently of each other , said that they were just waiting for the authorities to find a giant alien sticking half way out of a wall .
Ha ha ha ... fucking hell !
AM : There was that atmosphere of a cataclysmic event happening in New York , which I do n't think had been depicted previously ... even in science fiction terms it was perhaps unimaginable !
Yes , you do find that a lot of odd , little coincidences like that haunt your life .

Remarks of President Barack Obama Weekly Address
The White House
July 17 , 2010
This week , many of our largest corporations reported robust earnings – a positive sign of growth .
But too many of our small business owners and those who aspire to start their own small businesses continue to struggle , in part because they ca n’t get the credit they need to start up , grow , and hire .
And too many Americans whose livelihoods have fallen prey to the worst recession in our lifetimes – a recession that cost our economy eight million jobs – still wonder how they ’ll make ends meet .
That ’s why we need to take new , commonsense steps to help small businesses , grow our economy , and create jobs – and we need to take them now .
For months , that ’s what we ’ve been trying to do .
But too often , the Republican leadership in the United States Senate chooses to filibuster our recovery and obstruct our progress .
And that has very real consequences .
Consider what that obstruction means for our small businesses – the growth engines that create two of every three new jobs in this country .
A lot of small businesses still have trouble getting the loans and capital they need to keep their doors open and hire new workers .
So we proposed steps to get them that help : Eliminating capital gains taxes on investments .
Establishing a fund for small lenders to help small businesses .
Enhancing successful SBA programs that help them access the capital they need .
But again and again , a partisan minority in the Senate said “ no , ” and used procedural tactics to block a simple , up - or - down vote .
Think about what these stalling tactics mean for the millions of Americans who ’ve lost their jobs since the recession began .
Over the past several weeks , more than two million of them have seen their unemployment insurance expire .
For many , it was the only way to make ends meet while searching for work – the only way to cover rent , utilities , even food .
Three times , the Senate has tried to temporarily extend that emergency assistance .
And three times , a minority of Senators – basically the same crowd who said “ no ” to small businesses – said “ no ” to folks looking for work , and blocked a straight up - or - down vote .
Some Republican leaders actually treat this unemployment insurance as if it ’s a form of welfare .
They say it discourages folks from looking for work .
Well , I ’ve met a lot of folks looking for work these past few years , and I can tell you , I have n’t met any Americans who would rather have an unemployment check than a meaningful job that lets you provide for your family .
And we all have friends , neighbors , or family members who already knows how hard it is to land a job when five workers are competing for every opening .
Now in the past , Presidents and Congresses of both parties have treated unemployment insurance for what it is – an emergency expenditure .
That ’s because an economic disaster can devastate families and communities just as surely as a flood or tornado .
Suddenly , Republican leaders want to change that .
They say we should n’t provide unemployment insurance because it costs money .
So after years of championing policies that turned a record surplus into a massive deficit , including a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans , they ’ve finally decided to make their stand on the backs of the unemployed .
They ’ve got no problem spending money on tax breaks for folks at the top who do n’t need them and did n’t even ask for them ; but they object to helping folks laid off in this recession who really do need help .
And every day this goes on , another 50,000 Americans lose that badly needed lifeline .
Well , I think these Senators are wrong .
We ca n’t afford to go back to the same misguided policies that led us into this mess .
We need to move forward with the policies that are leading us out of this mess .
The fact is , most economists agree that extending unemployment insurance is one of the single most cost - effective ways to help jumpstart the economy .
It puts money into the pockets of folks who not only need it most , but who also are most likely to spend it quickly .
That boosts local economies .
And that means jobs .
Increasing loans to small business .
Renewing unemployment insurance .
These steps are n’t just the right thing to do for those hardest hit by the recession – they ’re the right thing to do for all of us .
And I ’m calling on Congress once more to take these steps on behalf of America ’s workers , and families , and small business owners – the people we were sent here to serve .
Because when storms strike Main Street , we do n’t play politics with emergency aid .
We do n’t desert our fellow Americans when they fall on hard times .
We come together .
We do what we can to help .
We rebuild stronger , and we move forward .
That ’s what we ’re doing today .
And I ’m absolutely convinced that ’s how we ’re going to come through this storm to better days ahead .
Thanks .
Image caption Pfc Bradley Manning has been described as a " person of interest " in the Wikileaks Afghan document leak
A soldier accused of leaking video of a deadly helicopter attack in Iraq has been transferred to a base in the US .
US Army Pfc Bradley Manning is to stand trial on charges he gave video of the attack , which killed a Reuters photographer , to the website Wikileaks .
The Pentagon is also investigating whether he gave the site 90,000 documents on the war in Afghanistan .
On Friday a White House aide begged whoever possessed the Afghan files not to release any more .
" It 's important that no more damage be done to our national security , " Robert Gibbs said on NBC 's Today show .
The US Army said on Friday that Pfc Manning , 22 , had been moved from Kuwait to Quantico Marine Base in Virginia , where he will be held pending trial .
The Pentagon said this week investigators were extending the helicopter attack video investigation to find out whether Pfc Manning was involved in leak of the Afghanistan documents , with a spokesman describing him as a " person of interest " .
' Afghan blood '
But a Pentagon spokesman has said the investigation is " broader " than Pfc Manning .
The US government maintains the massive dump of documents onto the website put lives at risk .
" We can do nothing but implore the person that has those classified top secret documents not to post any more , " Mr Gibbs said on Friday .
And , on Thursday , Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen said : " The truth is [ Wikileaks ] might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family . "
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has dismissed the accusation , saying the US government has presented no evidence innocent people or informants have been harmed by the leaks .
Speaking to the BBC's Newshour programme , he said : " One must consider why the Pentagon is focusing on the hypothetical blood that it says might be on our hands - although there is no evidence of that - compared to the 20,000 lives that have been lost in Afghanistan that are documented and exposed by our material . "
He said his organisation had tried hard to reduce the possibility of harm occurring and had sought to engage the White House in its efforts to vet the material before it was released .
He has pledged to continue document releases .
" We will not be suppressed , " he said .
" We will continue to expose abuses by this administration and others . "
The documents , which Wikileaks have called the Afghan War Diary , were first described in news reports late on Sunday .
Among other revelations , they describe in new detail civilian deaths , claim members of Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence agency have backed the Taliban in Afghanistan , and state the Taliban has used surface - to - air missiles to down coalition aircraft .
The DNSSEC root key has been divided among seven people :
Part of ICANN ’s security scheme is the Domain Name System Security , a security protocol that ensures Web sites are registered and “ signed ” ( this is the security measure built into the Web that ensures when you go to a URL you arrive at a real site and not an identical pirate site ) .
Most major servers are a part of DNSSEC , as it ’s known , and during a major international attack , the system might sever connections between important servers to contain the damage .
A minimum of five of the seven keyholders — one each from Britain , the U.S. , Burkina Faso , Trinidad and Tobago , Canada , China , and the Czech Republic — would have to converge at a U.S. base with their keys to restart the system and connect everything once again .
The " One Nation Indivisible " Campaign ...
On June 21st the artwork above started appearing on billboards across North Carolina , from the mountains to the sea .
These billboards are appearing in the following areas : Asheville , Winston - Salem , Greensboro , Charlotte , Raleigh , and Wilmington .
This campaign is intended as a consciousness - raising effort to point out how every U.S. citizen who does n't believe in a monotheistic god is being " officially " marginalized , disrespected , and discriminated against by the insertion of " under God " in the Pledge , by the supplanting of our former de facto national motto-- E Pluribus Unum ( Out of Many , One ) -- with " In God We Trust , " by language in certain state constitutions ( like the one in NC ) which restricts anyone that does n't believe in a monotheistic god from holding public office , and in many other ways .
We believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that our Founders intended to establish a secular government , one that separated church from state .
We believe the kinds of officially sanctioned marginalization and discrimination covered above is unconstitutional , that it violates the intentions of the Founders , and that it is fundamentally unfair .
All we are asking is that every citizen give every other citizen the same kind of consideration they expect for themselves , and that we all try to live up to the spirit of the ideals our Founders gave us of liberty and justice for all .
Some of the member groups of the North Carolina Secular Association will be participating in this campaign .
Below is a list of these groups press releases for each billboard location :
The cost of this campaign is over $ 15,000.00 .
The campaign is being funded through donations from the individual groups involved and FreeThoughtAction , a national freethought marketing organization .
Below is a Google Map of the approximate locations the billboards ....

Exhumed Announces Reunion , Plans To Record New Album
Band Photo : Exhumed ( ?)
American death metal group Exhumed has announced their reformation after a five year hiatus .
The band will consist of vocalist / guitarist Matt Harvey , guitarist Wes Caley , bassist Leon DelMuerte and drummer Danny Walker .
The band will also be recording a brand new album , their first since " Anatomy Is Destiny " in 2003 , which is eyeing a Spring 2011 release .
Matt Harvey stated : " I 'm totally fucken psyched to be making music with Exhumed again , it 's been way too long .
After a few years off and away from the death metal scene , I feel rejuvenated and ready to hack , maim and kill once again .
I wanted this to be a continuation of what the band was doing and was on its way to doing , not a reunion or some weird nostalgia thing , so the first person I started talking about this with was our guitarist Wes ( Caley ) , who has been writing some great songs for the new album , and once he got the ball rolling with Leon ( DelMuerte , bass , vocals ) and Danny ( Walker , drums ) , it come together quickly and easier than ever ! "
" We 've been writing for the past few months , me in Hawaii , and the other guys in California , and now that I 'm back on the mainland we 'll be getting things together for album number four .
We 're all really excited about the new shit , it should combine the directness of Slaughtercult and the intricacy of Anatomy ... , so it 's definitely gonna be our strongest record yet . "
These two have been widely dismissed as being the most negative , defensive teams their respective countries have ever produced – and yet this is still considered a glamour tie .
Does that say more about the illustrious histories of both sides or the level of competition amongst other sides in this tournament ?
Either way , in pure entertainment terms for the neutral , it might not be an all - time classic , but in tactical terms it should be more fascinating than ever .
The basic interest stems from the fact the two sides have arrived at similar formations in completely different manners .
Holland ’s shape is a fairly standard European 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , but Brazil ’s is more of a slant on their traditional 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 .
Therefore , this should be more exciting than a traditional 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 v 4 - 2-3- 1 match - up .
That can often create static games , for the simple reason that each side ’s central playmaker is being picked up by two opposition holding midfielders , whilst wingers and full - backs cancel each other out .
Here , the positioning of Brazil ’s two wide players creates a more interesting situation , and it will be interesting to see how Bert van Marwijk responds .
Robinho plays from a left - sided position , but has drifted around the pitch more at this tournament than he has done previously in this system .
In theory it will be a simple contest between him and Gregory van der Wiel , but after his movement into deep areas was so effective against Chile , expect to see him moving central into the space generally filled by Kaka , to try and give Holland problems in that zone .
In the final third , Brazil like to work that left - hand side , which might be problematic for Holland , because their right - sided defensive midfielder , Mark van Bommel , plays higher up the pitch than Nigel de Jong .
Considering Brazil ’s tendency to play on the counter - attack through Robinho and Kaka , leaving either man free is not advisable .
If van Bommel moves forward and leaves Kaka to de Jong , then that will open up Holland ’s left - hand side for an attack from Dani Alves .
That is another area of concern for Holland , because Giovanni van Bronckhorst ’s lack of pace could be severely exploited by Alves , who looks set to continue on the right because of Elano ’s injury and Ramires ’ suspension .
So far , van Bronckhorst has countered the threat of pace by getting very tight to opposing right - wingers , and not allowing them to turn – which has worked rather well .
But because Alves will often retreat to a position alongside the two holding midfielders , this approach wo n’t be possible .
van Bronckhorst will need help – with de Jong otherwise occupied , this might force Dirk Kuyt into a very defensive role .
Another problem Holland might encounter is Brazil ’s pressing high up the pitch .
Holland ’s opponents have generally dropped off and sat deep in their own half – Denmark the most notable example , and Japan did the same .
This has allowed de Jong and van Bommel plenty of time on the ball , something they wo n’t get in this game .
Perhaps , though , this will force de Jong to move the ball more quickly , which might help their attacking players .
Holland ’s defence ( as a four ) has looked slightly dodgy , but their defence ( as a team ) has been excellent .
It will be interesting to see how van Marwijk plays this game with his front players – should they press Brazil ’s central midfielders , or let them have the ball in deep positions and get men behind the ball ?
The second approach seems more likely , so we might be in for a reasonably low - tempo game if Brazil dominate possession .
Wesley Sneijder may find himself confronted with two Brazilian holding players , so Holland ’s biggest threats may be Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie .
Robben finds himself up against Michel Bastos , not a natural left - back , but one that has done well so far when tested .
Bastos , as ever , must look to show him down the line – but that ’s not always a solution – give him too much space down the line , and Robben will take it and punish you that way .
He might find coming inside slightly more difficult considering the presence of Brazil ’s two holding midfielders – Josue or Felipe Melo will be charged with doubling up against him , and Robben ca n’t expect too many overlaps from van der Wiel , pegged back by Robinho .
The key player for Holland is van Persie. 27 next month , the time has arrived for him to show his true quality on the international stage .
So far , he has n’t looked completely up to speed following his long injury lay - off , but this game will be about his positioning and movement as much as his touch on the ball .
Lucio likes physical confrontation , and so van Persie is better off playing a false nine role , rather than remaining pressed up against the centre - backs .
All of this largely ignores Dunga ’s tactics ; but it ’s difficult to see what , how or why he will change his usual system , tactics or personnel .
The unavailability of Ramires and Elano secures Dani Alves ’ place , whilst a late fitness test will decide whether Melo or Josue starts alongside Gilberto Silva .
Expect few surprises from Brazil – the focus here is on van Marwijk .

A retired Los Angeles police officer who sued a gun maker after his 3 - year - old son shot him had his lawsuit dismissed Friday by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge .
Enrique Chavez , now 39 , of Anaheim , was off - duty when he was shot on July 11 , 2006 , while driving his Ford Ranger near Harbor Boulevard and La Palma Avenue .
His son , who was not in a car seat , got a hold of the father ’s .45 - caliber
Glock while sitting in the back seat and shot him in the back , according to police reports .
Chavez was left paralyzed from the waist down .
In July 2008 , he sued Glock , alleging that the gun ’s safety was “ non-existent or ineffective . ”
In addition , the suit alleges negligence on the part of Uncle Mike ’s , the company that made the gun ’s holster ; Turner Outdoorsman , the store where he bought the holster ; and the Los Angeles Police Revolver and Athletic Club , where the officer purchased the gun .
In dismissing the suit , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kevin C. Brazile cited an “ exhaustive review ” of the gun ’s safety conducted by the Los Angeles Police Department before a purchase .
Chavez ’s attorney , Ian Herzog , argued that the LAPD review does n’t mean the gun is actually safe .
“ If you ’re correct about that , it amounts to a revolution in products liability , ” Herzog told the judge .
Herzog argued that a jury should have been allowed to make that decision .
The defense had argued that Chavez admitted he forgot the gun was in the back seat when he put his son in the truck .
Brazile also dismissed the portion of the suit directed at the holster manufacturer and seller .
“ There ’s nothing inherently dangerous about the holster , ” the judge said .
“ It ’s the gun that ’s dangerous . ”

Plain Sight recently received a lot of exposure when it was a featured sale item in Valve ’s Steam summer sale .
Already a critical darling , this punchy , terrific looking title also features 13 multiplayer maps wherein one can battle up to 20 players at a time .
Indie Game Reviewer decided to assign it to multiple reviewers – Callabrantus and Patrick B. , for this reason .
Thus we bring you the IGR Two - Hander Review of Plain Sight from Beatnik Games
Developer Summary :
Plain Sight is a multiplayer arcade game about suicidal ninja robots .
Fly through space , leap over planetoids and destroy opponents with your trusty katana .
Killing fellow robots lets you steal their tasty , tasty energy .
Packed with spinach - like goodness ; energy makes you bigger , stronger , faster and generally more awesome .
Being all big and badass is great , but in this game it does n’t win you the match .
It makes you a target .
To win , you have to convert your energy into points …
How do you do this ?
Simple .
Kill yourself .
Press the button and turn your happy little robot into a vicious ball of enemy - absorbing plasma .
The more opponents you take out , the better .
Upgrade your robot , respawn and get stuck in again …
What We Think :
A Fast - Paced , Slash and Crash Multi-Player Mash - Up That Plays Smooth Jazz in the Lobby .
Callabrantus ’
Take :
Robots Do Ninja a Little Differently …
Lurking in the shadows is for sucker ninjas .
Plain Sight brings ninja combat out of the darkened corners .
You goal is to assassinate as many enemy players ( or bots ) as you can , store up the energy , and release it in a giant self - detonation ; hopefully one large enough to bring a few other players down with you .
Bring Your Own Gravity
The best part about being a ninja robot ?
Battling in near zero -gravity .
It ’s also the most frustrating part , but it makes sure you stay on your toes .
The levels in Plain Sight run every which way , and thanks to your grav boots , so can you .
Run up walls , run over the sides of platforms , or leap over a platform , and send out a gravity burst to stop your descent short .
You need to keep yourself moving to avoid becoming another notch on an enemy ninja ’s energy bar .
Combat involves getting close enough to get a lock on an enemy , charging up your attack , and letting fly with your sword .
If your attack is met with another , the shot will be repelled .
A successful connection will destroy your target add to your overall energy , as will picking up energy stars that will appear randomly on the field .
This energy does n’t count as points , however !
In order to rack up a score , you have to self detonate while you ’re carrying a charge .
The bigger the charge , the bigger the blast .
Larger blasts have a better chance of taking out enemies , but as you accumulate energy , your ninja will grow in size , and slow down significantly , making you an easier target .
Finding the right time to detonate is tricky business .
Ninja Depot .
You Can Kill It . We Can Help .
Rack up some points , and you can start purchasing upgrades .
Augment your running speed , your attack speed , and the rate at which you detonate , along with a bevy of other attributes .
This will increase your chances on the battlefield , but it can also give you a few seconds to collect yourself , and determine which way is up ( after particularly sound thrashings … of which I received often ) .
The Game sports some classic multiplayer modes , such as Death Match , Team Death Match and Capture the Flag .
For something different , try out Lighten Up ( the biggest self - detonation wins ) or Ninja !
Ninja !
Botzilla !
( Ninjas attack Botzilla , Botzilla is craving robotic Japanese ) .
Spinning in Infinity
The game ’s break - neck speed had me craning my head this way and that , wishing the camera was also being controlled by a robot ninja .
With so many floating platforms , I often found myself staring at the bottom of the floor I was on .
More often than not , in the couple of seconds it took to right it , I ’d catch sight of my bot just in time to watch an opponent jam his katana in my chassis .
Get used to the grav burst move quickly , or you ’ll find yourself whirling around in empty space a lot of the time .
Look before you leap !
With a huge amount of levels to select from , and a great variety of game modes , there ’s plenty for everyone interested in a super fast multiplayer killfest .
It also comes with a tutorial and a practice mode while you polish the green off your bot .
Patrick B’s Take :
Plain Sight is visually amazing and fun .
It makes for a fast and furious deathmatch experience .
It ’s very quick to pick up and start smashing others .
The ability to upgrade your character mid-game is an interesting element .
In the end what makes this worth the purchase is the visuals .
Little robot ninjas battling it out in bizarre gravity defying environments is crazy - fun .
The stark , almost black and white color scheme and funky jazz music add an element of style to cap off the experience .
OK , that said it has a few issues that keep me from recommending it more than I have :
First , it ’s too simple .
Once you ’ve gotten down the basic mechanics it really becomes a button masher .
There ’s very little difference between playing a live game and a practice because of this .
The addition of another ability or two would add a level of complexity that would give this much more replay value .
Second , there ’s no voice chat .
I know , it ’s hard to implement that sort of thing in an indie game , but this sort of game needs smack talk .
Even a dedicated Ventrillo or Teamspeak server would do .
Third , you ca n’t password protect a server .
This type of game would be ideal for a online gaming group looking for something to do on down nights , but without private servers , you ca n’t ensure you can play by yourselves .
Editor ’s note :
At their blog dated May 4th , Beatnik ’s game developers state : “ Over the next month or so we ’re going to be working toward a big old patch for the game .
After listening to feedback from all of you , we ’ve decided to add a persistent perk system into Plain Sight .
These perks will be earned over many games and should provide you with some tactical advantages ” so we should see much improvement in the multiplayer mode for the game .
Back to you Patrick …
Lastly , there ’s limited sound control .
I love the soundtrack , but it overwhelmed the sound effects and I had no control of it , so it had to be turned off .
It ’s a minor issue , but was unfortunate none the less .
The Good News
None of these are game breaking and are possibly patchable things for the future , if any of the developers read this .
I hate to get down on such a wonderful independent game .
It ’s still easily worth the price of admission .
If you ’ve got a guild looking for something else to do , buy copies , get on your voice chat , and start cutting each other to pieces .
You wont regret it .
Plain Sight is available via Steam .

The family of the late King of Pop has taken offense to a Thriller - parodying brain - eater in PopCap 's popular Plants vs. Zombies .
Plants vs. Zombies is great for many , many reasons - and one of those reasons is the game 's sense of humor .
It 's delightfully tongue - in - cheek with its various horticulture - based weaponry and flesh - eating undead , including one particular " dancing zombie , " who was clearly meant as an homage to the iconic dance break in Michael Jackson 's classic " Thriller " music video .
The latest update to PopCap 's relentlessly addictive original , however , replaces the dancing zombie 's distinctive red jacket ( with matching pants ) and curled hair for something more disco -themed .
MTV
Multiplayer reached out to the casual developer and found that the change had been made at the request of Michael Jackson 's estate .
The Estate of Michael Jackson objected to our use of the ' dancing zombie ' in PLANTS vs. ZOMBIES based on its view that the zombie too closely resembled Michael Jackson .
After receiving this objection , PopCap made a business decision to retire the original ' dancing zombie ' and replace it with a different ' dancing zombie ' character for future builds of PLANTS vs. ZOMBIES on all platforms .
The phase - out and replacement process is underway .
I , for one , am kind of bummed .
Sure , I guess a disco - themed zombie is all right , but Michael Jackson 's appearance in " Thriller " is the image of a dancing zombie .
Considering that " Thriller " remains one of the most popular music videos ( and albums ) of all time years after its release ( and after all of those weird lawsuits aimed at Jackson , too ) , why would you want to remove what was clearly a fond parody - slash - homage to it ?
I 'm not saying that the Jackson Estate might not have had legal grounds to stand on , and PopCap is doing the right thing in respecting the family 's wishes ... but it just seems counterproductive to me .

[ The following is a partial transcript from the third and final debate between Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush and Democratic Candidate Al Gore : ]
Jim Lehrer : Okay , gentlemen , you know the rules as established by the Commission of Presidential Debates .
The questions will come from citizens in our audience .
You have two minutes to answer each question ; your opponent may then offer a rebuttal .
I will then ask a follow - up question at my discretion .
The next four questions pertain to At the Drive In , a rock music group from Governor Bush 's home state of Texas .
The first , to Governor Bush , will be asked by Clara Thompson .
Where are you , Ms. Thompson ?
... There you are .
Clara Thompson : Uh , yes , Mr. Bush .
Do you think that At the Drive In's new album , Relationship of Command , matches the intensity of the band 's live show ?
George W. Bush : Thank you , Ms. Thompson .
As Governor of Texas , I 'm proud of these young men from El Paso .
I take both young people and the arts very seriously , as I think my record shows .
But , uh , the question here , really , is : who do you trust , and who do you think will get things done ?
I am a uniter , and not a divider .
Also , you can't hear
At the Drive In 's afros on record .
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President .
Al Gore : I 'm glad you asked this question , Ms. Thompson , because this is an area in which Mr. Bush and I differ .
While no album can ever approximate the complexity of the live concert experience , the sonic intensity of Relationship of Command makes it a good second choice .
Andy Wallace mixed the album , and if that name does n't ring a bell , let me remind you that nine years ago , he mixed an album called Nevermind by a band called Nirvana .
The punch his mix brings to these guitars is impressive .
So , while Relationship of Command does n't quite compare to seeing this group live , you 'll surely want to mosh - dance in your bedroom when you listen to this recording .
Jim Lehrer : Moving on , this question comes from Mr. Frank Lee and is for Vice President Gore .
Frank Lee :
If you are elected president , what do you propose to do about the inconsistencies of Relationship of Command ?
Al Gore : Well , yes , I do think this album is largely inconsistent .
Right now , music is the most innovative it has ever been in the history of the universe .
We have many , many options open to us in these times .
Under the Clinton administration , we have brought music into a period of growth , of expansion , of limitlessness .
But I 'll tell you this : if you want a country filled with records like Relationship of Command that are light on memorable riffs from bands steeped in punk and 70's classic rock , [ gestures to Bush ] this ... is your man .
Jim Lehrer : Governor ?
George W. Bush : Creativity in music is up right now , yes .
But rock music for pure rock purposes has suffered under the Clinton administration .
They 're trying to muck up our loud , old fashioned noise with their Washington politics and fuzzy math - rock .
Now , these boys ... the singing ... either you love it or you hate it .
But the important part is , it gets by .
It gets by on a handful of truly catchy , anthemic rockers .
" One Armed Scissor " is the most arena - ready of the songs on Relationship of Command .
It has an infectious vocal hook .
It has a punchy riff on the chorus .
It gets into your subliminable mind , and it more than makes up for the quavering , affected vocalizing on the verses .
Jim Lehrer : The next --
Al Gore : Can I just say one thing about that ?
Jim Lehrer : No , I 'm sorry , that 's--
Al Gore : Okay , alright .
Jim Lehrer :
The next question will be asked by Ms. Sandra Hartford , and is for you , Governor Bush .
Ms. Hartford , where are you ?
Sandra Hartford : Mr. Bush , do you feel
At the Drive In frontman Cedric Bixler 's vocals are in need of reform ?
George W. Bush :
Well , I certainly wo n't claim to have ... uh ... invented them .
[ gasping laugh ]
[ polite laughter from audience ]
George W. Bush : I , uh ... no .
I think the man is very intense .
And intensity is a great thing .
If I am elected President , I can promise you , it will be very , very intense .
Jim Lehrer : Vice President .
Al Gore : Ms. Hartford , I 'm glad you asked this question because this is an area in which Mr. Bush and I differ .
Intensity can be a great thing , but is not always .
Cedric Bixler has two main vocal styles .
Now , one of those is a punk rock bark that recalls Rage Against the Machine 's Zack de la Rocha .
The other is an operatic wail that resembles Ronnie James Dio .
The self - conscious aggression of the de la Rocha bit is tiresome , I find , but the Dio channeling is odd and occasionally fun .
Take " Sleepwalk Capsules , " if you will , for example .
In the song 's chorus , he 's in full - on metal god mode .
You could even say his soaring pitch conjures the image of a youthful Tom Cruise sitting in the cockpit of an F - 15 fighter .
But under Governor Bush 's plan , it would not .
What he proposes is that we strip Tom Cruise naked , kill his family , burn his house and shoot down his fighter .
Now , I see a time when --
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Gore , your time is up .
Governor , do you have a rebuttal ?
George W. Bush : Well , no .
Jim Lehrer :
Then , on to the next question .
This comes from Mr. Hannity Colmes and will be fielded by Vice President Gore .
Hannity Colmes :
What song on Relationship of Command do you feel most encapsulates its strengths and weaknesses ?
Al Gore : Definitely " Invalid Litter Dept . "
The slower passages of this song are really not what the American people need at this time , with its 80's metal guitar tone and know - it - all spoken word vocals .
And honestly , you 'll find yourself wanting to hate it .
Tipper certainly hated it .
But the chorus of the song is such a fist - pumping , singalong triumph you 'll find yourself returning to it again and again .
And that 's really this album in a nutshell : alternately annoying and powerful .
Jim Lehrer : Governor Bush ?
George W. Bush :
In the great state of Texas , we have a saying : people with afros should be shot .
[ gasping laugh ]
People need to have consequences for their afros , and that consequence is death .
During my term as Governor , I 've fried hundreds of men , and it was n't always easy .
You know , sometimes the switch jammed , or we'd get low on power or something .
But I know one thing : there can not be a harsh enough penalty for bad hair .
Now , technically
At the Drive
In have not committed a crime , but what would you do if it was your hair ?
What would you do if your four year - old daughter came home from school , crying , with all them products dripping down her cheeks ?
I 'm sure you 'd want the maximum penalty implemented .
I know I would ...
Leafing through Leah Gordon 's book of bewildering , disturbing and thrilling black - and - white photos , one stands out .
Two boys stand before the camera , each wearing rough eyemasks , their naked upper bodies smeared with something grim - looking , large horns bound to their heads and rope in their hands .
They look , to be frank , terrifying .
The photo was taken in Haiti , at the Mardi Gras carnival of Jacmel , a port on the south coast , and at first glance it plays up to the country 's voodoo clichés ; but look a little closer – the boys seem at ease , proud even , to pose for their portrait .
That they do so is down to the dedication of Gordon , a 51 - year - old British photographer .
For 15 years , Gordon has been plunging herself into the rich , weird world of the Jacmel carnival and returning with images such as this and many more , which feature in her new book Kanaval : Vodou , Politics and Revolution on the Streets of Haiti .
For those of us unfamiliar with either its medieval European origins or its altogether different manifestations in the further reaches of Latin and South America , the word " carnival " evokes dancing policemen on the streets of Notting Hill , or the flamboyant , technicolour parades of Rio de Janeiro .
But the carnival ( or " kanaval " in Haiti's native creole ) of Jacmel is quite radically different : a spontaneous , popular and mysterious mixture of theatre and masquing , voodoo and history that reaches a climax in this former French colonial port on Shrove Tuesday , or Mardi Gras . '
For a few wild days , boys and men career round the crumbling , picturesque by - ways of Jacmel , often in marauding groups , wearing home - made costumes or in sinister , eye- popping drag .
Some outfits have meanings that extend back centuries , others are entirely idiosyncratic and personal to their creators .
It is no mere street party , then , but rather a carnival by and for the largely impoverished people of Jacmel , which tells , in its own way , the tumultuous history of Haiti , from the slave rebellion that freed the country from its French masters in 1804 to this year 's catastrophic earthquake , via the bloody dictatorships of the Duvaliers and much else besides .
And for her introduction to this intoxicating brew , Gordon has Jill Dando to thank .
In 1991 , Gordon was watching a Holiday programme sequence about the Dominican Republic : " Suddenly [ Dando ] said , straight to camera , ' I must warn you the Dominican Republic shares the island with another country called Haiti – do not go there by mistake , because Haiti is a country of dictatorships , military coups , death , black magic and voodoo . '
I thought , all that and hot weather ?
Within a month I was on a plane to Port au Prince . "
She discovered the Jacmel carnival in 1995 , and has been photographing it ever since ; but it was n't until 2003 that she decided to learn more about its traditions and participants .
The result is the book , which mixes photography , several essays by other contributors and the oral histories of carnival participants , which Gordon herself recorded .
And it is in these brief interviews that Gordon affords a glimpse into the extraordinary world of Jacmel carnival .
Salnave Raphael , for instance , is one of the Lanse Kod ( a Creole rendering of " lanceurs de corde " or " lassoists " ) , described above , who roam the streets with their ropes and horns .
" We are making a statement about slavery , and being freed from slavery , " he tells Gordon in his account .
" The cords we carry are the cords that were used to bind us .
The blackness of our skin is made with pot - black crushed charcoal , cane spirit and cane syrup mixed with water .
[ On ] the streets we stop at the first crossroads and at the blow of my whistle we all start doing push - ups , to show that though the slaves suffered they are still very strong .
We wear the horns to look even more frightening ... in carnival people like to be scared . "
The Lanse Kod vie for pre-eminence with other large , equally striking groups such as the Zel Maturin , who enact a battle between St Michel and various spectacularly dressed and bewinged devils , both Christian and voodoo , for the souls of the faithful .
Yet perhaps the most bewitching figures are the lone performers , such as Andre Ferner , who appears as Madame Lasiren .
Lasiren is a voodoo marine spirit whom Ferner and his ancestors have honoured for generations .
" The baby I carry in my arms is the child of Lasiren , who is called Marie Rose ...
Because Lasiren is a fish , " says Ferner , " she has to disguise herself as a woman to be at Mardi Gras .
Each year I change the disguise and fashion a new baby .
To get inspiration , I go to the place where the big beasts live , and they instruct me to do Mardi Gras .
I have been doing this for 18 years . "
" I really like Madame Lasiren because [ Ferner ] is just an old - fashioned Haitian spiritual voodooist , " says Gordon , who believes that for many of its participants , carnival is n't just the highlight of their year , it 's the source of their social status .
" I never asked what their jobs were .
It 's a difficult question in Haiti , because so many people do n't do anything .
You do n't really get judged so much by what your job is , and that 's why things like carnival and creativity are so important . "
Other characters which appear equally obscure are in fact pointedly satirical .
Until his recent death , Eugene Lamour played a character called Chaloska , in a bicorn hat , with grotesquely enlarged lips and teeth .
The name refers to Charles Oscar , a notoriously murderous Jacmel police chief lynched in the early 20th century .
Lamour first took him on to the streets in 1962 , coinciding with the autocratic outrages of President François " Papa Doc " Duvalier .
Ever since , the presence of Chaloska in carnival has coincided with popular disgust at certain corrupt figures in the Haitian establishment .
Political commentary , voodoo street theatre , religious pageantry – Jacmel carnival has been juggling these myriad roles for two centuries .
But whether it can survive in the form so vividly captured by Gordon is in doubt .
Already there is pressure to introduce parades and more music , which , according to Gordon , is largely an attempt to control and commercialise the event , with sponsorship , and licensed food and drink concessions .
Jacmel carnival is unusual because , unlike other Haitian carnivals , it has so far resisted this fate .
As for the devastating earthquake of January this year , Gordon is consoled that none of her oral - history subjects was killed ; nonetheless , she worries how much of the town 's evocative but vulnerable architecture has survived :
" What happens to all that history and memory when the buildings collapse ? "
Instead of carnival in February this year , there was a muted procession to the town 's cemetery .
Next year , says Gordon , there will definitely be a carnival in Jacmel .
" People keep asking me if these [ people ] that I worked with are going to start doing earthquake - related work , but it does n't really interest them .
It sort of interests the outside world more , " she says .
" Haitians tend to laugh at crises ; not in a horrible way – but they 've had a lot of them . "
' Kanaval : Vodou , Politics and Revolution on the Streets of Haiti ' is published by Soul Jazz Publishing ( souljazzrecords . co.uk ) , priced £ 19.99 .
An exhibition of Gordon 's photographs opens tomorrow at Riflemaker , London W1 ( tel : 020 7439 0000 , riflemaker.org ) .
Just by way of an update to the previous story , in which I speculated as to whether or not our three main political party leaders would ever get it together and do what is best for the country , from this afternoon ’s press conference from 10 Downing Street , between the two party leaders , it would appear we do now have a fully fledged Liberal Conservative Coalition Government .
Nick Clegg and David Cameron , surrounded by twittering birds and sunshine in the rose garden of the new Prime Minister ’s official residence , together announced “ a new way of doing politics ” .
Although the exact details of what exactly that entails were n’t fully fleshed out , it does appear that the Conservatives are sincere about working closely with the Liberal Democrats , in a sweeping reform of the British political system not seen since the end of the Second World War .
If the centre left of the Conservative Party and the centre right of the Liberal Democrats can do what they ’re proposing to do , which is bring an end to adversarial political games and instead serve the greater national interest ; lower the deficit , fairer taxes and reform what the new LibDem Business Secretary Vince Cable called the corrupt casino banking system , even this cynical old blogger has to admit to being rather proud of British democracy at this particular moment in time .
It also seems likely we ’ll see a scrapping of a whole slew of proposals which were deeply unpopular with the electorate put forward by the previous government , such as ID cards and Lord Mandelson ’s last ditch attempt to criminalise internet file sharers which was literally pushed through Parliament in the dying minutes of the previous administration ’s final session — much to the chagrin of back bench MPs , from all political parties , who did n’t have the chance to debate it .
When asked what they would do once the honeymoon period is over and their real ideological differences begin to show , Cameron and Clegg both agreed their performance would be judged by their ability to deliver what they ’re promising , not whether or not they can out - perform each other .

With the leader in the NZB world gone - what will replace Newzbin ?

A letter to my MP regarding the government response to the Select Committee ’s evidence check on homeopathy .
I am writing to you with regard to the recent response of the government to the Science and Technology Select Committee report into homeopathy .
The response includes this :
There naturally will be an assumption that if the NHS is offering homeopathic treatments then they will be efficacious , whereas the overriding reason for NHS provision is that homeopathy is available to provide patient choice
Though they highlight one of the dangers of NHS provision of homeopathy – the legitimisation of a bogus therapy – the government seems to have decided that ‘ patient choice ’ is more important than that ( or any other ) concern .
I find it bizarre that patient choice can be used as justification for the provision of an utterly implausible remedy , based on sympathetic magic , which the best available evidence shows to perform no better than placebo .
I am also curious as to how the government came to the decision to continue to allow provision of homeopathy on the NHS given that , prior to the election , both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats apparently opposed the spending of public money on inert treatments .
The Liberal Democrats , responding to a question from the Guardian , stated that they would seek a full review of CAM therapies and that , having taken advice on efficacy , would take the position that treatments that do not perform better than placebo should not be funded by the NHS .
[ The Guardian ]
The Conservatives ’ response to the same question included the comment that it would be “ wholly irresponsible to spend public money on treatments that have no evidence to support their claims ” [ The Guardian ]
Edit , 6th August
My MP , being a good constituency MP , responded promptly to my letter and is chasing a response from the Department of Health .
Four days before I contacted my MP , I emailed my local Primary Care Trust to ask if they had a policy on homeopathy .
They have yet to acknowledge my email .
As ( a ) I am impatient and ( b ) I have already waited eleven days without receiving any response , I decided to use the What do they know website to submit a request under the Freedom of Information Act .
I would like to ask whether Bradford and Airedale PCT have a policy on the funding of homeopathic treatments .
I would also like to know much funding has been allocated to homeopathy by Bradford and Airedale PCT in each of the last five years .
A footnote :
A search of the PCT ’s website yields only one result for “ homeopathy ” ( and none for “ homoeopathy ” ) .
Here ’s the PDF I found : Outcome of Consultation .
There were 63 respondents – 61 patients , the YOR Local Medical Committee , and a private homeopath .
Of the sixty three respondents , only one requested a homeopathy service – the homeopath .
This made me wonder how much truth there is in the claim that “ the overriding reason for NHS provision is that homeopathy is available to provide patient choice “ .
Perhaps it is less a case of “ patient choice ” and more a case of appeasing lobbyists who have an interest in homeopathic ‘ remedies ’ ?
Edit 12th August
I ’ve had a response from my local PCT .
They have n’t told me how much has been spent on homeopathy in each of the last five years .
In fact , this is all they told me :
NHS Bradford and Airedale do not routinely commission homeopathy , however , exceptional cases can be reviewed as an Individual Funding Request .
I ’ve gone back to ask if the other information I requested is available .
Edit , 24th August
More correpondence between me and Bradford and Airedale PCT :
Thank you for your initial response .
I would still like to see the figures that show how much has been spent on homeopathy by Bradford and Airedale PCT in each of the last five years .
Please can you provide this information if it is available ?
I have checked with my colleagues and they have informed me that we do not keep specific details of this information .
Do Bradford and Airedale PCT have any information on spending on homeopathy in recent years ?
[ PCT responses italicised . ]
Edit , 26 August
Response :
“ I am afraid we do not keep such a record and to my knowledge have not been asked to do so by the SHA .
I have also checked the ledger system for suppliers / providers including ‘ HOMEOPATHY ’ in their name and can find no record of any transactions in recent years . ”
Edit , 31st August
The Department of Health has now responded to my initial letter to my MP .
… the Committee ’s report was published on 22 February .
The new government considered its findings and recommendations and has published a full response .
The Department of Health will not be withdrawing funds for homeopathy magic beans nor will the licensing of homeopathic products magic beans be stopped .
Decisions on the provision and funding of homeopathy magic beans will remain the responsibility of the NHS locally . [… ]
In deciding whether homeopathy is magic beans are appropriate for a patient , the treating clinician would be expected to take into account safety , clinical and cost - effectiveness as well as the availability of suitably qualified and regulated practitioners .
The Department of Health would not intervene in such decisions .
[ Helpfully , the DH then explain how I can find the government response that my initial letter was sent in response to .
No , wait – I mean unhelpfully . ]
I wrote to my MP because I ’d read the government ’s response to the evidence check report .
I even quoted it in my initial correspondence .
It ’s taken the government ( via my MP ) a month to provide a written response that does not address a single point raised in my letter .
All they ’ve done is restate their case and point me to a document I have already read .
This has been a complete waste of my time and energy .
ETA : rather than waste more of my time composing a proper reply to the non-response I have received from the DH , I ’ve copied and pasted my original comments and added this :
I have read the government ’s response to the evidence check and am unhappy with it .
Please respond to the points I raise above .
I think I will now heed Cybertiger ’s advice and take a break .
Oh , AT&T -- you can't post up a video detailing the testing process for Android phones and not expect us to notice that your guys are waving around the heretofore unannounced HTC Liberty , which was leaked by Android Central on Sunday .
Honestly , now .
It 's hard to tell much from the video apart from the fact that this thing is running Sense and has a flush face with capacitive buttons along the bottom , but the leak says the screen res is just 320 x 480 , which is somewhat less than awesome .
Of course , AT&T 's Android lineup has been relatively low - end so far , so maybe we 're not so surprised , but we 're hoping this thing is a little more Desire than Legend , if you catch us .

July 28 , 2010  --
When Randi Reitan heard about Target 's $ 150,000 donation to a Minnesota - based political group backing a gubernatorial candidate with penchant for opposing gay rights , she marched straight into the popular superstore and cut up her store credit card .
" I had to speak up and so I decided to go to my Target , talk to the store manager and tell him that I just could n't shop there anymore , " said Reitan .
" Then I cut up my Target Visa card . "
Reitan , who says she has dedicated her life to gay rights after her son Jacob came out 10 years ago , is n't the only one upset by the discount department store 's move .
Gay rights activists and loyal Target shoppers are furious with the company after it contributed $ 150,000 to MN Forward , a political group that has endorsed and is paying for ads for the Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer .
Emmer , who will face the winner of the Democratic gubernatorial primary and an independent candidate in the general election this November , is against gay marriage .
On Emmer 's website he defines marriage as a " union between one man and one woman " and he has come under fire for his $ 250 contribution to a Christian rockband that has been known to speak harshly of gays .
Emmer told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the controversial rock band " You Can Run But You Cannot Hide , " were " nice people , " following band member Bradlee Dean 's reported comments that Muslim countries that support execution of gays are " more moral than even the American Christians . "
" These are nice people .
Are we going to agree on everything ?
No , " Emmer said of the band .
" I really appreciate their passion and — you know what — I respect their point of view . "
Large corporations have only recently been legally allowed to contribute to campaign advertising , after the Supreme Court in January reversed a century of campaign finance reform that had limited the money that could be spent by private companies and unions .
According to MN Forward Executive Director Brian McClung , Emmer was chosen by the group because of his position on job growth and the state 's economy .
It is the same reason that the group has been garnering contributions from corporations like Target and electronics giant Best Buy , which gave $ 100,000 .
Target 's CEO Gregg Steinhafel was not made available to ABC News for an interview , but in an e-mail to staffers he defended the company 's decision to contribute to MN Forward .
" Target has a history of supporting organizations and candidates , on both sides of the aisle , who seek to advance policies aligned with our business objectives , such as job creation and economic growth , " wrote Steinhafel .
" It is also important to note that we rarely endorse all advocated positions of organizations or candidates we support , and we do not have a political or social agenda . "
Steinhafel also reiterated the company 's dedication to equal rights .
" Let me be very clear , Target 's support for the GLBT community is unwavering , and inclusiveness remains a core value of our company , " added Steinhafel , who listed a number of ways the company supports diversity .
These measures include providing domestic partner benefits and the sponsorship of Twin Cities Pride , a nonprofit that plans the state 's annual Gay - Lesbian - Bisexual - Transgender Pride Celebration .
A representative from Best Buy also released a statement saying that it supports MN Forward because the group makes " jobs and economic issues a top priority this election . "
Like Target , Best Buy does not claim to agree with all issues a particular candidate promotes .
Gay Activities Angry over Target 's Political Contributions
But members of the gay community around the country say that Target in particular is " trying to have it both ways " by supporting a candidate like Emmer and still publicizing their efforts to help the gay rights movement .
" Target has always been a really supportive workplace for GLTB people , " said Monica Meyer , the interim head of the gay rights group OutFront Minnesota .
" I think people are feeling a little bit betrayed by the company .
[ The contribution ] seems really contradictory to how they 've acted in the past . "
" I do think that people are rethinking their shopping , particularly during election season , " said Meyer .
" And I have heard some people saying it 's a good thing Costco exists . "
Ron Malott , a designer in Austin , Texas , who shops regularly with his partner at Target for supplies for his two young children , says that he will find somewhere else to spend his money .
" I wo n't shop there , " said Malott .
" There are two in about a five - mile radius from me but I 'll find somewhere else to go , I wo n't spend my money at Target . "
On Facebook , a group supporting a boycott of Target named " Boycott Target Until They Cease Funding Anti-Gay Politics " and one with a similar title dedicated to Best Buy , is already attracting membership .
Target 's group alone already has more than 5,000 members .
Loyal Shoppers Vow Never to Shop at Target Again
The group 's message board has been flooded with Target shoppers vowing to never step foot inside the store again , with one member writing that she feels " more than a little sick and pretty angry when I think of all the [ money ]
I 've spent at Target over the years . "
Phone numbers for Steinhafel as well as his assistant are also posted on the group 's site .
Reitan , who claims that Target representatives told her to stop calling to complain after she tried to speak to someone at the corporate headquarters , also made a YouTube video of her trip to target when she returned more than $ 200 worth of merchandise and destroyed her store credit card .
" I was just shocked , " said Reitan .
" You can't have it both ways and say that you support diversity and you honor and embrace your gay employees and then give $ 150,000 to the most anti-gay candidate running for governor . "
Asked whether there is anything Target can do to regain her as a customer , Reitan was n't sure .
" I 'm just so upset at the fact that they just dismissed me as a person and did n't want to talk to me , " she said .
" They can't take the money back now but at least they could give a matching amount to a [ gay rights group ] . "
" But for now I can shop at my local grocery store for most of things I shopped at Target for . "
Jobs at the Prominent Hill mine in outback South Australia are on offer to Indigenous people on the APY Lands who complete a training program .
Executive general manager of operations for OZ Minerals , Mick Wilkes , says the training program will continue due to its success .
Its students have been learning reading , writing and computer skills in the pre-employment program and are then trained in mining skills .
Mr Wilkes says every student who completes the course is guaranteed a job at the mine .
" There are real issues out there in the community with numeracy and literacy that have to be addressed and we 're trying to do our bit to try and address those through this course , " he said .
" We started off with 19 students ... from various very remote areas on the APY Lands and I 'm very pleased to tell you we 've still got 16 students still on the course . "
LAS VEGAS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) said Saturday that serious deficit hawks ought to get behind a new “ robust ” public option bill that she and more than a hundred other members introduced days ago .
In an interview with Raw Story at the Netroots Nation conference , Schakowsky predicted that a new “ focus on deficit reduction ” and rising public distrust of the insurance industry would generate stronger support for it among members of Congress .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We ’ve seen the cost [ savings ] , and we ’ve seen the behavior of the insurance companies , ” she said .
“ I think that really puts a new atmosphere on the prospects for a new public option . ”
Unveiled last Thursday by Rep. Lynn Woolsey ( D - CA ) , Schakowsky , and more than 120 co-sponsors , the measure would give consumers a choice between private and public health insurance plans in the new law ’s exchanges .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that it would cut the deficit by $ 68 billion between 2014 an 2020 .
How would it save that much money ?
“ It would compete with insurance companies , who frankly would have to lower their rates , ” Schakowsky said , promising that it would force private insurers to “ be more efficient . ”
Progressives were disheartened with — but still largely supported — the resulting health care law enacted in March , which did n’t offer public insurance programs to consumers ineligible for Medicare or Medicaid .
Even a public option was viewed as a raw deal by liberals , who wanted a single payer system , as exists in Canada and Britain .
“ This is kind of a compromise from that , saying , at least make [ government - run insurance ] one of the choices , ” explained the Democratic Congresswoman .
The American people , she added , “ overwhelmingly ” support it .
ADVERTISEMENT
Republicans and conservative Democrats derided the public option as just another government program , invoking widespread distrust for government as a reason for their opposition .
Their other opposing arguments , given consistent CBO projections that it would save money , were mostly without empirical backing .
The House health care bill approved in November contained a public plan , and one day after it was stripped from the Senate version in December , a CBS poll found that six in ten Americans backed the concept .
A member of the progressive caucus , Schakowsky was a vocal supporter of a robust public plan tied to Medicare rates during the lengthy health care debate , but considered the resulting legislation strong enough to vote for nonetheless .
Ubuntu is one of the most popular versions of Linux , and their Netbook Remix edition is especially attractive for netbook owners .
Here we ’ll look at how you can easily try out Ubuntu on your netbook without a CD / DVD drive .
Netbooks , along with the growing number of thin , full powered laptops , lack a CD / DVD drive .
Installing software is n’t much of a problem since most programs , whether free or for - pay , are available for download .
Operating systems , however , are usually installed from a disk .
You can easily install Windows 7 from a flash drive with our tutorial , but installing Ubuntu from a USB flash drive is more complicated .
However , using Wubi , a Windows installer for Ubuntu , you can easily install it directly on your netbook and even uninstall it with only a few clicks .
Getting Started
Download and run the Wubi installer for Ubuntu ( link below ) .
In the installer , select the drive you where you wish to install Ubuntu , the size of the installation ( this is the amount dedicated to Ubuntu ; under 20 Gb should be fine ) , language , username , and desired password .
Also , from the Desktop environment menu , select Ubuntu Netbook to install the netbook edition .
Click Install when your settings are correct .
Wubi will automatically download the selected version of Ubuntu and install it on your computer .
Windows Firewall may ask if you want to unblock Wubi ; select your network and click Allow access .
The download will take around an hour on broadband , depending on your internet connection speed .
Once the download is completed , it will automatically install to your computer .
If you ’d prefer to have everything downloaded before you start the install , download the ISO of Ubuntu Netbook edition ( link below ) and save it in the same folder as Wubi .
Then , when you run Wubi , select the netbook edition as before and click Install .
Wubi will verify that your download is valid , and will then proceed to install from the downloaded ISO .
This install will only take about 10 minutes .
Once the install is finished you will be asked to reboot your computer .
Save anything else you ’re working on , and then reboot to finish setting up Ubuntu on your netbook .
When your computer reboots , select Ubuntu at the boot screen .
Wubi leaves the default OS as Windows 7 , so if you do n’t select anything it will boot into Windows 7 after a few seconds .
Ubuntu will automatically finish the install when you boot into it the first time .
This took about 12 minutes in our test .
When the setup is finished , your netbook will reboot one more time .
Remember again to select Ubuntu at the boot screen .
You ’ll then see a second boot screen ; press your Enter key to select the default .
Ubuntu only took less than a minute to boot in our test .
When you see the login screen , select your name and enter your password you setup in Wubi .
Now you ’re ready to start exploring Ubuntu Netbook Remix .
Using Ubuntu Netbook Remix
Ubuntu Netbook Remix offers a simple , full - screen interface to take the best advantage of netbooks ’ small screens .
Pre-installed applications are displayed in the application launcher , and are organized by category .
Click once to open an application .
The first screen on the application launcher shows your favorite programs .
If you ’d like to add another application to the favorites pane , click the plus sign beside its icon .
Your files from Windows are still accessible from Ubuntu Netbook Remix .
From the home screen , select Files & Folders on the left menu , and then click the icon that says something like 100GB Filesystem under the Volumes section .
Now you ’ll be able to see all of your files from Windows .
Your user files such as documents , music , and pictures should be located in Documents and Settings in a folder with your user name .
You can also easily install a variety of free applications via the Software Installer .
Connecting to the internet is also easy , as Ubuntu Netbook Remix automatically recognized the WiFi adaptor on our test netbook , a Samsung N150 .
To connect to a wireless network , click the wireless icon on the top right of the screen and select the network ’s name from the list .
And , if you ’d like to customize your screen , right - click on the application launcher and select Change desktop background .
Choose a background picture you ’d like .
Now you ’ll see it through your application launcher .
Nice !
Most applications are opened full - screen .
You can close them by clicking the x on the right of the program ’s name .
You can also switch to other applications from their icons on the top left .
Open the home screen by clicking the Ubuntu logo in the far left .
Changing Boot Options
By default , Wubi will leave Windows as the default operating system , and will give you 10 seconds at boot to choose to boot into Ubuntu .
To change this , boot into Windows and enter Advanced system settings in your start menu search .
In this dialog , click Settings under Startup and Recovery .
From this dialog , you can select the default operating system and the time to display list of operating systems .
You can enter a lower number to make the boot screen appear for less time .
And if you ’d rather make Ubuntu the default operating system , select it from the drop - down list .
Uninstalling Ubuntu Netbook Remix
If you decide you do n’t want to keep Ubuntu Netbook Remix on your computer , you can uninstall it just like you uninstall any normal application .
Boot your computer into Windows , open Control Panel , click Uninstall a Program , and enter ubuntu in the search box .
Select it , and click Uninstall .
Click Uninstall at the prompt .
Ubuntu uninstalls very quickly , and removes the entry from the bootloader as well , so your computer is just like it was before you installed it .
Conclusion
Ubuntu Netbook Remix offers an attractive Linux interface for netbooks .
We enjoyed trying it out , and found it much more user - friendly than most Linux distros .
And with the Wubi installer , you can install it risk - free and try it out on your netbook .
Or , if you ’d like to try out another alternate netbook operating system , check out our article on Jolicloud , another new OS for netbooks .

A Chinese farmer who used homemade rockets to fight off developers was celebrated in the state media today for winning record levels of compensation for his land .
Yang
Youde has become a cult figure in recent months for his one - man pyrotechnic resistance campaign , which saw him build a rickety watchtower above his home , from which he fired a bamboo bazooka at builders approaching his land .
He is the latest in a series of high - profile " nail households " that refuse to accept low compensation or intimidation by property developers and government officials .
According to the China Daily , Yang has also become the most successful hold - out , by winning a compensation deal worth more than 750,000 yuan ( £ 75,000 ) for 1.75 hectares ( 4.32 acres ) of land , a fishpond and single - storey brick farmhouse on the outskirts of Wuhan , Hubei province .
Although he claims to have fired only warning shots at developers , his actions appear to have secured a far higher settlement than that offered to his neighbours .
According to the paper , Yang was so pleased that he personally demolished his eight - metre - high watchtower and made preparations to relocate .
Yang signed the deal a week after his elder brother was attacked and injured in an escalation of the confrontation .
But the unfavourable media attention this directed at the authorities appears to have worked in his favour .
" Their attitudes were totally different and full of sincerity this time .
It made me hopeful of being able to iron out our differences , " he said .
While property owners are increasingly assertive in protecting their rights , there are still many cases where they lose out .
In March , a 92 - year - old man and his 68 - year - old son in Lianyungang , Jiangsu province , set themselves on fire in protest against the demolition of their family 's pig farm , and the son died of his injuries .
However , the sty was torn down .
M - 1 Global boss and Fedor Emelianenko ‘s manager , Vadim Finkelstein , discussed his client ’s surprising loss to Fabricio Werdum and the future negotiations with Strikeforce .
Finkelstein declared that he completely sure Fedor Emelianenko will bounce back from his defeat , stating that Strikeforce should listen to M - 1 ’s opinion if they want to extend their contract with “ The Last Emperor ” .
Also , Vadim Finkelstein hit back at Dana White ’s verbal assault on Fedor Emelianenko .
But stated that the agreement between the Ultimate Fighting Championship and M - 1 Global is still possible .
MMAFighting.com recently reported that M - 1 Global closed their HQ in Holland , which was later described by the organization as “ restructuring ” and only a coincidence after Fedor ’s loss .
Here is the best bits from Vadim Finkelstein ’s interview for the Russian magazine PRO ????? , translated by yours truly ( by the way of sports.ru ) .
Can you tell if Fedor had any training partners to prepare him to the level of Fabricio Werdum ’s Jiu-Jitsu ?
It does n’t matter .
I ’ll tell you what : the fact that Fedor got caught means nothing .
There were so many people who tried to submit him throughout the years , but he always managed to escape and destroy his opponents .
Strikeforce are talking now about the fight against Alistair Overeem , and then against Fabricio Werdum .
Do you think it ’s because of their intentions to keep Fedor at Strikeforce as long as possible ?
We are ready to fight against anyone , but everyone agrees that the most interesting fight right now is the rematch against Fabricio Werdum .
We have one fight left on our contract , so if Strikeforce want to extend it – they should listen to our opinion .
Fedor will fight again sometime between October and November .
I ’ll repeat that again : the only thing fans want to see is Fedor vs Werdum II .
Fabricio himself said that he would like to rematch Fedor in Russia .
It ’s great , but this fight will not happen in Russia .
How much it would cost to organize an event of that caliber in Russia ?
At least 3 million dollars .
The TV revenue will be considerably lower , because the Americans would not like to watch the fight at 2 pm .
The Russian channels would prefer to spend $ 1 million on another TV Show , and to give us around $ 200k .
So people in Russia basically do n’t understand how big Fedor is ?
Exactly .
Fedor Emelianenko is a huge star around the World , but in Moscow he can easily travel in the subway .
A couple of people would recognize him , and that ’s it .
Dana
White reacted to Fedor ’s loss with a simple “ : D ” sign in his Twitter account , and called Strikeforce ’s agreement with Fedor “ a mistake ” .
What do you think about that ?
I can really feel that the rating makers on the US websites really wanted Fedor Emelianenko to suffer from his first “ real ” defeat .
They now have Fedor on the Third Place , and the first is Brock Lesnar .
Question : Who ’s Brock Lesnar ?
He has only five professional fights , and one defeat .
He is a marketable fighter because of his WWE past .
They sell - out 60,000 stadiums for that crap , which no one would even consider watching in Russia .
That ’s why Brock Lesnar is popular .
As for Fedor , he is not a marketable fighter – he ’s just the best .
He destroyed everyone during 10 years .
He has 31 victories .
Will you ever be able to reach an agreement with the UFC ?
I think yes .
But not on the same terms they offered us before .
We will not let ourselves to get owned .
Fedor became so popular not inside the Octagon .
So , long story short : 1 . We would like to receive guaranteed payments .
I know that if we agree for percents , they will cheat us .
2 . Maybe not a co-promotion ( like we offered before ) , but at least co-branding .
3 . They also will have to permit Fedor participating in Sambo competitions , and during our last negotiations UFC were ready for that term .
Now we have a co-promotion with Strikeforce .
We go 50 - 50 with them on our co-promoted events , but there ’s still some problematic issues .
We want our fighters to fight on these events , but they tell us “ the crowd wants to see Americans . ”
I think you understand that everyone needs M - 1 because of Fedor Emelianenko ?
Of course , I completely understand that if there was no Fedor , Strikeforce would not need us .
We just want the world to see our other guys .
They could beat a lot of Strikeforce guys .
Now matter how hard I try to restrain myself , when it comes to holidays I always make too much food .
The 4th of July is no exception .
Since we typically have some sort of smoked meat on the 4th , usually of the pork variety , I feel compelled to make a big batch of cornbread to accompany it .
( This is a good recipe if you need one . )
Cornbread and pork are like peanut butter and jelly .
They are good apart , but they are so much better together !
Of course , since this is me we are talking about , I always have a lot left over .
What is a cook to do ?
May I suggest this recipe ?
This savory bread pudding is cheesy , creamy , and full of flavor .
You can doll it up with any veggies you want , but onions , peppers , jalapenos , and garlic are always my favorite combination .
I like my cornbread pudding spicy , so a dollop of cold sour cream helps keep the heat at bay .
If you have extra cornbread give this a try … heck , you could even make the cornbread just for this !
Cornbread Pudding Serves 6
4 cups day old cornbread , cut into 1 ″ cubes
1 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper
2 tablespoons minced jalapeno
1 clove garlic , minced
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups milk
2 eggs
Salt and pepper
1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
Heat the oven to 350 F and spray a medium casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray .
In a skillet over medium heat melt the butter .
Once it foams add the onion , pepper , jalapeno , and garlic .
Cook until softened , about 5 minutes .
In a large bowl combine the cornbread and vegetables .
Mix to distribute .
Pour into the prepared pan .
In a small bowl whisk together the milk and eggs .
Season with salt and pepper then pour over the cornbread mixture .
Top with the shredded cheese .
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes , or until puffed and golden .
Cool for five minutes before serving .
Enjoy !

Aprincipios del siglo pasado , en cada corrida de toros , morían despanzurrados muchos , demasiados caballos .
La suerte de varas , la que protagonizan los picadores , se hacía sin poner un peto a los equinos .
Así que cuando el toro alcanzaba al cuaco — no siempre ocurría — , éste terminaba con las vísceras de fuera .
Hoy esa salvajada es historia , y a pocos de los que nos gusta la fiesta brava se nos ocurriría pedir que el rito vuelva a “ sus orígenes ” para que se les quite la protección a los jamelgos .
Con la decisión de los catalanes de prohibir a partir del primer día del año 2012 la fiesta brava en su territorio , ésta se verá forzada a debatir si quiere sobrevivir al siglo XXI .
Soy taurino como se puede serlo : por herencia , ya que se me llevó desde niño , y por convicción , porque encuentro en ese rito algo único , que me ha movido a ver toros en plazas de México y España .
Pero así como yo no defendería que despanzurren caballos como ocurría hasta 1928 , tampoco me parece mal que se empiece a discutir si la fiesta como la conocemos debe permanecer intacta , sorda a los reclamos de excesiva brutalidad .
Por principio hay que desterrar del debate un argumento falaz , tan claramente desnudado ayer por el colombiano Daniel Samper , quien en Twitter expuso que “ poner ejemplos de otros animales torturados y abusados para justificar el abuso y la tortura de los toros es realmente triste ” .
En otras palabras , o la fiesta brava se justifica por sí misma o estamos en problemas los que creemos que es algo legítimo y perdurable .
A diferencia de otros espectáculos , las reglas internas que norman las corridas de toros son aprobadas por las autoridades de cada entidad , sea ésta un municipio o , en el caso de la ciudad de México , la Asamblea Legislativa .
Y para mí aquí reside el problema .
¿ Lo que vemos en la Plaza México es una fiesta 100 % apegada al reglamento ?
¿ Lo que sucede en los otros cosos de la república respeta las respectivas ordenanzas ?
¿ Antes de discutir si nos movemos a un modelo menos cruento podemos decir que en los hechos hoy hacemos respetar como taurinos la dignidad del animal que tanto ensalzamos ?
El mundo de los toros debe transparentarse .
Y eso no le gusta a muchos de los actores del ambiente taurino .
Un botón de muestra : hace años , el periódico Reforma demostró que había chapucería en las pruebas post mortem que se realizan para verificar que los cuernos no han sido recortados y que el animal es de la edad debida .
En la carnicería de la plaza , los reporteros compraron la testuz de “ Venadito ” , un bicho que acababa de matar el diestro Enrique Ponce .
Cuando llegó el plazo , la delegación Benito Juárez informó que todas las evaluaciones de los astados habían salido en orden .
Los funcionarios nunca pudieron explicar cómo lograron examinar ( deben diseccionarlos ) cuernos de un animal que ni siquiera tenían en su poder .
Las tradiciones no son eternas ni tendrían por qué serlo , que nadie base tampoco en ello una defensa de la fiesta brava .
Por ello , congratulémonos de que ya casi nunca muere un caballo en una corrida .
Lo quieran o no , después de lo de Cataluña , los taurinos mexicanos tendrán que afinar sus argumentos para defender la fiesta — por favor , que tampoco nadie mencione que deben sobrevivir porque inspiraron la ópera Carmen , etcétera — .
Ningún argumento sería más contundente que abrir las puertas a la ciudadanía para que se sepa que el reglamento vigente es aplicado con rigor , cosa que dudo profundamente .

UPDATE 3 : Ducati has officially announced signing Valentino Rossi .
UPDATE 2 : Ducati Motor Holdings CEO
Gabriele del Torchio has confirmed that Valentino Rossi will race with Ducati in 2011 .
UPDATE : Ducati & Yamaha have made a gentlemen ’s agreement to delay the announcement of Rossi ’s move until after Laguna Seca , in exchange for letting the Italian test the Desmosedici GP10 at the Valencian Round .
Let ’s avoid the the “ scoops ” , “ exclusives ” , and “ OMG’s ” , and just say that Asphalt & Rubber has received word from a trusted source that Valentino Rossi has signed a two - year agreement with Ducati , that ’s set to be announced on Monday … and boom goes the dynamite ( sorry , we could n’t resist ) .
The Rossi / Ducati fantasy has been put forth for years , with the fervor on the subject reaching its pinnacle this season , as Ducati reportedly wafted a € 15 million salary ( almost double Yamaha ’s offer ) in front of the nine - time World Champion .
Likely less to do with money , and more about prestige and priority , the announcement comes on the heels of Casey Stoner ’s exodus from the Ducati team , as the Australian has jumped ship back to HRC , in what is to be some sort of multinational threesome with energy drinks involved .
Ok Italy , it ’s almost time to change the sheets , this wet dream is nearly a reality .
Stay tuned for Monday .
Despite saying that he would like to end his career with Yamaha , Rossi has increasingly been linked to Ducati lately because of tensions with Jorge Lorenzo .
While Rossi was reportedly in favor of taking a salary reduction at Fiat - Yamaha ( €14 million reduced to € 9 million ) , the Italian did not like the notion that the use of funds would go to doubling Lorenzo ’s pay check , which was just a million euros short of Rossi’s .
With Lorenzo rivaling Rossi not only on the track ( the Yamaha Duo were virtually untouchable last season , and Lorenzo has run away with the 2010 Championship now with Rossi injured ) , but also for priority in the Fiat - Yamaha team box , we can presume egos collided .
Assured the top - billing at Ducati , and with the added attention / sponsorship that an Italian rider on an Italian made motorcycle brings , Rossi seems set to end his career on a Ducati …. which is sort of how it should be when you think about it .
The egg timer is now set as we wait for an announcement from Yamaha about Rossi ’s replacement .
Smart money is on Ben Spies … Wataru Yoshikawa being the long - shot on that bet .
The Iraqi city of Fallujah continues to suffer the ghastly consequences of a U.S. military onslaught in late 2004 .
According to the authors of a new study , “ Cancer , Infant Mortality and Birth Sex - Ratio in Fallujah , Iraq 2005 – 2009 , ” the people of Fallujah are experiencing higher rates of cancer , leukemia , infant mortality , and sexual mutations than those recorded among survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the years after those Japanese cities were incinerated by U.S. atomic bomb strikes in 1945 .
The epidemiological study , published in the International Journal of Environmental Studies and Public Health ( IJERPH ) , also finds the prevalence of these conditions in Fallujah to be many times greater than in nearby nations .
The assault on Fallujah , a city located 43 miles west of Baghdad , was one of the most horrific war crimes of our time .
After the population resisted the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq -- a war of neo-colonial plunder launched on the basis of lies -- Washington determined to make an example of the largely Sunni city .
This is called “ exemplary ” or “ collective ” punishment and is , according to the laws of war , illegal .
The new public health study of the city now all but proves what has long been suspected : that a high proportion of the weaponry used in the assault contained depleted uranium , a radioactive substance used in shells to increase their effectiveness .
In a study of 711 houses and 4,843 individuals carried out in January and February 2010 , authors Chris Busby , Malak Hamdan , Entesar Ariabi and a team of researchers found that the cancer rate had increased fourfold since before the U.S. attack five years ago , and that the forms of cancer in Fallujah are similar to those found among the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors , who were exposed to intense fallout radiation .
In Fallujah the rate of leukemia is 38 times higher , the childhood cancer rate is 12 times higher , and breast cancer is 10 times more common than in populations in Egypt , Jordan , and Kuwait .
Heightened levels of adult lymphoma and brain tumors were also reported .
At 80 deaths out of every 1,000 births , the infant mortality rate in Fallujah is more than five times higher than in Egypt and Jordan , and eight times higher than in Kuwait .
Strikingly , after 2005 the proportion of girls born in Fallujah has increased sharply .
In normal populations , 1050 boys are born for every 1000 girls .
But among those born in Fallujah in the four years after the U.S. assault , the ratio was reduced to 860 boys for every 1000 female births .
This alteration is similar to gender ratios found in Hiroshima after the U.S. atomic attack of 1945 .
The most likely reason for the change in the sex ratio , according to the researchers , is the impact of a major mutagenic event -- likely the use of depleted uranium in U.S. weapons .
While boys have one X - chromosome , girls have a redundant X - chromosome and can therefore absorb the loss of one chromosome through genetic damage .
“ This is an extraordinary and alarming result , ” said Busby , a professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Ulster and director of scientific research for Green Audit , an independent environmental research group .
“ To produce an effect like this , some very major mutagenic exposure must have occurred in 2004 when the attacks happened .
We need urgently to find out what the agent was .
Although many suspect uranium , we cannot be certain without further research and independent analysis of samples from the area .
” Busby told an Italian television news station , RAI 24 , that the “ extraordinary ” increase in radiation - related maladies in Fallujah is higher than that found in the populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the U.S. atomic strikes of 1945 .
“ My guess is that this was caused by depleted uranium , ” he said .
“ They must be connected .
” The U.S. military uses depleted uranium , also known as spent nuclear fuel , in armor - piercing shells and bullets because it is twice as dense as lead .
Once these shells hit their target , however , as much as 40 percent of the uranium is released in the form of tiny particles in the area of the explosion .
It can remain there for years , easily entering the human bloodstream , where it lodges itself in lymph glands and attacks the DNA produced in the sperm and eggs of affected adults , causing , in turn , serious birth defects in the next generation .
The research is the first systematic scientific substantiation of a body of evidence showing a sharp increase in infant mortality , birth defects , and cancer in Fallujah .
In October of 2009 , several Iraqi and British doctors wrote a letter to the United Nations demanding an inquiry into the proliferation of radiation - related sickness in the city : “ Young women in Fallujah in Iraq are terrified of having children because of the increasing number of babies born grotesquely deformed , with no heads , two heads , a single eye in their foreheads , scaly bodies or missing limbs .
In addition , young children in Fallujah are now experiencing hideous cancers and leukemias .
…
“ In September 2009 , Fallujah General Hospital had 170 newborn babies , 24 percent of whom were dead within the first seven days , a staggering 75 percent of the dead babies were classified as deformed .
…“ Doctors in Fallujah have specifically pointed out that not only are they witnessing unprecedented numbers of birth defects , but premature births have also considerably increased after 2003 .
But what is more alarming is that doctors in Fallujah have said , ‘ a significant number of babies that do survive begin to develop severe disabilities at a later stage .
’” The Pentagon responded to this report by asserting that there were no studies to prove any proliferation of deformities or other maladies associated with U.S. military actions .
“ No studies to date have indicated environmental issues resulting in specific health issues , ” a Defense Department spokesman told the BBC in March .
There have been no studies , however , in large part because Washington and its puppet Baghdad regime have blocked them .
According to the authors of “ Cancer , Infant Mortality and Birth Sex - Ratio in Fallujah , ” the Iraqi authorities attempted to scuttle their survey .
“ Shortly after the questionnaire survey was completed , Iraqi TV reportedly broadcast that a questionnaire survey was being carried out by terrorists and that anyone who was answering or administering the questionnaire could be arrested , ” the study reports .
The history of the atrocity committed by American imperialism against the people of Fallujah began on April 28 , 2003 , when U.S. Army soldiers fired indiscriminately into a crowd of about 200 residents protesting the conversion of a local school into a U.S. military base .
Seventeen were killed in the unprovoked attack , and two days later American soldiers fired on a protest against the murders , killing two more .
This intensified popular anger , and Fallujah became a center of the Sunni resistance against the occupation -- and U.S. reprisals .
On March 31 , 2004 , an angry crowd stopped a convoy of the private security firm Blackwater USA , responsible for its own share of war crimes .
Four Blackwater mercenaries were dragged from their vehicles , beaten , burned , and hung from a bridge over the Euphrates River .
The U.S. military then promised it would pacify the city , with one unnamed officer saying it would be turned into “ a killing field , ” but Operation Vigilant Resolve , involving thousands of Marines , ended in the abandonment of the siege by the U.S. military in May , 2004 .
The victory of Fallujah ’s residents against overwhelming military superiority was celebrated throughout Iraq and watched all over the world .
The Pentagon delivered its response in November 2004 .
The city was surrounded , and all those left inside were declared to be enemy combatants and fair game for the most heavily equipped killing machine in world history .
The Associated Press reported that men attempting to flee the city with their families were turned back into the slaughterhouse .
In the attack , the U.S. made heavy use of the chemical agent white phosphorus .
Ostensibly used only for illuminating battlefields , white phosphorus causes terrible and often fatal wounds , burning its way through building material and clothing before eating away skin and then bone .
The chemical was also used to suck the oxygen out of buildings where civilians were hiding .
Washington ’s desire for revenge against the population is indicated by the fact that the U.S. military reported about the same number of “ gunmen ” killed ( 1,400 ) as those taken alive as prisoners ( 1,300 - 1,500 ) .
In one instance , NBC News captured video footage of a U.S. soldier executing a wounded and helpless Iraqi man .
A Navy investigation later found the Marine had been acting in self - defense .
Fifty - one U.S. soldiers died in 10 days of combat .
The true number of city residents who were killed is not known .
The city ’s population before the attack was estimated to be between 425,000 and 600,000 .
The current population is believed to be between 250,000 and 300,000 .
Tens of thousands , mostly women and children , fled in advance of the attack .
Half of the city ’s building were destroyed , most of these reduced to rubble .
Like much of Iraq , Fallujah remains in ruins .
According to a recent report from IRIN , a project of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , Fallujah still has no functioning sewage system six years after the attack .
“ Waste pours onto the streets and seeps into drinking water supplies , ” the report notes .
“ Abdul - Sattar Kadhum al - Nawaf , director of Fallujah general hospital , said the sewage problem had taken its toll on residents ’ health .
They were increasingly affected by diarrhea , tuberculosis , typhoid and other communicable diseases .
” The savagery of the U.S. assault shocked the world , and added the name Fallujah to an infamous list that includes My Lai , Sabra - Shatila , Guérnica , Nanking , Lidice , and Wounded Knee .
But unlike those other massacres , the crime against Fallujah did not end when the bullets were no longer fired or the bombs stopped falling .
The U.S. military ’s decision to heavily deploy depleted uranium , all but proven by “ Cancer , Infant Mortality and Birth Sex - Ratio in Fallujah , ” was a wanton act of brutality , poisoning an entire generation of children not yet born in 2004 .

The Western Australian opposition wants an inquiry into whether initiation rituals are widespread within the West Australian police force following allegations of officers tasering colleagues .
An internal investigation is under way into the alleged tasering by officers at the Rockingham Police Station south of Perth .
They are alleged to have discharged Tasers directly against the bodies of fellow officers to deliver a painful shock as part of an initiation ritual or for punishment .
A sergeant and a senior constable have been stood down on full pay and two constables have been confined to office duties while the Internal Affairs Unit investigates .
The state opposition 's police spokeswoman Margaret Quirk said it would be of grave concern if there was any evidence such behaviour was widespread within the force .
Predator B aerial drones , which have proved successful fighting insurgents in Afghanistan , were deployed this week along the border between Texas and Mexico .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection began flying unmanned surveillance missions along the Mexican border on Tuesday , according to congressional sources briefed on the matter .
ADVERTISEMENT
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) , who was instrumental to pushing the issue in the Senate , applauded the news Friday .
“ The beginning of UAV flights over the west - Texas portion of our border with Mexico marks an important advancement for border security in our state , ” she said in reference to the unmanned aerial vehicles , which have been used by the military to survey the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
“ We are working hard to make round - the - clock aerial surveillance the standard for all 2,000 miles of the U.S. - Mexico border , and I hope this development is the first of many steps to bring our border detection and security efforts into the 21st century , ” Hutchison added .
Rep. Henry Cuellar , a Democrat from south Texas , has also praised the deployment of droves .
“ By putting eyes in the sky along the Rio Grande , we will gather real - time intelligence on the ground to augment the good work of federal , state and local law enforcement on the border , ” he said in a statement .
The first Texas - bound drone flight traveled from Arizona to New Mexico to near El Paso , Texas .
Customs and Border Protection operates five Predator B drones along the northern and southern borders , according to Cuellar .
Three drones operate over Arizona and New Mexico on the southern border and two drones patrol the Canadian border from North Dakota .
The Customs and Border Protection press office did not immediately return a request for comment .
The Predator drone flights in Texas augment the federal government 's presence along the 1,900 mile border .
The agency already has a few other unmanned aircraft as well as about 20,000 agents and nearly 700 miles of fencing .
Last week , President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE proposed the deployment 1,200 National Guard troops to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and contraband .
Cuellar has worked to establish an aerial drone mission center in Corpus Christi , Texas , since the beginning of this year .
The Federal Aviation Administration last month gave Customs and Border Protection permission to begin flying the unmanned aerial vehicles over West Texas .
The agency is allowed to fly the Predator drones from Fort Huachuca in southeastern Arizona to the El Paso area in West Texas .
Patrols have been restricted over Texas because of higher levels of commercial air traffic .
Hutchison , the ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , is working with the FAA to approve aerial drone patrols along the entire Texas border by the end of summer .
It is estimated to cost between $ 20 million and $ 30 million to set up a Predator drone in Corpus Christi to focus on the Texas border .
Federal Aviation Administrator J. Randolph Babbitt has agreed to streamline the approval process for requests to expand drone coverage in Texas and other parts of the nation , according to Hutchison ’s office .

The Register reported this week that Google is taking a step in their development process to allow both OEM Manufacturers and the general public more access to the Android development process .
This change is taking form in how public contributions are handled with the Native Development Kit , or NDK that Google is using for Android .
Apparently , before this policy change , public contributions to the Android source tree went into a private tree for Google to take a look at , and not into the crowd - sourced public arena .
Now with this shift in thinking , public contributions are going right to the public tree for people to use and look at , giving both devs and manufacturers a new level of access into the development process .
Of course , Google is reserving the right to continue to keep unreleased versions of Android private so that they can remain competitive in the hand - held market .
This is certainly understandable since they do n’t want to tip their hand on the awesomeness they are going to include in later versions of our favorite mobile OS .
When asked why they are making this change , Google ’s response was simple , they want to prevent big mistakes from OEM ’s releasing half baked software .
A quote from the Register article :
Google wants to … prevent a scenario where OEMs ship unfinished source code on phones with disastrous consequences for developers and end users as their code breaks or applications downloaded from the Android Market fail to work .
According to Google , this has nearly happened before when one unnamed OEM wanted to start shipping pre-release the Android 1.5 – codenamed Cupcake – on its phones .
Whatever the reason , more openness is always good in my opinion , it allows people to take even more ownership in Android , making it that much better .
No word on when the SDK will be changed in the same way as the NDK , but it should follow suit .

According to a survey by Pro Thema , 51.3 % of Greeks have said they would protest in the streets should new Austerity measures happen .
Many already are .
Saturday , fresh protests rocked Athens .
Reuters :
Angry protesters set fire to garbage cans and two TV outside broadcast vans in Athens as thousands of Greeks marched through the capital on May Day to protest against austerity measures they say only hurt the poor .
...
Shops were closed , ships stayed docked and the streets of the capital were unusually empty except for protesters marching toward parliament , meters away from the Finance Ministry where EU and IMF officials have been meeting for days to agree a new set of austerity measures .
" No to the IMF 's junta ! " protesters chanted , referring to the military dictatorship which ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974 .
" Hands off our rights !
IMF and EU Commission out ! , " the protesters shouted as they marched to parliament .
We have a hard time believing that Greece will be able to slash spending as necessary to contain growth of its national debt .
Protests will explode before letting deep spending cuts happen it seems .
Hopefully the IMF and E.U. will happy enough if Greece agrees to certain budget targets but then fails to achieve them when it comes to implementing austerity measures .
She said : " We came up with the idea when we were singing along with Jay - Z and trying different words in place of New York – Newport was by far the funniest .
Honestly , every time i look back at this pics , i just adore the utter simplicity of the design of the exhibit !

Amazing detail … sliced clear through even down to the first aid kit !
UPDATED …. so you wanted more close ups of the sliced up porsche ?
here you go !
Along the Gulf of Mexico ( CNN ) --
The family business has closed , and the couple can't work -- for themselves or for BP , it seems .
Their neighbors and community leaders , she says , are showing a kind of greed she 's never seen before .
They are n't the people she thought they were .
" Everyone 's out for themselves , " says the woman , who like many in her small Alabama town has a lot to say but wo n't say it except anonymously .
" I was telling my husband the other night that I 'll be glad when the Lord calls me home .
I 'll be glad to leave this place . "
For a moment , forget about saving wildlife .
Think not about the oil , the well , the sullied waters .
Put aside any blame of corporations or government and dismiss projections about what will happen to the economy or the environment .
Plenty of experts , officials with impressive titles and everyday people in the Gulf Coast and around the country are losing sleep over these matters .
Think instead of another tragedy - in - the - making , fallout from the oil disaster that can't be seen by cameras and is not easily measured by scientists with fancy equipment .
It 's the sort of effect that may not be felt or discussed openly until long after the boom and skimmers disappear and the media trucks pull away .
It is the emotional and social toll on individuals , the price families may pay and how communities are bound to suffer if residents do n't take care of each other .
From the front steps of his home in Orange Beach , Alabama , no more than 400 yards from the Gulf of Mexico , J. Steven Picou peers into the future .
The environmental sociologist has spent decades studying the human impact of manmade or technological disasters .
For 21 years , he 's tracked the residents of Cordova , Alaska , whose community was deeply wounded by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill .
And while every disaster and every community is different , he can't ignore the signs of what 's to come .
" It 's like the table is set , " he says .
" And now we 're going to be served with this 15 - to 20 - year - course meal of problems . "
Among the woes to be dished out : depression , marital problems , family violence , crime , substance abuse and suicides .
Those personal and social ills rise when disasters of this kind rock communities , according to extensive studies conducted by Picou , a professor at the University of South Alabama , and colleagues like him .
The good news , he and others say , is that the Gulf Coast -- no stranger to disaster -- has shown resilience before .
Time and again , residents here have banded together to rebuild .
Many of the resources and organizations mobilized to help after hurricanes are already in place .
But this time around , the disaster is different , and it comes when the wounds of Hurricane Katrina remain fresh .
It was avoidable , not a machination of Mother Nature .
Blame can be heaped on thick , passed around and debated .
There 's no end in sight , no guarantees that life will return to what it was .
And the questions of what 's to come loom , like anvils .
How bad things can get
Just a few miles from Picou 's home , a boat named " Rookie " sits idle in the marina at Zeke 's Landing .
It is a symbol of how bad things can get .
On June 23 , charter fishing boat captain William Allen " Rookie " Kruse , 55 , shot and killed himself .
Kruse , who 'd taken a job with BP's " Vessels of Opportunity " cleanup program , did n't leave a note , but family and friends say the disaster devastated him .
" He honestly thought we would not have the Gulf of Mexico anymore .
He would not see it to fish in it again , " says Tom Steber , the marina 's general manager , who knew Kruse going back to high school .
But suicide ?
That should have never been an option , Steber says , and what happened to his friend should serve as a lesson .
" Go talk to somebody .
Do n't get down to the point where you think you got to do that , " he says .
" You got all kinds of friends everywhere .
Just go talk to them . "
The first suicide in Alaska known to be connected to the Exxon Valdez disaster came four years after the spill when the former Cordova mayor , Bob Van Brocklin , ended his life .
Kruse 's death was 65 days into the Gulf 's oil disaster .
" We almost have Exxon Valdez fast forward here along the Gulf of Mexico , " Picou says .
Concern about communities sends Picou on an 80 - mile drive west to Bayou La Batre , a small fishing town on the opposite side of Mobile Bay .
He 's traveling around the Gulf Coast to where people are hurting -- to start conversations , impart what he 's learned and teach people how to listen to each other .
It 's a response modeled after programs devised in Alaska .
" Unlike a natural disaster where you have a therapeutic community emerging to help you rebuild , we know that in Alaska a corrosive community emerged , " he says .
" All of a sudden you have this incredible collapse of community capital . "
He describes how people may self - isolate to cope and how their distrust of others will grow and likely spread .
Cynicism about BP , he says , will move on to the federal government , the Coast Guard , the Environmental Protection Agency , local governments , neighbors .
Even family .
He recalls the " spillionaires , " those who profited by leasing out their boats to help with the the Alaska cleanup and how they were " also called Exxon whores by their cousins , brothers and fathers . "
" Communities are disrupted " by the strangers who come in after a technological disaster , Picou says .
When Picou first went to Alaska in 1989 , he was 45 and his knees were good .
His legs , at 65 , now bear scars from replacement surgeries .
He looks out toward the Gulf and shares details about some of the dreams he 's been having about oil .
One left him covered in the stuff after he fell off a bridge while hiking and landed in water .
" I probably wo n't see the end of this one , " he says of the Gulf oil disaster and the toll he expects it to take .
" Essentially we are in a marathon , and I would say that the gun has just gone off . "
Signs of corrosion appear
Spanish moss hangs from trees that line the main road in Bayou La Batre , a town of 2,300 with a welcome sign calling it the " Seafood Capital of Alabama . "
There are homes that go back generations , a boarded - up motel and what appears to be more places to pray than there are to eat .
A pile of shells from shucked oysters stands more than 30 feet high along the bayou that is the town 's namesake , and broken shells can be found mixed with gravel in driveways .
In this place , plenty of people wo n't talk on the record .
At the crowded city docks and along Coden Bayou , two launching sites for the " Vessels of Opportunity " program , not one will speak to media .
" I 'd love to talk to you , but BP wo n't let me , " one woman calls out from a ramshackle boat , after looking around to make sure no officials are in earshot .
But visit people on their porches at dusk , talk to them in hushed tones in corners or through fences and signs of Picou's " corrosive community " begin to appear .
It 's the kind of place where people are familiar , where the police captain might be seen helping out in the kitchen or answering a phone at the Lighthouse Restaurant after his shift is over .
Fishermen whose granddaddies knew each other gather at Donna 's Grocery at dawn , grabbing coffee and catching up before heading out to work for BP .
A cafe owner sits down with guests as if they 're visiting her home .
Is this sense of community sustainable , though ?
On a porch that runs the length of his house , a skeptic sips an iced - cold soda at sunset , surrounded by his family .
He shares his distrust of the state and local government .
A business owner down the road a ways talks about the " crack - heads " who are raking in cash and crashing cars .
People mutter about fraudulent BP claims and neighbors who are scheming for dollars .
And though changes have been made to make the situation more equitable , those who 've worked these waters for a living still complain about the doctors , lawyers and people rumored to be from as far away as Minnesota and Maine who swooped in with their recreational boats and snagged BP cleanup jobs they say should have been theirs from the get - go .
At the Bayou La Batre Police Department , the 14 - man team is stretched thin .
Not only do they serve the town , which has been a magnet for outsiders , but their jurisdiction covers an additional 10,000 people living outside it .
Behind his desk , Chief of Police John Joyner Jr. says he does n't know when he 'll find time to run reports and know exactly how crime is changing here .
He can say , however , that the daily population in Bayou La Batre has just about doubled .
Outside contractors , visiting officials , BP command post workers and others have flooded the place .
Over the past few months , calls for service -- seeking security detail for dignitaries , simple driving directions or responses to crimes and fender benders -- have gone up 100 percent .
Increased cash flow means there 's been a dip in property crimes , but drug and alcohol use has bumped up by about 20 to 30 percent , Joyner guesses .
The bigger problems , he predicts , will come later -- after the BP jobs dry up and if the water remains contaminated .
From his office down the hall , Capt .
Darryl Wilson agrees .
Right now , he says , " Some guys are making more in a week than they 'd make in a month . "
When these paychecks , which are n't having taxes withheld , stop and the IRS comes knocking , he says , there 's no telling what havoc will unfold .
" Why you need outreach "
Bayou La Batre is just one stop along the Gulf , one sliver of land and life amid the coastline states where oil and all it portends has come ashore and threatened futures .
Going from place to place , one can find other harbingers of the way people cope or fail to .
At a coffee shop in Foley , Alabama , a 39 - year - old member of the Gulf Coast chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous hates to think about what she'd be doing if she did n't already have nine years of sobriety .
" Alcoholics are always looking for an excuse to drink , " she says .
What 's happening in the Gulf " would have given me a great reason to drink .
I would have rode this one pretty darn hard . "
Two states over , Beth Meeks , executive director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence , shares tales of shelters filling up , of lost funding and growing daily calls to hot lines .
An out - of - work shrimper 's wife says her husband is angry all the time .
The wife of a laid - off oil - rig worker , who 's used to him being away for weeks at a time , ca n't get a reprieve .
The abuse is getting worse for one woman , but she feels more trapped than ever because there 's no income for her and the kids , and she already feels she overstayed her welcome with friends and relatives after Katrina .
It 's not that the oil disaster is creating abuse where it did n't exist before , Meeks says .
But given heightened stress levels among offenders who are home more than before , it 's no wonder the state hot line has seen a greater than 20 percent uptick in calls -- the bulk coming from the southern part of the state closest to the Gulf .
And a shelter in Lafayette , an inland city heavy with oil workers , got 200 more calls in the eight weeks after the oil disaster started than it did in the eight weeks before .
If the people in this region are anything like those in Alaska , and Picou thinks they are , the sociologist does n't think they 're the types that will immediately seek out help .
" These are independent , hard - working people , who feel that they do not need to go to a shrink , " Picou says .
" That 's why you need outreach . "
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals sent a request to BP in late June , seeking $ 10 million to provide mental health services to the state 's residents .
That request was denied .
Catholic Charities , affiliated with the Archdiocese of New Orleans , applied for a separate $ 12 million grant from BP -- one that would bolster their response work , as well as the work of 27 other nonprofit agencies .
About $ 1.2 million of that would be earmarked for crisis counseling .
As of Friday , BP had not responded to the application .
This struggle to find buy - in for mental health needs makes Liz McCartney smirk and shake her head in exasperation .
She is the co-founder of St. Bernard Project , a New Orleans - area nonprofit established after Katrina that 's dedicated to helping families rebuild their lives , physically and emotionally .
People have been " re-traumatized " by the oil disaster , she says , which is why her agency recently launched a peer - to - peer counseling program to train and empower community members so they can reach out to their own and de-stigmatize the need for mental health services .
After already giving $ 20 billion for lost jobs , McCartney says , BP has a great and relatively cheap opportunity to help affected communities by answering requests for counseling support .
" It 's such a quick win , " she says .
" It 's such an easy way for BP to demonstrate to people that they care not only about fixing the environment and making sure wildlife is taken care of but that people matter . "
Less than 15 miles away from McCartney 's office , Larry Carbo sits in large wooden rocking chair .
It features carvings of the phrase " Who Dat " and multiple fleur - de - lis symbols , meant to honor the Super Bowl championship - winning New Orleans Saints .
He 's on a porch beside St. Bernard Catholic Church , and the din of chirping crickets surround him .
Since mid-May , the retired New Orleans fire captain has been serving as one of Catholic Charities ' six mental health crisis counselors responding to the oil disaster .
It 's the kind of work he began doing after Katrina , when firefighters from New York -- who 'd done response work after Sept. 11 -- taught him the importance of listening and being there for others .
He 's heard it all .
Kids are acting up .
Couples are fighting .
Men are hitting the bottle or the ones they love .
A fisherman who can't stand not working admits he 's thinking about suicide .
" Just by talking , just by us listening to them , it 's a great relief .
Most people will tell you right now that they do n't have anybody to listen to them , " Carbo says .
" I 'll keep doing this as long as they need me .
I 'll be here . "
" Not a happy camper "
Raymond Barbour , 55 , sits in his humble office on a quiet street named Faith .
Junior Barbour Seafood in Coden , Alabama , outside Bayou La Batre , is the business he began with his daddy , whom he watched die working in the place .
Next door is his new house , raised high on cinder - block pylons .
The original home he was born in was carried away by Hurricane Frederic in 1979 ; the next one by Katrina five years ago .
Ask him how he 's doing , and Barbour will talk about his crabmeat and oyster business .
He 'll tell you what he 's losing each month .
He 'll wonder if he 'll have to shut down and worry about his 50 workers .
He 'll add kind words about officials looking out for folks and let you know that he still gets his gas at BP because he likes the product .
But ask him if he 's sleeping or how his marriage is going , and Barbour opens up .
If he 's lucky , he gets two hours of sleep a night .
The Ambien a doctor prescribed is n't doing a thing .
And his relationship with his wife of 37 years ?
Well , like his business , he sometimes worries whether it'll survive the oil disaster .
" I 'm probably not a happy camper to be around at times .
It just affects you that way .
It takes a little bit of something that makes you go off , and it 's not right to her .
And I know that , " he says .
" When it 's all said and done , I 'll probably need to be on one of those couches with one of those doctors trying to find out what all this has done to me . "
He says this with a laugh .
He does n't want people to worry about him .
And minutes later , Barbour is on the phone , back to trying to save his business .
Can a nation remain a superpower if its internal politics are incorrigibly stupid ?
Start with taxes .
In every other serious democracy , conservative political parties feel at least some obligation to match their tax policies with their spending plans .
David Cameron , the new Conservative prime minister in Britain , is a leading example .
He recently offered a rather brutal budget that includes severe cutbacks .
I have doubts about some of them , but at least Cameron cared enough about reducing his country ’s deficit that alongside the cuts , he also proposed an increase in the value - added tax from 17.5 percent to 20 percent .
Imagine : a fiscal conservative who really is a fiscal conservative .
That could never happen here because the fairy tale of supply - side economics insists that taxes are always too high , especially on the rich .
This is why Democrats will be fools if they do n’t try to turn the Republicans ’ refusal to raise taxes on families earning more than $ 250,000 a year into an election issue .
If Democrats go into a headlong retreat on this , they will have no standing to govern .
The simple truth is that the wealthy in the United States — the people who have made almost all the income gains in recent years — are undertaxed compared with everyone else .
Consider two reports from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
One , issued last month , highlighted findings from the Congressional Budget Office showing that “ the gaps in after - tax income between the richest 1 percent of Americans and the middle and poorest fifths of the country more than tripled between 1979 and 2007 , ” the period for which figures are available .
The other , from February , used Internal Revenue Service data to show that the effective federal income tax rate for the 400 taxpayers with the very highest incomes declined by nearly half in just over a decade , even as their pre-tax incomes have grown five times larger .
The study found that the top 400 households “ paid 16.6 percent of their income in federal individual income taxes in 2007 , down from 30 percent in 1995 . ”
We are talking here about truly rich people : Using 2007 dollars , it took an adjusted gross income of at least $ 35 million to get into the top 400 in 1992 , and $ 139 million in 2007 .
The notion that when we are fighting two wars , we ’re not supposed to consider raising taxes on such Americans is one sign of a country that ’s no longer serious .
Why do so few foreign policy hawks acknowledge that if they lack the gumption to ask taxpayers to finance the projection of American military power , we wo n’t be able to project it in the long run ?
And if we are unwilling to have a full - scale debate over whether nation - building abroad is getting in the way of nation - building at home , we will accomplish neither .
Our discussion of the economic stimulus is another symptom of political irrationality .
It ’s entirely true that the $ 787 billion recovery package passed last year was not big enough to keep unemployment from rising to over 9 percent .
But this is not actually an argument against the stimulus .
On the contrary , studies showing that the stimulus created or saved up to 3 million jobs are very hard to refute .
It ’s much easier to pretend that all this money was wasted , although the evidence is overwhelming that we should have stimulated more .
Then there ’s the very structure of our government .
Does any other democracy have a powerful legislative branch as undemocratic as the U.S. Senate ?
When our republic was created , the population ratio between the largest and smallest state was 13 to 1 .
Now , it ’s 68 to 1 .
Because of the abuse of the filibuster , 41 senators representing less than 11 percent of the nation ’s population can , in principle , block action supported by 59 senators representing more than 89 percent of our population .
And you wonder why it ’s so hard to get anything done in Washington ?
I ’m a chronic optimist about America .
But we are letting stupid politics , irrational ideas on fiscal policy and an antiquated political structure undermine our power .
We need a new conservatism in our country that is worthy of the name .
We need liberals willing to speak out on the threat our daft politics poses to our influence in the world .
We need moderates who do more than stick their fingers in the wind to calculate the halfway point between two political poles .
And yes , we need to reform a Senate that has become an embarrassment to our democratic claims .

Shazam , an amazing app that lets you identify any song by just holding your phone up to it , has turned off the tap for its free users .
It has introduced a premium version of its app called Shazam Encore for $ 5 on the Android Market .
The paid version of the app went live Tuesday evening .
That means Android users who now download the free version will get a seven - day premium trial , and if they do n't upgrade at the end of that they will be limited to identifying and tagging just five songs a month .
Shazam hit prime time when it launched its app on the Apple App store in 2008 .
Since then it has gained 15 million users on the iPhone aone and has 75 million users overall .
In November 2009 , Shazam introduced the paid version of its app for iPhone users .
The premium version offers unlimited tagging of music and recommendations that suggest other music similar to the track that ’s been tagged .
Users who downloaded and used the free app before the introduction of the paid version will continue to get all the features they had , including unlimited access .
It 's a smart move on Shazam 's part to keep its existing users happy , while trying to make money off its product .

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May : " People who are closest to the problem have to be driving the solution "
The home secretary has said it is " time to move beyond " Asbos , signalling the possible end of their use in England and Wales .
Launching a review of the system , Theresa May said it was time to " stop tolerating " bad behaviour .
More than half of Asbos in England and Wales were breached from 2000 to 2008 , government figures show .
But Labour , which devised Asbos , said they had made a " huge contribution " to cutting crime .
The Asbo - the " anti- social behaviour order " - was brought in to deal with persistent minor offenders whose actions might not otherwise have been punished .
It imposes restrictions , such as banning people from a local area or preventing them from swearing in public .
If an Asbo is breached , offenders can face jail .
Mrs May said she wanted a review of the powers because police should be able to use their " common sense " to deal with anti-social behaviour .
Punishments should be " rehabilitative and restorative " , rather than " criminalising " , she argued .
ANALYSIS Anti-social behaviour orders promised so much but , in the eyes of the new government , have delivered so little .
The Asbo was right at the heart of the New Labour project , the idea being that you could stop young tearaways in their tracks before they became career criminals .
It developed into a panoply of preventative measures aimed at nipping community disorder in the bud .
People clearly liked the theory - but the problem was always going to be the practice .
The apparatus was beset with problems , not least a feeling early on in Whitehall that councils were too timid to take on trouble - makers .
But local officials said Asbos were not a magic bullet for complex social issues such as two or more generations of angry young men neither in work nor education .
To make matters worse , some teenagers wore the Asbo as a badge of honour - while others complained they had been criminalised for being no more than immature and thoughtless .
Speaking in London , Mrs May said : " We need a complete change in emphasis , with people and communities working together to stop bad behaviour escalating . "
She also said : " We need to make anti-social behaviour what it once was - abnormal and something to stand up to ... rather than frequent and tolerated . "
Ministry of Justice figures show 55 % of the almost 17,000 Asbos issued between June 2000 and December 2008 were breached , leading to an immediate custodial sentence in more than half of the cases .
Mrs May said : " Anti-social behaviour still blights lives , wrecks communities and provides a pathway to criminality .
" It might sometimes feel like an unwinnable battle but it 's not .
There is nothing inevitable about crime and there is nothing inevitable about anti-social behaviour .
" By coming together , and only by coming together , we can win this battle . "
BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the speech signalled a " fundamental shift " in thinking away from that of the previous government , adding : " It seems Asbos wo n't be around much longer . "
For Labour , shadow home secretary Alan Johnson said Mrs May was showing " a lack of understanding about the powers already available to the police " .
He added : " An anti-social behaviour order is one of a series of different powers available to the police and is used when other punitive measures have failed ...
VIEWPOINT
Ms Carron says Asbos have been effective in cutting crime on her estate - the Clarence Way in north London .
She has worked for 11 years there tackling drug crime and anti-social behaviour .
She says Asbos give the child a chance to change , and are the only tool available to the community .
" You ca n't just go out and get an Asbo one Friday ... it can take nine months .
You build evidence but during that building , you find out what the problem is . "
She says she works closely with the police and social services and urged the home secretary to keep the system .
" Theresa May , come on the Clarence Way estate , come and stay at my house for a month , you come and see it .
" I bet she does n't have a problem outside her house like I do on my estate . "
" Of course it is right to keep such matters under review to ensure the public has speedy access to measures to stop anti-social behaviour .
However , there is no doubt that the introduction of Asbos have made a huge contribution towards tackling crime and anti-social behaviour .
" If the home secretary is to restrict the opportunities for the police to use Asbos and other measures currently available then this will be yet another example of this government going soft on crime " .
' Wider debate '
Owen Sharp , interim chief executive of the charity Victim Support , said : " We echo Theresa May 's comments that anti-social behaviour orders are n't a silver bullet , but there has to be a recognition that sometimes to get anti-social behaviour to stop then sanctions such as Asbos are needed . "
Simon Edens , of the Association of Chief Police Officers , said : " Any proposals that enable agencies and communities to better deal with anti-social behaviour are to be welcomed .
" We look forward to more details , and the opportunity to engage in a wider debate . "
It will be up to ministers in Scotland and Northern Ireland to decide what to do , if anything , with Asbos , as they are a devolved matter there .
Mrs May 's comments come after the government unveiled plans to overhaul licensing laws , with the home secretary describing alcohol misuse as a major cause of violence .
Measures include making it easier for communities to influence licensing decisions in England and Wales , with retailers selling alcohol to children receiving tougher penalties .
U.S. authorities can't account for 95 % of the £ 9.1 bn allocated to rebuild Iraq
An audit has discovered the U.S. Defense Department can't properly account for how it spent about 95 per cent of $ 9.1 billion in Iraqi oil money earmarked for rebuilding the war - ravaged country .
The U.S. Special Investigator for Iraq Reconstruction report released today said there was shoddy record keeping and a lack of oversight of the $ 8.7 billion .
The Pentagon cannot account at all for $ 2.6 billion spent between 2004 and 2007 .
The audit cited a number of factors that contributed to the inability to account for most of the money withdrawn by the Pentagon from the Development Fund for Iraq .
It said most of the Defense Department organisations that received DFI money failed to set up Treasury Department accounts , as required .
Missing money : The U.S. defence Department can't account for 95 per cent of the £ 9.1 billion it was given to rebuild Iraq
In addition , it said no Defense Department organisation was designated as the main body to oversee how the funds were accounted for or spent .
' The breakdown in controls left the funds vulnerable to inappropriate uses and undetected loss , ' the report said .
The audit found that the U.S. continues to hold about $ 34.3 million of the money even though it was required to return it to the Iraqi government .
It did not indicate that investigators believed there were any instances of fraud involved in the spending of these funds .
Rebuilding efforts , such as work to restore electricity networks , have been hit by sabotage and attacks
The money comes from the Development Fund for Iraq , set up in 2004 by the U.N. Security Council and comprised of oil revenues , Iraqi assets frozen before the 2003 U.S. - led invasion and funds from the Saddam Hussein - era oil - for - food program .
With the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority , which ran Iraq shortly after the start of the U.S. invasion in 2003 until mid-2004 , about $ 20 billion was placed into the account .
The funds are separate from the $ 53 billion allocated by U.S. Congress for rebuilding Iraq .
The report comes at a critical time for Iraq .
Despite security gains made since 2008 , bombings remain near a daily occurrence that compound the frustrations and fears of Iraqis increasingly weary of the current political crisis — one many say reflects how the country 's politicians are more interested in their own interests than those of the nation .
Politicians have hit an impasse since inconclusive parliamentary elections were held March 7 , unable to form a new government as Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , a Shiite , appears determined to stay in office .
The Iraqi government had agreed to allow the U.S. continued access to the funds after the CPA was dissolved in 2004 , but it revoked that authority in December 2007 .
In search of soft power , Brazil is turning itself into one of the world 's biggest aid donors .
But is it going too far , too fast ?
Correction to this article
ONE of the most successful post - earthquake initiatives in Haiti is the expansion of Lèt Agogo ( Lots of Milk , in Creole ) , a dairy co-operative , into a project encouraging mothers to take their children to school in exchange for free meals .
It is based on Bolsa Família , a Brazilian welfare scheme , and financed with Brazilian government money .
In Mali cotton yields are soaring at an experimental farm run by Embrapa , a Brazilian research outfit .
Odebrecht , a Brazilian construction firm , is building much of Angola 's water supply and is one of the biggest contractors in Africa .
Without attracting much attention , Brazil is fast becoming one of the world 's biggest providers of help to poor countries .
Official figures do not reflect this .
The Brazilian Co-operation Agency ( ABC ) , which runs “ technical assistance ” ( advisory and scientific projects ) , has a budget of just 52 m reais ( $ 30 m ) this year .
But studies by Britain 's Overseas Development Institute and Canada 's International Development Research Centre estimate that other Brazilian institutions spend 15 times more than ABC 's budget on their own technical - assistance programmes .
The country 's contribution to the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) is $ 20 m - 25 m a year , but the true value of the goods and services it provides , thinks the UNDP 's head in Brazil , is $ 100 m .
Add the $ 300 m Brazil gives in kind to the World Food Programme ; a $ 350 m commitment to Haiti ; bits and bobs for Gaza ; and the $ 3.3 billion in commercial loans that Brazilian firms have got in poor countries since 2008 from the state development bank ( BNDES , akin to China 's state - backed loans ) , and the value of all Brazilian development aid broadly defined could reach $ 4 billion a year ( see table ) .
That is less than China , but similar to generous donors such as Sweden and Canada — and , unlike theirs , Brazil 's contributions are soaring .
ABC 's spending has trebled since 2008 .
This aid effort — though it is not called that by the government — has wide implications .
Lavishing assistance on Africa helps Brazil compete with China and India for soft - power influence in the developing world .
It also garners support for the country 's lonely quest for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council .
Since rising powers like Brazil will one day run the world , argues Samuel Pinheiro Guimarães Neto , the minister for strategic affairs , they can save trouble later by reducing poverty in developing countries now .
Moreover , aid makes commercial sense .
For example , Brazil is the world 's most efficient ethanol producer , and wants to create a global market in the green fuel .
But it cannot do so if it is the world 's only real provider .
Spreading ethanol technology to poor countries creates new suppliers , boosts the chances of a global market and generates business for Brazilian firms .
The effort matters to the world 's aid industry , too — and not only because it helps offset the slowdown in aid from traditional donors .
Like China , Brazil does not impose Western - style conditions on recipients .
But , on the whole , western donors worry less about Brazilian aid than they do over China 's , which they think fosters corrupt government and bad policy .
Brazilian aid is focused more on social programmes and agriculture , whereas Chinese aid finances roads , railways and docks in exchange for access to raw materials ( though Brazilian firms are busy snapping up commodities in third - world nations , too ) .
Marco Farani , the head of ABC , argues there is a specifically Brazilian way of doing aid , based on the social programmes that have accompanied its recent economic success .
Brazil has a comparative advantage , he says , in providing HIV / AIDS treatment to the poor and in conditional cash - transfer schemes like Bolsa Família .
Its tropical - agriculture research is among the world 's best .
But Brazil also still receives aid so , for good or ill , its aid programme is eroding the distinction between donors and recipients , thus undermining the old system of donor - dictated , top - down aid .
And all this has consequences for the West .
Some rich - country governments cautiously welcome what Brazilians call “ the diplomacy of generosity ” , just as they do the soft - power ambitions of which aid is part .
After all , if ( as seems likely ) emerging markets are to become more influential , Brazil — stable , democratic , at peace with its neighbours — looks more attractive and tractable than , say , China or Russia .
But if aid is any guide , a lot will have to change before Brazil occupies the place in the world that its president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , aspires to .
Brazil seems almost ambivalent about its aid programme .
The country still has large pockets of third - world poverty , and sending money abroad could be controversial .
Brazilian law forbids giving public money to other governments , so legal contortions are inevitable .
The ABC aid agency is tucked away in the foreign ministry , where its officials are looked down on as “ Elizabeth Arden ” diplomats ( London–New York–Paris ) , not the “ Indiana Jones ” adventurers required .
At least some aid , for example to Venezuela , seems to have been inspired by Lula 's soft spot for leftist strongmen .
And the exponential increase in aid — the value of humanitarian contributions has risen by 20 times in just three years — means that both people and institutions are being overwhelmed .
Stories abound of broken promises , incompetence and corruption .
Slowly , though , things are changing .
Dilma Rousseff , the presidential candidate from Lula 's party , is thought to be mulling over the idea of a new development agency to raise aid 's profile , if elected .
As Mr Farani says , Brazil needs more aid officials , with more operational independence and a greater emphasis on policy aims , not just piecemeal projects .
Until it gets those , Brazil 's aid programme is likely to remain a global model in waiting — a symbol , perhaps , of the country as a whole .

How to plot fruit trees in your area :
Having a street directory is useful to accurately plot down the trees in your area but all you really need is a pen and paper .
Google maps will allow you to zoom in until you see the shape of private blocks with the street numbers as well as small alleyways that are n’t always shown on other maps .
So all you need to do is write down the address of the fruit tree i.e .
Outside of house 72 Blyth
St and then you can simply find the house and tree on Google maps later .
Using google maps you can easily plot down the fruit trees in your area .
Creating a feral fruit tree map is easy .
Here are the basic steps :
View Feral fruit trees Melbourne in a larger map .
Sign in to your google account if you have n’t already .
Click Edit in the top left hand corner Zoom into the area you want to plot .
Use the icons in the top left corner of the map .
These include :
Selection tool .
Use this to drag the map and select placemarks ..
Placemark tool .
Use this to plot fruit trees .
This will edit the overall map of fruit trees in Melbourne and plot the new trees you have added for everyone to view .
* Remember to add the name of the tree ie .
( pomegranate , apple etc ) plus any descriptive features which may aid in finding the tree , for example ‘ in front of house number 36 , hanging over fence , in front of church etc ’
* Feral Fruit Trees map has been unavailable due to changes in Google ’s system .
We ’ve added another fruit tree map here for your use in the same way .
That section of empty cubicles , the conference rooms collecting cast - off office furniture ... for employees , they 're dreary reminders of layoffs , consolidations and shelved expansion plans .
To real estate professionals , it's " shadow " office space -- space that 's leased or owned but largely empty and not officially listed anywhere as vacant .
And brokers are fretting about the buildup of unprecedented amounts of it around the Twin Cities .
All that idle square footage will likely prolong the recovery of the area 's hard - hit office sector , already struggling with high vacancy rates .
Slow demand for new space will likely mean a dearth of new construction , and all the jobs and building material sales that go with it .
NorthMarq 's semiannual Compass Report , due out today , shows that the direct office vacancy rate in the Twin Cities has hit 19.9 percent -- a 19 - year high , by NorthMarq 's numbers .
Fold in the space tenants are trying to sublease , and the rate jumps to 22.8 percent -- the highest since NorthMarq began tracking sublease space in 1995 .
The rates would be even higher if what the report describes as a " significant " amount of uncounted shadow space weighing on the market was counted .
The trouble is , while employees can clearly see the mothballed spaces , no one knows how much of it there is .
" We can't quantify the shadow space , " said John McCarthy , senior vice president of brokerage services at NorthMarq .
" That 's what 's so lurking and mysterious about it . "
McCarthy and other brokers estimate that 75 percent of companies do n't use about 10 percent of their space .
By that measure , there would be about 5 million square feet of shadow space across the seven - county metro area -- enough to push the real office vacancy rate from 19.9 percent to above 25 percent and perhaps closer to 30 .
The amount and scope is unlike anything he 's seen in nearly 20 years in the business , he said .
" It 's across all types of buildings , " McCarthy said .
" It 's just sitting there . "
Science fiction is a natural fit for Christian readers — especially dystopian novels which usually depict a world without religion , argues one writer .
But Christian bookstores and publishers are reluctant to cater to this market .
What gives ?
Advertisement
There 's been an interesting discussion about science fiction in the Christian blogosphere over the weekend .
First of all , over at Revelife , Stephanie P writes a blog post titled , " Science Fiction Goes with the Christian Life . "
She explains :
Dystopia is a type of science fiction where the author depicts a future world where the government is set up to make everything " perfect , " but is actually horribly repressive .
The dystopias like " 1984 , " " Brave New World " and " Fahrenheit 451 " all show us a world that takes the ideas we prize to an extreme to show where they go wrong ...
Dystopias show us a world without religion , where man is the measure of everything and man-made happiness has come to supplant true happiness .
Moral frameworks are out of the picture , and everything is decided by the governing body .

So it 's too bad that speculative fiction is under - represented at Christian bookstores , as writer Mike Duran points out at Novel Journey :
Perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of being a Christian who reads speculative fiction ( supernatural , sci - fi , horror , fantasy , etc. ) is the lack of speculative titles available in Christian bookstores .
It is routinely estimated that 75 - 80 % of all Christian novels are some form of romance , which leaves the other quarter - of - a- percent to duke it out for the remaining space .
But apart from the two big names —
Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti — spec titles are a rarity in Christian bookstores .
While many groups have formed ( independent presses , blog tours , message boards , crit groups , etc. ) aimed at addressing this disparity , the bottom line remains : Christians who like speculative fiction are forced to find their " fix " outside the Christian market .
At Duran 's own personal blog , he elaborates a bit more about this .
( And reveals that one of the fastest growing Christian book categories , crowding out everything else , is " Amish lit and Amish romance . "
Who knew ? )
Writes Duran :
My question to Christian readers who are turned off by supernatural story elements is this :
Do you apply that same preference to the Bible ?
Heck , the very first book of Scripture contains stories about a talking serpent , an angel with a flaming sword driving sinners from Paradise , an entire city being destroyed by fire and brimstone , plagues of frogs and rivers of blood , sparring magicians , a death angel who slaughters firstborns , and an ocean parted at one man 's word .
And that 's just the first book of the Bible !
Read on and there 's a story about a witch who conjures the ghost of a prophet , an apostle whose shadow heals the sick , and four apocalyptic horseman who are en route to planet earth .
And that 's just scratching the surface .
So how can a Christian claim to dislike supernatural / paranormal story elements when the Bible contains so many of those elements ?
Which brings me back to my initial observation :
Could the preponderance of romance and Amish lit be indicative of a dangerous worldview shift amongst Christian readers - a shift away from a biblical worldview to something sanitized , stripped of mystery , and utterly predictable ?

Actually , I 'm left wondering if this huge market for " Amish lit " comes from just Amish people , or regular Christians who just want to fantasize about being Amish ?

With the financial system on the verge of collapse in late 2008 , a group of troubled banks doled out more than $ 2 billion in bonuses and other payments to their highest earners .
Now , the federal authority on banker pay says that nearly 80 percent of that sum was unmerited .
In a report to be released on Friday , Kenneth R. Feinberg , the Obama administration ’s special master for executive compensation , is expected to name 17 financial companies that made questionable payouts totaling $ 1.58 billion immediately after accepting billions of dollars of taxpayer aid , according to two government officials with knowledge of his findings who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the report .
The group includes Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and the American International Group as well as small lenders like Boston Private Financial Holdings .
Mr. Feinberg ’s report points to companies that he says paid eye - popping amounts or used haphazard criteria for awarding bonuses , the people with knowledge of his findings said .
Even so , Mr. Feinberg has very limited power to reclaim any money .
He can use his status as President Obama ’s point man on pay to jawbone the companies into reimbursing the government , but he has no legal authority to claw back excessive payouts .
Washington ( CNN ) -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court , claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James .
Leicester Stovell alleges that the athlete and his family have been involved in a cover - up to deny paternity by committing fraud and misrepresentation .
He told HLN's " Prime News " on Thursday that he wants " a carefully structured and secure DNA test " to prove he 's the NBA all - star 's father .
Stovell says he has been trying for three years to establish paternity and is seeking $ 4 million in damages .
An earlier test ruled out the possibility , but he said the test could have been tampered with -- " and there are indications that there was a motivation . "
Stovell said he had sex with James ' mother , Gloria James , after meeting at a Washington bar while she was visiting from Ohio in 1984 .
A few months later , she told him she was pregnant , but did not say whether he was the father .
Stovell said his only request was that the child , if a boy , play basketball .
He said his memory of the encounter resurfaced more than 20 years later , " after being asked whether I had a son , and I then systematically explored all of my past for that possibility . "
" I came across this set of recollections and in focusing on them , they amplified , " he said .
In the complaint , filed June 23 , Stovell says , " I recently have concluded that a comprehensive , sophisticated and well - funded effort might well have been underway for quite some time , perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant LeBron James was in high school , to frustrate identification of his real father , and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me . "
He stopped short of saying he is certain he is James ' father .
" I do n't want to make such a definitive statement in the absence of corroborative evidence " such as DNA , he said .
Stovell said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire .
" I have some limitation considerations that caused me to want to file the suit before the end of June , " he said .
He denied the timing had anything to do with the current LeBron mania .
James is scheduled to announce Thursday evening the team he has chosen to play for next season , a deal worth perhaps tens of millions of dollars or more .
He currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers .
He says he was informed by Gloria James months later that she was pregnant .
He claims she told him the child would be named LeBron , similar to Leicester Bryce , Stovell 's first and middle names .
The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter , but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s .
Stovell is a solo legal practitioner in the District of Columbia , and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf .
A call to LeBron James ' attorney , Frederick Nance of Cleveland , Ohio , was not immediately returned .
The lawsuit had been filed without much initial publicity , but was reported by the TMZ celebrity website Wednesday .
Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
He filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency , alleging racial discrimination .
Federal court records show the case was settled when the commission paid him $ 230,000 , while not admitting fault .

The provincial government has been pushing California to count the electricity generated by British Columbia 's independent run-of - the - river power projects as renewable energy -- allowing it be sold at a premium to the state 's electric utilities .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
But , after visiting California lawmakers last month as part of government - led delegation , the executive director of the industry association representing independent power producers acknowledged that likely wo n't happen in the short - term , although he still is holding out hope for the long - term .
At issue is California 's so - called renewable portfolio standards .
Those standards , which were first introduced in 2002 , require the state 's electric utilities -- such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- to use renewable sources for 20 per cent of their retail sales by 2020 .
The standards also established rules for what counts and what does n't count as renewable power -- which , according to the province , can be sold at a price that 's up to 200 per cent higher than non-renewable power on the spot market .
In the does n't category : hydro projects that produce more than 30 megawatts of electricity and -- in the case of facilities in operation after Jan. 1 , 2006 -- change a river 's flow or have an adverse impact on its instream beneficial uses .
A government spokesperson stated the ministry of energy , mines and petroleum resources has n't analyzed which of the province 's independent power projects would meet that standard .
However , Pacific Gas and Electric released a renewable power study on June 20 , 2008 which states " BC ROR Hydro facilities will not meet any of these criteria . "
And that likely explains why the government has been trying to convince the California government , along with Pacific Gas and Electric , to loosen those standards .
California politicians were n't swayed
PG&E wants to build a high - voltage transmission line costing an estimated $ 4 to $ 7 billion to tap into the province 's renewable energy -- which , in its opinion , should include run -of - the - river power projects .
During testimony last year before the state assembly 's select committee on renewable energy , the firm 's energy procurement senior vice - president Fong Wan argued in favour of such a change by pointing out British Columbia has a " population that demands nothing less than stringent environmental protection . "
Joining him to make that point was the then head of the province 's environmental assessment office Robin Junger -- who has since been appointed the deputy minister of energy , mines and petroleum resources .
But their testimony did n't seem to sway California lawmakers .
So Junger was back - talking to them last month as the leader of a six - person delegation whose members included Donald McInnes , the vice - chairman and president of the province 's highest - profile independent power producer Plutonic Power Corporation Inc .
A spokesperson for Plutonic was unable to say why McInnes was the only independent power producer executive on the trip , according a delegate list obtained Public Eye .
For its part , the government did n't respond to that question .
But Independent Power Producers Association of BC executive director Paul Kariya -- who was also part of that delegation -- speculated it might be because Plutonic is developing both run-of - the - river and wind projects .
Busy lobbying trip
As for what happened during that trip , Kariya said he and his colleagues had four meetings with state senators and assembly members , their staffers and environmentalists .
He said the delegation was " well - received " during those meetings , but added the chances of changing California 's renewable portfolio standards is " pretty slim " in the " short - term . "
Kariya was reluctant to provide more details because he did n't want to jeopardize British Columbia 's lobbying effort .
But he did suggest California 's term - limits could mean the province will , in the future , be dealing with different politicians who are more receptive to such a change .
" Folks are privately quite positive but also candid privately and saying , ' We 're going to have to maybe play this for another day . ' "
" Meaning you might not get what you want in the short - term .
You play for the long - term , you will be playing with a whole set of different players " -- and a whole different set of conditions .
" There is a heavy , heavy dose of protectionism that one can really appreciate south of the border given their economic woes .
I 'm not saying those will go away .
But as soon as other pressures -- like the price on carbon and that -- kicks in , some of that stuff changes , " he continued , adding the delegation also urged California lawmakers to bring down some of the state 's other barriers to importing out - of - state renewable power .
But California Hydropower Reform Coalition director Keith Nakatani , one of the environmentalists who met with the delegation , has a different perspective .
In an interview with Public Eye , he said , " The main question is why should California weaken its environmental standards to accommodate what the British Columbia government wants ? "
Citing the concerns surrounding run -of - the - river power projects , Nakatani said such a change " would result in extensive environmental damage in B.C. , which would also then weaken California 's reputation as the United States 's leader in environmental protection all for the benefit of one California company . "
PG&E did n't respond to repeated requests for comment .

I have n't had time to review or reflect much on the WikiLeak 's disclosure of 92,000 classified documents to the NY Times , the London Guardian newspaper , and the German magazine Der Spiegel .
After taking a cursatory look at some of the news articles , I can't say that I 'm surprised at all .
At best , it only reflects the lack of good reporting that we 've seen to date on the war in Afghanistan - adequate reporting perhaps on the surface of things , but no in - depth analyses resulting in a good understanding of the conflict .
The NYT says :
The documents — some 92,000 reports spanning parts of two administrations from January 2004 through December 2009 — illustrate in mosaic detail why , after the United States has spent almost $ 300 billion on the war in Afghanistan , the Taliban are stronger than at any time since 2001 .
As the new American commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David H. Petraeus , tries to reverse the lagging war effort , the documents sketch a war hamstrung by an Afghan government , police force and army of questionable loyalty and competence , and by a Pakistani military that appears at best uncooperative and at worst to work from the shadows as an unspoken ally of the very insurgent forces the American - led coalition is trying to defeat .
The material comes to light as Congress and the public grow increasingly skeptical of the deepening involvement in Afghanistan and its chances for success as next year ’s deadline to begin withdrawing troops looms .
The dialogue runs directly counter to the military 's positive spin on the conflict , as leaders such as Petraeus stubbornly insist that " victory " in Afghanistan is still possible .
Just give it another four years or so .
As I said , I do n't think the reports will tell you anything particularly new .
But what I find more interesting is trying to determine who might have sent these documents to WikiLeaks - 92,000 classified documents , mostly tactical level reports , over a six - year period .
Is this person a military officer who has seen one too many operations go south ?
A low - level DOD civilian , secretly frustrated at the mismatch between reality and the manufactured news on the television ?
A poorly - screened defense contractor , taking advantage of stressed out defense personnel to slip messages out to other confederates ?
Who is this modern - day Daniel Ellsberg ?

In April , just as the iPad had hit the streets I wrote a post about how accessories set the iPad a world away from the competition .
That was based on the number of accessories that had been announced in the two months that had gone by since the device had been first introduced by Steve Jobs .
There was already a large number of companies making myriad models of cases , stands , bags , etc .
All of this was happening even before the device was available for purchasing .
All this came back to mind today as I read a post on GottaBeMobile which described how the author had spent some time in an Apple Store checking out iPad accessories and presented his thoughts on how the accessory landscape for iPads differs from other tablet devices .
His impressions are now based on three months of iPad availability and on the selection of accessories he could actually purchase in the Apple Store , instead of on press - releases and it only substantiates my original hypothesis .
The number and variety of accessories available for the iPad will set it apart from any other competitors which may be released in the near future .
This is one consideration that should be foremost in the minds of the people working on creating tablets to challenge the iPad .
It is very important for these companies to provide some accessories of their own , as Apple does with the dock , keyboard , etc .
Having a base set of accessories available from the manufacturer should help them attract more attention to their offerings .
I remember how , back in 2003 when I was considering which Pocket PC handheld to get I ended up choosing Dell ’s Axim over HP ’s many models exactly because Dell offered a full set of accessories I could get along with the device .
I ended up getting a foldable keyboard and a leather case as well as screen protectors all in the same order .
One important aspect of the iPad for accessory manufacturers however , is clearly lost on many of Apple ’s potential competitors : a single design .
Apple offers six iPad models but they all look the same and all have essentially the same dimensions .
This means that when you create a case or a stand for the iPad , you are essentially creating a product which will be usable by all of the millions of iPad users .
Now compare that to what it would be for manufacturers considering the creation of similar accessories for the products of companies that will be introducing tablets with two or three different screen sizes .
These companies would be looking at creating add - on products for a variety of models and form factors , each one with a potential market that is much smaller than that which is already available with the iPad .
The large number of accessories already available for the iPad , along with the large number of applications specifically designed for it , help to make it more attractive to potential users .
At the same time the rapidly growing number of users help make the iPad more and more attractive to accessory manufacturers as well as software developers .
At this point , just a few months after its initial public release it seems clear that Apple has already managed to start a virtuous cycle for the iPad which will be very hard for competitors to break .

Hotel occupancy is one of several industry specific indicators I follow ...
From HotelNewsNow.com : STR : US hotel results for week ending 17 July
In year - over - year measurements , the industry ’s occupancy increased 7.3 percent to 71.0 percent .
Average daily rate rose 1.6 percent to US$ 99.07
Revenue per available room went up 9.0 percent to US $ 70.30 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
the scale does n't start at zero to better show the change .
The graph shows the 4 - week average , not the weekly occupancy rate .
The following graph shows the four week moving average for the occupancy rate by week for 2008 , 2009 and 2010 ( and a median for 2000 through 2007 ) .
Notes :
On a 4 - week basis , occupancy is up 6.8 % compared to last year ( the worst year since the Great Depression ) and 4.7 % below the median for 2000 through 2007 .
On a weekly basis this is the first week since summer 2008 with the occupancy rate above 70 % .
In 2009 , the occupancy rate peaked at 67 % in mid-July .

So a while back I came across this Ted Talk .
Which led me to this company : Hampton Creek Foods .
Which led me to the store to find their products of which I only found Just Mayo .
Which is great .
But then we made contact and they sent me the GREATEST THING EVER !
Oh look how adorable .
It ’s like a one of those little ice creams from when you were a kid .
The kind you ate with a flat wooden spoon .
Wait a minute .
What ’s this in the lid ?
A spoon ?
They sent me three of these little cups .
I ate one .
Amazing .
Over too soon .
I gave one to a friend ( mistake ) .
Then with the third one I managed to stop eating enough to squeeze out two
( one and half )
cookies that I actually baked to see how that works .
EVEN BETTER THAN THE DOUGH !
WHY AM I SCREAMING ?!
Because you ca n’t get Eat the Dough in stores .
You have to know someone or meet someone like I did .
So you have to start bothering these guys to get this stuff in stores pronto .

Revelations of extensive plagiarism in work that gubernatorial candidate Scott McInnis claimed as his own call into question his fitness for public office .
The lifted work , examined in The Denver Post , constitutes inexcusable intellectual thievery .
It is so damaging that we believe McInnis ought to drop out of the race .
Colorado ’s next governor should be a person of integrity , a trusted hand to lead the state through difficult times .
The Post revealed in Tuesday ’s paper that McInnis was paid to write essays on water in 2005 and 2006 yet turned in writings that had been plagiarized .
Now we learn he did the same thing in a 1994 op - ed in the Rocky Mountain News .
We were astonished Tuesday to hear McInnis , in an interview with 9 News , call the revelations over his water essays a “ non-issue . ”
Later , he did tell us he had made a mistake and that he should have checked the material .
Yes , he should have .
The Hasan Family Foundation paid McInnis $ 300,000 over two years to give talks on water issues and write original , monthly articles on the topic .
The plagiarism detailed by Post reporter Karen E. Crummy is extensive .
McInnis says he hired a consultant to serve as an expert for the writings .
Yet the foundation hired McInnis as the expert , and McInnis ’ work never mentioned the help of anyone else .
It was presented as his own .
The written work he submitted to the foundation included numerous instances of passages that were copied , with few changes , from scholarly work originated by Gregory J. Hobbs , who is now a Colorado Supreme Court justice .
The former congressman was paid handsomely for work that he said was “ original and not reprinted from any other source . ”
It was McInnis ’ obligation to ensure that was true .
Unfortunately , this is not the first time we ’ve had questions about McInnis ’ judgment .
During his final term in Congress , he paid his wife $ 37,000 to be his campaign manager — even though he already had decided he was n’t going to run for re-election .
As we said in 2004 , the arrangement “ smacks of bad judgment . ”
More recently , we were taken aback by McInnis ’ refusal to release tax forms , even though Colorado ’s gubernatorial candidates since 1998 routinely have done so .
What is he hiding ?
McInnis ’ financial records are pertinent information .
Detractors have characterized him as a “ lawyer - lobbyist , ” and we think voters have a right to know how he has made his money .
We ’ve also been puzzled by McInnis ’ inability — or refusal , it ’s difficult to know which — to provide detail on his philanthropy even though he claims to have been generous to individuals down on their luck .
The best specific example he could come up with was having given the meat of a dead elk to a family in need .
Equally odd was his failure to recall being a member of an advisory board for a pro-choice GOP group .
The plagiarism and other issues have cumulatively so damaged McInnis ’ credibility that we do not believe he can be an effective governor .
Even though McInnis acknowledged he made a mistake , he still spent part of Tuesday blaming a research assistant for the failure to credit the work .
If you put your name on something and take money for it — a lot of money in this case — it is your responsibility to make rock - solid sure it is bona fide , original work that will stand up to scrutiny .
The state ’s chief executive must be someone Coloradans can believe in as the state suffers a stretch of tight budgets and a struggling economy .
If Scott McInnis cannot be trusted to turn in what amounts to an overpaid term paper — without plagiarizing someone else ’s work — there is no way he can be relied upon to guide Colorado through these complicated times .
And that right there , readers , is the most bizarre headline we 've ever typed .
Noted -- noted ! -- anti-mountain bike crusader Mike Vandeman was " arrested yesterday and charged with assault with a deadly weapon after he attacked a pair of mountain bikers with a handsaw . "
Cyclelicio.us reports :
According to UC police , a pair of mountain bikers were cycling on a fire road in the hills above the UC Berkeley campus .
A hiker — Mike Vandeman — struck one of the cyclists with a saw , cutting him across the chest .
East Bay mountain bikers have reported other similar attacks on them , and some mountain bikers I know have expressed concern for their personal safety when Mike Vandeman is around .
The harrowing incident , according to UC Berkeley police , happened on May 15 .
Cyclelico.us goes on to point out that Vanderman gained gained attention in the 90s via his Usenet postings to w rec k . bikes in which he painted mountain bikers as " addicted , narcissistic , violently insane liars . "
Update : All charges against Mike Vandeman have been dropped .

Tuesday signed legislation into law requiring that eggs sold in California come from hens that are not crammed into cages .
The law requires all eggs sold in the state as of Jan. 1 , 2015 , to come from hens able to stand up , fully extend their limbs , lie down and fully extend their wings without touching each other or the sides of cages .
The new regulations comply with the standards outlined in Proposition 2 , which was approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2008 .
The measure , which captivated animal welfare advocates , was championed by the Humane Society of the United States as a way to protect hens and improve food safety for consumers .
" Californians have made it clear that they do n't want unsafe eggs from hens crammed into cages , and we applaud the Legislature and governor for heeding this call , " Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle said in a statement .

2010 has been a very good year for gaming so far , says review aggregator Metacritic .
Metacritic is n't that hard to understand : Reviews go in , averaged score comes out .
But what 's trickier to spot , unless you 're very good at mental mathematics , is that the average of the averages is on the rise , at least according to Metacritic 's midyear report .
Scores rose by an average of 3.9 for each platform , with the PC seeing the highest increase at 5.1 points , closely followed by PSP and DS , which both saw a 4.0 point increase .
The smallest increase was for Xbox 360 games , which only increased by 2.9 points .
However , the difference in total scores between platforms is very small , with the highest being the PC at 73.7 points and the lowest being the PSP at 70.3 .
Oh , and if you were wondering , the average of the averaged averages is 71.8 %
The number of " bad " games - games with Metacritic scores of 49 or lower - has gone down against last year , with only 16 versus 2009's 25 .
On the other end of the spectrum , Red Dead Redemption , Mass Effect , and Super Mario Galaxy 2 all scored highest than Street Fighter IV , which was the highest rated game of the first half of 2009 .
So what do these numbers actually mean ?
Well , that depends on what you think of review scores .
It does seem to suggest that the average quality of games has increased over this time last year .
The numbers are based on opinion , however , and there are so many factors that shape an opinion , any conclusion you might draw has a lot of ifs and buts and other qualifiers attached to it .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China ’s signal that it will ease its currency ’s 23 - month - old peg to the dollar will spare the country from U.S. lawmakers ’ wrath only if it opens the door to significant upward movement in the yuan .
Without quick follow - up by China to its terse announcement on Saturday , Democrats and Republicans eager to show voters they are looking out for U.S. jobs before congressional elections in November will renew a drive to punish China for “ currency manipulation . ”
U.S. President Barack Obama could still formally label China as a currency manipulator that suppresses the value of its yuan for unfair trade advantages and the United States could treat China ’s currency as a subsidy warranting U.S. duties on more Chinese imports .
Beijing ’s new currency regime does little to stop efforts in the U.S. Congress to slap duties on Chinese imports , although time might be running out for lawmakers restricted by a busy agenda that includes a major reform of financial regulations and perhaps an energy bill .
Many legislators will start campaigning around September for the elections in November .
Just days before leaders of the Group of 20 major developed and developing nations meet in Toronto , China ’s central bank said it would gradually make the yuan ’s exchange rate more flexible , in a possible return to policies it pursued from 2005 to 2008 .
But Beijing all but ruled out a one - off revaluation or major appreciation sought by critics such as Democratic Senator Charles Schumer , leader of a bipartisan group of lawmakers threatening to pass legislation to prod China to move .
Congress and the U.S. Treasury Department should hold fire and see how China implements the policy and , critically , how Beijing responds to any yuan rise in financial markets , said a prominent critic of Chinese currency policies .
“ If they let the rate start going up on a one - shot basis , that is significant , or look like letting it go up consistently -- by say a percent or so a month .
Either of those should be enough for the Treasury or the Congress to say ‘ OK , this is now moving in the right direction , ’ ” said C. Fred Bergsten , head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
“ But if this is just a statement of principle and nothing much happens for a couple weeks or a couple months , then you have to resume the pressure . ”
“ STRONG LEGISLATION ”
China said on Sunday it will keep the yuan ’s exchange rate at a basically stable level , prompting criticism from Schumer , the main hawk on China in Congress .
“ Just a day after there was much hoopla about the Chinese finally changing their policy , they are already backing off , ” Schumer said , calling for “ strong legislation ” by Congress .
China has held the yuan at roughly 6.83 to the dollar since July 2008 in an attempt to insulate the fastest - growing major economy from the ravages of the global financial crisis .
For the three years before that , it loosened the peg and gradually let the yuan rise about 21 percent in value , which took the steam out of anger in Congress , although many lawmakers and manufacturers were upset it did not rise more .
Sander Levin , chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee , indicated Congress would not be mollified if China only tinkered with its exchange rate .
“ We have seen actions like this before and it is clear that China did not allow enough appreciation the last time it adopted a policy like this one , from 2005 to 2008 , ” he said .
Many Western economists estimate the yuan is still undervalued by 25 percent to 40 percent , giving Chinese companies a huge price advantage in international trade .
A U.S. manufacturing group that blames China ’s currency for the loss of more than a million jobs said its members still want Congress to keep up the pressure on China .
“ Unless the move is rapid and significant , China ’s announcement is nothing more than a cynical ploy ahead of the G20 and in the wake of mounting congressional pressure , ” said Scott Paul , executive director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing .
BRIEF COOLING -OFF PERIOD
Anger about the exchange rate has coalesced behind a bill advanced by Schumer in the Senate and others in the House that would require the Commerce Department to treat currencies seen as undervalued as a subsidy so that firms could seek duties against them .
The bill is a much milder version of legislation Schumer and colleagues sponsored several years ago that would have hit all Chinese goods with a 27.5 percent tariff .
The latest bill would probably add to the 3 percent of U.S. imports from China already covered with countervailing or anti-dumping duties .
Chinese leaders now have put the onus on Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to gauge if they can credibly tell Congress that Beijing is not manipulating its currency .
Obama complained loudly about Chinese currency manipulation during his 2008 presidential campaign but resisted labeling Beijing as a currency manipulator in two semi-annual Treasury reports issued during the peak of the global crisis .
As the world economy began to stabilize , U.S. complaints about China ’s exchange rate policies resurfaced .
Geithner postponed the Obama administration ’s third review of China ’s currency practices , which was due on April 15 , in effect giving Beijing until the G20 leaders ’ meeting to act .
Schumer and like - minded lawmakers are also pressing the Commerce Department to begin slapping countervailing duties on some Chinese goods even without new legislation .
In two cases involving coated paper and an aluminum product , U.S. officials are weighing arguments that China ’s undervalued currency is itself a trade subsidy .
Raghuram Rajan , economics professor at the University of Chicago and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , said Beijing ’s announcement “ will allow both China and the U.S. to cool off before either side does something to precipitate a trade war . ”
But U.S. politicians do not want to be seen as weak on China before the congressional elections in November .
Even if Washington gives China a pass in the delayed currency manipulation report , now expected by early July , the next semi-annual report is due on October 15 , just weeks before election day .

UPDATE : Written Declaration 29 was finally adopted by 371 members of the European Parliament .
The Declaration 's author backpedaled on data retention for search engines , with a disjointed explanation that it is possible to have limited — and simultaneously blanket — search engine surveillance .
Unsurprisingly , members of Parliament are still confused .
Stay tuned for more on the fate of data retention in Europe .
A controversial , surreptitious proposal to compel search engines to store everything that European citizens search for on the Internet has been introduced by a few members of the European Parliament .
The veiled mandatory data retention proposal was sneaked into a broader declaration called " Written Declaration 29 , " which ostensibly seeks to promote the protection of children by developing an early warning system ( EWS ) to fight against pedophiles and sex offenders .
But hidden within the text of the Declaration is obscure language mandating the storing of searches on a massive scale :
Ask the [ European ] Council and the [ European ] Commission to implement Directive 2006 / 24 / EC and extend it to search engines in order to tackle online child pornography and sex offending rapidly and effectively .
The Directive 2006 / 24 / EC , more widely known as the European Data Retention Directive , is an unpopular framework that compels telecommunications service providers operating in Europe to store all communications traffic data between six months and up to 2 years , for possible use by law enforcement .
European Privacy officials had previously stated that " search queries themselves would be considered content rather than traffic data and the Directive would therefore not justify their retention . "
But in spite of that advice , Written Declaration 29 seeks to extend data retention to search engines .
The campaign promoting Written Declaration 29 focuses only on the goal of protecting children online , and is otherwise silent on the extension of the Data Retention Directive to search engines .
The successful hiding of this controversial provision is likely what led 324 European Parliamentarians to sign the Declaration , coming close to the member signatures that it would take for the Written Declaration to be adopted .
Once adopted , members of the European Parliament can use written declarations to launch or relaunch a debate on a subject that comes within the EU ’s remit .
But when Cecilia Wikström , a member of the European Parliament , learned that the Declaration , in fact , seeks to violate EU citizens ' search privacy by extending the Data Retention Directive to search engines ; she publicly withdrew her support , and boldly spoke out against the proposal , seeking to clarify any possible misunderstandings for her colleagues :
Both of the two e-mails sent to [ Members of the European Parliament ] focused on the early warning system and neither mentioned the Data Retention Directive .
The website set up to support the written declaration also does not mention Data Retention , at least not in an obvious way .
Even the written declaration itself does not mention the Directive by name , but only refers to its reference number .
Parliamentarian Wikström also said :
The Written Declaration is supposed to be about an early - warning system for the protection of children .
Long - term storage of citizens ’ data has clearly nothing to do with ' early warning ' for any purpose .
The ' data preservation ' system established by the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention was designed specifically for cases requiring urgent preservation of data in relation to ongoing investigations .
Written Declaration 29 is well - intended , however , the blanket surveillance proposal completely undermines the campaign to protect children .
No measures should be implemented that cause damage to other human rights .

IT ’S the trailblazer of solar sailing .
Japan ’s IKAROS spacecraft has used “ smart glass ” technology to steer using only the pressure of sunlight – a first for solar sails .
IKAROS launched in May and soon after became the first solar sail to be fully propelled by sunlight .
Now liquid crystal devices along the outer edge of the sail have been used to steer the craft .
The devices control the reflectivity of the outer sections of the sail ; switching one on creates a mirror - like effect , allowing sunlight to push more on those parts of the sail .

The original Starcraft was released some 12 years ago and has become one of the most popular PC titles ever , selling over 11 million units to date .
The first entry in the game 's sequel , following years of fan anticipation , arrives in two weeks bearing an unprecedented budget .
The $ 100 million man .
According to the Wall Street Journal ( subscription required ) , Activision Blizzard has spent over $ 100 million on the three - part sequel to the science - fiction real - time strategy game , which kicks off with Starcraft II : Wings of Liberty on July 27 .
The report stated the $ 100 million was purely development price and made no mention of marketing expenditures .
That lofty figure well exceeds Gran Turismo 5's $ 60 million development cost , one of the most expensive video games to date .
Activision Blizzard CEO
Bobby Kotick has previously labeled the Starcraft franchise as one of the company 's seven " pillars of opportunity . "
Kotick said each pillar has the potential to reap between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion of operating profit for the publisher throughout its life .
The other pillars are Call of Duty , Guitar Hero , World of Warcraft , Diablo , new Blizzard MMOG , and Bungie 's new intellectual property .
Kotick was n't the only Activision Blizzard executive speaking about the game though .
Blizzard president Mike Morhaime told the paper that the publisher should be able to migrate some of its World of Warcraft subscribers to Starcraft II .
" We 've brought in a lot of new players in the beta testing who 've been playing World of Warcraft but have never tried Starcraft , " Morhaime said .

The announcement earlier this year of the renewable energy feed - in - tariff for South Africa was a progressive step by energy policy makers .
The value of these tariffs even surpassed the expectations of most stakeholders involved in the renewable energy industry .
But how does South Africa ’s renewable energy market match up against other countries on the African continent , specifically in the case of the wind power market ?
Unfortunately , the answer is “ not very well . ”
Over 97 % of the total installed wind power on the continent is installed in Egypt , Tunisia and Morocco .
In 2008 , 104 MW of wind power was added on the continent .
Egypt , Tunisia and Morocco made up 99 % of that total .
To understand why the North African countries are leading the rest of the continent in wind power projects , one must appreciate the specific factors driving wind market developments in this region .
Some Drivers for Wind Power Projects in North Africa
Proximity to the European Market —
The proximity of North African countries to Europe and the growing electrical grid interconnections between these regions is one of the reasons for the strong interest in the North African wind energy market .
European countries have committed themselves to meeting CO2 emissions targets and are investing resources into clean energy projects .
For example , Tunisia and Italy plan to integrate the electrical grid connections between the two countries .
Once the underwater connection between the countries is completed , Tunisian clean energy companies will be able to export 200 MW of energy to Italy .
High Wind Potential —
The wind speeds and wind reliability in North African countries rank amongst the highest in the world .
These wind resources are exceptional , therefore this part of the continent was always a strong candidate to develop into a formidable wind power market .
Ambitious Renewable Energy Targets
Egypt has set a renewable energy target of 20 % of electricity generation by 2020 .
Wind energy is expected to contribute 12 % of this renewable energy .
Morocco has set its renewable energy target at 20 % of electricity generation by 2012 .
Tunisia has set a wind energy target of 180 MW by 2011 .
These targets form part of the key incentives that project developers use to assess the level of government commitment to renewable energy projects in these countries .
( See lead image for chart showing key market drivers for wind development in Africa . )
The Growth of the Egyptian Wind Market in Particular
Quick Government Thinking and Action — With 365 MW of installed wind power , Egypt has the highest wind capacity on the continent .
Measurement of the wind energy potential began in earnest in the country in 2000 and 2001 .
In 2001 , the Renewable Energy Authority ( NREA ) , accumulated data on the sites with the highest annual wind speeds in the country .
Following this , the ministry of electricity and energy acquired more than 800 m² of land to be used to develop wind energy projects .
Strategic Alliances with International Development Agencies —
Perhaps the most important intervention of the Egyptian government was to align the country with international development agencies to assist in the construction of wind farm projects .
German financier , Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbla ( KfW ) , Danish International Development Agency , DANIDA , the Spanish government and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation , JBIC , form the impressive list of development agencies that have been instrumental in providing loans to the Egyptian government to develop wind power projects .
Investments by these agencies will provide an injection of capital in different phases of the multi-stage Zafarana wind project in Egypt .

Why Has South Africa Lagged Behind ?
Prior to 2006 , energy intensive industries were not under pressure to reduce electricity consumption and introduce energy efficiency measures .
The reliability of power supply to these industries was good and the cost of electricity lower than the global average .
Thus , these industries had no reason to pressure the utility to explore alternative forms of power generation .
Self - power generation projects were largely a long - term plan , and not a serious consideration .
The same holds true for domestic users of electricity in South Africa .
Prior to the events in 2007 / 2008 , South African households enjoyed a reliable supply of power and had not experienced the sweeping power outages that led to load shedding in 2007 / 2008 .
There was therefore no public or industry pressure on the utility to explore alternative sources of power generation .
Today however , public pressure on the utility has increased from both the industrial and domestic sectors .
Energy efficiency , renewable energy and DSM ( demand - side management ) are the hot topics of the day , which has led to the focus on renewable energy for power generation .
What Is The Role of Wind Power Projects in South Africa ?
Wind energy is unlikely to form an integral part of the future baseload energy capacity in South Africa .
Nuclear and coal energy will be the key components of the energy mix in the country .
This is not to say that wind power projects do not have an important role in the country though .
The lower upfront capital costs for wind power projects and shorter time - to - completion lead times allow wind power projects to add additional capacity to the national grid far quicker than a new coal or nuclear energy plant can .
Wind power projects have the potential to total more than 300 MW of installed capacity in the next three years .
The contribution that wind power projects will make is however largely dependant on key issues such as grid capacity , private sector investment , EIA application processes and the regulatory environment in South Africa .

Summary : What can South Africa Learn from North Africa ?
1. Identify organizations that can assist in thoroughly assessing and addressing wind energy potential in the country .
Without accurate data on the wind speed and wind variability at a specific site , equipment manufacturers , project developers and investors will not be interested in investing time and resources into a project .
One organization that has been key in the development of the North African wind energy market , is the German technical co-operation agency ( GTZ ) .
The GTZ has been instrumental in North Africa and is partnering with South Africa to support the development of its wind market .
2. Identify development finance institutions to assist in funding projects in the country .
Loans with favourable interest payments provided by Spanish , Danish , and French organisations have assisted in developing the North African wind market into the powerhouse it is on the African continent .
South Africa should look to investigate similar routes of sourcing finance .
Conclusion
While South Africa might not catch up with its Northern counterparts , it certainly has all the resources necessary to develop a significant wind energy industry .
The wind potential is abundant , regulatory incentives are favourable and project developers , equipment suppliers and financiers have already expressed intent to get involved in the sector .
What is required now is more dialogue between the regulators of the renewable energy industry on issues such as grid stability , grid connection costs and the time frame in which these issues will be resolved .

Mark Zuckerberg turned strangers ' intimate moments into riches .
We turned the tables on the Facebook CEO , lurking outside his house , following him out with his girlfriend and pals , and to Chinese language lessons .
America 's youngest billionaire got the paparazzi treatment .
For all the power and money in Silicon Valley , tech dons have managed to escape the sort of scrutiny the tabloid press brings to bear on the celebrities of Hollywood or the moguls of New York .
Until now .
Photographer Nick Stern spent a long weekend following Zuckerberg around Silicon Valley .
He trailed Zuckerberg around Palo Alto streets by car , tailed him to a Stanford University event , snapped pictures of the young CEO outside a bar , and trained his camera lens on the people coming in and out of Zuckerberg 's modest College Terrace abode .
Stern brought back these pictures of the 212th - richest man in the world spending time with his buddies , girlfriend , sister , and colleagues .
The most interesting thing about Zuckerberg 's life may well be how ordinary it is for such a well - off 26 year old .
Few that age would have trouble coming up with flashy ways to spend an estimated $ 4 billion fortune , even one that 's largely still on paper .
( Zuckerberg has acknowledged taking cash out of at least one funding round in recent years . )
Yet , as the photos below show , Zuck does n't seem to have ramped up his spending all that much from his days coding the first prototype of Facebook in his Harvard dormitory room .
Zuckerberg can still be seen wearing flip flops wherever he goes , or sometimes a pair of unremarkable running shoes .
His car is nothing you 'd blink at on a Bay Area freeway .
His taste in bars is downmarket and collegiate .
Zuckerberg 's house is modest , even humdrum , save for the fact that it's in the conveniently located College Terrace neighborhood of Palo Alto , near Facebook headquarters and the Stanford University campus .
It does n't even look like Zuckerberg sprang for laundry service , considering he wears nearly identical faded gray t- shirts day after day , even as comely girlfriend Priscilla Chan cycled through a variety of stylish outfits .
If it feels a little naughty to take such a close look into Zuckerberg 's life , remember that this is the executive who pushed the private information of Facebook 's hundreds of millions of users progressively further into the public sphere .
Facebook turned users ' friends lists into public information ; it asked them to either publicize their likes and interests or delete such information entirely ; it removed the option to conceal their profile photos ; Facebook even let some partner websites tap into profiles without asking .
The list goes on and on .
Through it all , Zuckerberg has been alternately defiant and chastened .
For every couple of pieces of personal information his company has appropriated , he 's given one back , roughly speaking .
But the net effect has been to give Facebook an unprecedented amount of information about an unprecedented number of people .
Click to viewThere 's a philosophical underpinning to these moves .
Zuckerberg seems to believe that " the age of privacy is over " ; he said after a wave of Facebook privacy rollbacks that " we decided that these would be the social norms now . "
All in all , Facebook 's CEO does n't seem too preoccupied about your privacy , or about ours .
Likewise , we were n't bothered by the notion of tailing him around the Valley for a few days , or about sharing the experience with you .
Enjoy .
Monte Carlo simulations are a handy tool for looking at situations that have some aspect of uncertainty , by modelling them with a pseudo - random element and conducting a large number of trials .
There is n’t a hard and fast Monte Carlo algorithm , but the process generally goes : start with a situation you wish to model , write a program to describe it that includes a random input , run that program many times , and look at the results .
In each case , you ’re taking a pot shot at the result , and over many iterations you should get a broad picture of the probabilities of certain outcomes .
If these match observations of the real situation , your model is a good one .
Alternatively , if you can achieve certain results through randomness that others put down to some other factor , perhaps there is more chance in the real situation that others have expected .
As an example , lets imagine visiting an SEO expo , filled with 10,000 SEO experts .
Now , 20 % of the experts are creative copywriters and link profile experts who will help to make your site more usable , more readable , faster , and help drive traffic from disparate sources as they improve your search profile .
The others are clueless keyword stuffers and link spammers , who will turn your site into an real mess .
However , a given rank on a results page is dependent on an awful lot of things - how the site was originally , what other sites are doing , changes to google ’s algorithms , temporary network and server effects and so on .
Because of that , sometimes the bad SEOs get their sites onto the front page , and sometimes the good ones do n’t .
Let estimate that the good SEOs get their site onto the first page under a given term two thirds of the time , while for the bad SEOs it ’s only one third of the time .
Now , whichever SEO you ask claims to be in the good category , of course , so you ask to see the results for the last 5 sites they optimised .
If they are all on the first page , can you be confident you ’ve got a good one ?
We can set up a monte carlo simulation for that by simply looping over the five sites , and seeing which ones succeed each time , by chance , and which fail .
Starting with our total 10,000 SEO population , how many good vs bad SEOs do we expect .
<? php $ tGood = $ tBad = 0 ; $ iterations = 10000 ; for ( $iters = 0 ; $iters < $ iterations ; $iters ++ ) { $ goodCount = 2000 ; $ badCount = 8000 ; for ( $ i = 0 ; $ i < 5 ; $ i ++ ) { $ max = $ goodCount ; for ( $j = 0 ; $j < $ max ; $j ++ ) { if ( lcg_value () < 0.33 ) { $ goodCount -- ; } } $ max = $ badCount ; for ( $j = 0 ; $j < $ max ; $j ++ ) { if ( lcg_value () < 0.66 ) { $ badCount -- ; } } } $ tGood += $ goodCount ; $ tBad += $ badCount ; } var_dump ( " Good SEOs : " .
$ tGood / $ iterations ) ; var_dump ( " Bad SEOs : " .
$ tBad / $ iterations ) ; ?>
After our 10,000 iterations , we see the numbers come out with a majority of good SEOs , but some bad ones have made it through :
string ( 19 ) " Good SEOs : 270.0382 " string ( 16 ) " Bad SEOs : 36.343 "
This is an example where we can use brute force to solve what would otherwise be an integration problem .
Admittedly , this is not a very difficult problem , but the logic can be continued and refined into situations that are require more complex maths .
The wikipedia Monte Carlo simulator page has a good description of how the value of Pi can be estimated by a Monte Carlo method , for example .
Projecting The Future
For a more complicated example , we can think about planning a development project .
We ’d like to take a set of estimates , and run them through a Monte Carlo simulation to see what kind of overall times we can expect .
Imagine that we ’ve taken a look at past projects , and concluded a few things about the estimate .
Our estimates always come in a ‘ best case ’ , ‘ worst case ’ variety , so we have a range of numbers .
Most tasks are delivered somewhere within that range , usually well under the worst case , but there are small few that seem to go way over it .
We decide to model this by assuming that worst case is actually 3 times that estimated originally .
However , rather than assuming we have equal chance of getting any value in that range ( a flat distribution ) , we want to model our chance of getting the lower results as being higher than getting the higher ones .
This kind of distribution is called a power law , and we can use a function that models that distribution for our random function .
<? php function powerLaw ( $ min , $ max , $ n ) { $ max += 1 ; $ val = pow ( ( pow ( $ max , $ n + 1 ) - pow ( $ min , $ n + 1 ) ) * lcg_value ( ) + pow ( $ min , $ n + 1 ) , ( 1.0 / ( $ n + 1 ) ) ) ; return $ max - 1 - $ val + $ min ; } function getTotalTime ( $ estimates ) { $ totalTime = 0 ; foreach ( $estimates as $ estimate ) { $ totalTime += powerLaw ( $ estimate [ ' best ' ] , $ estimate [ ' worst ' ] * 3 , 5 ) ; } return $ totalTime ; } ?>
With those functions in place , all we have to do is feed in our estimates , and for each one run them through the getTotalTime function .
We can do a number of loops of this , and look at the results that we get .
<? php // our estimates $ estimates = array ( " login form " => array ( " best " => 2 , " worst " => 10 ) , " forgotten password " => array ( " best " => 8 , " worst " => 20 ) , " profile page " => array ( " best " => 16 , " worst " => 20 ) , " avatar upload " => array ( " best " => 8 , " worst " => 14 ) , ) ; // conduct 10,000 trials $ results = array ( ) ; for ( $ i = 0 ; $ i < 10000 ; $ i ++ ) { $res = getTotalTime ( $ estimates ) ; if ( ! isset ( $ results [ $ res ] ) ) { $ results [ $res ] = 0 ; } $ results [ $res ] ++ ; } ksort ( $ results ) ; ?>
This gives us an array of results , from which we can calculate some estimates .
For example , although the worst case from the estimates is 64 hours , if we want to account for 80 % of the runs we ’d need to allocate around 68 hours - and assuming our model is correct then our project would still have a 20 % chance of going over !
We can visualise this by using the Google Charts API , which helps to show how , while the bulk of runs fit around the original hours , there is a tail to consider of unexpectedly long delivery times :
<? php $url = “ http :// chart .
apis .
google .
com / chart ?
chs = 450 x200 & cht = bvs ” ; $url .= ‘ & chds = 0 , ’ . max ( $ results ) ; $url .= ‘ & chd = t : ’ . implode ( “ , ” , $ results ) ; $url .= “ & chbh = 3 , 1 , 1 ” ; echo $url ; // url for google ?>
The length of time runs along the horizontal access , number of trials that resulted in that time in the vertical access .
The long tail of growing times of the estimate show why to get a more certain timescale we have to go way over our original worst case , but still having the project likely to be delivered somewhere in the original range .
The nice thing about these methods is that they are fairly easy to get a grip of .
You can plug in a randomness function of your choosing based on almost anything , and try modelling situations that otherwise would be hard to understand intuitively .
By plotting the result of calculating statistics you can quickly try out scenarios and get a feel for different sort of effects , as long as there ’s an element in the thing you are modelling that is chaotic enough to be effective random .

Czym jest Forex już większość już wie .
Coraz więcej osób planuje lub już zaczęło grę na giełdzie walutowej .
Jednak bardzo ważnym krokiem jest wybór brokera .
Bowiem dobra platforma transakcyjna , to połowa sukcesu .
Na czym więc należy się skupić przy wyborze platformy transakcyjnej ?
O to kilka cennych rad .
Po pierwsze , należy sprawdzić czy nad danym brokerem jest sprawowany nadzór przez komisję finansową .
W zale żności od tego , w jakim kraju będzie zarejestrowana firma , to do takiego rejestru powinna być wpisana firma .
Nadzór firmy brokerskiej zagwarantuje nam , że wpłacone pieniądze są bezpieczne , a wypłaty będą pewne .
Jest to bardzo ważny krok , ponieważ na rynku forexowym jest coraz więcej firm oferujących możliwość gry online , ale duża część tych firm działa nielegalnie lub bankrutuje .
Dlatego po prostu nie ryzykuj i wybierz sprawdzone narzędzia .
FXranking to sprawdzona lista najlepszych firm .
Kolejnym krokiem jest sprawdzenie kosztów otwierania transakcji i prowadzenia rachunku .
Nie które platformy utrzymują się wyłącznie z tzw .
spreadów ale większość pobiera dodatkowe opłaty , a jeśli broker jest zagraniczny , to dodatkowo przy wypłatach i wpłatach trzeba zapłacić różnicę wymiany walut ( są oczywiście tacy , którzy biorą wszystkie opłaty na siebie ) .
Następnie ważną rzeczą jest to , czy broker oferuje grę na mikrolotach .
Dla początkujących na Forexie i nie posiadaj ących dużego kapitału , to jest najlepsze rozwiązanie .
Na pocz ątku warto otworzy ć rachunek demo i przetestować samą platformę transakcyjną .
Należy zwrócić szczególną uwagę na to , jakie możliwości dają narzędzia w niej umieszczone , czy wykresy są przejrzyste , czy do wyboru mamy dużo wskaźników , czy istnieje możliwość samodzielnego tworzenia wykresów .
Warto tutaj przetestować czy platforma
Forex działa sprawnie , czy nie zawiesza się , czy transakcje nie wchodzą z opóźnieniem .
Na koniec warto sprawdzić support .
Możliwość kontaktu telefonicznego , obsługa w języku polskim oraz szybkość odpowiedzi na pytania .

More than 40 percent of homeowners seeking help from the Obama administration 's flagship effort to rescue those at risk of foreclosure have dropped out of the program .
The latest report on the program suggests foreclosures could rise in the second half of the year and weaken an ailing housing market .
About 530,000 borrowers have fallen out of the program as of last month , the Treasury Department said Tuesday .
Nearly 1.3 million homeowners had enrolled since March 2009 .
Treasury officials say few of these borrowers will wind up in foreclosure .
But many analysts are concerned that a new wave of foreclosures could greatly impact the struggling housing industry .
Another 390,000 homeowners , or 30 percent of those who started the program , have received permanent loan modifications and are making payments on time .
A major reason so many have fallen out of the program is the Obama administration initially pressured banks to sign up borrowers without insisting first on proof of their income .
When banks later moved to collect the information , many troubled homeowners were disqualified or dropped out .
Many borrowers complain of a bureaucratic nightmare .
They say banks often lose their documents and then claim borrowers did not send back the necessary paperwork .
The banking industry said borrowers were n't sending back the necessary paperwork .
The Obama plan was designed to help people in financial trouble by lowering their monthly mortgage payments .
Homeowners who qualify can receive an interest rate as low as 2 percent for five years and a longer repayment period .
The average monthly payment has been cut by about $ 500 on average .
The homeowners receive temporary modifications .
These are supposed to become permanent after borrowers make three payments on time and complete the required paperwork .
That includes proof of income and a letter explaining the reason for their troubles .
In practice , though , the process has taken far longer .
The more than 100 participating mortgage companies get taxpayer incentives to reduce payments .
But as of mid-May only $ 132 million has been spent out of a potential $ 75 billion , according to the Government Accountability Office .
Though the program has been widely criticized for making only a small dent in the foreclosure crisis , administration officials defend their efforts .
They say that the foreclosure prevention program has spurred changes in the mortgage industry , prodding lenders to make more significant cuts to borrowers ' monthly payments than before the government effort started .

[ JURIST ]
A judge for the US District Court for the District of Arizona [ official website ] on Friday granted a preliminary injunction [ opinion text ] against an amendment to an Arizona law [ ARS § 38 -651 text ] regarding health benefits for the families of state employees .
The amendment , added as subsection O , would remove language from the law allowing interdependent domestic partners to receive health benefits by changing the definition of “ dependent ” to include only married couples and their children , effective October 1 , 2010 .
The state employees argue that the amendment violates their rights to equal protection and substantive due process and that the amendment has no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest .
In his order , Judge John Sedwick granted the preliminary injunction , finding that the plaintiffs met their burden of showing that their case would be likely to succeed on the merits and that they would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction .
He also found the state ’s arguments that the amendment served the state interest of cost savings and administrative efficiency to be “ speculative at best and discriminatory at worst . ”
Lambda Legal [ official website ] , the organization representing the state workers , praised the judge ’s decision [ press release ] :
This injunction removes the sword that ’s been hanging over the heads of hundreds of state workers and their families .
We ’re pleased Judge Sedwick has recognized that this is a matter of equal pay for equal work , and that eliminating benefits for Arizona ’s gay and lesbian state employees would hurt real families .
The order also denied the state ’s motion to dismiss the workers ’ equal protection claim and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer ’s claim of immunity .
The order granted the state ’s motion to dismiss the workers ’ substantive due process claim .
The injunction is set to go into effect within 10 days .
Arizona is also facing a federal lawsuit regarding its controversial new immigration law .
The US Department of Justice [ official website ] filed suit earlier this month [ JURIST report ] arguing that the law violates the Supremacy Clause [ text ] of the US Constitution .
The law criminalizes illegal immigration and allows police officers to question individuals based on “ reasonable suspicion ” that they are in the country illegally .
The law is already being contested in a class - action lawsuit [ JURIST report ] led by the American Civil Liberties Union [ advocacy website ] .
Brewer signed the legislation into law in April and the law is set to go into effect on July 29 .
At least 15 people have been killed at the Love Parade electronic music festival in the German city of Duisburg , police have said .
The deaths reportedly occurred after panic sparked a stampede in a tunnel .
The BBC's Tristana Moore described what is known about how the incident happened .

Just one month after three members of the New Black Panther Party were cleared of any wrongdoing in a 2008 voter intimidation case , the organization ’s chairman announced that the New Black Panthers are n’t done harassing people for no apparent reason .
In a videotaped interview with Mediaite ’s Tommy Christopher , NBPP Chairman Malik Zulu Shabazz said , “ [ Beck ] can bring his Tea Party , and we ’ll bring our party , and we ’ll see Glenn Beck . ”
Shabazz is referring to a rally that Beck will lead on August 28 at the Lincoln Memorial — the same day and place of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s famous “ I have a dream ” speech .
“ Glenn Beck should not be allowed to have this rally , ” Shabazz told Christopher .
“ Glenn Beck is a sneaky little devil , and he does sneaky things , and tries to portray that he ’s really not the neo-racist that he really is .
And for him to go and to secure the Lincoln Memorial on Dr. King ’s birthday will meet not only opposition from civil rights leaders , but it ’s going to meet direct opposition from the New Black Panther Party . ”
In other words : Standing on the shoulders of giants is a privilege , not a right ; the keepers of said privilege are separatist thugs , not visionaries .
Such intimations of violence are rather commonplace among members of the National Black Panther Party .
King Samir Shabazz , the chairman of the NBPP ’s Philadelphia chapter and the subject of the aforementioned DOJ investigation , told National Geographic that considering all that white people had done to blacks , “ there ’s no reason why I should still be walking around in 2008 talking about , ‘ Let us all fight the struggle together . ’ ”
While standing out on a street corner in downtown Philadelphia , a beret - wearing King Shabazz was once documented telling bystanders , “ I hate white people .
All of them .
Every last iota of a cracker , I hate ’em . ”
At an African heritage festival , King Shabazz took the opportunity to harass interracial couples .
“ We have too much business going on in the black community to be sliding through South Street with white , dirty cracker whore [ expletives ] on our arms , ” he said .
King Shabazz has also been documented saying , “ You want freedom ?
You ’re gonna have to kill some crackers .
You gonna have to kill some of their babies . ”
A bipartisan panel has called for the investigation into the New Black Panther Party , armed members of which stood outside a polling place in Philadelphia during the 2008 presidential election and harassed a cameraman , to be re-opened after a former DOJ prosecutor criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for abandoning the case .
For 400 years the sea has been kind to Boston .
Maritime trade fed the city ’s early economic rise , and countless cod laid down their lives to feed its inhabitants .
With the exception of boatloads of occupying redcoats , the Atlantic has n’t given the city much to complain about .
When the area has flooded — as it did this spring — it has n’t been because of the mighty Atlantic , but the placid Charles .
But when Boston ’s planning visionaries think about the future , increasingly , it ’s the sea they ’re worried about .
Huge swaths of the city are on landfill , just a few feet above sea level , and as ocean levels rise in the coming decades — as most earth scientists project they will —
Boston faces the prospect of an ocean that is higher and more dangerous than the one it has long known .
So - called 500 - year floods — freak meteorological events of extreme destructive power , now expected only twice a millennium — will become 100 - year floods , and 100 - year floods will become 20 - year floods .
The specter of rising seas has long been invoked by environmentalists as a kind of warning , to spur action on climate change .
But in recent years , a growing chorus of planners and scientists have begun talking about higher sea levels not as some cautionary scenario , but as a fact of life — one that everyone who lives near the ocean , whatever his views on the climate , needs to prepare for .
What does Boston need to do ?
Architects , city officials , insurers , and engineers have begun to lay the groundwork
for a new version of the city , one prepared to keep pace with rising tides .
In the past few years , the conversation has gained momentum , with meetings in City Hall , academic conferences on the topic , and a widely discussed article in the current issue of the journal ArchitectureBoston .
The ideas run the gamut from basic infrastructure fixes — raising the entrances to the city ’s subway and highway tunnels , or moving electrical equipment out of downtown basements and onto the roofs — to zoning changes that discourage construction in high - risk areas .
And a pair of architects is proposing a megalithic building project that would completely reshape Boston Harbor , using massive sea gates that could swing shut to seal the city off from the most devastating storm surges .
“ This is n’t just an environmental issue , ” says James W. Hunt III , the city ’s chief of environmental and energy services .
He ticks off the agencies currently involved in the effort : the Boston Redevelopment Authority , the Mayor ’s Office of Homeland Security , the office of Environmental and Energy Services , the transportation department , the public health commission .
After six days of talks and discussions and an estimated 10,000 slides shown at the International Conference on High Energy Physics , a few slides stand out as likely to stick around for a while .
The Higgs exclusion limits from CDF and DZero , the first top quark candidates from the Large Hadron Collider and the discrepancy in neutrino and antineutrino numbers will probably pop up again in many talks in coming years .
The next years will also be the time when committees and funding agencies have to make decisions on what comes after the LHC , and they ’ll be grateful to Jean - Pierre Delahaye for another slide that stands out .
It is probably the first slide ever that lists all possible future projects in high - energy physics around the world along with their states of readiness , assembled especially for the last - but - one talk at ICHEP .
Jean - Pierre ’s future is everything from pink to bright green – pink meaning a project in an R&D phase , blue a project on its way to conceptual design , yellow a project on its way to technical design , red under construction and green projects under operation .
The projects are also classified by kind , so accelerators with similar physics goals are grouped together , with proton accelerators , linear colliders or B factories all on top of each other for easier overview .
The first results from the LHC are only just rolling onto the presentation screens and people are already thinking about the next project .
They have to – a new project can take up to 40 years from first idea to project approval , as Delahaye shows in his talk .
Not too long ago this took not much more than five years .
With projects becoming ever bigger and more challenging , new technologies that promise to enhance the performance and reduce the price at the same time are worth some thorough investigation .
Maybe the next machine does not actually have to be bigger .
What if there are acceleration techniques that could get the length of a linear collider down from several tens of kilometers to just a few hundred meters ?
Or even a few centimeters ?
Take for example the accelerating gradient in a laser - driven dielectric linear accelerator , which is predicted to be around 1000 Megavolts per meter .
This is a completely different league from a project like the ILC , whose accelerating gradient is set at 31.5 Megavolts per meter .
But the International Linear Collider could in principle be built tomorrow , whereas R&D for dielectric acceleration will have to go on for many years before its developers can press the " Go " button .
So what are the accelerators of the future ?
How and when will we know which one will get built ?
It 's the job of a variety of different committees , task forces and strategy groups to analyze , discuss and make recommendations .
It 's the job of funding agencies and governments to take decisions based on these recommendations , or " road maps " .
With first LHC results rolling in and discoveries in the palpable future , road - map makers around the world are getting ready to write new editions of their maps .
In Europe , the CERN Council Strategy Group will start a new round of meetings that kicks off in March 2011 .
A year later , the highlight of the process will be an open community meeting where all particle physicists ( not only from Europe ) can voice their visions fir the future of the field .
The new edition of the roadmap is due in September 2012 .
Japan 's current master plan for large - scale projects ( with projects such as SuperKEKB , the JPARC upgrade , the ILC and a large neutrino detector tops on the list ) will also be updated by 2012 , and in the United States , the long - range planning exercise by the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel completed in 2008 will be updated depending on LHC results , probably also around 2012 .
They 'll be grateful that the legwork of collecting the schedules and statuses of all projects around the world was done by Jean - Pierre Delahaye for ICHEP ...

I ’m a bit too geeked up about this piece of news seeing as I ’ve been dying for a mobile version of IMDB since Android took off , but I can finally head to the market and download the app to one of the most valued sites for movie lovers .
Internet Movie Database is the one stop shop for everything you need to know about any movie that ’s ever come out … ever .
Well , almost ever , and they ’ve packed all of that information into a very clean , functional , and feature - packed app .
You get the cast list , user reviews , critic reviews , trailers , search features , MOVIEmeter , Top Lists , images , and everything you could possibly think of accessing on the full site ( note : the app is set to the US version of IMDB by default , but you can change this in the settings ) .
The only thing I can’t seem to find is forums access and a way to access my IMDB account .
For a 1.0 release , however , the app is very capable and worthy of a quick download .
Anyone else as embarrassingly excited as I am for this app ?

||| Stavanger kommune går nye veier for å finne ut hvilken effekt kjønn har for pasientenes pleietilbud .
En forsker skal over flere uker observere hvilken effekt mannlige omsorgsarbeidere har på pasienttilbudet ved en eller flere avdelinger i Stavanger .
Flere menn —
Det vil vi gjøre i et prosjekt der kvinnelige pleiere byttes ut med menn i en periode , også vil vi se om det fører til en endret hverdag for brukerne , sier rådgiver Oddbjørg Starrfelt i Stavanger kommune til NRK .
Prøveprosjektet er et ledd i et forsøk på å få flere menn inn i omsorgsyrker .
Kvinnefri høst -
Vi ønsker å se om tilbudet til pasientene er forskjellig avhengig av om det er mange kvinner eller mange menn som utfører arbeid .
Det vil vi gjøre i et prosjekt der kvinnelige pleiere byttes ut med menn i en periode , og så vil vi se om det fører til en endret hverdag for brukerne , sier Starrfelt .
Rogaland fylkeskommune og Helsedirektoratet støtter prosjektet økonomisk .
Dermed vil det fra høsten bare være menn på jobb i deler av kommunens omsorgstilbud .
Did You Know There Were So Many
Uses for Hydrogen Peroxide ?
I find it kind of funny really , that there are so many different ways to use hydrogen peroxide .
It 's a bit like the old Saturday Night Live skit about the ( made up ) product Shimmer : “ New Shimmer is a floor wax ” , “ No !
It ’s a dessert topping ” .
The joke , of course , is that a floor wax and a dessert topping seem impossible in one product .
( More about the classic SNL Shimmer skit .....)
Here are some of the many ways to use H2O2 :
As a mouthwash and gargle
In relaxing baths and foot baths
To sanitize toothbrushes , and dentures
As a produce wash , to keep fruits and veggies fresh longer
To disinfect and deodorize compost pails , cutting boards , sponges and scrub brushes
For washing carpets , floors , and windows
Stripping wood furniture , and cleaning wooden decks
Removing mold
To brighten laundry & remove stains
To clean out aquariums
To keep the water clean in fish farming
In gardening : As a plant fertilizer and plant spray
To clean swimming pools and spas , as an alternative to chlorine
Taxidermists use it to clean and whiten bones …..
It 's used in making cheese
Aseptic packaging ( those weird little boxes that food comes in ) are sprayed with it
It is used in products for whitening teeth , treating acne , and cleaning contact lenses
Oh , and it's also great for cleaning cuts and skin infections !
You know , like the brown bottles at the drug store ....
Now , this is kind of wonderful , really .
Right there , H2O2 is very practical to have around .
Do you find this all funny and intriguing like I do ?
Are you curious to learn more ?
But there ’s more to it -- hydrogen peroxide also has a wonderful quality of being good for the environment .
This benefit goes deep and wide .
It is good for rivers , it is good for plants , and it can be used to replace chlorine bleach , ammonia , and other chemicals which are harmful to rivers and plants .
Chlorine in pools is unpleasant and irritating to many people .
For some this is a minor nuisance , for others it is a real hazard .
Hydrogen peroxide can be used instead , and is non -toxic .
Likewise household cleaning products containing chlorine can be upsetting to household cats and dogs – it smells like urine to them , as well as being unhealthy when they lick it off of their skin and fur .
It all starts to blend together : H2O2 is good for people , animals , plants , rivers … … and it breaks down into water and oxygen - what could be more non -toxic ?
Going one step farther , H2O2 is part of the earth ’s cleaning cycle .
It is formed as water ( H2O ) passes through the ozone layer ( O3 ) where it picks up another oxygen atom ( O ) , becoming H202 ( hydrogen peroxide ) .
So , a bit of it comes down to us in rain .
When you water your plants with the garden hose , there ’s no hydrogen peroxide in that water .
Adding a little hydrogen peroxide to plant water is great for the garden ( indoor plants too ) .
The runoff wo n’t harm streams and fish the way that many garden fertilizers do .
I 'll have more to say about all that .
H2O2 is also produced by the human immune system to help fight off infections .
White blood cells make it ……
Is this story getting interesting yet ?
And is it starting to sound a bit repetitive , too - like one big story applied to many different things , in a big circle from people to plants to water to fish to sky ?
A story of disinfection and non-toxic cleaning and nature – spinning round and round with different words , depending on what topic we are addressing ……
What brings you here today ?
You may be here because you already know lots about the usefulness of hydrogen peroxide , and you 're " a fan " !
Welcome !
I hope you can find some new uses , some new info , and some food for thought here .
OR : this topic may be completely new to you .
Maybe you are looking for info on one particular use -- let 's say stain removal -- but you had no idea that hydrogen peroxide has a wide array of uses .
Well , maybe you 'll become a fan of peroxide , or maybe not .
Either way , I hope you find the info you came looking for .... and maybe also learn that peroxide is fascinating enough that some people really dig into it as an interest .
( Who knew ? )
Using Hydrogen Peroxide
This site is called " Using Hydrogen Peroxide " because I think that USING peroxide is what is most , well , useful !
It 's where it matters -- in practice rather than in theory .
It 's being able to use peroxide where the benefits are .
The practical applications are were we can really dig in and try things , and apply the ideas in real life .
And we can all try using H2O2 , within some safety limits !
Would you like to try using hydrogen peroxide ?
What new applications can you find to try out ?
AND : If you have already used peroxide for years , I hope you 'll also consider sharing some of your experience with others here .
Stories and lots to know
There are lots of interesting stories about peroxide .
Okay , what about the “ bird man of Alcatraz ” , who , it is said , used it to heal birds ?
Is it true that some famous healing springs have higher - than - usual levels of peroxide in their waters ?
Some people say it has other health benefits for people , and even for farm animals ... is that true ?
What does the FDA say about it ?
And does Health Canada agree ?
Did you know that it was used in World War II to fuel catapults and rockets ?
I ’ll try to get to the bottom of those stories , too .
Finally , there is lots of ground to cover about handling , storage , concentrations , " grades " , and mixing .
Would you like to know :
The advantages of buying 35 % H2O2 , and the dangers
What are the shipping restrictions on 35 % , and why
The difference between food grade , technical grade , and the stuff in the brown bottles at the drug store
How to mix 35 % peroxide down to 3 % , or 6 % ...
How to mix 35 % peroxide into gel to get a gel containing 3 % ( great for cuts and skin infections )
How much to use in watering plants , cleaning carpets , or treating your swimming pool
The point is .....
..... finding ways to USE peroxide that provide benefits for ourselves , our homes , our families and others ... and benefits for animals and our world .
Whatever we use hydrogen peroxide for , let ’s keep it fun , creative and joyful – in that spirit of non -toxic growthful life and health for water , animals , plants , and housecleaning …..
Note : Hydrogen peroxide is also called H202 -- that 's its chemical name -- both terms can be used interchangeably .
I apologize if the topic you are looking for is not here yet .

It seemed we had some nice eye - contact , but on top of being dizzy I 'm a bit shy , so I left without saying a word .
Argh !
You might be my type !
Engadget and others are reporting that Apple will be holding a press conference this Friday .
Apple on Wednesday invited select press to a special press conference to be held this Friday in California .
Apple would only say that the press conference would be regarding the iPhone 4 .
No other information was available when I spoke with them tonight .
The topic of discussion , of course , is the iPhone 4 which has received much press over the past few weeks regarding a signal loss issue when it is held in certain ways .
A Consumer Reports article reignited discussion of this issue earlier this week .
This is a tremendously intriguing final for a variety of reasons .
Firstly , because it is between the two non-World Cup - winning sides with the best historical record in the competition , using this table as the basis for that statement .
One of them will finally break their duck .
Furthermore , this is clash between two sides historically appreciated for their style of football .
Before the tournament started , if we had asked a large sample of fans what their ideal final would be to guarantee an exciting game , Holland v Spain would surely have been the most popular answer , considering Brazil ’s apparent negativity and the highly - structured Argentina side Diego Maradona looked set to field .
But then , by their standards , neither Holland nor Spain have played particularly attractive football so far .
Dutch pragmatism
Holland have reached their first World Cup final since the the 1970s , when they won the hearts of many football fans across the globe for their exciting , revolutionary ‘ Total Football ’ system .
There has been much discussion about the nature of Bert van Marwijk ’s current Dutch side – it certainly is n’t Total Football , but is it even typically Dutch ?
Raphael Honigstein wrote an interesting piece before their semi-final with Uruguay on this subject , concluding , “ It ’s high time the old stereotypes were ditched , regardless of the result .
Dutch football itself already did it a while back .
Maybe the rest of the world should follow suit . ”
Even accepting Honigstein ’s theory that Holland are “ no more defensive than 30 years ago ” , it is interesting that , for a country so rooted in the concept of individualism , they have reached the final with few top - class performances from their star players .
Wesley Sneijder is the one man who is being talked about in ‘ Team of the Tournament ’ terms , but his goal tally , his main achievement in the tournament , has been inflated by three rather fortunate goals .
He and Robben have provided a couple of good moments , but nothing like the dominant performances they showed when guiding their sides to domestic doubles and the Champions League final last season .
Holland have been successful in 2010 because they ’ve worked well as a unit .
Spain ‘ using the Barcelona formula ’
With this debate about the nature of the Holland team , it ’s perfect that they come up against a Spain side who arguably display more of a classically ‘ Dutch ’ attitude towards football .
Jonathan Wilson has this week commented that Spain are ‘ essentially using the Barcelona formula ’ in terms of tactics , and there is a clear crossover with Barcelona in terms of personnel too .
When David Villa scored the winner against Paraguay last week , there were 7 Barcelona - owned players on the pitch at the time : Carles Puyol , Gerard Pique , Sergio Busquets , Xavi Hernandez , Andres Iniesta , Pedro Rodriguez and Villa .
Another , Cesc Fabregas , has been strongly linked with a move back to the Nou Camp this summer .
But the more fascinating aspect is that seven of those eight ( this time including Fabregas but excluding Villa ) are players who were brought up as Barcelona players – all of them spent considerable time at La Masia , and the majority made their professional debut for the club .
The Dutch influence on Barcelona cannot be overstated – in its entire history , only four managers have been in charge of the club for more than 150 matches , and all four have been from Holland – Rinus Michels ( 1971 - 75 and 1976 - 78 ) , Johan Cruyff ( 1988 - 96 ) , Louis van Gaal ( 1997 -2000 ) and Frank Rijkaard ( 2003-08 ) .
Nine of their 20 La Liga titles have been won under Dutch management .
Michels is possibly the most important factor to consider here .
‘ He was the father of Total Football , and he carried it on at Barcelona ’ , as Wilson says in Inverting the Pyramid .
From him , there is a clear Dutch link to the present day .
Cruyff was a Barcelona player under Michels , then when he became manager , brought Rijkaard to the club .
The present manager , Pep Guardiola , played under Cruyff , van Gaal , and then managed the Barcelona B team during Rijkaard ’s final season , and Guardiola ’s influence on Spain ’s squad both as a player ( Xavi , Iniesta ) and as a manager ( Pedro , Busquets ) has been well - documented .
Dutch influence
It is not just a coincidental chain , either .
Cruyff described Michels as his “ first and only football master ” .
Guardiola pinpoints Cruyff as the key factor in his successful career , saying , “ Cruyff believed I could do it , and gave me the opportunity .
I think there are lots of people with talent who simetimes miss out simply because they are not given the chance .
I owe it to Cruyff ’ .
When Cruyff managed Barcelona , he “ turned the Catalan giants into Europe ’s leading club , and , arguably , the Continent ’s standard - bearer for beautiful , attacking football ” as David Winner puts it , a position they have regained under Guardiola .
In Winner ’s book about Dutch football , ‘ Brilliant Orange ’ , his description of the main factors of Total Football ( aside from the well - documented switching of positions ) is telling , when considering the Dutch influence upon Barcelona .
‘ Space is the unique defining element of Dutch football … Total Football was built on a new theory of flexible space … Michels and Cruyff exploited the capacities of a new breed of players to change the dimensions of the football field … they tried to make the pitch as large as possible , spreading play to the wings … when they lost the ball , they pressed deep into the other side ’s half , hunting for the ball , defended a line ten yards inside their own half , and used the offside trap aggressively to squeeze further space . ”
This could be a description of Barcelona – flexibility , making the pitch as wide as possible , heavy pressing , a high line and an aggressive offside trap .
This is not a history lesson on Barcelona , but a recognition that Puyol , Pique , Busquets , Xavi , Iniesta and Pedro ( 60 % of Spain ’s likely outfield XI for the final ) all grew up in surroundings inherently shaped by Dutch figures and Dutch theories , dating back to Total Football .
But then , there is a further twist , because the current Spain side are playing football which has disappointed some in terms of excitement and attacking flair .
Few expected a Holland v Spain World Cup final where the major discussion about both sides was ‘ Are they boring ? ’ , a debate touched upon by Giancarlo Rinaldi , looking at Vicente del Bosque ’s players .
Spain certainly have n’t created as many goalscoring opportunities as expected , but even though their three knockout games have finished 1 - 0 , against Portugal , Paraguay and then Germany , all have been good games , despite ( or maybe because of ) the lack of goals .
“ We probably do n’t appreciate just how hard it is to open teams that , scared of Spain ’s talent , sit deep , close off space and give their opponents no time to breathe ” , says says Sid Lowe , in a piece with some fascinating quotes from Xavi .
But they have largely stuck to the Dutch / Barcelona formula in terms of ball retention , heavy pressing and a high defensive line .
The one exception has been Spain ’s clear lack of width .
The final is a simple clash between two great football nations and two historical underachievers , but is also perfect in terms of footballing ideology .
The history of Dutch football is a history of underachievement and disappointment .
Failure once again on Sunday night would be a failure extraordinary even for the Dutch , because they would be beaten to their first World Cup by a side who have borrowed so much from their way of playing football .

Following threats in recent months that it would begin targeting those who obtain or deliver their content without permission , the Ultimate Fighting Championship has announced they are targeting two popular streaming hangouts .
UFC have subpoenaed Justin.tv and Ustream.tv to force them to reveal the identity of a single user who uploaded two UFC events earlier this year .
Since the start of this year , the Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) have been warning that they are prepared for a very tough fight indeed – and one in which they hope to knockout Internet piracy of their PPV events .
After shutting down Rage - Streams.net earlier this year , the UFC implied they would start going after those that consume streams too , an unlikely scenario and one that has failed to bear fruit thus far .
But there are still plenty of providers – uploaders – and on them , UFC President Dana
White made his position clear .
“ We are committed to standing toe - to - toe with anyone trying to illegally broadcast or stream UFC events , ” said the UFC mouthpiece earlier this month when noting that the company had reached 500 settlements with infringers in 2 years .
Earlier , UFC general legal counsel Lawrence Epstein warned that the mixed - martial arts outfit might even subpoena sites in order to gain the IP - addresses of people who were illegally uploading UFC events .
The company has now made good on its threats .
UFC parent company Zuffa , which claims to be the largest provider of Pay - Per - View content in the world , just announced that it has subpoenaed two hugely popular streaming video sites , Justin.tv and Ustream.tv .
With this legal action they hope to force the companies to reveal the identity of a user who uploaded two UFC events earlier this year .
The UFC say that on January 2 , 2010 , more than 36,000 people watched an illegal streaming video feed of UFC 108 which was being uploaded from a single IP address .
On February 21 , 2010 , the very same IP address uploaded UFC 110 which was viewed by a claimed 78,000 individuals .
“ I ca n’t wait to go after the thieves that are stealing our content , ” said White .
“ This is a fight we will not lose . ”
Zuffa say that once Justin.tv and Ustream.tv hand over the identity of the uploader , they will take civil copyright action against them .
MMA fans gave the news a mixed reception , with some noting that being a fan is n’t a right and ‘ stealing ’ events is simply wrong .
Others felt that accepting a level of piracy is a good way to get more exposure .
“ The UFC has had 15 pay - per - view event in the past year .
Zuffa LLC is making a killing on PPVs and frustrating fans who simply cannot afford them .
Hence , the piracy problem , ” wrote a contributor to MMA blog , MMAJunkie .
“ MMA is approaching a saturation point and wo n’t be able reach the next plateau of popularity until live UFC shows are easily accessible to the average viewer .
You ca n’t fight the Internet – even if you are in the right .
The UFC needs to adapt and evolve in the way it delivers content to the consumer and take a short - term loss for a long - term gain . ”
In 2009 , the UFC banked $ 350 million in PPV revenue .
There 's been some chatter that perhaps President Obama might not nominate Elizabeth Warren to head the Consumer Financial Protection Agency ( her brainchild , basically ) , especially since Tim Geithner was said to oppose the nomination .
Well now Tim Geithner seems to support her .
But beyond that , it 's obvious that the liberal base adores , and thinks that her nomination is a very , very important political step .
At yesterday 's big " Netroots Nation " convention -- a big political pow - wow for online progressives -- there was a lot of talk about warren , per various Tweets we saw and this report from CNN .
If Obama picks someone else , he 'll anger a core base , without getting any upside .
She 's getting the job .
Now let 's just hope she does n't destroy the banking system ...
The California bill banning neck holds does not apply to the sort of suffocation that killed Floyd in May in Minneapolis and led to months of protests .
Floyd died when a police officer put his knee on Floyd ’s neck while he was on the ground .
President Obama ’s hopes of closing Guantánamo , which were already gravely wounded by his inability to meet his self - imposed deadline of a year for the prison ’s closure , now appear to have been killed off by lawmakers in Congress .
Although the House Armed Services Committee was happy to authorize , by 59 votes to 0 , a budget of over $ 700 billion for war ( $ 567 billion for “ defense spending ” and $ 159 billion for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ) for the fiscal year beginning in October , lawmakers unanimously saw through – and turned down – a fraction of this budget for what the administration had labeled a “ transfer fund ” – money intended to close Guantánamo and buy a new prison in Illinois for prisoners designated for trials or for indefinite detention without charge or trial .
The administration had attempted to hide its intentions behind this vague wording , because senior officials were acutely aware of ferocious opposition in Congress to the closure of Guantánamo .
Fueled by opportunistic Republicans and backed by cowardly Democrats , Congress had only been prevented at the last minute from passing an insane law last year , which would have prevented the administration from bringing any prisoner to the U.S. mainland for any reason ( even to face a trial ) and had only relented in October , allowing prisoners to be brought to the U.S. mainland for trials , but not for any other purpose .
Despite this , the House Armed Services Committee is now trying to withdraw from even this concession to the administration ’s aims , including , in a summary of the bill , a prohibition on using even the tiniest fraction of the war budget ( around $ 350 million ) to buy a new detention facility .
As Spencer Ackerman explained in the Washington Independent :
“ According to the bill summary , the bill now requires Defense Secretary Robert Gates to give Congress a report that ‘ adequately justifies any proposal to build or modify such a facility ’ if it wants to move forward with any post - Guantánamo detention plan .
‘ The Committee firmly believes that the construction or modification of any facility in the U.S. to detain or imprison individuals currently being held at Guantánamo must be accompanied by a thorough and comprehensive plan that outlines the merits , costs , and risks associated with utilizing such a facility , ’ the summary text read .
‘ No such plan has been presented to date .
The bill prohibits the use of any funds for this purpose . ’ ”
This is a depressing example of how even a morally and ethically flawed attempt to close Guantánamo is unacceptable to both Republican and Democratic lawmakers , who have retreated to a position that the Bush administration , at its most extreme , would have been proud of .
For those of us who do n’t mind prisoners being brought to the U.S. mainland to face trials ( 35 in total , according to Obama ’s Guantánamo Task Force ) , but who are implacably opposed to the administration ’s contention that it can hold some prisoners indefinitely ( 48 of the remaining 181 prisoners ) , it is by no means a tragedy that the plan to replicate some of Guantánamo ’s most unpalatable innovations on American soil has been prevented .
In my more optimistic moments , it strikes me that , with the option of transferring prisoners to the U.S. mainland denied , the administration will – if it remains committed to the closure of Guantánamo – have to rethink its plans , and that one way of doing this would be to give up on its intention to hold 48 men indefinitely , which , to put it bluntly , is unconstitutional .
In truth , the claim that 48 men should be held indefinitely has always been something of a deception , because these men have outstanding habeas corpus petitions in the district court in Washington , D.C. , where judges , rather than an unaccountable task force , are making their own decisions about whether they are , as President Obama explained in a major national security speech last May , a special category of prisoner who “ cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people . ”
So far , the judges have ruled that just 14 men can continue to be held indefinitely , although it ’s noticeable that , in denying their habeas petitions , they have generally not concluded that they “ pose a clear danger to the American people , ” but have , instead , found that they were minor players in the Taliban , or in al - Qaeda forces supporting the Taliban .
However , according to the detention policies they are required to follow , the judges are not allowed to distinguish between the terrorists of al - Qaeda and the foot soldiers of the Taliban when it comes to consigning men , on an apparently sound legal basis , to endless incarceration .
This problem relates to the Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed by Congress the week after the 9/11 attacks , which authorizes the president “ to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations , or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 ” ( or those who harbored them ) .
Combined with a Supreme Court ruling ( in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , in 2004 ) that “ Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention ” of individuals covered by the AUMF , this is the rationale used by the administration to justify the prisoners ’ detention , and , although different judges have expressed different opinions about who these individuals are , they have broadly agreed that , to qualify as an “ enemy combatant ” – or , in Obama ’s new world , an “ alien unprivileged enemy belligerent ” – the government is required to prove , by a preponderance of the evidence , that these individuals supported al - Qaeda and / or the Taliban .
This lack of distinction between al - Qaeda and the Taliban is clearly ridiculous , as was noted last year by two judges , Judge James Robertson and Judge Thomas Hogan , who made a point of stating , when refusing to grant the habeas petitions of two Yemenis , Adham Mohammed Ali Awad and Musa ’ab al - Madhwani , that they did not regard either man as an ongoing threat .
Regarding Ali Awad , Judge Robertson noted , “ It seems ludicrous to believe that he poses a security threat now , ” and in al - Madhwani ’s case , Judge Hogan stated that he “ did not think Madhwani was dangerous , ” noted that he has been a “ model prisoner ” since his arrival at Guantánamo in October 2002 , and added , “ There is nothing in the record now that he poses any greater threat than those detainees who have already been released . ”
Moreover , this inability to make a distinction between al - Qaeda and the Taliban – or al - Qaeda forces supporting the Taliban in military operations in Afghanistan , rather than in activities related to terrorism – is one that I have been railing against for some time now , for the simple reason that the former should be put forward for trials , whereas the latter – if they should continue to be held at all – should be held as prisoners of war according to the Geneva Conventions .
I do n’t see this happening anytime soon , of course , because no one even wants to talk about it , but when the House Armed Services Committee moves so decisively to prevent the closure of Guantánamo – and every sign is that the House will approve their amendment this week , and the Senate Armed Services Committee will follow suit at the end of the month – the closure of Guantánamo now requires a new kind of thinking .
To my mind , this should involve , first of all , more respect for the district court ’s habeas rulings than has been shown to date .
Over the last 20 months , judges have granted the habeas petitions of 35 prisoners , and along the way have done more to demolish claims that Guantánamo holds “ the worst of the worst ” than any other forum , exposing how much of the government ’s supposed evidence consists of unreliable statements made by the prisoners themselves or by their fellow prisoners , and also exposing how torture , coercion , and the bribery of prisoners with better living conditions have played a major role in making these statements unreliable .
Despite this , the administration has failed to take advantage of these rulings in its dealings with Congress , and has preferred to either appeal them , or to release those who have won their petitions with extreme reluctance .
In addition , rethinking the closure of Guantánamo should involve highlighting the fact that 96 of the 181 men still held have been cleared for release , reviving plans for returning dozens of cleared men to Yemen ( which were shelved in the most cowardly manner after it was revealed that the would - be Christmas Day plane bomber , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , had trained in Yemen ) , and – although I expect hell to freeze over before this comes to pass – renewing calls for cleared prisoners who cannot be repatriated because they face the risk of torture to be allowed to settle in the U.S. , as was planned last year by White House Counsel Greg Craig , supported by Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton , until Obama got cold feet .
This could best be achieved by allowing U.S. citizens access to the stories of cleared prisoners released in other countries who are living peaceful lives , and , if it ’s of any use , I ’m happy to help on this front , as I ’ve spent much of the last three months traveling around the UK with a former prisoner , Omar Deghayes , showing Outside the Law : Stories from Guantánamo ( a film I co-directed , in which Omar plays a major part ) , and can guarantee that giving people the opportunity to meet Omar ( after they have seen his pained and eloquent testimony about his ordeal ) is a perfect way to demonstrate that colossal mistakes were made – and continue to be made – at Guantánamo , that many innocent men were seized , and that many of these innocent men are still held .
And finally , to return to the confusion between al - Qaeda and the Taliban that is at the heart of Guantánamo ’s detention problem , rethinking the closure of Guantánamo should involve a recognition that the failure to distinguish between al - Qaeda terrorists and Taliban foot soldiers is unfairly consigning men to indefinite detention as terrorists when they should be held as prisoners of war .
In addition , it should also provide an opportunity to reflect on the more fundamental question of whether , over eight years after most of the men who are still held at Guantánamo were first seized , the Authorization for Use of Military Force is a valid reason for detention at all , when the Geneva Conventions and the criminal justice system should suffice .
Tallinder seen as a capable mentor .
Hedberg ready to step in .
The defending Atlantic Division champions bolstered their blueline by signing offensive defenseman Henrik Tallinder from Buffalo and bruising shot blocker Anton Volchenkov from Ottawa .
They shored up their goaltending with the addition of Johan Hedberg , who ’s expected to share some of Martin Brodeur ’s workload in 2010 - 11 .
Though free agent blueliner Paul Martin departed for Pittsburgh , there was no putting a damper on what was clearly a very successful day for Devils ’ President / CEO / GM Lou Lamoriello .
“ The two [ defensemen ] that we got certainly bring two different types of dimension to our team , ” Lamoriello said in a conference call .
“ Volchenkov , we certainly have played against enough , and he ’s going to do something in our zone that we have not had recently , in fact since Scott Stevens left .
He ’s going to make it very difficult to play in that zone and he will complement the [ Colin ]
Whites and the [ Bryce ] Salvadors .
” Volchenkov , 28 , does n’t shy away from the big hit .
He collected four goals and 10 assists in 64 games last season with Ottawa while averaging 20:41 of ice time .
A Russian Olympian in 2006 and 2010 , the Moscow native recorded a career - best plus - 37 rating in 2006 - 07 .
Volchenkov and the Senators went on to reach the Stanley Cup Final that year , losing to Anaheim in five games .
Tallinder , 31 , tallied four goals and 16 assists with a plus - 13 rating for the Sabres in 82 games last season , averaging 20:36 of ice time .
A member of the 2010 Swedish Olympic team , Tallinder had a key role in mentoring 2010 Calder Trophy winner Tyler Myers in Buffalo .
He ’ll be counted on for a similar positive influence on the Devils ’ crop of highly - regarded Swedish prospects .
“ Tallinder , we ’ve always liked him , ” Lamoriello said .
“ We played against him enough in Buffalo .
In particular , for me , he came to the forefront on the job he did playing alongside Myers and how he helped him along .
There was another factor in that : we have three young Swedish players , one defenseman in [ Alexander ]
Urbom and two young forwards in [ Mattias ] Tedenby and [ Jacob ]
Josefson , who will be given every opportunity to make this team .
We thought he would be just perfect in helping them develop and come along .
” Hedberg , 37 , brings nine seasons of NHL experience .
Last year , he posted a 21 - 16 - 10 mark with a 2.62 goals - against average , .915 save percentage and three shutouts in 47 games with Atlanta .
He ’s made 30 or more appearances in three straight campaigns , and figures to add a reliable No. 2 to New Jersey 's goaltending stable .
That , Lamoriello , hopes , will give Brodeur more of an opportunity to rest .
Though Brodeur led the League in wins ( 45 ) and shutouts ( 9 ) , the 38 - year - old future Hall of Famer also topped all goalies in games played ( 77 ) .
“ He ’d love to play every day , ” said the Devils ’ GM .
“ We ’d love to get him to slow down a little and take a practice off here and there , he wo n’t even do that .
I think it ’s necessary , but I do n’t think it ’s a disrespect to him .
It ’s just to keep him fresher .
Hedberg understands his role , and he ’s looking forward to it .
He ’s extremely excited , in fact , all three players , I was really pleased with the conversations I had with them today .
” Though July 1 opened the bidding on the League ’s free agents , there ’s still a long way to go before the puck drops in October .
Time will tell whether the Devils will have more moves to make .
“ We are where we ’re at , ” Lamoriello said .
“ I ca n’t say whether something will happen or wo n’t happen because you never know .
But we still feel there ’s some things that we ’d like to do to get better whether it ’s today , next week .
We made a decision coming into this period that we were going to , first of all , set some priorities , and that is , get our defense better .
I believe this defense is better than it was last year , right now , and we were trying to get an experienced backup goaltender to relieve some of the pressures of Marty .
I ’d like to think we did that . ”
The creator of a now - defunct " Everybody Draw Muhammad Day " page on Facebook fears she may be targeted for death now that the cartoonist who launched the online campaign has been placed on an execution list by a radical Yemeni- American cleric .
The 27 - year - old Facebook page creator -- a Canadian woman who asked not to be identified due to fears of reprisal -- told FoxNews.com that she was visited at her home last week by Royal Canadian Mounted Police officials who advised her to remove her page and not to talk to reporters .
" I 'm scared , " she said .
" I 'm scared that somebody might kill me . "
The woman created her version of " Everybody Draw Muhammad " in late April , days after a Seattle cartoonist launched the online campaign to protest Comedy Central 's censoring of an episode of " South Park , " in which the Prophet Muhammad was depicted wearing a bear costume .
The Canadian woman said she will no longer act as the administrator of such a page .
" I just want to be quiet now , " she continued .
" I wish I did n't do this . "
As part of " Inspire , " a 67 - page English - language Al Qaeda magazine , Yemeni- American cleric Anwar al - Awlaki -- who has been linked to the botched Times Square bombing and cited as inspiration for the Fort Hood massacre and the plot of two New Jersey men to kill U.S. soldiers -- targeted the Seattle cartoonist for " assassination , " along with others who have participated in her campaign .
" The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection , " wrote al - Awlaki , who is an American citizen .
" But even then our campaign should not be limited to only those who are active participants . "
He warned that " assassinations , bombings and acts of arson " are all legitimate forms of revenge against the creators of blasphemous depictions of Muhammad .
" Now , with the defamation of Muhammad reaching the shores of America , I wonder whether the patriotic American Muslim will still have the audacity to claim that he enjoys the right to be a Muslim in America ? "
Al - Awlaki wrote .
" Does he understand that this right includes his duty to fight against those who blaspheme his Prophet ? "
Al - Awlaki invited Muslims worldwide to " stand up in defense " of Muhammad and for their efforts to " manifest in all appropriate " means .
The Canadian woman told FoxNews.com that she created her page as a way for Facebook users to discuss Islam " openly and honestly " -- and that she has lost most of her anger following her initial outrage .
" I was upset at first , but I 'm not too upset anymore , " she said .
" I kind of got tired of it . "
She said she now realizes her online actions may have put her in jeopardy .
Following the recommendation of Canadian authorities , she said she has altered her routines and will consider changing her phone number .
" I have no way of knowing what might happen to me , " she said .
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Pat Flood , citing department policy , would not confirm or deny that police officials visited the woman 's home .
David Gomez , the FBI 's assistant special agent in charge of counterterrorism in Seattle , said authorities consider the threat " very seriously " and confirmed that they contacted the Seattle cartoonist two weeks ago .
" We take the written threat very seriously and we advised her to take appropriate actions , " Gomez said Monday .
" We wanted her to lower her profile , basically . "
Gomez said FBI officials felt " obligated to warn " the Seattle woman based on previous attempts by Al Qaeda to target individuals for caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad .
" Al Qaeda is a very real organization , they have made attempts on other journalists involved in this type of activity , " Gomez said .
" Based on that , we felt obligated to warn her . "
Contacted via e-mail , the Seattle woman declined comment .
WASHINGTON -- China 's focus on science and technology is relentless , and it 's occurring at all levels of its society .
Its labor pool is becoming increasingly sophisticated , its leadership is focused on innovation , and the country is adopting policies designed to pressure U.S. firms to transfer their technology .
The trend is causing increasing worry in Washington , but there are five reasons why China may yet succeed in its goal to achieve world dominance in technology .
1. China 's leadership understands engineering
In China , eight of the nine members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau , including the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , have engineering degrees ; one has a degree in geology .
Of the 15 U.S. cabinet members , six have law degrees .
Only one cabinet member has a hard - science degree -- Secretary of Energy Steven Chu , who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1997 , has a doctorate in physics .
President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have law degrees .
2. China 's leadership wants to out - innovate the U.S .
China 's political leadership has made technological innovation a leading goal in everything from supercomputers to nanotech .
One highlight of this is China 's investment in clean energy technologies .
In March , the Pew Charitable Trusts reported that China led the U.S. in clean energy investments .
Last year , the country invested $ 34.6 billion in clean energy , nearly double the U.S. total of $ 16.8 billion , Pew said .
" It 's very sad that Americans spend more on potato chips than we do on investment in clean energy R&D , " said John Doerr , a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byer , at a forum in June with Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates .
He warned of a threat to U.S. future if the country does n't increase its contribution to clean energy research .
3. China 's science and technical talent pool is vast
The technical labor pool in China is so large that Shanghai - based offshore outsourcing company Bleum Inc. can use an IQ test to screen applicants , with a cutoff score for new computer science graduates in China of 140 .
Less than 1 % of the population has a score that high .
Bleum has started hiring a U.S. workforce but sets an IQ score of 125 as a screening threshold because of the smaller labor pool .
The company employs 1,000 people in China .
One data point to note :
In 2005 , the U.S. awarded 137,500 engineering degrees , while China awarded 351,500 , according to a workforce study last year .
4 . The U.S. is failing at science and math education
A stark assessment of the U.S. failure in science and math education was made by U.S. Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchinson ( R - Texas ) at a Senate hearing in May , when she compared the performance of students in Texas to those in China .
" In my home state of Texas , only 41 % of the high school graduates are ready for college - level math ( algebra ) , and only 24 % are ready for college - level science ( biology ) , " said Hutchinson .
Janelle La Chaux paid a visit to Oakland police headquarters Friday to fill out a crime report .
She believed her former roommate on 31st Street had stolen her 22 - inch flat - screen and she wanted to document the theft .
" I could have called them when I was at the place where it happened , but I just decided to come down here because I do n't want to wait , " La Chaux , 30 , said as she filled out a form in the lobby .
" Sometimes I call them and it just takes a long , long time to come . "
Nowadays , police may not come at all .
On Tuesday , the city laid off 80 officers to help eliminate a $ 30.5 million budget deficit , prompting the department to announce that officers would no longer be dispatched to take reports for most nonviolent crimes .
" With current levels of staffing , we are unable to respond to many lower - priority calls , " said Officer Jeff Thomason , a police spokesman .
Instead , Oakland residents now have to file certain crime reports online or visit a police station .
Those without a computer can ask that a blank form be mailed to them or pick one up at a library .
Residents can still call 911 to report emergencies and crimes such as shootings , robberies , rapes and assaults .
' Never going to hang up '
No matter how crimes are reported , police said the department still wants to hear about them - even if the layoffs mean that no one will investigate if a suspect can't be identified or is long gone .
" You can still call the Oakland Police Department and say , ' I need a report . '
We 'll always direct you to the right place , " Thomason said .
" We 're never going to hang up on someone and say , ' We do n't do that anymore . ' "
Crime analysts will use the reports to discern patterns , said Lt. Jim Meeks , who oversees investigations of property crimes and theft .
" It 's designed to still provide us with intelligence , " Meeks said .
" It still counts .
The only way we 're going to know that something is going on is through the reporting . "
Over the past two years , residents have been able to go to oaklandpolice.com and report lost property , theft , vandalism , vehicle burglary and vehicle tampering .
In the past , however , people could ask for an officer to come take a report .
That will no longer be the case .
By Aug. 2 , Oakland police intend to expand the online system - called Coplogic - so residents can report seven other types of crimes , including residential burglaries in which the suspects are n't known .
" There will be no follow - up investigation and the primary purpose for filing the report is for insurance purposes , " according to the department .
Nearly two dozen other Bay Area agencies use Coplogic to some degree .
The San Ramon company that created it bills itself as " the innovator in online citizen reporting . "
Complaints after theft
But Oakland resident Howard Matis , 61 , is n't optimistic .
Even his phone calls to Oakland police about his stolen laptop went unanswered last month , he said Friday .
After someone broke into his home in the hills on June 21 - one of a spate of similar break - ins in the area - he used tracking technology to identify a young man pecking away on Matis ' computer .
Although officers had responded to his home the day of the burglary , the department ignored his calls the next day , even when he supplied the name of the suspect .
" I kept calling and calling , and no one would get back to me , " Matis said .
' No one cared ' before layoffs
Instead , San Leandro police returned Matis ' laptop after investigating a home invasion in that city , he said .
Matis criticized the online reporting system , saying , " It 's ridiculous , because they stole my computer , so how could I report it ?
On the other hand , if you report it , they do n't do anything .
" Oakland police could have broken up this burglary ring in the hills if they reacted to my evidence immediately , " Matis said .
" No one cared - and that was before the layoffs . "
InSource Energy is building a £ 5 m anaerobic digestion plant at the site of RF Brookes ’ ready meals factory in Rogerstone , Newport , which is owned by Premier Foods , the UK ’s largest food producer .
EnviTec Biogas is supplying anaerobic digestion technology for the plant that will convert RF Brookes ’ food waste into biogas , which will then be used to generate renewable energy in the form of electricity and heat .
The plant has capacity to process around 10,000 tonnes of food waste per year , which is expected to generate 300 kW of power .
The energy will be used to help power the factory – the leading supplier of ready meals to Marks & Spencer – providing savings in waste disposal and energy bills and reducing carbon emissions by around 8,500 tonnes per year .
WRAP Cymru provided a grant of £ 0.5 m to part - fund the project under a programme supported by the Welsh Assembly Government to promote anaerobic digestion in Wales .
Construction will be completed by the end of this year and the plant will be fully operational in early 2011 .
Phil Coles , RF Brookes ’ managing director , said : ’ We ’ve set a challenging target of sending zero waste to landfill by 2015 and also to maximise opportunities for obtaining energy from renewable sources .
We are pleased that this initiative will help us on our road to achieving both of these objectives and are delighted to be the first company in Wales to adopt this technology in this way . ’

In our New Agtivist interview series , we talk to people who are working to change this country ’s f’ed - up food system in inspiring ways .
( Shannon Barry photo ) When the going gets tough , the tough get cooking .
That ’s the main lesson I ’ve gleaned from my friend Vimala Rajendran , a legendary underground cook in Chapel Hill , N.C. , who has recently gone legit by opening Vimala ’s Curryblossom Café .
Doing justice to her life story would require the skills of a Salman Rushdie or a Mira Nair : childhood in middle - class suburban Bombay , peeling cardamom at her mother ’s knee ; youthful marriage to an academic scientist and passage to the United States ; a stint as a young housewife and mother , expanding her culinary horizons in cosmopolitan Ann Arbor ; survivor of a violent , collapsed marriage in Chapel Hill ; sudden status as a penniless single mother of three without job or immigration papers ; and then salvation through underground community dinners cooked and served at her home .
And through it all , the scent of aromatic spices gently sizzling in ghee and the chop - chop - chop of a knife on a cutting board .
What makes Vimala , 52 , a New Agtivist is her commitment to Chapel Hill ’s extraordinary surrounding “ foodshed ” — a fancy name for a regional food ecosystem , encompassing its growing , distribution , and consumption .
No foodshed can thrive without a robust market for local produce and a cadre of people who know what to do with it ; Vimala has done more than her bit to support both .
At her community dinners and now at her restaurant , she relies on the produce of her friends in the farming community .
She makes it work economically by buying in bulk when produce is abundant , often taking top- quality but cosmetically flawed goods the farmers might otherwise not be able to sell .
She also serves the foodshed as a cooking teacher .
Over the years , dozens of people — most of them young — have entered her tutelage barely knowing how to boil water and emerged with the ability to whip up vibrant , delicious Indian food .
( I know Vimala ’s terrific food firsthand : I ’ve had the pleasure of cooking with her once , and attended her community dinners many times . )
Vimala is also commited to accessibility .
Her community dinners were pay - what - you - can ; and the prices at the new cafe are quite a bargain , given the quality of ingredients and level of cooking skill .
Just as her Curryblossom Café is now , her community dinners were always a family affair .
They were run by her and her second husband , Rush Greenslade , 61 ; several of the now - adult children from their respective previous marriages ; and a rotating cast of friends who cook in exchange for food .
( The same setup holds sway at the new restaurant , except that the workers get paid a living wage . )
With her new restaurant set for a grand opening July 17 ( it had a “ soft opening ” two weeks ago ) , I caught up with Vimala via phone from the kitchen while she and her friends prepped for the dinner rush .
Q. How did you get into cooking in the first place ?
A . My earliest memory was food .
I was always hungry as a child , maybe 2 or 3 years old .
The food I remember was never on time to feed my insatiable hunger .
So I would just hover around my mom asking her , What ’s next , when is it going to be ready ?
So then to put me in a learning circumstance , she would just say , “ Here , peel this cardamom . ”
So my little hands got into food preparations so early in life .
And at age six , I would insist that I had to go the market with or without my parents to do the shopping .
I went and shopped for the stuff twice a day , because we did n’t have a refrigerator growing up .
And even in our urban or suburban area in Bombay , my family always had a small pot of banana plants and a tomato plant , or something like that .
We grew our own green chilies .
So I was into food very early on in life .
And then in the 1980s I came to the United States to Ann Arbor , Mich . , as a dependent spouse , and wife of a scientist — it just became a great opportunity for me to discover food , not just from distant parts of India that I had not encountered before back in Bombay , but also from all over the world .
So I can handle these cuisines from various different countries , having had neighbors and friends who willingly and openly shared their recipes with me .
Folks from Egypt taught me to make a special version of lentils and rice , and falafels from Lebanese friends , and I learned to make baklava from Middle Eastern friends who showed me layer by layer how to handle phyllo .
( Shannon Barry photo ) Q .
You gained quite a following for your underground community dinners in Chapel Hill .
How did you start ?
A . In 1992 I was in a difficult family situation .
My neighbors in Chapel Hill suggested that I cook a meal and the women in the neighborhood would invite their friends .
I took a lot of time preparing it — salmon and lamb , chicken and all kinds of desserts — just Indian foods , Indian foods that I liked to make .
And during that meal , there was one person from India who said , “ Ladies , this is the best Indian food ever .
This reminds me of food in India .
It has transported to me to places so familiar , and we ’ve got to take this to the next level . ”
Eventually , the broader community also reached out to me .
People would say , “ The food is good , keep cooking and we will come . ”
We were able to raise our monthly rent of $ 350 , and there was always food .
So I realized if I cooked , all my friends and my children and I could eat healthy food .
Q . By the time I started attending your dinners in the mid-2000s , you were getting a lot of your ingredients from local farmers .
How did that supply system begin ?
A . That happened six or seven years ago , when I started building relationships one by one with the local farmers .
A lot of young people [ in the Chapel Hill area ] were going into farming , whether as farmhands on established farms or on their own .
Many of them were my children ’s age , and even attended highs school with my kids .
That these are farmers who I have known as friends , and young people who are the same age as my children , made the relationship really special .
And then knowing John and Cindy [ Soehner ] of Eco Farm — that was a natural relationship because their children were in school with my kids .
Q . Yet you were cooking those fabulous meals on a shoestring .
How could you buy from local farmers while also keeping costs low enough to make it work for you ?
Comedian Patton Oswalt has gone on the warpath against one Brian Corman , Columbia University 's School of General Studies valedictorian , who blatantly ripped off one of Oswalt 's jokes during his graduation speech almost verbatim , passing it off as an anecdote from his own experience .
Embarrassing .
After discovering the joke theft , Oswalt took to the Twitter : " Congrats to Columbia University valedictorian Brian Corman !
Great speech . "
We 're pretty sure that was meant to be sarcastic .
( Watch the video of Corman 's delivery , starting at 33:56 , and Oswalt 's original , below . )
Columbia briefly removed the video after Oswalt called Corman out , but has since put it back up again .
Apparently , Corman has apologized , and Columbia issued this statement : " It has come to our attention that a portion of our Valedictorian ’s remarks at this year ’s School of General Studies Class Day was taken from a comedy routine by Patton Oswalt .
As an institution of higher learning that places a core value on respect for the works of others , we were surprised and disappointed to have learned of this matter today .
Columbia University and the School of General Studies do not condone or permit the use of someone else 's work without proper citation . "
On his blog , Oswalt acknowledges Corman 's apology but wonders , " Did the salutatorian smash a watermelon ? "
And in reporting all this , Columbia University student - run blog " The Bwog " had this piece of advice for fellow students : " If you ’re going to steal comedy bits , do n’t steal from living comedians who use the Internet a lot .
Steal from Milton Berle , he never tweets ! "
Corman 's tortured delivery , followed by Oswalt killing it , below :
LeBron James ‘ one - hour special drew a higher overnight rating than his final game for the Cleveland Cavaliers .
ESPN drew a 7.3 overnight rating for “ The Decision ” on Thursday night , a one hour special in which James announced his intention to sign with the Miami Heat .
The special drew the highest overnight of the night on broadcast or cable , and the top overnight for any non-NFL program of the year on ESPN .
To put the numbers in perspective , Cavaliers / Celtics Game 6 on May 13 — what turned out to be James ’ final game with the Cavaliers — drew a 7.1 overnight , the highest of the NBA Playoffs on cable .
In March , ESPN drew a 0.4 overnight for a two - hour edition of SportsCenter featuring Tiger Woods ‘ first one - on - one interview since his marital woes became public .
In 2009 , the network drew a 0.9 for an edition of SportsCenter which featured Alex Rodriguez admitting to use of performance enhancing drugs .
Overnight ratings peaked at a 9.6 from 9:15 - 9:30 PM , when James announced he was joining the Heat .
Cleveland - Akron was the top market for Thursday ’s telecast , with a 26.0 .
Columbus , OH , followed with a 14.2 .
Despite being virtually the same size as the Cleveland market , Miami - Ft. Lauderdale was well behind with a 12.8 .
The telecast drew a 10.7 in Chicago , a 10.4 in New York and a 5.3 in Los Angeles .

The White House ’s initial response to the release of 92,000 pages of raw reports from the field by US forces in Afghanistan for a period from 2004 - 2009 – that it was a threat to national security and to the lives of American troops –was as predictable as it was farcical .
These documents did n’t reveal anything new to America ’s enemies in Afghanistan or Pakistan .
The Taliban fighters knew full well that their heat - seeking missiles had successfully downed American helicopters .
They did n’t reveal anything new to Pakistan ’s intelligence service , the ISI .
The Pakistanis knew that they were assisting the Taliban with intelligence , strategic planning and weapons in their fight against US forces and the current puppet regime in Kabul .
They did n’t reveal anything to the long - suffering civilian population in Afghanistan either .
Afghans know that US forces have been targeting them at checkpoints , wantonly bombing their houses and villages in attempts to hit suspected Taliban or Al Qaeda leaders or fighters , and covering up those atrocities when innocent men , women and children are the victims .
No , what the release of these documents threaten is the huge almost decade - long lie that both the last administration of President George W. Bush , and the current administration of Barack Obama have been putting out , that the US is engaged in a “ good war , ” trying to defeat “ terrorists ” and establish a democratic government in Afghanistan .
This is what makes the WikiLeaks release of these documents so much like Daniel Ellsberg ’s and Tony Russo ’s release of the Pentagon Papers .
It ’s not so much that there was explosive new information in these papers , though there is some .
It ’s that they expose to the American public the depth and breadth of government and Pentagon lying about the wars in question –Afghanistan in the WikiLeaks case , and Indochina in the Pentagon Papers case .
The WikiLeaks documents show the US to be engaged in a brutal war in which the local civilians are of no consequence , or in which they are even seen as the enemy .
The only reason there is any concern at all about their welfare is a recognition that when they are killed , it strengthens support for the Taliban .
There is no objective concern for their welfare .
The danger of the WikiLeaks papers is that they expose America as a classic imperialist or neo-colonialist oppressor , not some kind of virtuous purveyor and defender of freedom and democratic principles .
And this kind of exposé risks turning Americans against the war even more than they already are ( polls taken just before the WikiLeaks release show that even with the biased , pro-war coverage provided by the corporate media , a narrow majority of Americans currently wants the US out of Afghanistan ) .
That is what has the White House and the Pentagon in a panic .
America ’s foreign policy , and particularly its policy of war without end , is critically dependent upon the government ’s ability to lie with impunity .
Most of the time , it gets away with this lying .
The corporate media , for the most part , play along , only questioning things on the margin , if at all .
The basis premise , that the war is necessary , does n’t get challenged .
WikiLeaks , with this well - planned and orchestrated dump of incriminating documents , broke through the careful web of lies by providing the material not just to that prime information gatekeeper , the New York Times , which almost certainly would have ignored or minimized the story had it been the sole recipient of the material , but to the British Guardian newspaper , and to the German magazine Der Spiegel , both of which have shown much more of a willingness to expose the harsh realities of the Afghan War to their readers .
The Times had no alternative but to report more or less honestly on the documents and their significance — though it still tended to focus less on the war ’s impact on innocent civilians than on the reaction of the government and the military to the documents ’ release than did the Guardian and Der Spiegel .
Secrecy has no place in a democracy .
That once again is the lesson here , as it was with the Pentagon Papers .
America , much more so than in 1971 , is run by a secret government .
Almost anything that could embarrass the government , or that could anger the public , is kept secret on the broad grounds of “ national security , ” a term that has become broadened to such an extent that it can cover almost anything .
Even information about the BP well disaster in the Gulf , because it has been put under the jurisdiction of the US Coast Guard , a military organization , instead of the Department of Energy or the Department of Interior , is kept secret from the public by a kind of unmentioned notion of “ national security , ” since the Coast Guard adopts the same pinched approach to public disclosure as the Pentagon : zip .
We Americans have become so used to being lied to and to having information withheld from us , that even when we hear a reporter say the government is n’t answering a question because it involves “ national security , ” we just accept it , as in : “ Oh , yeah .
National Security .
Well , that makes sense . ”
But it does n’t make sense at all .
At the end of the disastrous Indochina War , one of the lessons most commonly drawn by policymakers was that the US should not get involved in wars that the American public does n’t support .
But instead of that leading to a new openness in foreign policy , so that armed conflict would only happen after a strong case was made to the American public , what happened was that even more secrecy was wrapped around American military activities abroad , and at the same propaganda capabilities were ramped up .
Instead of democratizing the question of going to war , the focus was put on enhancing the ability to mold and shape public opinion in favor of war .
The latest conflicts were preceded by more covert action , and more secrecy , and involved more lies to the public than any in the past , making public support for them based solely on propaganda and lies .
Hence the panic over the WikiLeaks documents , which expose the propaganda and lies .
How will the families of the dead and maimed American troops ( and other Americans ) , respond to the news that the war their loved ones died in or came home permanently maimed from was fought “ on the cheap , ” leaving them vulnerable to attack ?
How will they respond to learning that they died or were disabled in part because America ’s ostensible ally , Pakistan , was simultaneously providing aid to the Taliban even as it was receiving money and military aid from the US ?
How will they respond to learning that through all these years , as generals and politicians talked of “ winning ” the war in Afghanistan , they knew that things were getting worse , and that the war was unwinnable ?
This all remains to be seen , of course .
The American public is so used to getting lied to that the response may just be a deeper retreat into debilitating cynicism .
After all , it ’s not easy to see where to turn .
The Democrats and the Republicans are both the parties of war without end .
But then , maybe with the economy in ruins , the thought of blowing another half trillion dollars on this pointless war , and on more pointless wars being planned for the years ahead ( Iran ? North Korea ? Venezuela ? ) , will cause people to think straight and reject the whole idea .
How about spending that money here at home on better schools , better retirement funding , better health care , and on alternative energy ?
And how about a return to open government , or at least an end to secret government ?
As former President James Madison said in 1832 , “ A popular government , without popular information , or the means of acquiring it , is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy ; or , perhaps both . ”
If Americans were truly to develop a revolutionary “ tea - party ” attitude , as opposed to the fake Tea Party movement orchestrated by Fox and the Republican Party , every member of Congress who voted yesterday to provide more funding to escalate the war in Afghanistan would be booted from office this November .
The WikiLeaks documents should jolt us all in that direction .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Terrorism and federal government debt tie as the most worrisome issues to Americans when they consider threats to the future well - being of the U.S. Four in 10 Americans call each an " extremely serious " threat , with healthcare costs ranking a close third .
On a broader basis , a majority of Americans consider all but 1 of the 10 issues rated in the May 24 - 25 USA Today / Gallup poll as either " extremely serious " or " very serious " threats .
Discrimination against minority groups is the sole exception , with 46 % calling it extremely or very serious .
Partisans Rank Issues Differently
The overall scores for terrorism and the federal debt are boosted by the relatively high percentages of Republicans -- 50 % or more -- who consider each of these extremely serious , putting these at the top of the Republicans ' list .
The size and power of the federal government ranks third among Republicans .
The top three issues for Democrats are healthcare costs , the environment / global warming , and terrorism .
However , no more than 37 % of Democrats call any of these issues " extremely serious . "
The federal budget deficit ranks as the top issue concern for independents -- 42 % call it extremely serious -- thus aligning independents closer to Republicans than to Democrats on this issue .
By contrast , independents ' 36 % rating for terrorism is closer to Democrats ' than to Republicans ' rating .
The greatest gaps between Republicans and Democrats -- exceeding 20 percentage points -- are seen for the environment / global warming ( about which Democrats are more concerned ) , and the federal debt and the size of government ( issues for which the Republicans show greater concern ) .
Republican Party Preferred on Top Issue Concerns
The Republican Party is preferred over the Democratic Party for handling the two top- ranking issues of public concern -- terrorism and federal government debt .
The Democratic Party is preferred by much wider margins for the environment and discrimination against minority groups -- but these are among the least worrisome issues to Americans .
Bottom Line
Of several potential threats to the future well - being of the United States , Americans seem most concerned about terrorism and several economic matters -- the federal budget debt , healthcare costs , and unemployment .
Americans are far less likely to consider other domestic issues , including illegal immigration and the environment , as serious threats .
Regarding the current immigration debate over balancing U.S. security concerns with fair treatment of illegals , however , many more Americans say illegal immigration is an extremely serious threat than say this about discrimination against minority groups .
Nomad tribe emerges from forest to prove its existence
July 29 , 2010

Indians from the tiny Awá tribe will stage a three day protest in the Brazilian Amazon from August 1st to 3rd , to prove that they exist and to demand that their land be protected from invasion .
The event , named ‘ We Exist : Land and Life for the Awá Hunter - Gatherers ’ , has been organized by Brazilian indigenous rights organization , CIMI , the local Catholic church and several indigenous groups .
Around 100 Awá Indians are expected to participate in the protest .
For most , it will be the first time they have left their forest home .
The protest will take place in Ze Doca , a town near the Awá ’s land in Maranhão state in the eastern Amazon .
It is in response to remarks by the local mayor ’s office denying that the Awá exist .
The Awá are one of only two nomadic hunter gatherers tribes remaining in Brazil .
More than 60 Awá have no contact with outsiders and are in grave danger from illegal loggers .
Although Awá lands have been legally recognized , the Indians are being targeted by loggers , who are bulldozing roads into the forests , and by settlers , who hunt the game the Awá rely on , exposing the Indians to disease and violence .
A federal judge ruled in June 2009 that all invaders must leave the Awá territory within 180 days .
However , the ruling has since been suspended , and deforestation and invasions are increasing .
Stephen Corry , Director of Survival , said today , ‘ Denying the existence of indigenous peoples is self - fulfilling and belongs to the colonial past .
It ’s also a crime : deny they exist and they wo n’t exist , they ’ll disappear like so many Brazilian tribes before them .
If Brazil wants to be viewed as a leading nation , the authorities must no longer tolerate violations like this . ’
Survival ’s Research and Field Director Fiona Watson , who has visited the Awá , is available for interview .

A hospital trust where conditions were so bad that more than 1,000 patients may have died due to negligence actively tried to stop employees from raising concerns about patient safety , according to an inquiry conducted by the British Health Department .
" Staff have known about the problems on the wards for many years , but there has been no means by which they can bring them up , " said a health official close to the inquiry .
" Those who have tried to do so have been shot down .
Some have been ordered to withdraw or hide their allegations .
" One egregious case occurred following the death of John Moore - Robinson , a 20 - year - old who was admitted to the hospital following a mountain bike accident in April 2006 .
He was discharged with painkillers and died less than 24 hours later from a ruptured spleen that health workers had failed to detect .
In his report on the incident , consultant Ivan Phair concluded that , " The premature death of Mr. Moore - Robinson in my opinion was an avoidable situation .
I feel that an independent expert would criticize the management afforded to him by the staff .
There is a high probability that the level of care delivered to Mr. Moore - Robinson was negligent .
"
The hospital 's head of services , Kate Levy , then wrote to Phair asking him to remove these comments from his report in order to avoid " further distress to the family and adverse publicity . "
Phair 's report was not included in data presented to the inquest following the death .
Another consultant , Pradip Singh , told the inquiry that he and several coworkers had complained to superiors about staff cuts and the ensuing reduction in standards of care .
They were either ignored or ostracized as troublemakers .
According to Singh , the hospital suffers from a " palpable culture of intimidation . "
Data submitted to the inquiry note that the hospital 's written policy on whistleblowers actively discourages employees from raising concerns .

Smoking marijuana to most Americans an enjoyable and relaxing recreational activity .
It ’s not hard to understand why .
It is safer than alcohol , yet your favorite relaxing method is illegal .
Yea , its bullshit … but wake up and face that getting busted for smoking or holding a little marijuana will still get you in some pretty deep trouble .
Since that recreational activity can get you busted , it is very important to know a thing or two to defend yourself against the law .
There are many websites that can give you tips on how to act , what to do and what to say to lessen the chances that you will get caught , and ultimately be served some kind of punishment for smoking a plant ( cigarettes are much worse and 10 times as addictive , IMO ) .
One such website really stands out .
“ Never Get Busted Again ” by Barry Cooper , provides a short list of free tips to never get busted again for using marijuana .

Video : Studying the behaviour of bumblebees has enabled biologists to refine methods used to track down serial killers
You might not think it , but bumblebees and serial killers have something in common : neither like to divulge their address and both tend to stay close to home .
Now a study of the habits of one could be used to track down the other .
Geographical profiling ( GP ) is a technique used by the police to find serial offenders .
The search is narrowed down using two common traits : most attacks happen fairly close to the perpetrator ’s home , but beyond a “ buffer zone ” that prevents the attacker being recognised or noticed by neighbours .
By mapping out the locations of crime scenes , police aim to identify the buffer zone and prioritise their search in this area .

Bumblebees also leave a buffer zone around their nest to prevent predators finding it , so Nigel Raine , from Queen Mary , University of London , UK , and his colleagues wondered if they could be used to test the effectiveness of the GP model .
“ For obvious ethical reasons , you ca n’t carry out controlled tests of the GP model on serial killers , but we can test it on bumblebees , ” Raine says .
The biologists set up a colony of bumblebees and allowed them to forage in a “ meadow ” of fake flowers containing artificial nectar .
Gotcha !
The bees were tagged and then monitored as they travelled between their nest and the flowers .
Altering the density of the flowers enabled the scientists to manipulate how hard the bees had to work to gather the nectar .
By combining computer simulations of the bees ’ movements with geographical profiling , the team found they were able to locate the entrance to the bees ’ nest , showing that the police technique was effective .
The researchers say they have also found ways to improve the profiling technique .
They have observed different types of foraging behaviour among the bees that could be used to refine the algorithms used by the police , helping to make the technique more accurate .
David Hill from the University of Sussex , Brighton , UK , says the system could help track down more agreeable creatures too .
He thinks it could be used to locate and protect the homes of species such as bats , although “ woodland species with multiple , shifting roosts could present much more of a challenge ” .

The sport of mixed martial arts will crown its next top - ranked heavyweight on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas .
There , UFC heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar will square off with undefeated interim titleholder Shane Carwin in an anticipated unification bout at UFC 116 “ Lesnar vs. Carwin . ”
Sherdog.com caught up with dozens of professional fighters and trainers to gauge their opinions on the battle between these two behemoths :
As I do every summer , I left a graduate - level algebraic graph theory math problem on the board as a challenged posed to my students .
I had hoped one of them could solve it by the end of the semester .
To my amazement , it was anonymously solved within the first week .
In its place , I posted a much more difficult problem , one that took me and my colleagues two years to prove .
Then I see this janitor writing over my problem and chase him away only to realize , upon closer inspection of the janitor ’s writing , that the janitor had solved this difficult proof .
I finally tracked down the janitor and found out his name was Derrick Noble .
By the time I found out who he was , he was in a bit of a jam .
He was on trial for attacking a police officer .
Because of Derrick ’s unparalleled promise , I spoke to the judge on Derrick ’s behalf .
The judge offered him prison or to be released to my supervision to study mathematics and see a therapist .
Derrick chose the latter .
Derrick treated the first five therapists with utter contempt .
In desperation , I finally called on Sean , my old roommate , now an estranged old friend , who is a therapist and happens to think Carwin will win , just like Noble .
My fields medal leads me to believe Lesnar will be the champ , but Derrick and Sean both have more natural talent than me , of which I am jealous , and they think Carwin .
Lesnar wins .
He wins by ground - and - pound stoppage in the first round .
He shows the world how much of a beast he really is .
I think that Brock wins this fight .
Carwin has to catch him with some good , solid shots early on .
If not , Brock takes Carwin down and controls the fight .
Brock in the second round by punishment on the ground .
I think it ’s probably one of the biggest fights of the year at heavyweight .
Brock Lesnar --
I ’m a big fan , huge fan .
I ’m going back to my old wrestling days , of course , [ with ] him being a collegiate wrestler .
I ’ve always been a huge fan , but Shane Carwin has the skills to become the next heavyweight champ .
I kind of look at the paper , black or white and who ’s going to win or not .
I think Carwin ’s going to pull it off , but I hope Brock is going to make it happen and continue being the champ .
I have a liking for Brock .
I see a lot of myself in him , and I think he ’s good for the sport .
But , yeah , I do [ think Carwin will win ] .
I just think his stand - up skills are a little better than Brock ’s .
He ’s got a lot more experience , having 12 fights , big fights , and you saw how fast he dismantled Frank Mir .
I just think if Shane Carwin can defend the takedown , he should win the fight .
But if he ca n’t defend the takedown , then he ’s going to be in trouble .
I ’ve been really impressed with Carwin , but his only chance to win this is to KO Lesnar .
That sounds great in theory , but I just do n’t think it will be that simple .
Having trained Brock for a very brief time at [ Miletich Fighting Systems ] when he decided to start fighting , I know firsthand how strong Brock is and how far he has come in a short time .
I really think it ’s gonna come down to Carwin ’s ability to stop the takedown .
This is such a difficult fight to call , but I ’m gonna have to take the safe route here when the only chance to win is a puncher ’s chance .
Well , that ’s hard to call ; they ’re both beasts .
I think we might see the Octagon break ( laughs ) .
They both hit hard , and both [ are ] good wrestlers .
I think if Carwin gets him to the ground and slaps on a camel clutch , it ’s over .
On the other hand , if Brock can get to the top and Jimmy “ Superflys ” him , he might squish Carwin .
Final analysis is … pandemonium .
I think Brock wins this fight fairly easily .
I see him being very dominant .
Brock will get the takedown and ground - and - pound out a win in the late second or third round .
The toughest fight Brock will ever have is in the practice room against Cole Konrad I think Lesnar is going to take Carwin down in the first and try to Donkey Kong him .
Carwin will weather an early storm and KO Lesnar with one of his six - inch punches in the second , just like the punch that dropped [ Gabriel ] Gonzaga .
Please , Shane , smash that overgrown non-veggie eating poop stick .
That is going to be a brawl .
Two big athletic boys .
I want to say Lesnar based on his wrestling , but I pick Carwin by KO .
I hope the cage can handle the size and power of these two .
Brock by ground - and - pound TKO .
I think his wrestling is [ on ] a whole different level than Carwin’s , but Carwin has a puncher ’s chance on the feet .
I am rooting for Shane Carwin in this fight .
I have been a fan of his since his fights in Ring of Fire .
On the feet , I think he is far superior and a much more natural striker .
Only problem I see for him is Brock ’s superhuman strength .
If he ends up on top of Shane , I think he will look for a wrestler ’s decision .
This is literally a fight where two worlds are gonna collide .
Takedowns for a dollar ( copyright ) .
Carwin is coming to collect .
Lesnar by decision .
Carwin by KO.I kind of have to go with Carwin in this one .
I do think Brock will take him down but do n’t know if he can finish or keep him there .
Also , Carwin has the better standing game , and Brock did n’t look like he likes getting hit .
I think Shane is going to get this one .
I think he is the harder hitting of the two .
[ It will ] be fun to watch two massive heavyweights trying to hurt each other .
I ’m thinking Carwin is going to beat the poop out of Lesnar in this one .
Carwin has the size and power to offset Lesnar ’s raw size and wrestling and his lack of skill in striking .
Carwin in round two by KO or TKO .
The only thing that could make this better would be Cain Velasquez running in and turning this into a three - way death match .
Oh , I should n’t say that ; we might end up seeing that happen on Monday Night “ Raw . ”
I really could imagine the WWE doing a parody of that .
Shane Carwin is absolutely one of the nicest people I 've met on the circuit .
I used to wonder if Shane had it in him to really put a beatdown on someone , but his last few fights cleared up that question ( laughs ) .
Brock Lesnar is entertaining to watch and knows how to sell it .
Even though he reminds me of that guy on the football team hanging people on the flagpole by their underwear , I like his attitude as a fighter .
The difference here is depth in the MMA game , and I believe Carwin has it .
This fight goes two , maybe three rounds max .
Anything longer than that and people are going to find out the ugly truth about 265 - pound fighters .
If one of these guys wins by triangle , I ’m gonna crap myself .
My prediction is Shane Carwin by TKO and the UFC needing some new fence panels afterwards .
Lesnar will start fast trying to control the fight on the top position on the ground .
Carwin will stuff the takedowns and counter with punches to the head .
Lesnar will have no answer to Carwin ’s onslaughts and combinations of punches to the head , and it will end in the first round .

A brand new course is being offered at the University of Texas , El Paso featuring our favorite SciFi series .
Called " Thinking Boldly with Star Trek " , the course is meant to help first - year students strengthen their academic talents through critical thinking .
It also appears that there will be episode viewing as part of the course curriculum .
Can we sign up just this course ?
UTEP is the perfect venue for the new Trek curriculum since the Great Bird of the Galaxy , Gene Roddenberry was an El Paso native .
In fact , the El Paso Independent School District , in 2001 , recognized Roddenberry ’s contribution to education by naming its planetarium in his honor .
The course is taught by Nancy Hill , assistant director for technical services at UTEP 's University Library .
“ In our 1301 [ University Studies : Seminar in Critical Inquiry ] courses , the goal is to help entering students acquire or sharpen critical thinking and learning skills , ” Hill said .
“ Anything that ’s fun is nonthreatening to learners , and Star Trek really fits the bill .
Like any good epic , it has a very clear moral and ethical tone .
When the original Star Trek debuted in 1966 , it featured the first multicultural cast in television history .
Minority and female characters have always been figures of authority on Star Trek , and each series promotes the idea that it ’s better to use intellect and reason , rather than weapons , to solve problems .
Gene Roddenberry , Star Trek ’s creator , once said : ‘ This is n’t a show about outer space .
It ’s about us . ’”
Hill uses Star Trek as a vehicle to launch lively discussions about complex social , scientific and philosophical questions .
This year , her course will focus on four main themes : time , space , machines and monsters .
In addition to viewing relevant Star Trek episodes , students will read classic science fiction works , including Mary Shelley ’s Frankenstein ; Isaac Asimov ’s I , Robot ; R.J. Tilley ’s “ Willie ’s Blues ” and Tom Godwin ’s “ The Cold Equations . ”
Hill also requires students to write a research paper .
“ The value of science fiction and fantasy is that you get out of your zone and look at ideas from a different , more objective point of view , ” Hill said .
“ There ’s been a tremendous amount of scholarly writing about Star Trek , so it ’s not difficult for students to find academic material .
In this way , they learn about the broader science fiction genre .
I also use the series to talk about literary traditions such as the role of storytelling in a culture , whether it ’s an ethnic group or , as in Star Trek , a species .
Storytelling defines who we are . ”
Hill , who became a Star Trek fan in college , is n’t fazed by those UTEP students who enroll in her course without knowing anything about the series .
“ In the first week of class , I assign everyone to teams and ask each team to give an overview of one of the six Star Trek series ( Star Trek , Star Trek : The Animated Series , Star Trek : The Next Generation , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Star Trek : Voyager and Star Trek : Enterprise ) .
It ’s a good opportunity to teach students how to work effectively in groups , and it also hones their research and presentation skills , ” Hill said .
“ My secret goal is to convert all of them to become über - Trekkies , ” joked Hill , pointing to the full - sized poster — “ Everything I Need to Know in Life I Learned from Star Trek ” — on her office wall .

Mozilla is celebrating a major landmark for Firefox , with two billion add - ons downloaded for the popular browser .
Despite an increasing amount of competition , Firefox is still the second most used browser on the planet , with only Microsoft 's Internet Explorer holding a greater market share , and add - ons have been a key part of its rise to popularity .
" Today marks a very special occasion in the world of Firefox Add-ons as we cross the 2 Billion download marker , " states the Rock Your Firefox blog .
" We have a lot of people to thank for helping us reach this milestone : most of all , you ! "
Breaking targets
The Firefox team acknowledged that they had smashed the internal target they had set for reaching the two billion mark .
" When we reached 1 billion Firefox Add - on downloads in November 2008 , we thought it would take us less than 3 years to get to the next billion , and with your help , we 've gotten to 2 billion in half that time ! " the team blogged .
" With more than 150 million add - ons in use every day , we know that the next billion add - on downloads will be here before we know it . "
However , as the graph that Mozilla released shows , although growth is still phenomenal it is beginning to flatten as competition form browsers such as Chrome begins to slow take - up of Firefox .
With a major chunk of the market now using Firefox , Mozilla will be very aware that there are now major names like Google and Apple snapping at their heels , as well as Microsoft trying hard to improve its dominant Internet Explorer browser with IE9 .

There are mixed views from within the Labor Party on Prime Minister Julia Gillard 's call for an open debate on asylum seekers .
Ms Gillard has nominated the policy on asylum seekers and border protection as the next thing on her to - do list .
Yesterday she said people should feel free to say what they believe about the issue , but some MPs see echoes of former prime minister John Howard in her words .
It was a very deliberate shift in Ms Gillard 's language on the issue of asylum seekers on the weekend .
" I 'd like to sweep away any sense that people should close down any debate , including this debate through a sense of self - censorship or political correctness , " she said .
" People should say what they feel and my view is many in the community feel anxious when they see asylum seeker boats and obviously we , as a Government , want to manage our borders . "
Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin and backbencher David Bradbury say the Prime Minister is calling for a mature debate .
" She wants to have an open conversation with the Australian people about these issues , " Ms Macklin said .
" They are issues that Australians have many different views about and I think what she 's wanting to encourage is a mature debate about them . "
But some Labor MPs see echoes of Mr Howard 's initial approach to the rise of One Nation founder Pauline Hanson , such as this from September 1996 :
" One of the great changes that has come over Australia in the last six months is that people do feel able to speak a little more freely and a little more openly about what they feel .
In a sense the pall of censorship on certain issues has been lifted , " Mr Howard said .
At the time Mr Howard made the statement Labor MPs were highly critical , accusing him of dog whistling - sending a message to a specific part of the electorate .
Those MPs who have some concerns about their Prime Minister 's use of language were not prepared to speak publicly today , but Greens senator Sarah Hanson Young was .
" Her job as prime minister should be to reassure the Australian people that there is nothing to be anxious of , there 's nothing to be fearful of , calm down the debate , " Senator Hanson - Young said .
" Take out the hysteria and in fact , do the right thing , not what is easy .
And Julia Gillard seems to think that the easy route for her at the moment is to chase Tony Abbott down the low road of politics .
" Her dog whistle this morning was the lowest form of politics that I 've seen played in a long time from the Labor Party . "
The big issue
Some Labor
MPs for some weeks have been saying privately that the question of asylum seekers is a bigger issue for Labor in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne than the mining tax .
Backbencher David Bradbury , who represents the western Sydney seat of Lindsay , says the issue of asylum seekers is a big one .
He says it takes in concerns about population growth , but mainly about protecting borders and treating refugees fairly .
" It 's about ensuring that whilst we are a generous country and we 're prepared to not only meet our international obligations but be a good international citizen , that we want to do that within a framework that does not encourage people to take risky and life - threatening voyages across the sea , " he said .
Minister Chris Bowen , who also represents western Sydney , says a high number of his constituents are refugees or have many family members in refugee camps around the world .
" My community certainly acknowledges the importance of refugees , the important contribution that they 've made to Australia and would continue to make to Australia , " he said .
" Likewise , there 's a lot of concern in my community about those high number of people waiting in camps and for every person who arrives on a boat , that 's one less person we take from a camp . "
But one MP who lives outside of those cities says if Ms Gillard moves to toughen the policy , it could mean losing some votes to the Greens in inner city seats .
But the MPs that PM have spoken to have no answers to the problems the debate raises for Labor .
They recognise that toughening the policy and addressing the view strongly put by the Coalition that the Government has lost control of the borders could shore up support in the centre and on the right , but risk losing some on the left .
Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison says the voters know who they can trust on the issue .
" The Prime Minister can engage all she likes in some sort of midnight conversion on the eve of an election but the truth is 143 boats do n't lie , " he said .
" That 's the record of their policies and I think the Australian people will make a judgement about who they believe they can best trust on this issue - our proven record or the Government 's hollow words on the eve of an election . "
A decision on Labor 's policy is expected soon , with a three - month pause on processing claims from asylum seekers from Sri Lanka due to expire on Thursday .
July 4th in America :
A government of the rich , by the rich and for the rich
5 July 2010
Sunday , July 4 marked the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence .
This founding document of the American republic proclaimed the profoundly democratic principle that “ all men are created equal ” and endowed with “ unalienable rights . ”
It was issued in 1776 , one year into a bitter armed struggle against an occupying British army .
This revolutionary struggle to put an end to colonial rule was a profoundly liberating event , whose reverberations were felt round the world .
Two hundred and thirty - four years on , the federal government in Washington commemorated the anniversary with a series of actions that demonstrated how thoroughly the principles elaborated in the Declaration have been repudiated in practice , leaving Americans with a government that is as unrepresentative and reactionary as that of old King George III .
Congress adjourned for the holiday leaving millions of unemployed workers without the money , in the form of jobless benefits , to pay their rent or mortgage and feed themselves and their families .
At the same time , it deprived states of tens of billions of dollars in anticipated Medicaid funding , thus ensuring brutal cuts in essential social services and layoffs of teachers and other public employees .
While slashing funds for the jobless and the working population generally , it approved $ 33 billion to pay for the escalation of the nine - year - old colonial war and occupation in Afghanistan , ensuring the reproduction in a far more savage form of all the crimes of the British King — “ plunder , ” “ death , ” “ desolation , ” “ tyranny , ” “ cruelty , ” “ perfidy ” — spelled out in the Declaration ’s bill of particulars .
The main social layer in America with reason to give a flag - waving cheer on this Fourth of July consisted of Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers , who saw a proposed $ 19 billion tax shifted from their assets onto working people .
While the toothless financial reform bill passed by Congress last week was initially to be paid for by taxing the institutions most responsible for the financial meltdown of 2008 , the Democratic leadership caved to Republican objections , agreeing to fund it instead with money left over from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) — funds that otherwise would have gone to decrease the US deficit .
Instead , those billions in deficit reduction will be gouged out of programs that benefit the working class and the poor .
Taken together , these actions provide an unmistakable portrait of a government that is of the rich , by the rich and for the rich — one that is utterly unresponsive to the needs and wishes of the vast majority of the American people .
The actions of the US Senate ( the “ millionaires club ” ) , the House ( where the average net worth is $ 650,000 ) and the Obama White House are determined by the interests of the banks , the corporations and the wealthiest one percent of the population , while the majority of the country , the working people , are abandoned to the mercies of the capitalist “ free market . ”
The policies of this government are catastrophic for millions upon millions of Americans .
The Senate ’s decision to adjourn last week without passing an extension of unemployment benefits left 1.63 million jobless workers with no income .
By the end of this month , that number will climb to 3 million , and if Congress fails to pass an extension upon its return , some 7 million by the end of the year .
These millions of unemployed workers , together with their children , are being condemned to impoverishment , hunger and homelessness in the name of fighting the deficit — a political catch phrase that boils down to imposing the full burden of the crisis of the capitalist system upon the working class .
The economic and social context in which this action has been taken underscores its criminality .
The Labor Department released figures Friday showing the loss of 125,000 jobs in June .
At least 15 million people are without work , with five workers chasing each job .
And the number of long - term unemployed — those out of work for six months or longer and in need of the federally funded extensions — is unprecedented since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The jobless data following a string of reports on falling home and car sales , plummeting consumer confidence and declining factory orders , all of which make a mockery of the Obama administration ’s claim that this is a “ recovery summer . ”
The failure of Congress to approve $ 24 billion in Medicaid assistance to state governments will intensify the spiraling down of the US economy .
Without this money , layoffs that could affect some 900,000 public and private sector workers are threatened , together with the loss of critical social services and the further decimation of public education .
The Democratic House and Senate leadership have blamed Republican obstinacy for the defeat of these meager relief measures .
The reality , however , is that both big business parties accept the doctrine of deficit reduction and agree that social spending — including the pittance offered to the unemployed — must be curtailed to that end .
As for the Obama White House , it declined to make an issue of millions of workers being left destitute .
No such obstacle stood in the way of paying for imperialist war , however , with the Congressional Democratic leadership determined to approve the $ 33 billion supplemental package — roughly the same amount that was withheld from the unemployed and the state governments — before July 4 .
The House vote for war funding came just one day after the Senate voted 99 - 0 to confirm the new Afghanistan commander , Gen. David Petraeus , who spelled out to Congress his intention to escalate the killing of Afghans .
What is to account for the chasm that divides the interests of the working class majority from the policies of the two big business parties ?
According to the latest data released by the Congressional Budget Office last week , the income gap between the top 1 percent , America ’s millionaires , and the rest of the population more than tripled between 1979 and 2007 .
During that period , the top one percent saw its after - tax income increase 281 percent , compared to just 25 percent for the middle fifth of the population .
The immense and uninterrupted growth of social inequality in America makes a mockery of the egalitarian principles enunciated in the country ’s founding document , and is incompatible with basic democratic principles .
It is an essential manifestation of the deep - going degeneration of a capitalist system that can produce only economic , social and ecological disasters , together with ever more catastrophic wars .
As the US commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Independence , it is entirely appropriate to invoke the document ’s defense of the right of the people to “ alter or abolish ” any government that denies their “ unalienable rights , ” and to replace it with a new system that “ to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . ”
The Socialist Equality Party is confident that the American working class will seek to exercise this fundamental right .
The urgent issue is the development of the revolutionary leadership that will provide the program for workers in the US to unite with their brothers and sisters all over the world in a new revolutionary struggle to put an end to unemployment , poverty , oppression and war , and create a socialist society organized to serve the needs of the majority , rather than the profit interests of a modern - day financial aristocracy .

Stranger has proven much more difficult as we really pushed some rendering aspects on the Xbox and bringing that over to DirectX is a bit of voodoo .
So it 's taken far longer than expected to convert Stranger than we had initially anticipated .
We 're still aiming for 2010 but do not have a set month for release .
We are working diligently on getting this done and making sure its all quality conversions .
3 down . 1 to go .
Must happen in 2010 .

Analysts only expected Apple to report $ 14.62 million in revenue , which means that Apple could be in good shape to when Microsoft reports later this week .
Microsoft is expected to report revenue of $ 15.25 billion , according to the Thomson Reuters poll .
Apple sold a record 3.47 million Macintosh computers for the quarter , up by 33 percent a year ago , and iPhone sales increased by 61 percent compared to a year ago to 8.4 million units .

Gloves Coming Off As Romney Aide Attacks Palin
The Palin and Romney camps have already started trading barbs in what could be a preview of the race for the GOP nomination in 2012 .
Doug Mataconis · · 11 comments
In a sure sign that her potential opponents consider a Sarah Palin run for the Republican nomination in 2012 a likelihood , a recent column in Time Magazine includes what can only be called a shot across the bow from the Romney campaign :
Few express much regard for Palin ’s ultimate chances .
One adviser to Mitt Romney , the former Massachusetts governor , and , by traditional standards , the putative 2012 frontrunner , says of Palin , “ She ’s not a serious human being . ”
Another Romney intimate warns , “ If she ’s standing up there in a debate and the answers are more than 15 seconds long , she ’s in trouble . ”
The Palin camp swatted back in The Politico :
In potentially the first inter -staff dust up of the 2012 presidential race , an aide of Sarah Palin is hitting back at Mitt Romney ’s camp for saying the former Alaska governor is “ not a serious human being . ” (…)
Asked about the comments by POLITICO , a longtime Palin aide unloaded on Romney ’s staff .
“ It shocks me that anyone would try to do that , ” the aide said .
“ You ’d think we ’d all be working together toward a common goal – that being 2010 – and that should be the focus right now .
Those who try to claim the mantle of Reagan would be good to follow one of his most sacred tenets . ”
“ For Washington consultants to sit around and personally disparage the Governor anonymously to reporters is unfortunate and counterproductive and frankly immature , ” the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity , continued .
Well , all I can say in response to that is welcome to big time politics , buddy .
It ’s fairly obvious that anyone who runs against Sarah Palin , assuming she ever runs for anything ever again , is going to hit her on her relative lack of experience and her disengagement with issues beyond repeating platitudes — something that can be seen fairly evidently in this recent appearance on The O’Reilly Factor .
And if the Palin camp thinks that this little comment from an anonymous Romney aide is “ disparaging , ” just wait for what the media and the Democrats are going to put her through .
If Palin runs , she sure is n’t going to get a coronation .

Psych .
professor divulges that he killed dorm-mate in 1955
After keeping it private for 50 years , a UA psychology professor admitted to his classes Tuesday he killed another student when he was in college .
Robert Bechtel , professor of environmental psychology , told his two classes that after a life of being bullied , he snapped when he was a 22 - year - old college junior and killed a student in his residence hall Jan. 12 , 1955 .
Bechtel is the subject of an independent documentary being filmed on campus and decided to go public with the information this week after keeping it secret for almost 50 years .
" There was a wide range of reaction : Most people were thoroughly shocked , a lot came up to me after and thanked me , others said they had been bullied , " said Bechtel of his classes ' reactions .
Bechtel met with UA President Peter Likins and Alfred Kaszniak , head of the psychology department , to get permission for the film crew before he told his classes and to tell his story .
He said Likins gave him his blessing .
Bechtel said he had been bullied from the time he was 4 years old until he was in college .
His residents bullied him when he was a proctor , or a resident assistant , at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania in fall 1954 .
" They would pull my bed into the hall and urinate on it and tell everyone , " Bechtel said .
The bullies moved his bed outside of the residence hall and into the quad and urinated on it .
Bechtel also heard a chorus of " Bechtel will eat shit " as he moved through each of the three floors of the hall , he said .
He also said he would be hit and kicked often and always with a crowd of people around to see his mistreatment .
Over the years the bullying built up and Bechtel said he could n't deal with it any longer .
He went home for winter break and obtained two guns with the intent to cease the bullying by killing his tormentors , Bechtel said .
" I was going to stop it all by shooting up the whole place , " Bechtel said .
After shooting and killing one student , he said " the feeling dissolved " and he stopped .
He turned himself in to police later that day , Bechtel said .
" ( I wanted to ) blow away the whole dorm , but only shot one person , " Bechtel said .
He was put on death row for a few months and was admitted to Fairview State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in April 1955 , where he stayed for almost five years , Bechtel said .
" I had an epiphany about heaven and hell : People in heaven help each other , " Bechtel said .
He realized he could have a meaningful life if he could help other people , and he started a school in the hospital teaching patients math , English and geography .
When officials at the hospital saw he had insight , they decided he was ready to be released .
Bechtel was sent to county prison , and at his Jan. 6 , 1960 , trial he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was released .
After the trial he worked and returned to school at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania studying psychology , which he had been studying before the incident at Swarthmore .
In 1976 , Bechtel and his wife moved to Arizona , and he began teaching psychology at the UA .
Bechtel received tenure his first year here .
Their daughter graduated from the UA in 2001 , and he said he told her his story when she was 19 .
" It was n't something I could incorporate - he is a very loving father , " said Carrah Bechtel , Robert Bechtel 's daughter .
She said when she heard the story it was like it was a story about someone else .
She said it was awful , and said she was very direct with her father about her feelings .
She said she thinks sometimes it is unfair that it affects her too , but she is glad she knows the truth .
Carrah Bechtel approached Macky Alston , an independent filmmaker , in New York City and expressed interest in working with him to tell her father 's story .
" I think we have a normal relationship with extraordinary circumstances , but it had to be told , " Carrah Bechtel said .
" I do n't want to not be there for him . "
Both Carrah and her mother were present when Bechtel told his 8 a.m. Environmental Psychology class and noon Psychology of Happiness class Tuesday .
" When he first said it , we all thought he was joking .
...
It was kind of shocking , " said Paula Spicerkuhn , a psychology junior and student in his 8 a.m. class .
Spicerkuhn said others in the class reacted the same way and understood it had happened , but also that it has been a long time , she said .
" It seems like he 's moved past it .
People can learn a lot from him , " Spicerkuhn said .
Robert Bechtel held an extra session in the Manuel T. Pacheco Integrated Learning Center at 6 p.m.
Tuesday for his students to come and talk to him and asked questions about it .
Deanna Ortiz , a psychology junior and student in his 8 a.m. class , said she was grateful her professor shared such a personal part of his life .
She said his experience is a wake - up call to what is really going on around her every day .
" In a way we are all murderers - we kill people with our words and actions by gossiping and such , " Ortiz said .
Ortiz said she thinks students will look at him differently , but it 's important to see he is a human being who made a mistake .
" It made me realize how ignorant I was before he shared , " Ortiz said .
" It will help us realize all we do can really have a negative effect on others . "
The purpose of the documentary is to inform others of the repercussions of bullying .
Carrah and Robert Bechtel said they want to make people aware that bullying is not something that stops after elementary school .
Alston said the documentary will follow Robert Bechtel as he tells his story .
" ( We are ) following Bechtel ... as they go public with it ... the themes of experiencing that and then having this incredible second chapter of his life after everybody thought it was over for him , " Alston said .
Kristin Maynard , a psychology senior and student in Robert Bechtel 's 8 a.m. class , said she is nervous about the widespread reaction the documentary may ignite .
She said many of the people she has told since Tuesday have not been able to see the positive side of his disclosure .
" It 's easier to say , ' Wow , that 's a bad person , ' rather than listen .
Obviously it 's hard to be sympathetic , but to see what else he 's done with his life , it 's amazing , " Maynard said .
Maynard said she thinks the documentary will show Robert Bechtel 's situation was preventable .
Maynard said it 's important for people to understand he was a victim as were the shooters involved in the Columbine High School , Colo. , shootings in 1999 .
Bechtel said after the Columbine shootings he realized how familiar those students ' story was , and when people were trying to figure out why it happened , he said he knew it was because of bullying .
Later , investigations confirmed his suspicions .
" ( After Columbine ) my thought was , ' Here we go again . '
We have to get into a state where we have every school teaching kids how to get along with each other , " Bechtel said .
Bechtel and his daughter have written a book about his life , " Redemption , " and are hoping to publish it and release the documentary in 2006 .

Karl Rove needs no introduction ; Grant Jeffrey , by contrast , will perhaps be unknown to most people who do n’t consume Christian fundamentalist apocalyptic paperbacks and DVDs .
Rachel Tabachnick , who discusses the above event at Talk to Action here ( which brought it to my attention ) , notes that Jeffrey is the author of works such Shadow Government : How the Global Elite Plan to Destroy your Democracy and Freedom .
According to the DVD ’s blurb :
What if there were hidden forces with no ties to democracy or constitutional rights in power ?
What if new laws , media propaganda and Secret Societies labeled John a danger to society ?
And what if all this set the stage for a Biblically prophesied global government run by the Antichrist ?
Leading researchers , authors and minds like Grant Jeffrey … take you through the incredible and hidden world of Surveillance , Rights and Freedoms , Global Government and Bible Prophecy .
Books by Jeffrey include The New Temple and the Second Coming : The Prophecy That Points to Christ ’s Return in Your Generation ( “ Grant Jeffrey investigates … developments among rabbinic authorities to reveal a prophetic , Temple - related timeline that points to Jesus ’ return in the current generation ” ) , as well as The Signature of God : Astonishing Bible Codes Reveal September 11 Terror Attacks ( “ Remarkable new computer discoveries from the Bible Codes reveal astonishing details about the September 11 Islamic terrorist attack on America that were encoded in Hebrew text thousands of years ago ” ) and The Next World War : What Prophecy Reveals about Extreme Islam and the West ( “ How Russia and extreme Islam will launch World War III ” ) .
Walid Shoebat used to credit his conversion to Christianity to Jeffrey ’s Armageddon : Appointment With Destiny , although he tends to downplay that these days .
The site for the “ G - 20 Summit Faith and Business Leaders ” event – which had no links to the real G - 20 meeting , as a tiny notice on the site makes clear – includes a blurb by Canadian Christian Right bigwig Charles McVety :
As you know the G - 20 World Leaders are coming to Toronto , June 25 – 27 .
On Saturday evening , June 26th we are going to gather in praise and prayer to petition God to guide these leaders toward peace and freedom . …
The world is fraught with peril today .
Countries such as Greece are already bankrupt and cannot pay their employees .
Spain is in deep trouble financially and the United States owes over $ 13 Trillion .
Canada is going deeper in debt every day as our government wastes billions of dollars on needless projects .
Our environment deteriorates as pollution grows while the G - 20 throws trillions of dollars at reducing CO2 , a natural necessary part of air .
War in the Middle East could break out any day with President Ahmadinejad of Iran building nuclear weapons and threatening to “ wipe Israel off the map ” .
With these leaders down the street in our city of Toronto we have an ideal opportunity to pray for them .
Dr. Paul Dhinakaran will lead us to the Throne of Grace for such a time as this .
He has one of the largest ministries in the world and is a world leader in prayer receiving over 20,000 prayer requests per day .
His prayer rallies average over 500,000 people per night .
God has spoken to Dr. Paul giving him a special impartation for us in these days .
Please try to clear you busy schedule and be with us on Saturday , June 26th at 7:00 pm Admission is free .
This is part of a larger G - 20 Summit for Faith and Business Leaders .
Karl
Rove will speak to us on how to effect change democratically .
Dr. Grant Jeffrey will teach us history and prophecy and several other speakers will prepare us for these days .
On Sunday evening we will gather for a Rally to Stop Nuclear Iran .
The swipe at “ reducing CO2 ” is typical for apocalyptic Christian fundamentalism : while the movement as a whole manipulates uncertainties about the future ( wars , diseases , earthquakes , and such ) to instil fatalism , fear , and hate , wider political considerations mean that climate change has to be dismissed out of hand .
McVety , as Rachel notes , is close to John Hagee and co-chairs the Canadian branch of CUFI ( Christians United for Israel ) ; she also notes this 2006 Walrus article which explains McVety ’s role in the Canadian Christian Right .
Dhinakaran is an Indian Pentecostal evangelist and the son of D.G.S. Dhinakaran , from whom he inherited his “ Jesus Calls ” ministry .
According to his ministry ’s publicity materials , D.G.S. enjoyed an international reputation :
Great servants of God , like Pastor .
Benny Hinn , Dr. Pat Robertson , Dr.Dave Roberson , Pastor .
John Osteen honour Dr.D.G.S.Dhinakaran as the apostle of this age in India .
… Dr. M.G. “ Pat ” Robertson , Chairman of The Christian Broadcasting Network , USA has decribed the spiritual nature of Bro. Dhinakaran very aptly in the following few lines : ” Frankly , I cannot recall any figure in the Old Testament or New Testament who has had such a profound and ongoing encounter with the Deity . ”
As for Paul ’s own profile :
A man who frequently rubs shoulders with eminent leaders of the nation , Dr. Paul was appointed by the present Prime Minister of India as a Member of the National Monitoring Committee for Minority Education and as a Member of the Governing Council of “ Education for all ” Committee , both in the Education department of the Government of India .
He had also served as a Syndicate Member of the Bharathiar University for two consecutive terms appointed by the Governor of the State of Tamilnadu .
… As a visionary , he revolutionized the “ Jesus Calls ” ministry in several ways .
He was instrumental in establishing Jesus Calls “ Prayer Towers ” throughout the globe in 7 countries and all over India where Prayer Intercessors offer dedicated prayers all the 24 hours for thousands of people daily .
This link between prayer , geography , and spiritual warfare is suggestive of C. Peter Wagner ’s teachings .
Karl Rove , of course , does not take any of this very seriously – in 2008 Christopher Hitchens mentioned that Rove does not consider himself to be “ a person of faith ” , although when a Christianity Today journalist asked Rove about it he affected to some sort of vague religiosity .
But if he wants to cement his links with this crowd , perhaps he could include one of Jeffrey ’s books in his new book club , once he has done with Brad Thor ‘s latest potboiler .
There are plenty to choose from …
Various organisations are listed as suppporting the “ Faith and Business Leaders ” event , with their logos next to the image of Jeffrey .
They are : Canada Family Action ; Conservative Values of Canada ; McVety ’s Insitute for Canadian Values ( founded in 2005 with “ a gala dinner tutorial from Ralph Reed ” ) ; and – somewhat more surprisingly – the B’nai Brith Canada .
Rachel notes that B’nai Brith Canada ’s executive vice - president Frank Dimant also spoke at the event .
Dimant has long - standing links to McVety ; in 2003 McVety joined Dimant in denouncing Jews for Jesus for “ preaching Christianity under the guise of Judaism ” .
Dimant also teaches at McVety ’s Canada Christian College , where the “ Faith and Business Leaders ” summit took place .

Indigenous Sovereignty Threatened by UK LaCrosse Decision
The Native American Indian confederacy of tribes known as the Iroquois Nation , or Haudenosaunee were recently denied access to the World Lacrosse Championships in England , despite their ancestors invented the sport .
This brings up an important indigenous rights issue : sovereignty .
The Haudenosaunee ( Iroquois Nation ) are rather unique in North American history , and consist of the Mohawk , Seneca , Oneidas , Onondagas , Cayugas , and Tuscaroras tribes , who unified into a League of Nations as early as 1450 C.E .
Their union played a pivotal role in the formation of the US Constitution .
There is a long and complicated legal history behind the status of Native American lands in the United States .
The Federal Government officially considers them to be domestic dependent nations , despite the fact that they predate the arrival of Old World populations and current American governments by thousands of years .
Since 1923 , a few Indian tribes have issue their own passports , including the Hopi , Western Shoshone , and Iroquois .
However , increasingly strict security measures enacted during the Bush administration have started to hamper the rights of North American indigenous populations to freely travel across borders .
The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative , which also forces American citizens traveling to Canada to have a US Passport to gain re-entry ( and by default , entry into Canada ) is behind this latest LaCrosse case .
This international accord requires that passports have to be scanned , something not present on Haudenosaunee documents , and no provisions were included to allow exceptions for native people .
This is not the first case where the freedom of mobility of tribes has been infringed upon by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative .
Many Native Americans who used to freely cross the Arizona border to ancestral , ceremonial , and traditional lands in Mexico are now being denied access .
Tohono O’odham elder Ofelia Rivas stated in 2007 , “ We were all born at home with a midwife , and nobody at the time recorded our births …
I have no birth certificate so how am I supposed to get a [ US ] passport ? ”
The question we are all confronted with by this latest round of travel restrictions is this : is the status of sovereignty of indigenous nations in the United States threatened ?

Police have condemned a gang of up to 15 men and women who viciously attacked two gay men in Bradford .
The victims needed hospital treatment for head injuries after being repeatedly struck with make - shift weapons their attackers had pulled from a skip in Heap Lane , Barkerend .
The gang chased and set upon the men , aged 21 and 37 , as they walked towards Bradford city centre to catch a train home to Keighley .
They were verbally abused by the group as they emerged from a shop on the corner of Heap Lane , having visited a friend in Undercliffe .
Detective Inspector Ian Bryar , of Bradford South Police , who is leading the investigation into the attack , said : “ This was an unprovoked attack on two men walking towards the city centre .
“ Because of the language used by the group towards the victims I believe that this attack was based on the men ’s sexuality and is therefore being treated as a homophobic hate crime .
“ West Yorkshire Police takes this incident very seriously and detectives are investigating this offence now .
We will not tolerate people being targeted or singled out due to their sexuality .
“ The victims are both very shocked and upset not just by their physical injuries , but emotionally too .
To be targeted in this way has left them confused and disappointed . ”
Det Insp Bryar urged anyone with any information about the attack to contact police .
He said : “ I know that one of the victims visited a shop in Heap Lane immediately before the attack .
There were many people in the shop at the time and I am appealing for these people to come forward and speak to detectives if they have any information that could help us with our inquiries . ”
Both victims were taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary .
Doctors had to use a specialist glue to treat the head wounds of one of them .
Jonathan Cookson , community development worker at Mesmac , Bradford , a hate crime reporting centre and health advice group for gay and bisexual men , said : “ Yorkshire Mesmac strongly condemns this sad , vicious attack .
We will do everything we can to stop this sort of incident from happening and to support the victims . ”
Anyone with any information about the attack , which occurred at about 7.30 pm on Thursday , should call Bradford South police via 0845 6060606 or Crimestoppers , anonymously , on 0800 555 111 .
Israel could ignite a third intifada if it continues to push its 1.2 million Arab citizens into a corner , claims Haneen Zoabi , the Arab member of the Knesset vilified for joining the Gaza aid flotilla .
Zoabi , who was branded a traitor for her participation in the Gaza convoy , warned that Israel was playing with fire .
" We accepted a democratic , liberal state , we voted for the Knesset .
But we are not just an internal issue – we are the litmus test of the whole problem .
If Israel does not recognise this , conditions will deteriorate towards a third intifada . "
But she rejected any suggestion that Israel 's Arab citizens supported violence .
Zoabi rounded on a Hamas leader for suggesting her community could be used during civil unrest as a fifth column , conducting sabotage against the Israeli state .
Mohammed Arman , a senior Hamas commander , had said , in a book smuggled out of his Israeli jail , that the role of Palestinian citizens of Israel would be to " harass the occupiers , disrupt their daily routine and undermine their confidence " .
Zoabi said : " We do n't accept that .
I do n't even like the word violent .
Israel wants us to break the law and we wo n't .
I did not break any laws by being on the Mavi Marmara " – the Turkish ship which was seized by Israeli forces as it attempted to break the siege of Gaza .
When she returned to Israel following the raid on the flotilla in which nine activists were killed , Zoabi , who represents the Arab political party Balad , faced death threats , and was jostled and sworn at in the Knesset chamber .
She was also stripped of three parliamentary privileges .
" I did not even break Knesset rules .
The result is they are trying to change the law to de-legitimise me and my people . "
Zoabi , who remains under armed protection , says that what happened to her was symptomatic of a broader campaign to undermine her community
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel says 14 bills , now working their way through the Israeli parliament , are antidemocratic .
These range from demands that Arab citizens swear loyalty to Israel as a Jewish and democratic state , to a bill threatening imprisonment or financial sanctions for marking the event Nakba ( an Arabic word connoting disaster or catastrophe , used to describe Israel 's war of independence ) with protests , and a bill that criminalises starting up or developing boycotts against Israel .
The bills appear to be the latest sign of a campaign to force Palestinians who did not flee when the state of Israel was created in 1948 to chose between their identity and their citizenship .
Zoabi said a Palestinian man 's conviction last week for " rape by deception " – after he had consensual sex with an Israeli woman who believed him to be a fellow Jew – was an example of " collective psychosis " .
She said : " Usually a regime wants to free its people from fear and hatred .
This one trades on fear and paranoia . "
When a policeman who shot a Palestinian car thief dead was this month given a three - year sentence there was such a public backlash the court took the unprecedented step of issuing a press release defending its decision .
Zoabi said that under this pressure her community , which makes up a fifth of Israel 's population , was changing from one that saw itself as fighting for its civil rights to one that was part and parcel of the Palestinian struggle .
" It took us 40 years for us to admit that we were even Palestinians .
Another 15 years passed before we realised that the peace process started under Oslo had been a disaster .
The Zionist project was to domesticate its Arab citizens as the hewers and drawers of water .
But the carrot - and - stick approach failed , and now we see Israel is prepared to throw away its liberal side to control us .
We were passive once and now we are becoming active about our national identity , " Zoabi said .
In 1999 more than 90 % of her community voted for the Israeli Labour party leader , Ehud Barak , who was to start talks with Yasser Arafat on a two - state plan .
Zoabi cites polls that say 89 % would vote for a state " for all " , the formula used by Balad for a bi-national secular state .
Her party still officially favours a two - state plan .
But Zoabi has expressed doubt that the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , could negotiate any state from Israel " bigger than a local authority " .
She said : " We did not immigrate to Israel .
Israel immigrated to us .
We are the indigenous people of a land from which we are being gradually expelled . "
• This article was amended on 27 July 2010 to give the translation for the Arabic term " Nakba " when referring to the establishment of Israel .
A life in politics
Born in Nazareth to an old and well - connected Palestinian family , Haneen Zoabi , aged 41 , read philosophy and psychology at Haifa University and became the first Arab citizen to graduate from a media studies course .
Her interest in politics was awakened by her desire to see equal rights for women .
She became the first woman to be elected to the Knesset on an Arab party 's list .
Like her party Balad she rejects the idea of Israel as a Jewish state and says this is the only way to fight the demands of the far - right foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman that Israeli Arabs take loyalty oaths .
Branded a traitor for being on the Turkish ship attacked by Israeli commandos , she said she received 300 letters of support from Israelis who backed her right to protest against the siege of Gaza .

The First American Flag Was Very British Looking
We are all familiar with the 50 stars and 13 stripes which , together , comprise the flag of the United States of America .
The United States adopted that flag , originally with 13 stars , on June 14 , 1777 .
But what did the fledgling nation -- and its band revolutionaries -- use beforehand ?
The first American flag was actually the Grand Union , pictured right .
Thirteen stripes , yes , but instead of stars , a smaller version of the British flag , the Union Flag .
( If it looks different than the British flag you 're familiar with , check out today 's bonus fact ! )
The historic underpinnings of this flag remain fuzzy and may sadly be lost to antiquity .
We do know two things :
One , no one disputes that this British - looking flag was America 's first , used at various times during the American Revolution .
Second , the flag was first adorned by the Continental Navy warship , the U.S.S. Alfred , in December of 1775 , as its official emblem , signifying its allegiance to the American colonies .
Other " facts " about the history of the Grand Union are still debated .
Most historians believe that on New Year 's Day , 1776 , George Washington flew the Grand Union at Prospect Hill , in Somerville , Massachusetts , while forming the Continental Army .
A likely apocryphal story states that the Second Continental Congress -- the body which adopted the Declaration of Independence -- adopted the Grand Union as the official emblem of the war efforts ; however , the well - maintained records of the Continental Congress are silent to anything flag related before 1777 .
Finally , some believe the Grand Union was used to demonstrate to Britain that it remained loyal to the King , in spite of their differences , but that theory is conjecture without specific evidence .
Regardless , if you see this flag flying , rest assured it is a real American flag .
Bonus fact :
The Union Flag as we know it today is actually three emblems in one , representing the patron saint of the member countries :
The Cross of Saint Andrew ( Scotland ) , the Cross of Saint Patrick ( Ireland ) , and St. George 's Cross ( England ) .
Originally -- and in 1775 , when the Grand Union emerged -- the flag only contained references to England and Scotland , signifying the union between those two kingdoms in 1603 .
It was not until 1800 , when Ireland and the UK merged , that the Cross of Saint Patrick entered the design .
Even though most of Ireland is now independent of the UK , the Cross remains in the Union Flag .
Double bonus !
The Welsh Cross of Saint David is notoriously absent in the Union Flag .
Why ?
Because when Scotland and the UK unified in 1603 , Wales was already part of the United Kingdom .
Therefore , the Union Flag , created by royal decree in 1606 , officially is considered to incorporate Wales ' presence via St. George 's Cross -- albeit controversially , even to this day .

Does your husband or wife constantly forget chores and lose track of the calendar ?
Do you sometimes feel that instead of living with a spouse , you ’re raising another child ?
Your marriage may be suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
An A.D.H.D. marriage ?
It may sound like a punch line , but the idea that attention problems can take a toll on adult relationships is getting more attention from mental health experts .
In a marriage , the common symptoms of the disorder — distraction , disorganization , forgetfulness — can easily be misinterpreted as laziness , selfishness , and a lack of love and concern .
Experts suggest that at least 4 percent of adults have the disorder , that as many as half of all children with A.D.H.D. do not fully outgrow it and continue to struggle with symptoms as adults , and that many adults with the disorder never received the diagnosis as children .
Adults with attention disorders often learn coping skills to help them stay organized and focused at work , but experts say many of them struggle at home , where their tendency to become distracted is a constant source of conflict .
Some research suggests that these adults are twice as likely to be divorced ; another study found high levels of distress in 60 percent of marriages where one spouse had the disorder .
“ Typically people do n’t realize the A.D.H.D. is impacting their marriage because there ’s been no talk about this at all , ” said Melissa Orlov , author of the book “ The A.D.H.D. Effect on Marriage , ” to be published in September .
Ms. Orlov says she began studying attention deficit ’s toll on relationships after her husband received the diagnosis about five years ago .
Although she had been working for years with Dr. Ned Hallowell , a leading researcher on the subject , Ms. Orlov had not realized that the disorder was also ruining her marriage .
“ I felt like he was consistently inconsistent , ” she said in an interview .
“ I could never count on him .
It goes from feeling responsible for everything to just chronic anger .
I did n’t like the person I ’d become either . ”
( They are now happily married , she added . )
Of course , complaints that a husband or wife is inconsiderate and inattentive , or does n’t help enough around the house , are hardly limited to marriages in which one or both partners have attention problems .
But A.D.H.D. can make matters much worse .
It can leave one spouse with 100 percent of the family responsibility , because the other spouse forgets to pick children up from school or pay bills on time .
Partners without attention problems may feel ignored or unloved when their husband or wife becomes distracted — or , in another symptom of the disorder , hyperfocused on a work project or a computer game .
They may feel they have no choice but to constantly nag to make sure things get done .
Spouses with attention deficit , meanwhile , are often unaware of their latest mistake , confused by their partner ’s simmering anger .
A lengthy to - do list or a messy house feels overwhelming to the A.D.H.D. brain , causing the person to retreat to a computer or a video game — further infuriating their spouse .
“ It ’s not because they ’re lazy or they do n’t love their spouse , but because they are distracted , ” Ms. Orlov said .
“ But if you do n’t know that distraction is the issue , you start to think the person does n’t care about you , and anger and resentment build up . ”
Although treatment often starts with medication , it typically does n’t solve a couple ’s problems .
Talk therapy may be needed to unpack years of accumulated resentments .
Behavioral therapy and coping strategies — for both partners — are essential ; for instance , Ms. Orlov would banish long to - do lists in favor of recipe cards that each contain a single task , sorted in order of priority .
It ’s a subtle switch , she says , but surprisingly effective .
One of the biggest challenges is for both spouses to accept the very real toll an attention disorder can take .
Often the partner without A.D.H.D. worries that the diagnosis will give the other partner an excuse for not helping ; meanwhile , that partner typically has a hard time understanding how his or her behavior affects others .
“ Initially I think I was a bit of a skeptic about A.D.D. in general , ” said a 52 - year - old man from Cleveland whose wife of 26 years recently received a diagnosis .
He asked that his name not be used to protect the family ’s privacy .
He described a life of “ crushing responsibility , ” of working full time , caring for his children and his wife , and maintaining the household and finances .
“ After years of this , I felt I did n’t have two children , I had three children and no one to help , ” he said .
“ I was always the one who said , ‘ No , we ca n’t do that , ’ or ‘ Get this done . ’
I had to be sort of a nag . ”
His wife ’s distractedness was particularly challenging when the children were young .
“ She could be in the room but paying no attention to what was going on , ” he said .
Traditional counseling did n’t help .
On the brink of the divorce , the wife found Ms. Orlov and Dr. Hallowell ’s Web site , adhdmarriage.com , and began consulting with Ms. Orlov .
Although the couple have only just started therapy , they are finally hopeful about their future together .
“ It ’s been a revelation , ” the wife said .
“ I did n’t realize what a critical piece the A.D.H.D. has been in my marriage . ”

Image caption The Oscar - nominated In The Loop was backed by the Film Council
The UK Film Council is to be axed as part of a cost - cutting drive by the Department for Culture , Media and Sport ( DCMS ) , it has been announced .
The organisation , founded in 2000 , had an annual budget of £ 15 m to invest in British films and employed 75 people .
Culture Secretary Jeremy
Hunt said he wanted to establish a " direct and less bureaucratic relationship with the British Film Institute " .
UK Film Council chairman Tim Bevan called it " a bad decision " .
He said the announcement was " imposed without any consultation or evaluation " .
British film , which is one of the UK's more successful growth industries , deserves better .
Tim Bevan , UK Film Council chairman
More reaction to the announcement
" People will rightly look back on today 's announcement and say it was a big mistake , driven by short - term thinking and political expediency , " he said .
The DCMS said film funding would continue but would be distributed through other bodies .
Current lottery funding for film is £ 26 million per year .
This is expected to increase to £ 32 million after 2012 .
Direct government funding , currently about £ 25 m a year , is being considered as part of the ongoing spending review .
In a statement , the DCMS said it was " clear that culture and creative industries will not be singled out as a soft target , and that the government will champion the value they bring " .
Digital screens
The Film Council was set up by the Labour government to develop and promote the British film industry .
Funded by the National Lottery , it channelled about £ 160 m into more than 900 films over the last 10 years , including Bend It Like Beckham , The Last King of Scotland and Streetdance 3D .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Film Council member Rebecca O'Brien : " It was a very sudden decision "
Other initiatives included the Digital Screen Network , which invested in 240 digital cinema screens across the UK - meaning the UK now has more digital cinemas than any other European country .
In a letter to the British film industry , John Woodward , Chief Executive of the Film Council , said he had been informed that " the target is to have the organisation totally closed down with its assets and its remaining operations transferred out by April 2012 " .
" That does , at least , give us time to honour our current commitments , " he added .
Mr Hunt said 16 public bodies , including the Museums , Libraries and Archives Council ( MLA ) would lose their funding as the government committed to " increasing the transparency and accountability of its public bodies , while at the same time reducing their number and cost " .
" Many of these bodies were set up a considerable length of time ago , and times and demands have changed , " he added .
Selected films funded by the UK Film Council Gosford Park ( 2001 )
The Constant Gardener ( 2005 )
Vera Drake ( 2004 )
This is England ( 2006 )
Man on Wire ( 2008 )
Streetdance 3D ( 2010 )
Tamara Drewe ( 2010 )
" The changes I have proposed today would help us deliver fantastic culture , media and sport , while ensuring value for money for the public and transparency about where taxpayers ' money is spent . "
Shadow Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw has accused the government cuts of being " hasty , ill thought - though and incoherent . "
He added : " The UK fllm industry has just had its best year ever , earning millions for our country , but the Government is axing the UK Film Council without saying what or who will do its important work . "
The MLA is also to be wound up by 2012 , in order to " focus efforts on front - line , essential services and ensure greater value for money " .
Responding to the announcement , chairman Sir Andrew Motion and chief executive Roy Clare have pledged to " continue to deliver a vibrant and effective expert service for the public who rightly expect excellent , sustainable museums , libraries and record offices in their local neighbourhoods .
" Stormy seas call for cool heads and steady hands , " they added .

Brain Responses to Erotic Films
A greater understanding of people different from ourselves makes for a more accepting and tolerant populace .
Are attempts to deliberately evoke disgust by the sexual practices of " others " an important and worthy step towards achieving this goal ?
Or does it further stigmatize the minority " outgroup " ?
What if the " outgroup " is disgusted by the practices of the majority ?
According to the principle of preadaptation , a system that evolves for one purpose is later used for another purpose .
From this viewpoint , disgust originates in the mammalian bitter taste rejection system , which directly activates a disgust output system .
This primal route ( e.g. , bitter and some other tastes ) evokes only the output program , without a disgust evaluation phase .
During human evolution , the disgust output system was harnessed to a disgust evaluation system that responded not to simple sensory inputs ( such as bitter tastes ) but to more cognitively elaborated appraisals ( e.g. , a cockroach ) .
...
Later , through some combination of biological and cultural evolution , the eliciting category was enlarged to include reminders of our animal nature , as wel [ sic ] as some people or social groups .
To our knowledge , there have been few studies concerning the [ sic ] disgust in homosexual men .
Whether the patterns of disgust differ between homosexual and heterosexual men is unknown .
Fig 1 (

Mean scores of the sexual films showing F–F , F–M and M–M in the two groups .
F–F and M–M stimuli induce sexual disgust , respectively .
Results of two independent samples test comparisons ( homosexual versus heterosexual ) are displayed .
Blue indicates homosexual men ; green , heterosexual men ;
less than 0.01 .
Error bars equal 1 SD .
NOTE : the level of sexual disgust was assessed by scores from 1 ( extremely high ) to 4 ( extremely low ) , and the level of sexual arousal was rated from 6 ( extremely low ) to 9 ( extremely high ) .
In the homosexual group , the F–F stimulus identified great activity in a large number of brain regions , including the left superior frontal gyrus , right and left medial frontal gyrus , left and right cerebellum , left middle occipital gyrus ( BA 19 ) , right lingual gyrus ( BA 18 ) , left precuneus , right middle temporal gyrus , left superior temporal gyrus ( BA 38 ) , left thalamus , and left supplementary motor area .
In the heterosexual group , M–M stimuli elicited great activations in the left middle frontal gyrus , right middle frontal gyrus ( BA 6 ) , left inferior frontal gyrus ( BA 45 ) , right inferior frontal gyrus ( BA 47 ) , left middle temporal gyrus , right middle temporal gyrus ( BA 37 , BA 39 ) , left superior temporal gyrus ( BA 13 ) , right superior temporal gyrus ( BA 38 ) , left inferior occipital gyrus ( BA 18 ) , bilateral caudate , bilateral thalamus , bilateral insula , left putamen , right parahippocampal gyrus , right cerebellum , right anterior cingulate ( BA 42 ) , and right amygdala .

The MPFC [ media prefrontal cortex ] engages in a number of processes , which are potentially common to various emotional tasks ( e.g. appraisal / evaluation of emotion , emotional regulation , and emotion - driven decision - making ) .
Notably , ROI analysis showed that the negative correlation was found between magnitude of MRI signals in the left media frontal gyrus and the level of disgust in homosexual men ...
[ if you believe that negative correlation ]
... Activity in this occipital region [ cuneus ] might reflect more vivid mental imagery induced by viewing disgusting stimuli , specifically when videos were watched ...
Thus , in the present study , the activation of the left cuneus in heterosexual men may reflect a combination of external viewing and internal generation of disgusting images .
Footnotes
What are the neural correlates of sexual arousal and disgust in heterosexual men and homosexual men viewing various types of porn ( Zhang et al. , 2010 ) ?
" Where can I sign up ? " you say , both as a participant and a researcher .
Or maybe you 're horrified that such an experiment would be conducted by the scientific establishment .
Pornography is a hot - button topic , and a discussion of its potential harms and merits is well beyond the scope of this post .
Disgust is considered to be one of the six basic emotions ( Ekman , 1992 ) .
Given that disgust is a response to things that are physically distasteful or morally repugnant , this emotion has been examined in a specific evolutionary framework : " from oral to moral " ( Rozin et al. , 2009 ) :
In a rationale that is simple yet puzzling , Zhang et al. wished to see if the brains of gay men process disgust in a different manner from those of straight men .
The participants were 16 heterosexual and 16 homosexual men ( as identified by self - report ) .
Bisexuals were excluded .
The stimuli were 3 minute long film clips depicting explicit sexual activity between two men ( M - M ) , two women ( F - F ) , or a woman and a man ( F - M ) .
" Each type of erotic film was montaged with attractive short films . "
Subjects passively watched the films during scanning , then rated their levels of sexual arousal and sexual disgust after the fMRI portion had finished ( shown below ) .
the asterisk , It was no surprise to anyone that straight men were most turned on by F - M film clips and turned off by the M - M films .
Straight guys were also a bit turned on by F - F ( also not surprising given the popularity of girl - on - girl p0rn ) , although there was a great deal of variability .
Also as expected , gay men were most aroused by M - M films .
They rated their disgust as highest for F - F clips but were close to neutral for heterosexual p0rn ( interestingly ) .
The neuroimaging data were analyzed using Disgust versus Rest as the comparison of interest .
OK , so that 's a bunch of areas that are activated relative to doing nothing ( instead of relative to watching a neutral film ) .
I wo n't try to interpret those results .
How about comparing the Disgust vs. Rest responses of the gay and straight men ?
There was one region of the brain more active in each of the groups : left ventromedial prefrontal cortex for gay men ( Fig. 4 ) , and left cuneus for straight men ( Fig. 5 ) .
Why ??
What does it mean ?
Why were the gay men better able to downregulate their emotional responses to unpleasant p0rn ?
Why would the heterosexual males engage imagery processes to a greater extent than homosexual males when viewing sexual acts they find distasteful ?
( as suggested by the authors suggest below ) .
In the absence of a full report on the data that includes additional comparisons ( disgusting versus neutral and arousing films ) , I 'll refrain from commenting further .
Perhaps other published studies will be able to shed light on the matter , as we 'll see in the next post .
For further reading ( and a range of viewpoints ) , see the following :

Finally , anything by Dr Petra on the topic would be recommended ... Although not explicitly stated , it seems that they wanted to determine whether gay men respond more like straight men or straight women , since the latter have stronger reactions to disgust .
Therefore , the gay men in this study weredisgusted by the practices of the majority .

House Democrats today tried to repeal the new Form 1099 requirements set to go into effect in 2012 as part of the health care reform law .
Republicans , however , objected to the way the bill was introduced and how the majority party planned to pay for the change .
The provision in question would require businesses to file a Form 1099 with the IRS to for each supplier or service provider to which they make payments of more than $ 600 in a single year .
While Republicans have introduced bills in both the House and Senate to repeal the new 1099 filings , Democrats in the House tried to do just that late Friday afternoon .
They failed .
As introduced , the measure required a two - thirds vote to pass the House .
It fell short , garnering 241 yea votes and 154 nay votes .
All of the no votes were cast by Republicans and a lone Democrat .
Two Republicans voted for the bill .
GOP members opposed the Democratic repeal effort on two grounds .
The main Republican objection was foreign tax law changes -- including the prevention of splitting of foreign tax credits ( FTC ) from income , prohibition on taxpayers from claiming a credit for foreign income that is never subject to U.S. taxation because of a covered asset acquisition and repeal of the 80/20 rules -- that Democrats wanted to use to offset the estimated $ 19 billion that the added Form 1099 filings are projected to produce .
In addition to having issues with the offsets , Republicans were angered by the way the bill was introduced by the majority party .
Earlier , Democrats had postponed a vote on a Republican motion to repeal the IRS reporting rule .
While Friday 's vote looks like more political posturing in advance of the midterm elections , the vote at least was an indication that the added 1099 rule is becoming universally unpopular on Capitol Hill .
That bodes well for its eventual removal before it takes effect in just over a year and a half .
You can read more on the vote in the Wall Street Journal , the Hill 's On the Money blog and the Washington Post .

Shadow of the Vampire is a film about the making of a German all time classic silent horror - movie from 1922 called Nosferatu - Eine Symphonie des Grauens ( Nosferatu - a Symphony of Horror ) .
The production of Nosferatu had to deal with a lot of strange things ( some crew members disappeared , some died ) .
This movie focuses on the difficult relationship between Murnau , the director , and Schreck , the lead actor .

Inspired by an article he read about abandoned diamond mines in Namibia , photographer lvaro Snchez - Montas wanted to learn more .
In his magazine he had only stumbled across one picture of Kolmanskop , a now ghost town in southern Namibia that had once been a rich mining village .
Online he found a treasure trove of interesting photos and at that moment promised himself that he would one day experience the Namib desert for himself .
He would see with his very own eyes how the desert sands ' had reclaimed its space .
When he got there , he found “ the beauty in the abandoned , of the useless , of the time passing by . ”
Left at the mercy of the Namib desert , the winds had filled the rooms of the deserted buildings with sand .
The diamond village that had once been thriving was now more like a surreal dream .

Now scientists using the Spitzer Space Telescope ( and possibly the Schwartz ) have discovered real spaceballs , aka buckyballs , the mysterious form of pure carbon they 've sought in space for some 40 years , according to a new study .
Sporting a soccer ball - like pattern , a buckyball is a molecule whose 60 carbon atoms form a stable , hollow sphere .
Even at just a billionth of a meter wide , it 's the largest type of molecule yet seen in space .
Buckyballs are the spherical versions of so - called fullerene carbon molecules , which were first theorized in 1970 .
The molecules were first spotted in a laboratory in 1985 during experiments that simulated the atmospheric conditions of carbon - rich , aging stars .
The molecules ' discoverers named buckyballs after architect Buckminster Fuller , because the molecules resemble his geodesic domes ( geodesic dome picture ) .
The find - a previously unknown form of pure carbon - earned the team a Nobel Prize .
( The element 's two previously known pure forms are graphite and diamond . )
Buckyballs have since been found in meteorites , Earth rocks , and candle soot .
Nanotechnologists have stretched them into strong , light carbon nanotubes used in bike frames and tennis rackets .
And now scientists are eyeing the molecules for superconducting materials and drug delivery .
But for decades the pure carbon spheres remained elusive in one of the places they were most expected : space .
" We 've been suspecting buckyballs existed in space , primarily based on the fact that these are some of the most stable and durable materials that we know on Earth , " said study leader Jan Cami , an astronomer with the University of Western Ontario , Canada .
" But up to now we had n't found evidence for them . "
( Read more space news and views at National Geographic 's Breaking Orbit blog . )
Largest Molecules Found in Nebula
The team finally found its evidence in a planetary nebula called Tc - 1 .
A planetary nebula is an interstellar gas and dust cloud left behind after a sunlike star has died .
Tc - 1 is remarkably hydrogen poor - a condition necessary for buckyballs but rare in our hydrogen - rich universe .
Hydrogen tends to bond with carbon atoms , so an abundance of hydrogen would prevent buckyballs from forming .
The star that formed this planetary nebula shed its hydrogen envelope many thousands of years ago .
But it took a recent event - the peculiar ejection of some remnant carbon - for buckyball molecules to assemble .
It also took a bit of luck for Cami and colleagues to spot them .
Spitzer detected infrared light from the molecules because their current temperature is ideal - it 's been a hundred years since the star ejected carbon , and the buckyballs are now at about room temperature .
Just a century from now , Cami said , the molecules will have drifted farther from the star and become too cool for the infrared space telescope to see .
Largest Molecules in Space to Advance Cosmic Knowledge
The buckyball discovery , Cami said , should advance our understanding of the chemistry of interstellar space .
Of particular interest is the problem of diffuse interstellar bands , a series of mysterious lines in the light spectra of astronomical objects .
Breaking up the light from a star , for instance , into its rainbow - like spectrum can tell scientists what kinds of chemicals exist in the star 's atmosphere , based on the unique wavelengths different molecules tend to absorb .
The interstellar bands are caused by other material absorbing some light from an object before the light reaches Earth .
Scientists have hotly debated what kinds of molecules are responsible for these bands , which have become one of the greatest mysteries in cosmic spectroscopy .
But buckyballs could hold the answer .
" Now that we know buckyballs exist in space , " Cami said , " we may settle whether or not they are important for this problem . "
With the big E3 Expo set to kick off in just four days , we must admit to being more than a little intrigued at finding a new PS3 model bumble its way out of the FCC test labs .
PlayStation 3 models CECH - 2501A and CECH - 2501B are both certified for 802.11b/g WiFi and Bluetooth 2.0+EDR differing only in hard disk drive configurations .
We 're also seeing a pair of PS3 DECH - 2500A and DECH - S2500A debugging stations -- interesting since a debug unit is typically only required when there 's been a change in the chips on the motherboard .
Feel free to speculate as we prepare for E3 to kick off on June 15th .
The federal government will introduce a bill Tuesday to strip retirement benefits from serial killer Clifford Olson and hundreds of other federal inmates .
The bill comes out of a review ordered by Prime Minister Stephen Harper into reports that Olson receives $ 1,100 a month from Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement .
The two benefits programs are intended to raise the standard of living for the nation 's poorest seniors .
Olson and other retirement - aged inmates who receive no other income are currently entitled to access the programs .
Clifford Olson , left , leaves a B.C. provincial court in 1981 .
Reports suggest the convicted killer receives $ 1,100 a month in retirement benefits .
( ( Nick Didlick / UPC/ Canadian Press ) )
Sources told the CBC that Human Resources Minister Diane Finley will table the proposed legislation in the House of Commons .
It will affect about 400 federal inmates aged 65 or older who receive payments from these programs .
The bill urges provinces to follow the federal government 's lead .
If the provinces agree , another 600 inmates in provincial jails will lose their benefits .
Finley is expected to say inmates already have their basic needs looked after by the state and therefore do n't need the benefits .
Sources say the change would save $ 2 million a year , and $ 10 million dollars each year if the provinces sign on .
Olson , 70 , killed 11 boys and girls in British Columbia before he was sentenced to life in prison in 1982 .
Olson , who has never shown remorse for his crimes , is serving 11 consecutive life sentences in a maximum security prison in Quebec .
His retirement benefit money has been put in trust .
He was also paid $ 100,000 by the RCMP to lead them to the bodies of his victims .
That money was put in trust for his estranged wife and son .

The largest U.S. websites are installing new and intrusive consumer - tracking technologies on the computers of people visiting their sites — in some cases , more than 100 tracking tools at a time — a Wall Street Journal investigation has found .
The tracking files represent the leading edge of a lightly regulated , emerging industry of data - gatherers who are in effect establishing a new business model for the Internet : one based on intensive surveillance of people to sell data about , and predictions of , their interests and activities , in real time .
The Journal 's study shows the extent to which Web users are in effect exchanging personal data for the broad access to information and services that is a defining feature of the Internet .
In an effort to quantify the reach and sophistication of the tracking industry , the Journal examined the 50 most popular websites in the U.S. to measure the quantity and capabilities of the " cookies , " " beacons " and other trackers installed on a visitor 's computer by each site .
Together , the 50 sites account for roughly 40 % of U.S. page - views .
' The Most Dangerous Philosopher in the West ' Welcome to the Slavoj Zizek Show
In the midst of a crisis of capitalism , the Western underground is rediscovering communism .
Its star is the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek , who mixes Marxism with pop culture and psychoanalysis .
His appearances offer stand - up comedy for a radical leftist avant - garde .
An anti-piracy group has revealed that when it comes to shutting down torrent sites , it is the undisputed king of the Internet .
BREIN , which works on behalf of the Hollywood movie studios , says that not only has it shut down several Usenet indexers and streaming sites already in 2010 , but hundreds of torrent sites too .
There is torrent site carnage going on in The Netherlands and we 've failed to report on any of it .
When it comes to reporting on BitTorrent - related news and issues , we try our very best to cover every angle here at TorrentFreak .
Admittedly we can’t cover everything and sometimes it ’s hard to constantly turn out positive articles which fill our readers with optimism that the Internet is n’t about to taken over by evil corporate entities hell - bent on web - wide file - sharing destruction .
Today , however , we have a big apology to make .
We ’ve let you all down and we ’ve let ourselves down too by completely missing one of the biggest developing stories the BitTorrent world has ever known .
We ’ve totally neglected to cover what can only be described as a wholesale slaughter of file - sharing venues in The Netherlands , and for this we wholeheartedly apologize .
Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN , who have previously given Mininova , The Pirate Bay , Demonoid and What.cd a hard time in varying degrees , have been busy .
And when we say busy , we are n’t messing around .
During the last few months it ’s up for debate whether the group ’s staff have had time to sleep .
If they ’ve even stopped to eat it would be , frankly , somewhat of a surprise .
According to BREIN , which works mainly on behalf of the Hollywood studios but has branched out to work for other rights holders in recent times , during the first half of 2010 it shut down a staggering 422 “ illegal websites ” .
While the whole world was focused on the U.S. Government taking down less than 10 sites this year but making a huge song and dance about it , BREIN was quietly showing them how it ’s really done .
In addition to 5 Usenet indexers , 6 streaming sites , a FTP server , and 29 sites linking to material on one - click hosters , this most prolific and apparently effective of anti-piracy groups took down 384 torrent sites in the last 6 months .
That ’s more than 2 torrent sites culled every day this year and we ’ve failed to report on just about every one of them .
In an attempt to fill this gap , Torrent Freak contacted BREIN boss Tim Kuik for information but we did n’t do very well at all .
We were told that they are n’t releasing the URLs of the sites since they only detail those that they take to court and naming them would only give them increased traction and popularity .
We also tried to find out their names through our own network but yet again we failed miserably .
For this we apologize .
A bloodbath going on under our noses , in our own community , we did n’t even notice and we still can’t give you details since it appears all the corpses have been buried in unmarked graves surrounded by a wall of silence .
The worst part is that this failing on our part is nothing new .
All the signs were there a few months ago that BREIN was capable of carrying out yet another massacre in 2010 , just as they did last year .
In 2009 , BREIN said it shut down 35 eD2 K servers , 38 streaming video sites and 14 Usenet portals / NZB sites .
It also took responsibility for the destruction of an unprecedented 393 BitTorrent sites .
We did n’t notice , but strangely neither did anyone else .
So what were we able to find out about the closures ?
“ The take down most often takes place through the hosting provider , ” Kuik told Torrent Freak .
“ We also obtain identity details from the hosting providers but these sites tend to register under a false name .
If the site changes to another hosting provider , we will contact that provider .
In case all else fails we will go for blocking of the site by access providers .
Currently there is court case pending about that . ”
If BREIN is allowed to continue this rampage there wo n’t be any torrent sites left by 2012 and we ’ll be left with literally nothing to report on .
Torrent Freak will die , but really we only have ourselves to blame .
Nearly 800 torrent sites gone already and not a whisper from us ?
A shameful performance .
We ’ll try to improve , for all our sakes .
Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman has apparently turned down a one million - dollar prize which he was awarded in March by the Clay Mathematics Institute .
Perelman was awarded one of seven million dollar prizes for solving a " millennium " problem -- the Poincaire conjecture -- which had been puzzling mathematicians for about one hundred years .
The problem -- which was a theorem about the governing the properties of three - dimensional spheres -- was one of the most important questions in topology before being solved .
While this is not the first time he 's turned down a prize , Perelman has seemingly rejected this one because he disagrees with the " organized mathematical community . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seeing things .
The Hill , a newspaper covering Congress , reports that she has " seized on new polls that suggest healthcare overhaul 's popularity is rising , and is urging members of Congress to use this week 's recess to tout the new law . "
Ms. Pelosi's may be counting a phantom army of health care supporters .
While she cites a Kaiser Family Foundation survey from last month that found 48 % of respondents viewed ObamaCare favorably , other polls tell a different story .
Rasmussen Reports found 60 % of ...
After the U.S. Government took action against several sites connected to movie streaming recently , nerves are jangling over the possibility that this is just the beginning of a wider crackdown .
Now it appears that a free blogging platform has been taken down by its hosting provider on orders from the U.S. authorities on grounds of " a history of abuse " .
More than 73,000 blogs are out of action as a result .
Hot on the heels of recent threats from Vice President Joe Biden and Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator Victoria Espinel directed at sites offering unauthorized movies and music , last month U.S. authorities targeted several sites they claimed were connected to the streaming of infringing video material .
‘ Operation In Our Sites ‘ targeted several sites including TVShack.net , Movies - Links .
TV , FilesPump.com , Now -Movies.com , PlanetMoviez.com , ThePirateCity.org , ZML.com , NinjaVideo.net and NinjaThis.net .
In almost unprecedented action , the domain names of 7 sites were seized and indications are that others – The Pirate Bay and MegaUpload – narrowly avoided the same fate .
Fears remain , however , that this action is only the beginning , and that more sites will be targeted as the months roll on .
Indeed , TorrentFreak has already received information that other sites , so far unnamed in the media , are being monitored by the authorities on copyright grounds .
Now , according to the owner of a free WordPress platform which hosts more than 73,000 blogs , his network of sites has been completely shut down on the orders of the authorities .
Blogetery.com has been with host BurstNet for 7 months but on Friday July 9th the site disappeared .
The following Monday the owner received an email from BurstNet :
Due to the history of abuse and on going abuse on this ‘ bn.***********’ server .
We have opted to terminate this server , effective immediately .
This termination applies to : bn.affiliateplex.com
Abuse Department
BurstNET
Technologies , Inc
Further correspondence received the following response :
Bn.xx*********** was terminated by request of law enforcement officials , due to material hosted on the server .
We are limited as to the details we can provide to you , but note that this was a critical matter and the only available option to us was to immediately deactivate the server .
… and a later clarification :
Please note that this was not a typical case , in which suspension and notification would be the norm .
This was a critical matter brought to our attention by law enforcement officials .
We had to immediately remove the server .
“ We notified him [ the Blogetery owner ] when we terminated it [ the server ] , and we refunded him his money to his account , because he has other servers with us
If he wants the refund to his card , we can easily do that .
However , it should be the least of his concerns , ” A BurstNet representative later confirmed .
“ Simply put :
We cannot give him his data nor can we provide any other details .
By stating this , most would recognize that something serious is afoot . ”
Due to the fact that the authorities are n’t sharing information and BurstNet are sworn to secrecy , it is proving almost impossible to confirm the exact reason why Blogetery has been completely taken down .
The owner does , however , admit to handling many copyright - related cease and desists in the past , albeit in a timely manner as the DMCA requires .
Nevertheless , a couple of quick Google searches which are likely to turn up blogs which link to copyright material appear to do just that – here , here and here .
That said , on any network this large this type of activity is bound to happen .
Many thousands of blogs on the same platform would have been perfectly legal .
“ All of the users are without service just like when the Pirate Bay raids happened and all the people who were on the host sites were also taken down , ” pointed out an annoyed Blogetery user who contacted TorrentFreak .
“ I have lost my personal site also and I do n’t have any way to contact the owner since his contact info was on the blogetery .com site & that was the only way to contact him . ”
Indeed , 73,000 blogs is a significant number to take down in one swoop , regardless of what some users of the site may or may not have been doing .
Time will tell if it was indeed a copyright complaint that took down the service but the signs are certainly there .
Not so long ago the conclusion that this type of action could be taken on copyright grounds would have been dismissed out of hand , but the current atmosphere seems to be changing .
Update : Apparently there was “ terrorist material ” hosted on one of the blogs .
You want a quiet PC , and you 're not alone .
We all know that .
But if you 're seriously considering a Hush , that DVR - centric passively - cooled computer we told you about before , you may be alone afterall ( but only in terms of income bracket ) .
If you 're ready to shell out over three k for one of those solid - aluminum monsters , TrustedReviews is there to tell you all about what a feature - ridden AV beast it is , what with the S - Video and composite in and out , D - Sub , DVI , 7.1 - channel surround , 2.8GHz Pentium 4 , DVD - writer and all the fixin's .

Enlarge By Patrick Semansky , AP Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano and Adm. Thad Allen discuss oil spill cleanup as storms loom .
CONTAINMENT EFFORTS CONTAINMENT
EFFORTS SHUTTING DOWN THE WELL SHUTTING DOWN THE WELL CLICK HERE to see how the cap and relief well work to stop the oil flow .
BP has spent $ 2.65 billion in its effort to cap a gushing oil well and clean up a growing slick in the Gulf of Mexico , the company reported Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Drilling of a relief well , intended to interrupt oil flow from the ruptured well , reached 16,770 feet , 1,230 feet shy of the goal , BP said Monday .
But drilling has slowed as engineers perform tests to determine the precise location of the damaged well .
The relief well will intercept the original well at 18,000 feet and is scheduled to be complete in mid-August .
MASTER OF MEDIATION : Feinberg at helm of oil fund
BP is capturing nearly 1 million gallons of oil a day in two containment systems .
The company has begun installing a third system that could double the amount of oil captured by the first two systems .
The new system could be disconnected quickly if a hurricane approaches , the company said .
The current system requires five days to disconnect , said Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the federal government 's incident commander .
FULL COVERAGE :
The latest on the oil spill
The new system may be delayed by choppy seas , Allen said .
So far , the water is calm enough to proceed , he said .
Tropical Storm Alex , which is moving over Mexico toward Texas , has churned up the water in the Gulf , Allen said .
Meanwhile , huge slicks of oil moved toward the Gulf shore .
" We have seen the oil change direction , " Allen said Monday .
The oil , which had been heading east toward Florida , is now entering the Mississippi Sound and Louisiana 's Chandeleur Islands , he said .
Mississippi reported tar balls on several of its beaches , including Belle Fontaine beach , the mouth of the Davis Bayou and Deer Island in Jackson County .
Gulfport , Miss. , expects oil to come ashore today , city spokesman Ryan LaFontaine said .
The city has asked federal and state authorities for permission to use absorbent boom to protect inland waterways and harbors , he said .
The federal government late Monday expanded the area of the Gulf closed to fishing from 78,597 square miles to 80,228 square miles .
About a third of the Gulf is closed to fishing .
Fishing waters are closed from the Port of Gulfport east to the county line , LaFontaine said .
" The timing of this could not be worse , " LaFontaine said .
The city 's 62nd Annual Mississippi Deep Sea Fishing Rodeo begins Thursday .
Although the carnival will go on as planned , fishing will be limited , he said .
" It 's hard to have a fishing rodeo if you can't fish , " LaFontaine said .
Laki velvoittaisi operaattorit ilmoittamaan asiakkaille , jos nämä lataavat verkosta laitonta sisältöä .
Vastaavat lait on jo säädetty muutamissa maissa , kuten Britanniassa ja Ranskassa .
Vuosittain arviolta 200 000 suomalaista lataa verkosta laittomasti elokuvia ja musiikkia , mutta viranomaisten kynnys puuttua asiaan on ollut korkea .
Rangaistukset puuttuvat
Kaavaillun lain ongelmana pidetään sitä , että siihen ei sisälly mekanismia , jonka avulla voisi selvittää , onko varoitus nettilataajalle ensimmäinen vai viideskymmenes .
Myös rangaistuksen tuoma peloite puuttuu .
- Se ongelma on siinä , että tässä mallissa ei ole mitään seuraamuksia .
Voi olla että kotitalouteen tulee kymmenen kirjettä luvattomasta nettijakamisesta ja siinä kaikki .
Tällainen malli olisi meidän mielestämme tehoton , sanoo Tekijänoikeuden tiedotus - ja valvontakeskuksen toiminnanjohtaja Antti Kotilainen .
- En usko että se vaikuttaa mitään .
Lähetellään kirjeitä , joista ei seuraa mitään , niitä saa ropista postiluukusta niin paljon kuin huvittaa , ja mitään se ei aiheuta , komppaa Piraattipuolueen puheenjohtaja Pasi Palmulehto .
Piraattipuolue haluaisi ratkaista asian niin , että yksityinen kopiointi laillistettaisiin kokonaan .
Tekijänoikeusjärjestöt puolestaan vaativat sellaista mallia , jossa muusikot , näyttelijät ja muut luovan alan ammattilaiset saisivat nykyistä varmemmin korvauksen työstään .
Tarvittaessa lain rikkojalta katkaistaisiin nettiyhteys ja laittomasti saatu hyöty perittäisiin takaisin .
Riski on olematon
Tällä hetkellä jopa sadattuhannet suomalaiset rikkovat lakia lataamalla korvauksetta internetistä musiikkia ja elokuvia , mutta korvausvaatimuksia esitetään vain satakunta vuodessa .
Tuotteiden saaminen ilmaiseksi on helppoa ja kiinnijäämisen riski olematon .
- Tällä hetkellä laiton ilmainen nettilataaminen on niin houkuttelevaa , että näillä laillisilla kauppapaikoilla ei toimintaedellytykset ole kunnossa , Kotilainen sanoo .
Kyse ei ole nappikaupasta , sillä teleoperaattorit Elisa ja Sonera arvioivat , että noin kolmasosa Suomen koko verkkoliikenteestä on laitonta elokuvien latausta .
Kun tähän lisätään musiikkilataukset , arvio laittoman liikenteen osuudesta nousee yli viidenkymmenen prosentin .
Kotilaisen mukaan lakia tulee tiukentaa , koska tappiot suomalaisille tekijöille ovat vuositasolla yli 300 miljoonaa euroa .
Palmulehdon mukaan lakia tulee lieventää , koska lataaminen on niin yleistä , että nykylainkin mukaan suurin osa nuorisosta voitaisiin tuomita tekijänoikeusrikoksista .
Opetusministeriössä valmisteltu lakimuutos on juuri ollut lausuntokierroksella , ja sen työstäminen jatkuu kesälomien jälkeen .
Lain on tarkoitus tulla voimaan vielä tänä vuonna .

This Is Why It ’s Good That It ’s Hard To Amend The Constitution
A new poll shows that Americans have some odd ideas about the Constitution , and how to change it .
Doug Mataconis · · 38 comments
A poll conducted in connection with the recently concluded Aspen Institute conference shows that Americans have some rather alarming ideas about what should be done with the Constitution :
By a margin of 6 to 1 ( 61 to 10 percent ) Americans believe that the Constitution should safeguard even more rights , and name gender equality as the right most deserving of constitutional protection .
Majorities support guarantees of equality , of the right to privacy , of the right to own property and even the right to an education .
55 percent support the right to equality regardless of sexual orientation while 47 percent thinks the right to healthcare should be constitutionally protected as well .
(…)
When it comes to fixing to the system , voters zero in on the judiciary branch as most ripe for extensive changes .
69 percent call for a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices and 66 percent favor term limits .
Most significantly , by a margin of 51 to 34 the public favors popular election of Supreme Court justices , which follows the recent trend in some states that have chosen to elect their top justices .
It is the most dramatic change to the system that the poll respondents favor .
74 percent agree it is time to abolish the Electoral College and have direct popular vote for the president .
The public also favors by 49 to 41 holding national referenda for constitutional amendments .
As Matthew Yglesias notes , the idea of electing Supreme Court Justices is simply a horrible one .
If there is one institution that should be insulated from the will of the majority as much as possible , it ’s the Judiciary , and the the experience of states that do popularly elect Judges ( as well as the political circus that breaks out each time there ’s a Supreme Court nomination ) makes it clear that such a system would be an utter disaster at the national level .
As for the retirement age and term limits ideas , they do have merit but the lifetime tenure that the Founders put in the Constitution is in there for a reason ; not only to shield judges from political pressure , but also to provide for a measure of consistency in the law .
In the grand scheme of things , I do n’t think that lifetime tenure imposes sufficient costs to be done away with .
As for elimination of the Electoral College , the primary result of that “ reform ” would be that Presidential candidates would concentrate their campaigns in high population states like Texas , California , Florida , and New York and ignore smaller states and smaller venues .
Moreover , direct popular election would potentially make election outcomes less certain by nationalizing vote - count errors and fraud allegations .
In a close election , the fate of the Presidency could be in doubt for months , and while we may have been able to afford that luxury in 1800 , we ca n’t afford it today .
Instead of eliminating the Electoral College , it would be far preferable to reform it by adopting the District Method :
This method divides electoral votes by district , allocating one vote to each district and using the remaining two as a bonus for the statewide popular vote winner .
This method of distribution has been used in Maine since 1972 and Nebraska since 1996 , though neither state has had a statewide winner that has not swept all of the Congressional districts as well .
Consequently , neither state has ever spilt its electoral votes .
Though I personally do n’t think that the current Presidential election system is as bad as people make it out to be , the District method not only makes sense , but would also make Presidential elections more of a nationwide phenomenon than they are today .
Rather than ignoring a state entirely because it so heavily favors their opponent , candidates would have an incentive to concentrate on areas of the state where they would be able to win one , or more , Congressional Districts and thus pick up an Electoral Vote or two that could make the difference in the election .
And the final idea , amending the Constitution by national referendum , is perhaps the most misguided idea of all .
The Founders made the Constitution difficult to amend for a reason , and most of them can be found in the results of this poll and the desires of a majority of respondents to make things like education and health care a Constitutional “ right . ”

Do you guys remember back when Chloe drew a pretty little picture of a Catcake ?
Or a Cupcat ?
Well NPC reader Melvin does .
I was delighted to find these pictures in my inbox yesterday .
He had the folks at Beaverton Bakery make these based on the drawing .
I love how he placed them on the laptop .
🙂
Next best thing to an iPad ?
I ’m very impressed at how closely they resemble the original drawing .
I hope they were delicious !
Thanks very much Melvin !
LAME “ LEAK ” SITE NOTHING MORE THAN THIN COVER FOR “ THE TEL AVIV TANGO ”
By Gordon Duff STAFF WRITER / Senior Editor
Now “ Wiki - Leaks ” is busy selling phony bin Laden stories , having the long dead Osama humiliating the CIA by running around villages in Afghanistan selling vacuum cleaners .
What is our “ leak ” site really about ?
This is a dead news cycle .
The World Cup is over , lots of people on holiday and no major stories .
Only in a dead news period like this , as Oliver Stone pointed out , could the Israeli controlled media dump a pile of lame rumors mixed in with box loads of chickenfeed , passing it off as the story of the century .
Even the cover story , the mysterious Assange fleeing the murderous CIA , working to save the world is lame .
WikiLeaks is lame .
Please , everyone , go to the site and read everything there .
I have seen more confidential information on a weather report .
Assange is hardly a James Bond figure .
Woody Allen is masculine in comparison .
Journalists all get leaks , and frankly , we do n’t print most of them .
Some we ca n’t trust .
Some are just too dangerous .
Some are simply illegal .
Some are blatantly self serving Israeli propaganda coated with a veneer of anti-Americanism .
This is “ Wiki - leaks ” material .
What is important is what they do n’t print .
The only things that come out about Israel , the country most vulnerable to leaks , the country always up to the most skulduggery , is an occasional harmless story like their major leak on East Jerusalem settlements .
It hit the New York Times first .
When you read Mr. Assange ’s output , you are looking at one of the Mossad games , nothing more .
They send some stories to Fox News , some to CNN , some to the Washington Post or London Times .
They have their pick as their friends and co-workers own those outlets and so many more .
The game today is using Wikileaks , given its 15 minutes of fame for trashing the US in Iraq with the helicopter video , to spread imaginary stories about Pakistan , the only nuclear power in the Middle East capable of standing up to Israel and the enemy of India .
India is what it is all really about .
Israel is playing India for a fall , drawing them into their games they way they did with the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan .
India will wake up with their government bought off , blackmailed , up to their neck in wars and insurgencies at home and fighting Israel ’s enemies abroad .
India is the next real target for rape , destruction , destabilization by Israel and our “ Wiki - leak ” is part of that game .
Another chosen victim , of course , is the United States , hated enemy of Israel , not for public consumption , however .
Check the names of those who looted the American economy .
In the top dresser drawer of 80 % of those who took the US into bankruptcy , you will find an Israeli passport .
Did anyone ask why nothing was reported in 90,000 pages regarding the massive drug dealing in Afghanistan ?
With stories in the press around the world reporting that President Karzai and his brother are the biggest druglords in the world , why would this not be mentioned ?
Is it because Karzai is a good friend of the Indo - Israeli alliance that runs Wiki - leaks ?
Classified Army documents are filled to the brim with reports that the CIA and their private contractors are involved in drug operations with Karzai but also other names are named including many prominent Americans , some members of congress .
I wo n’t leak their names but I know they are in the documents .
If Wiki got what they say they got , then most of their documents would have reported corruption , drug dealing , governments of a dozen countries would have been mentioned .
If real leaks were made public and we did something about it , first by arresting the gangsters and spies filling congress , the White House and every federal agency , we might balance our budget but who would be left to do the Sunday morning talk shows ?
If you want the names of those who would really be on leaked documents , check your TV listings .
It is n’t a coincidence .
Those chosen to lie on television are also being paid for other duties as well .
Israel would have been cited for laundering drug money for the Taliban .
It is in the documents .
I did n’t release them .
That is illegal .
BG Asif Haroon Raja of Pakistan , former Attache to Egypt and respected intelligence analyst had the following to say about the Wiki barrage :
“ Unsubstantiated and fabricated allegations against Pakistan and its premier institutions are so absurd and decayed that it gives nausea to the reader .
Only ones who enjoy the stale jokes are its manufacturers or the game players .
ISI - Taliban closeness has been drummed up in such a manner as if it is the biggest sin ever committed .
Each time it is presented with a new flavor to make it look more breathtaking .
This unholy practice has been going on systematically and incessantly for the last six years to condition the minds of the world audience and to convert falsehood into truth .
Story of this nature is routinely published in western media every fortnightly .
In the last few months write ups on this subject have suddenly gained impetus .
Previously , accusations were in the form of allegations made by newspapers and think tanks .
Now top US civil and military officials have jumped into the arena with loins girded up and have started using high handed tactics openly without caring for diplomatic decorum .
Propaganda assault together with verbal assaults by visiting officials and drone attacks have become a norm .
They have become xenophobic and overbearing .
This can be gauged from the mood of the three US visitors who visited Islamabad recently .
Prickly Hillary Clinton can see ghost of Osama sauntering in Pakistan each time she lands in Pakistan .
Through her lens she sees ISI in cahoots with Taliban .
She again reminded our harried rulers that any attack on US homeland with connection to Pakistan would have devastating consequences upon Pak - US relations .
She conceitedly dangled few carrots to make them do more .
Grim looking Holbrooke and tense ridden Adm. Mike Mullen harbored similar ideas .
The trio wanted Pak Army to cut off its entire links with Taliban , consider Indians as friends and to promptly launch an operation in North Waziristan to chase out Haqqani network and Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) , the two outfits most dreaded by USA .
LeT has been put on the hit list to please India .
Wikileaks is a follow up of London Report and some of the objectives behind it are to keep Pakistan pressured and cornered , authenticate Indian allegations about ISI ’s involvement in various acts of terror in Afghanistan , demonise LeT and defame ISI , exert pressure on Obama Administration to affect a change in its policy of softness towards Pakistan , reconciliation with Taliban and withdrawal of coalition forces .
India together with Northern Alliance and pro-war American senior officials are possibly behind the Wikileaks scandal .
This report is less harmful for Pakistan and more injurious for USA since source reports on Pakistan mostly provided by RAAM and RAW agents were never taken seriously by the receivers .
Receiving officers have been noting their remarks on such reports as lacking in authenticity , biased and devoid of credibility .
Moreover , such manipulated leakages would further widen rather than build trust gap between USA and Pakistan . ”
When Joe Biden and General Petraeus both reported that Israel was endangering American troops , the classified portion of this involved Israeli operations in Afghanistan , which are extensive .
Why would General Petraeus have gone to congress about Israel if he did n’t have documents ?
We could n’t manage to leak those also ?
They are all over Washington , anyone could pick them up .
They just do n’t .
Ask Oliver Stone why .
Hundreds of pages of reports of Israeli and Indian operatives in Pakistan ’s region called Baluchistan were tossed out also .
Their involvement in terrorism , not only against Iran but working directly with the Taliban in Pakistan was there but not included .
So much was n’t included .
Nothing involving drug flights being serviced by Israeli companies was released .
It was in the files .
If we really want to leak things , they are out there .
It can get bloody .
Wikileaks leaves a trail of stench from Mr. Assange right to Tel Aviv .
If anyone could n’t see it , the corporate press or the Israeli press or the Zionist press or whatever the current buzz word is for the useless press , they put you on the path .
They are the ones putting a spotlight on the disinformation and failing miserably to note how obviously the leaks have been edited to serve Israeli games .
Wikileaks is Israel .
Assange works for them , I hope not unwittingly .
I hate it when people are duped .
I would rather he were paid or being blackmailed .
I always want the useless to be rewarded in this life because , just in case their is another one after this , they know what they can expect there .
It wo n’t be pleasant .
I did n’t want to write this , add to the problem .
Even negative publicity is publicity .
Every time I am attacked , my readership goes up dramatically .
It almost encourages one to be abrasive and unnecessarily controversial , like with Fox News .
Let ’s cut this short .
Wikileaks is simply another ploy by the ultra powerful Israel lobby , a cheap game meant to humiliate the United States , destroy Pakistan and build a reputation for a puppet .
I suspect it will fail .
I hope this effort is useful in that endeavor .

The agency in charge of the controversial new “ eco fees ” consumers are paying — with some being wrongly overcharged — must get its house in order pronto , Environment Minister John Gerretsen warned Tuesday .
After almost two weeks of being pilloried by opposition parties and critics over the fees of up to $ 6.66 per item , Gerretsen wrote a letter to Stewardship Ontario chief executive Gemma Zecchini raising “ serious concerns ” about overcharging reported by some retailers .
“ This is unacceptable and must be addressed immediately , ” Gerretsen warned the independent agency , which is composed of industry representatives .
“ Stewardship Ontario must take quick action to resolve these issues and restore consumer confidence . ”
Gerretsen threatened to revoke the agency ’s power to set fees if swift action is not taken .
“ I expect Stewardship Ontario to put in place the necessary audit and compliance systems to ensure consumers are not overcharged .
If the situation is not rectified , I will consider options to ensure consumers are not being misled about any fees being charged , or eliminate altogether the ability to charge additional set fees to consumers . ”
Stewardship Ontario was set up by Queen ’s Park to oversee recycling programs and make sure household hazardous waste is disposed of using environmentally friendly methods
Opposition parties said the letter smacked of a last - minute public relations ploy .
“ Holy smokes , it ’s a dollar short and days late .
The way the letter ’s written it ’s like they ’re trying to cover their butts , ” said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath , noting the government is already under fire for the HST , solar power subsidies and wind turbines .
“ It makes you wonder how much this government has lost control of its agenda . . . it ’s like they ’re walking along a road of hot coals . ”
The scramble to do damage control comes with Premier Dalton McGuinty on holidays and after top - level changes in his office following the departure of former chief of staff Peter Wilkinson .
“ It ’s a dog of a program , ” said Progressive Conservative MPP and environment critic Toby Barrett .
“ We ’re only one week into it .
Where is this outfit taking it ? ”
Gerretsen , who had already been in touch with Stewardship Ontario on July 8 , said he expects a speedy response but did n’t set a deadline .
His letter comes amid other criticisms the eco fee program appears at cross purposes with other government initiatives on the environment .
Four years ago , the Ontario government began handing out coupons encouraging consumers to buy the curly - looking compact fluorescent light bulbs that use 75 per cent less electricity than regular bulbs .
It even banned the old - style bulbs starting in 2012 .
Now those same energy - efficient bulbs are subject to the controversial new eco fee that came in along with the 13 per cent HST on July 1 .
The environmental fee for the new bulbs , which contain mercury , is 14 cents .
It ’s a classic mixed message and it has both supporters and critics crying foul over the eco fee scheme administered by Stewardship Ontario .
“ The program is important but it has been delivered in an entirely clumsy way , ” said Beatrice Olivastri , chief executive of Friends of the Earth Canada , noting the bulbs contain mercury .
“ Ca n’t we deal with it better ? ”
The fees of up to $ 6.66 per item now apply to aerosols , including asthma inhalers , cleaning products , pharmaceuticals and thousands of other potentially toxic items .
The highest fee is for large fire extinguishers .

Calling the fees a “ secret eco tax , ” Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak urged McGuinty to order them scrapped and promised the Tories would do so if elected next year .
“ If the Liberals do n’t , a PC government will , ” he said .
“ We do n’t need a brand new eco tax . . . particularly back - to - back with the HST . ”
Hudak singled out some types of grass seed packaged with fertilizers as another example of what ’s wrong .
“ That just shows that this is nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with another tax grab on the backs of ordinary Ontario families . ”
The Tories also pointed out the eco fee applies to tire pressure gauges — which , ironically , conservationists say motorists should use regularly to make sure their car tires are inflated property to get the best gas mileage and reduce pollution .
New Democrats joined Hudak in questioning whether Stewardship Ontario , manufacturers and retailers charging the fees are adequately supervised , calling on Ontario Ombudsman André Marin to investigate “ potential abuses . ”
They include the “ bluntness ” of fees that do n’t distinguish between “ less green and more green products , ” such as recycled paint versus standard paint , and what Horwath dubbed “ the apparent ability of retailers to charge an eco fee in excess of the fees set by Waste Diversion Ontario , effectively disguising a retail price increase as something to do with improving the environment . ”
Stewardship Ontario did not return a telephone call from the Star but its website notes “ every cent we receive . . . is used to pay for a program that will mean less waste in landfill , less damage to our waterways — and a better future for generations to come . ”
None of the money goes to government .
Gerretsen told the Star last week that the program diverts over 20,000 tonnes of hazardous waste a year from Ontario landfills but acknowledged the strategy to publicize the new fee “ was n’t good enough . ”
In another irony , one of his predecessors in the job , current Children and Youth Services Minister Laurel Broten , boasted in 2007 that replacing regular light bulbs with compact fluorescents would reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
“ It ’s the equivalent of taking 250,000 cars off the road , ” she said in a statement .
Around the same time , then - energy minister Dwight Duncan downplayed the amount of toxins in the compact bulbs if disposed properly at toxic waste depots .
“ There ’s less mercury in a CFL bulb than the battery in your wristwatch , ” said Duncan , now finance minister .

The largest P2P conglomerate ever assembled is supporting today 's launch of the first episode of ' Pioneer One . '
The show , made for and made possible by the P2P community , is actively promoted by uTorrent , Limewire and a variety of prominent torrent sites including The Pirate Bay and EZTV .
With millions of daily users BitTorrent is a great platform for filmmakers and musicians to promote their work .
One of the main challenges that independent content producers face today is not piracy , but finding ways to to get their work noticed .
This is where the BitTorrent - powered distribution platform VODO comes in .
By harnessing the power of all the major players in the P2P field , VODO offers a unique platform through which independent filmmakers can share their work with the masses .
Downloaders on their turn are encouraged to donate if they like what they see .
Thus far all the previous VODO releases have been downloaded by hundreds of thousands of people , and that ’s just the start .
With backing from uTorrent , Limewire and The Pirate Bay , the number of downloads for today ’s release might exceed one million .
VODO ’s newest release is titled Pioneer One , a brand new 7 - part TV - series that raised enough funds to film the first episode through donations from TorrentFreak readers and other supporters .
Unlike traditional television , the sci- fi-ish series will debut on the Internet , on BitTorrent .
Pioneer
One is an ambitious project from Josh Bernhard and Bracey Smith who have collaborated before on ‘ The Lionshare ’ , a BitTorrent - exclusive film which was released on VODO earlier this year .
With support from even more big names than before , Bernhard , who wrote the script for the TV - series , hopes that today ’s release will set a new record .
“ Based on The Lionshare stats and the amount of coverage we ’re getting on this , I ’m hoping we ’ll hit a million downloads .
Some have higher expectations , but I do n’t want to jinx anything by putting it in print , ” Bernhard told Torrent Freak .
Answering the question why they chose VODO for the release of their series , Bernhard said that it was a logical choice because he did n’t expect the pilot to be picked by a network anytime soon because it ’s so hard to break into that industry now .
“ There ’s only so much of that TV pie to go around .
There ’s only so much real - estate on networks .
We would have to storm the gate just to get a meeting with somebody , ” Bernhard explained .
“ Why would they pick up a show from two nobodies outside their industry ? ”
Besides this pragmatic issue , the makers of Pioneer One also believe that the Internet and BitTorrent have the future .
In the old fashioned TV - system it does n’t really matter how engaged people are in a show .
Passion is not rewarded in today ’s numbers game on traditional television , something that has to change .
“ TV has other priorities than making good TV , ” Bernhard told us .
“ You have vocal fanbases whose enthusiasm is ignored , because to networks , their passion is n’t worth more than beating American Idol in the ratings .
The fact that TV ca n’t sustain a show like Firefly , to use a well - known example , with such passionate viewers , shows that something is wrong with how that system works . ”
Pioneer One Trailer
The interesting contradiction is that , thanks to VODO , Pioneer One will not be an obscure indie release at all .
In the coming week more than a million people are expected to download and watch the episode – numbers most network TV - shows can only dream of .
Although Bernhard hopes that a network or other sponsor will come along to fund the rest of the season , he emphasizes that it will always be released for free to the public .
“ Our plan has always been to distribute the whole season through VODO .
That ’s how we want to do it , and a big part of why this show is so exciting to us , ” he said .
For VODO today ’s release is yet another milestone .
Not only is it supported by more P2P partners than ever before , but Pioneer One is also the first release that has a commercial sponsor , MOFILM , to bring in additional revenue aside from donations .
VODO founder Jamie King told TorrentFreak that now there are so many partners in place , they will put more emphasis on the network itself instead of the distribution channels .
“ In the next six months , we ’re going to be rolling out a new VODO infrastructure for incentivising donation and getting more peers into active relationships with our creators .
To put it simply , we continue to be incredibly optimistic about developing an independent creation culture on top of P2P infrastructure — and really making it work .
Pioneer
One is really the first step towards that . ”
It ’s going to be interesting to follow the progress of the Pioneer One project , a TV - series that is a true pioneer itself .
BitTorrent has already revolutionized the TV - viewing experience for millions of people and through VODO and the high quality it brings this can only accelerate even further .
In a future article will check up on the progress of Pioneer One to see if the 1 million views becomes reality .
In the meantime people can download Pioneer One ’s first episode on VODO .
I recently participated in a TV discussion on why prostitution is on the rise in the country .
I shared the panel with a closet feminist and a radical feminist , both of whom were of the opinion that prostitution was better than marriage since the house is unsafe for a woman , and she would at least get paid for her services if she were a prostitute .
I returned home thinking about their wise utterances and went to bed discussing the same with my husband .
I said , “ For decades , feminists have claimed that one out of three women is unsafe in her own house .
They have told us horrendous tales about how it was daily grind for men in the country to abuse , assault , set afire and murder their wives .
They lobbied for laws which would facilitate a woman breaking her shackles and barging out of the “ tyrannical household ” or throwing her alleged oppressors out , whichever is convenient .
They ensured that every woman who had a problem “ clearly understood ” that all her problems were because of men , marriage and the household . ”
“ By the same token , ” I continued , “ feminists have also been shouting off of rooftops that streets are terribly unsafe for women .
They claim that everyday nine out of ten women are subject to manhandling , rape , sexual assault , acid attacks and what not .
While they believe that , ideally , a woman should able to walk safely on the street at midnight , they are constantly scaring themselves and the rest of us in the society about how women are unsafe on the street even during the day . ”
“ What then , is the solution for women ?
Where do they go ?
What can they do ? ” I wondered loudly .
All of a sudden my husband had an epiphany and said , “ A WHOREHOUSE ! ”
“ YES , ” I agreed , “ This is brilliant !
It is neither the house nor the street .
It is something in between – the utopia that my feminist friends on TV spoke so highly of .
They have to be right .
That ’s where they think our women would be safest , well paid and properly fed , and that ’s why prostitution , with the more fashionable label of ‘ commercial sex ’ , is on the rise . ”
I then thought of how far we have come thanks to the feminist movement from pre-independence days .
We had a time when prostitution was a recognized profession and we had the Devadasi system .
The system was severely condemned by communists as the handmaid of patriarchy .
Their unrelenting crusade against the oldest profession resulted in a legislation for the “ prevention of immoral trafficking ” in 1956 .
While this “ prohibitive ” legislation decriminalized prostitution , a few decades later , the Government went a step ahead and tacitly legalized commercial sex and sex tourism , recognizing how it can financially empower women and thereby boost the economy .
Today , we are at a point where we are talking about prostitute rights .
While we have women ’s rights champions like Brinda Karat who proclaim that “ Society should have no right to control what women wear or do ” , we have others who say , “ If you respect a woman ’s right to say “ no ” to sex , you should also respect her right to say “ yes ” to sex . ”
Simultaneously , all heterosexual relationships have been prostitutionalized so that a woman can claim compensation for all sexual or non-sexual , real or imaginary interactions at any time during or after the relationship .
A woman who chooses her hearth and home is not left behind either .
She is tagged with the honorary title of “ prostitute ” as feminists believe that she is unaware that she is only trading sex for social and financial security , and they will not take “ no ” for an answer .
We surely have come a long way , baby !
While I was still marvelling at this astounding progress , I saw a news item which said that the recent Government Census clubbed housewives , prostitutes and beggars into a group .
What a timely gesture by the Government !
While housewives have already been clubbed with prostitutes , would it not be unfair to ignore the scores of women who have taken to a glorified form of begging by standing before the Courts of Law for maintenance and alimony from their estranged husbands ?
Feminists have not only taught women to shun all the age - old encumbrances imposed by marriage and family but also to shed all inhibitions associated with parasitic living .
Accordingly , there is no trace of shame in these modern liberated women , but it is with a sense of pride and entitlement that they artfully exact money , thus claiming their rightful inclusion by the Government in the club .
The feminists reduced housewives into prostitutes and beggars long ago .
The Government has just made it official by grouping them in the Census .
Why , then , is the Supreme Court cross about it ?
Beats me !
A church committee has asked the General Synod of Australia 's Anglican Church to adopt a statement calling for citizens to have fewer children , recommending that the government cut childbirth incentives to new parents and instead offer incentives for parents to have fewer children .
The country is on track for overpopulation , the church warned , which could break the eighth commandment by stealing resources from future generations .
Do Christians have a special responsibility to have children ?
" There is a scriptural mandate for it , and you have admonitions in the psalms that speak of the blessedness of God providing many children to a husband and wife .
And there 's a general tenor throughout scripture that children are a blessing and a heritage from the Lord .
So , should Christians be fruitful and multiply ?
I say absolutely .
In fact , I would say this : the only instance in which Christians should not seek the gift of children would be in extraordinary ministry circumstances where perhaps having children would be ill - advised or dangerous . "
" We become more like God when we marry .
Two become one ; when I choose to love my wife and become one with her , we become more like God .
When two of us become three and have one family , I become more like God .
That 's when I understand the father heart of God , the mother heart of God .
So , for our own sanctification , godliness , and becoming like God , we need to have children . "
" While it 's trendy to talk about curbing baby emissions , most industrialized countries actually need more population : more babies to sustain and care for their aging population .
It 's a general misread of demographics across the world to see it as a baby problem .
But most importantly , the world needs to see Christians leading ...

How to show / hide a hidden input form field using jQuery
This past week I was working on a project at work which included building a request form with multiple fields .
It was a rather large form that included a dropdown list with an ‘ other ’ option .
I wanted to allow users to select the ‘ other ’ option which then would show an input field so they can enter a specific description of what that ‘ other ’ item is .
I did n’t want to clutter the form by displaying that additional field by default so I used a little jQuery , thus displaying it dynamically and only when needed .
A Better jQuery In - Field Label Plugin
This is a pretty nice effect , and it can really help to save space on forms .
There are a billion different ways to implement this , and I do n’t suggest you use the example from above because that was just a quick way to show the effect .
So let ’s walk through a couple of different implementation approaches and figure out the best way to implement this feature .

Compare JavaScript frameworks
Modern Web sites and Web applications tend to rely quite heavily on client - side JavaScript to provide rich interactivity , particularly through the advent of asynchronous HTTP requests that do not require page refreshes to return data or responses from a server - side script or database system .
In this article , you will discover how JavaScript frameworks make it easier and faster to create highly interactive and responsive Web sites and Web applications .
How to Test your JavaScript Code with QUnit
QUnit , developed by the jQuery team , is a great framework for unit testing your JavaScript .
In this tutorial , I ’ll introduce what QUnit specifically is , and why you should care about rigorously testing your code .

One of the most memorable cases was the KGB 's Gray Wolves operation in the 1960s and 1970s .
The goal of the operation was to prevent Baltic emigre and Jewish communities , who supported dissidents in the Soviet Union , from uniting against the Soviet regime .
To do so , the KGB , via contacts inside the Baltic communities , disseminated documents related to the deportation of the Baltic population during the occupation of those regions by the Red Army in 1939 .
The documents came from the archives of the KGB 's secret - police predecessor , the NKVD .
In the documents , the KGB emphasized the Jewish names among the NKVD officers who took part in the deportations in order to stir up anti-Semitic sentiments .
At the same time , KGB " helpers " within Jewish communities in the West disseminated Nazi documents from archives captured by the Soviet Army that contained the names of Baltic collaborators who had taken part in the Holocaust .
However , along with authentic documents , the KGB also included forged files with the names of Baltic anticommunist activists it wanted to compromise .
A KGB officer in charge of the operation reported to his superiors in Moscow that as a result of the " active measures , both Baltic and Jewish communities have significantly reduced their anti-Soviet activities as they are busy with mutual accusations and settling accounts , " according to KGB documents in the possession of Western researchers .
Whatever Happened To Pamyat ?
Another example was the notorious anti-Semitic group Pamyat , which was led by professional actor and monarchist Dmitry Vasiliev and appeared on the Soviet political scene in the late 1980s .
A collection of black - shirted , bearded men , Pamyat was modeled on the pre-revolutionary anti-Semitic Union of Russian People .
Pamyat 's activity coincided with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 's stalling reforms and low approval rating .
In the 1990s , some KGB officers suggested that Pamyat was the brainchild of high - ranking KGB officials .
Its purported goal was to show the frightening alternative to socialist reform .
Despite its notorious image , Pamyat quietly evaporated from the political scene .
Some observers have noted that the Kremlin today seems to have similar uses for the rising tide of racist attacks .
Many reports about racial incidents and hate crimes routinely come from Kremlin - controlled or Kremlin - aligned media .
Police often stress the " racial " nature of violent crimes against foreigners , even before any investigation is under way .
The Antifascist Pact
In February , the pro-Kremlin Unified Russia party and 11 other parties signed a so - called antifascist pact .
Among the parties that signed on were the right - wing Liberal Democratic Party of Russia ( LDPR ) , the Union of Rightist Forces , and other political associations that usually support Putin .
Yabloko , the Communist Party , and Motherland refused to sign the document saying they " do not want to participate in such a farce , " and pointing out that the LDPR is well known for its xenophobic rhetoric .
In March , the pro-Putin youth movement Nashi once again proclaimed itself " antifascist " and labeled its political adversaries as " fascists . "
Elections Coming Up
Analyst Ruslan Saidov wrote in forum.msk.ru in March that the presidential administration wants to play an antifascism card in the 2008 presidential election , just as in previous election cycles it came out against the Communists .
Saidov wrote that the Kremlin 's second goal is to use the " radical threat of nationalism " as a bogeyman to deflect criticism of it by the liberal intelligentsia .
A third goal , according to Saidov , is to depict the Kremlin 's political opponents as " racists " and " extremists . "
In the last half year , the Kremlin has spoken out against small radical youth groups , such as the National - Bolshevik Party , the nationalist Motherland party , and even , at one point , the liberal Yabloko .
Saidov wrote that initially the authorities wanted to " personify the fascist threat " by focusing on LDPR leader and Deputy Duma Speaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky .
Another goal , which Saidov did not mention in his article , could be to use the rising tide of racism or fascism to improve the Kremlin 's image abroad by presenting Putin 's administration as the only protection against these threats .

NTP Sues Apple , Google , HTC , LG , Microsoft and Motorola for Infringement of Wireless Email Patents
RICHMOND , Va. , July 9 / PRNewswire / -- NTP
Incorporated , the company founded by Tom Campana , the inventor of wireless email , yesterday filed lawsuits against Apple , Inc. , Google Inc. , HTC Corp. , LG Electronics Inc. , Microsoft Corporation , and Motorola , Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for infringing NTP 's eight patents related to the delivery of electronic mail over wireless communications systems .
Each of the defendants is a manufacturer or developer of either wireless handheld devices or software applications used in the delivery of email across wireless communications systems .
Donald E. Stout , NTP 's co-founder , said , " Use of NTP 's intellectual property without a license is just plain unfair to NTP and its licensees .
Unfortunately , litigation is our only means of ensuring the inventor of the fundamental technology on which wireless email is based , Tom Campana , and NTP shareholders are recognized , and are fairly and reasonably compensated for their innovative work and investment .
We took the necessary action to protect our intellectual property . "
NTP is best known for its long litigation and eventual settlement with Research in Motion ( RIM ) , maker of BlackBerry ® wireless devices .
In that litigation , all the claims asserted at trial were found to be valid and willfully infringed by RIM , and the verdict was ultimately affirmed on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
Spurred by that litigation , the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) moved to re-examine NTP 's patents .
In December 2009 , in spite of the massive effort by the USPTO to overturn NTP 's patents , the USPTO Board of Patent Appeals ( USPTO Board ) ruled that 67 of NTP 's patent claims in four patents are valid , including three claims that RIM was found to have infringed .
Infringement of a single claim is all that is needed for a patent to be deemed violated .
NTP has also filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to overturn the USPTO 's remaining rejections of NTP 's patent claims .
" The filing of suit today is necessary to ensure that those companies who are infringing NTP 's patents will be required to pay a licensing fee , " Mr. Stout continued .
" In view of the USPTO Board 's ruling , the debate over whether Mr. Campana was an originator in the field of wireless email is over .
No patents in U.S. history have received as much scrutiny as NTP 's patents .
We are delighted that the USPTO Board has recognized the groundbreaking innovation of Mr. Campana by confirming 67 of NTP 's patent claims .
We are also confident that the USPTO 's rejections , which are on appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , will be overturned . "
About NTP Incorporated

NTP 's intellectual property includes patents relating to technologies involving wireless email which Mr. Campana developed as lead inventor in 1990 .
Mr. Campana was awarded over 50 patents in his career and invented a wireless location technology that helps parents find their children which received first prize at the 1996 Consumer Electronics Show .
NTP has licensing agreements with Research in Motion Limited , Good Technology , Inc. , Nokia Inc. , and Visto Corporation .
Dumbed - down , amoral , nihilistic drivel from the likes of Gaga and Katy Perry serves to keep the masses in a state of spiritual decay .
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , July 2 , 2010
It has never been more apparent to those who have awakened from the slumber imposed upon them by popular culture that the establishment music industry now pumps out the most dumbed - down , monotonous , garbage which actually serves to induce depression and despair in those who are enlightened and aware , while providing hypnotizing bread and circuses for those still transfixed by the babylon system .
If the readers of this website sat down and watched MTV for an hour , they ’d probably come away feeling dazed , confused , and disgusted at the parade of sickness , idolatry and worship of everything that ’s wrong in our society .
Love of money , the evisceration of morality , the exaltation of post - modern nihilism , the attack on the family , the normalization of the bizarre , the sick and the twisted .
Mainstream popular culture is nothing more than a tool which the elite use to make us feel worthless , pathetic , powerless and hopeless .
They want us to believe that the most significant thing we can ever achieve in life is to look cool and garner the approval of our peers by wearing the uniform of whatever cult we are mandated to belong to , and that we can only accomplish this by mimicking the retarded behavior of the people we see in music videos .
This is why legions of young people , whatever color they are or background they come from , walk around trying to look like and imitate rappers who wear their pants half way down their legs , can barely talk , and only live for getting smashed out of their skulls and having meaningless random sex with women who they objectify as instruments of carnal pleasure .
Easily the biggest stumbling block in trying to educate people as to why they are depressed , leading increasingly insular and emotionally unstable , unhealthy lives with declining living standards is dragging them away from the very distractions that contribute to their downfall .
The power of entertainment as an opiate of the masses has never been stronger , and with the widespread rollout of 3D technology , the tools of hypnotism are only becoming more and more potent .
A London Guardian report entitled “ Lady Gaga and the New World Order ” gives serious credence to a website that not only discusses how popular music is used to keep people downtrodden and distracted , but how it is replete with messages and symbolism bragging about how the elite are using entertainment to keep the masses enslaved .
The Vigilant Citizen has a good claim to be the world ’s most distinctive music critic .
On his website , vigilantcitizen.com , he describes himself as a graduate in communications and politics and a producer for “ some fairly well - known ‘ urban ’ artists ” .
He has spent five years researching “ Theosophy , Freemasonry , Rosicrucianism , the Bavarian Illuminati and Western Occultism ” .
All of these interests converge in his insanely detailed analyses of the symbolism of pop videos and lyrics .
Thus Pink ’s MTV awards performance mimics a Masonic initiation ; Jay - Z’s Run This Town trumpets the coming of the New World Order ( NWO ) ; and the video for Black Eyed Peas ’ Imma Be Rocking That Body advances “ the transhumanist and police state agenda ” .
What ’s surprising is the methodical , matter - of - fact , occasionally humorous tone of his essays .
He does not write like a swivel - eyed loon rambling about Obamunism ( although , inevitably , there ’s an unsavoury fascination with Jewish influence ) .
To those who do n’t study occult symbolism , he concedes , it might all seem “ totally far - fetched and ridiculous ” , but for those in the know “ I was simply stating the obvious ” .
His examinations are certainly exhaustive .
Scrolling down his densely illustrated posts , you may find yourself thinking , “ Say , Lady Gaga really does very often cover up one eye .
And a lot of pop stars really do pretend to be robots . ”
Although the Vigilant Citizen insists he is neither a political conservative nor a religious fundamentalist , he is heir to such off - piste 60s pop critics as the Reverend David A Noebel , author of Communism , Hypnotism and the Beatles , and Gary Allen , who theorised that post - Rubber Soul Beatles material was so technically sophisticated that it must have been “ put together by behavioural scientists in some think tank ” .
Leftwing thinkers at the time had their own take on pop as mind control .
Peter Watkins ’ 1967 movie Privilege starred Manfred Mann ’s Paul Jones as a puppet of the state , pacifying the populace with catchy patriotic tunes .
In such analysis , the villains may change but the mechanisms remain the same .
The fact that the Guardian writer seriously discusses how popular music is littered with elitist symbolism without sneering the whole thing off as a conspiranoid delusion is an example of how abundantly clear this process is becoming .

A d v e r t i s e m e n t

This kind of subject matter is no longer “ out there , ” it ’s no longer considered wild to simply point out that popular culture and particularly popular music is exercising an undue and insidious influence on the moral , societal , and spiritual development of younger generations and humanity in general .
Nowhere was it more obvious than during a recent Beyonce performance where she was surrounded by dancing riot cops .
As the vigilant citizen website explains , this is about indoctrinating people to accept “ the “ robotization ” of the human body and the gradual introduction of a virtual police state ” .
In other essays , Gaga ’s habit of covering one eye is explained as her rejection of God and her induction as a Luciferian priestess .
Notice how people like Christina Aguilera copy Gaga ’s symbolism of humans as soulless robots .
The one - eyed Luciferian theme is also seen here with Rihanna .
While the website sometimes uses too broad a brush with which to identify servants of the babylon system , for example , a Bob Dylan clip is misconstrued as him saying he sold his sold to the devil , when in fact as any Dylan fan will know , in the late 70 ’s he became a Christian and started releasing gospel music , it does an excellent job in pointing the finger at those who really have metaphorically sold their souls – people like Katy Perry – to be used as tools with which to keep the masses in a perpetual state of disorder and spiritual decay .
Tearing down the facade of this babylon system and dragging people away from the constant hypnotic distractions of sports , dumbed - down music , fashion and every other sideshow offered up to turn our heads from our true spiritual development is as if not more important than educating people about the political aspects of the new world order agenda .
We need to make it “ cool ” to be informed about what is happening to our world and how we can change its course .
This process has accelerated over the past decade and many music artists have incorporated this awakening into their work .
Bands like Muse and the Foo Fighters , rappers like Paris and Eminem , are pushing back against the tide of zombie brainwashing being fostered on us by the likes of Gaga and Katy Perry .
There ’s no better way to conclude than with Bob Marley ’s “ Babylon System ” song , which perfectly illustrates everything we are up against in this battle .

In 1917 the charlatan John R. Brinkley experienced what was truly a seminal moment .
This so - called doctor , whose diploma had come from a medical school that was “ vague , obliging and long defunct ” and whose expertise was dubious at best ( “ if the white coat reassured people , the healing had begun ” ) , was consulting with a 46 - year - old Kansas farmer named Bill Stittsworth .
“ I ’m all in , ” Stittsworth said .
“ No pep .
I ’m a flat tire . ”
Then both farmer and doctor gazed out the office window .
They spied livestock .
And they experienced a shared brainstorm .
Supposedly at his patient ’s urging , Brinkley agreed to try to restore the man ’s virility via an unorthodox transplant operation .
The farmer wound up with two extra testicles courtesy of one luckless goat .
For Dr. Brinkley , whose story is told with uproarious brio in Pope Brock ’s heavenly “ Charlatan , ” this 1917 epiphany was the beginning of a mercenary miracle .
“ Dimly he had begun to realize that he was gifted beyond the run of doctors , ” Brinkley ’s adoring authorized biography would one day explain .
That book would also credit Brinkley with “ this lovable characteristic of genius , that money is not an aim , or an end in itself , but a means of enlarging the central idea of his life - work . ”
Image Pope Brock Credit ... Lynda Shenkman Curtis
Selflessly or otherwise , Brinkley parlayed his goat - gland breakthrough into a unique place in American history .
He was much more than just a mere medical quack .
In a book so lively that its wild stories are virtually wall - to - wall , Mr. Brock describes early - 20th - century America ’s endlessly credulous populace , with “ the average citizen as guileless as the wide - mouthed shad . ”
Brinkley and his virility scheme tapped into the nation ’s penchant for mumbo- jumbo and hence into opportunities for salesmanship that had been previously unknown .
This is the quintessential New Orleans cocktail , and as of 2008 it is the Official Cocktail of the City of New Orleans ( thank you , state legislature ) .
There are those who say this is the first cocktail , period .
Alas , this is sadly untrue .
It is said that this drink was invented by Antoine Amadie Peychaud , a Creole apothecary who moved to New Orleans from the West Indies and set up shop in the French Quarter in the early part of the 19th Century .
He dispensed a proprietary mix of aromatic bitters from an old family recipe , to relieve the ails of his clients ( Peychaud 's Bitters are still made in New Orleans and sold today , and are an essential component of any truly complete bar ) , and around the 1830s he became famous for a toddy he made for his friends .
It consisted of French brandy mixed with his secret blend of bitters , a splash of water and a bit of sugar .
According to legend he served his drink in the large end of an egg cup that was called a coquetier in French , and some say that the Americanized pronunciation of this as " cocktail " gave this type of drink its name .
That 's all it is , too -- legend , and a good yarn that locals like to spin .
Nowadays we know for a fact that the word " cocktail " predated this by decades , first appearing in print in 1803 and first defined in print in 1806 as " a mixture of spirits of any kind , water , sugar and bitters , vulgarly called a bittered sling . "
Research has also shown that brandy - based cocktails were being served in New Orleans before M. Peychaud began dispensing his concoction , and were most probably spiked with Stoughton 's Bitters , a medicinal stomach bitters which did n't survivethe 19th Century .
This is , of course , not to say that M. Peychaud 's cocktail was n't popular locally -- it was , and became much more so as its fame spread .
Before long , the demand for this drink led to its being served in bars throughout the city ( euphemistically called " coffee houses " in those days ) .
One of these , a large bar on Exchange Alley owned by a gentleman named Sewell Taylor , was named the Merchants Exchange Coffeehouse .
Not long after , Mr. Taylor started a new business as a liquor importer , with one of his most popular products being a particular brand of Cognac called Sazerac - du - Forge et fils for which Mr. Taylor was the sole importer .
Someone else took over the bar , changed its name to the Sazerac Coffee House , and history was made .
Apparently the bar was big enough to accommodate 12 bartenders , all mixing " Sazeracs " for their patrons , and people began to refer to the drink with the name of the coffeehouse where it was most popular .
Around 1870 , a gentleman by the name of Thomas Handy took over as proprietor of the Sazerac House , and the primary ingredient was changed from cognac to rye whiskey due to popular American tastes as well as to the difficulty of obtaining cognac at the time -- the phyloxxera epidemic in Europe had devastated France 's wine grape crops , which would take years to recover .
Somewhere along the line a dash of absinthe was added , usually used to coat the glass with the excess discarded .
Eventually absinthe was banned and was replaced by the locally - produced pastis called Herbsaint , which is ideal in a Sazerac and with which you 'll find them made in New Orleans most often .
The bar moved to the Roosevelt Hotel in 1949 , where the Sazerac Bar and Restaurant still stands .
The Roosevelt became the Fairmont , and as of summer 2009 it'll be renovated and reopened as the Roosevelt once again , featuring a spectacularly redone Sazerac Bar that 'll hearked back to the bar 's glory days .
Since those days the hotel paid an annual fee to the Sazerac Company for the use of the name .
The company , which produces , imports and distributes many different liquors , was founded in 1870 by the gentleman who bought the Sazerac Coffeehouse and the Peychaud family 's secret recipe for the bitters .
This is an absolutely exquisite cocktail .
As you sip it , you come across layer after layer of flavor -- the warmth and glowing burn of the rye , effused with the flavors of spice and honey , the bite of the bitters balanced with the sweetness of the sugar , with the subtle yet complex flavor of the anise underneath and the perfume of the lemon oil from the twist feel like a symphony inside your mouth .
This is also a drink that warms up well , revealing even more flavors .
Sip it very slowly .
Savor it .
Take your time with it .
Now that absinthe is legal in the United States again , use that if at all possible for an extra bit of historical authenticity .
Lucid and Kübler are readily available now , as is St. George from San Francisco , Marteau and Pacifique from the Pacific Northwest , Leopold Bros. from Colorado and all of Ted Breaux 's absinthes from Jade Liqueurs to name but a few .
However , if you do use absinthe instead of Herbsaint in your Sazerac , avoid brands from the Czech Republic , as they taste nothing like the type of absinthe that was historically drunk in New Orleans and used in early Sazeracs ) .
The drink has been enjoyed this way for over 130 years , and over 150 if you include the original version made with Cognac .
There are recipes that call for Angostura bitters as well as Peychaud 's bitters for this cocktail .
For the longest time I was against this , primarly due to watching too many bartenders grab both bottles of bitters and shake equal amounts into the drink , which is just wrong .
I decided to be a traditionalst , saying that it was n't invented that way -- M. Peychaud did n't make it that way .
However , Thomas Handy 's bartenders at the Sazerac Coffeehouse are the ones who added the absinthe , now an integral component of the drink , and they 're the ones who started using a bit of Angostura as well .
I love the flavor of Peychaud 's bitters -- the Sazerac is a showcase for that unique flavor , and always should be .
However , Jeff Morgenthaler recenttly pointed out that a single drop of Angostura will leave you " surprised [ at ] how much it opens up the flavors . "
Make it a small dash , and make it optional if you want to be a staunch purist ... but 130 years is still long enough for something to be a tradition !
As Jeff advises , " While it may enrage some purists , you can always counter with , ' If it was good enough for Thomas Handy , it 's good enough for me . ' "
I go both ways on this .
I still love an all - Peychaud 's Sazerac , but try a little drop of Angostura and see what you think .
If it 's not to your taste , by all means leave it out .
But for God 's sake , do n't make the mistake that , sadly , so many New Orleans bartenders make -- grabbing each bottle by the neck and putting four or five dashes of each .
This is a Sazerac , not a Seelbach , dammit !
Although I love a Sazerac made with rye whiskey , you can also make a truly wonderful drink by substituting a fine Cognac for the rye , making the drink as it first was in the old days , or with a mixture of the two .
If you have real absinthe , use that to coat the glass , too .
And speaking of rye ... get rye whiskey for this drink .
Do not use Bourbon .
Do n't get me wrong , I love Bourbon .
It 's simply wrong for this drink -- too much sweetness , not enough spice .
It has never been made this way traditionally , and until recently would never be made this way in New Orleans , and that 's enough .
I believe that if you 've got something that 's wonderful , that 's real , and right , and true ... you leave it alone .
As Stanley Clisby Arthur , author of Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix ' Em , in print since 1937 , said in his classic tome , " While Bourbon may do for a julep it just wo n't do for a real Sazerac .
This comes directly from a bartender who used to mix Sazeracs for Tom Handy , so it bears some authority . "
Try them both ways yourself , and you 'll immediately realize that the sweetness of Bourbon is completely wrong for this drink , and only the spiciness of rye ( or Cognac , or a mix of both ) will do .
The typical rye whiskey used for Sazeracs in New Orleans is Old Overholt , a 4 - year - old rye that 's got a crisp , complex flavor ... spicy with a touch of honey .
It 's an 86 - proof whiskey , which is eminently sippable .
However , if you like a drink with a bit more of a kick to it , Rittenhouse Bonded Straight Rye Whiskey at 100 proof makes a truly outstanding drink that 'll give you a boot in the butt as well .
In an ideal world , my whiskey of choice for this drink is the magnificent Sazerac 18 - Year - Old Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey , one of America 's great whiskeys produced by the Buffalo Trace Distillery , owned by the Sazerac Company .
If you can find it , grab it -- it 's a limited edition release , and as supplies dwindle the price is shooting up .
( As of January 2004 it had already gone up from $ 34.95 a bottle to $ 42.95 at Martin Wine Cellar , and the extremely limited , once - a - year releases are now seen at $ 80 - 100 a bottle ) .
There 's some new Sazerac 18 - Year Rye in the works apparently , but it 'll take a while to make .
Fortunately , there 's also a 6 - Year - Old Sazerac Rye , which is quite delicious , much more readily available and very reasonably priced at about $ 22 - 24 per bottle .
Other ryes I favor for Sazeracs are Wild Turkey Rye ( really good and potent stuff , if you want a Sazerac that 'll also give you a little kick in the pants ) and Pappy Van Winkle Family Reserve 13 - Year - Old Rye at 95.6 proof .
This one makes a spectacular drink as well .
After writing in Looka !
about my 2000 trip home for Jazzfest and my rediscovery of the Sazerac as being my favorite cocktail of all time , a gentleman wrote in to ask why I did n't talk about having any Hurricanes during my visit home .
I replied , " Hurricanes are for tourists .
Sazeracs are for natives . "
That said , we want every visitor to the city ( and everybody else , around the world , at their local bar or at home ) to join us .
Here 's how you make one .
1/2 teaspoon absinthe , or Herbsaint ( a New Orleans brand of anise liqueur )
1 teaspoon of simple syrup ( 2:1 sugar to water ) , or 1 sugar cube or 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar
4 dashes Peychaud 's bitters
1 small dash , a scant drop , of Angostura bitters ( extremely optional ; some feel it helps open the flavors , but traditionalists may leave it out ) .
2 ounces rye whiskey .
Strip of lemon peel
The traditional method : Pack a 3 - 1/2 ounce Old Fashioned ( rocks ) glass with ice .
In another Old Fashioned glass , moisten the sugar cube with just enough water to saturate it , then crush .
Blend with the whiskey and bitters .
Add a few cubes of ice and stir to chill .
Discard the ice from the first glass and pour in the Herbsaint .
Coat the inside of the entire glass , pouring out the excess .
Strain the whiskey into the Herbsaint coated glass .
Twist the lemon peel over the glass so that the lemon oil cascades into the drink , then rub the peel over the rim of the glass ; do not put the twist in the drink .
Or , as Stanley Clisby Arthur says , " Do not commit the sacrilege of dropping the peel into the drink . "
My preferred method : Always use a nice big rocks or Old - Fashioned glass for this drink .
Wes and I have managed to slowly and painstakingly acquire a set of eight heavy - bottomed Old Fashioned glasses from the old Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans , emblazoned with the hotel 's name and the word " SAZERAC " in large letters .
We 've become very fond of these glasses , as you can imagine !
I also recommend the use of a prepared simple syrup ( 1 - 1/2 parts sugar to 1 part water ) for this and most other cocktails involving sugar that do n't involve muddling .
I do n't like adding granulated or lump sugar to a drink unless I 'm muddling , because it never quite dissolves completely .
In simple syrup the sugar is already dissolved , so there 's no chance of serving a gritty drink to your guests .
As Herbsaint may be difficult to find in your area , you may substitute another pastis for the Herbsaint ; however , I find that the flavor of Herbsaint is far superior to that of Pernod ( the usual Herbsaint substitute ) , so it 's worth your while to seek it out .
Actually , it 's worth your while to get a bottle of good absinthe , as it's easy enough nowadays .
Add the absinthe or Herbsaint to the glass , then swirl it around to coat the entire sides and bottom of the glass .
Discard the excess , although if you enjoy a bit more of the flavor of the absinthe or Herbsaint you may wish to leave a small amount of it in the bottom .
Remember that the flavor of the absinthe should be there , but in the background -- it should not dominate .
In a cocktail shaker ( I use the glass portion of my Boston shaker ) , add the sugar syrup , whiskey and bitters .
Add ice and tir gently for about 30 seconds ( and for God 's sake do n't shake it -- you do n't want a frothy Sazerac ) or until the drink is cold , then strain into the Herbsaint - coated glass .
Twist lemon peel over the drink , and try to watch carefully to make sure a cascade of tiny lemon oil droplets actually strike the surface of the drink ; this is one of my favorite parts of the preparation ritual .
Rub the twist over the rim of the glass , then add as garnish .
( No , I 'm not a slavish adherent to S. C. Arthur 's admonitions ; I 'll do this drink in a very acceptably traditional manner , with my own tastes taken into account .
Leave the peel out if you wish . )
Sit back , relax and enjoy the greatest cocktail in the world .
( Sorry , Martini . )
To take a trip back in time with the original , really lovely version of the Sazerac , substitute a fine Cognac for the rye .
Better yet , use a mixture of rye and Cognac , as is the preferred technique of Dale Degroff , LeNell Smothers and Jamie Boudreau among many other mixologists ; proportions vary from equal parts to 1 - 1/2 Cognac and 1 /2 rye , so play around and see what you like .
Also try it with real absinthe if it 's available near you ; it 's like hopping into the Wayback Machine !
Just a reminder -- while most bars in New Orleans still make Overholt Sazeracs , think outside the box .
Sazerac 6
Year rye is wonderful , Rittenhouse is fantastic , and if you 're feeling extravagant the limited edition Sazerac 18 - Year - Old Straight Kentucky Rye Whiskey might just make the best Sazerac in the world .
It 's truly marvelous , if you can find it -- and it's hard to find ..
A graph is a data structure that links a set of vertices by a set of edges .
Modern graph databases support multi-relational graph structures , where there exist different types of vertices ( e.g. people , places , items ) and different types of edges ( e.g. friend , lives at , purchased ) .
By means of index - free adjacency , graph databases are optimized for graph traversals and are interacted with through a graph traversal engine .
A graph traversal is defined as an abstract path whose instance is realized on a graph dataset .
Graph databases and traversals can be used for searching , scoring , ranking , and in concert , recommendation .
This presentation will explore graph structures , algorithms , traversal algebras , graph - related software suites , and a host of examples demonstrating how to solve real - world problems , in real - time , with graphs .
This is a whirlwind tour of the theory and application of graphs .
Mr. Aldrich , whom everyone calls Ricky , was at Harvard in 1963 when his grandmother died and left Rokeby to him and his two siblings , John Winthrop Aldrich , now 67 , who is known as Wint and is the New York State deputy commissioner for historic preservation , and Rosalind Michahelles , 63 , a holistic health counselor in Cambridge , Mass .

Unfortunately , their grandmother did n’t leave much money for upkeep , and the lawyers administering her estate told the young Aldriches that Rokeby would have to be sold .
Deeply imprinted , as Wint said , by their grandmother ’s belief in family stewardship and the historical value of their decrepit inheritance , the three marshaled cash from well - heeled cousins to pay the taxes that first year .
Then the fun began .
Ricky Aldrich had spent a few years in Yugoslavia and Poland after Harvard , studying history and practicing what he called “ creative capitalism , ” but which he said the Polish government considered black market activity .
He returned to Rokeby in the early 1970s with a new wife , Ania , a Polish artist who was just 23 and spoke no English .
Now 63 , and sporting cobalt - blue eyebrows , she said her first sight of Rokeby was a tangle of woods , since her husband had eschewed the grand , winding , quarter - mile front drive for a back entrance .
“ I ’d come from a small town , ” she said .
“ I wanted to live in a big city , have a big life , a fast life .
I said , ‘ Oh my God , this is a worse country than where I ’m from . ’
And then we come to this huge house , and I was very confused . ”
The roof leaked , the windows were splintered and there was n’t much heat to speak of .
Also , there was a mother - in - law , Mrs. Aldrich , albeit one who had prudently decided to live elsewhere on the property — in a five - car garage turned dower house .
Still , she was kind to Ania , and for the first few years they conversed in schoolroom German .
“ I ’m so sorry , ” Mrs. Aldrich repeatedly told her .
“ I ’m so sorry about this house . ”
It was sink or swim , Ania said .
Wint , his first wife , two daughters and two stepchildren were in residence for a decade or so .
Rosalind arrived every summer with her two daughters .
Territories and responsibilities were unclear .
There were unspoken rules you might trip over .

The piggy above was genetically modified to have a yellow nose and feet , while the kitty was engineered so its skin glows in ultraviolet light .
The aim is to develop ways to genetically modify animals to have properties not found in nature that have scientific or agricultural benefits .
New Scientist surveys the latest variety of " Altered animals : Creatures with bonus features . "
Paging Eduardo Kac and Alba , your meme is ready !
From New Scientist :
Ultimately , the adoption of GM farm animals may hinge on public opinion and the demand for the benefits they can offer .
That demand may be felt most urgently in countries such as China , where meat consumption is skyrocketing .
" I anticipate that genetically engineered livestock will be first used in China , Cuba and other places around the world , and then come to the US and Europe , " says James Murray , an animal geneticist at the University of California , Davis .
" It 'll be the reverse of what you saw with the plants . "
So in 20 years ' time will GM animals be as widespread as their botanic counterparts are now ?
" Technologically , nothing is standing in our way , " says Fahrenkrug .
" Really , the issue is coming down to : what are you going to make ? "
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM :
In a horrific instance of Talibanism , Muslim fanatics in Kerala on Sunday chopped off the right hand of a college lecturer , accusing him of setting a question paper with a derogatory reference to the Prophet .
Lecturer T J Joseph was returning home from church with his mother and sister around 8.30 am in Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam district when he was accosted by the attackers .
" We had just got into our car when a van pulled up in front .
Around eight people armed with swords and knives emerged and pulled out Joseph after smashing the windscreen .
They then chopped off his right hand and stabbed him in the left thigh , " said Joseph 's sister , Mary Stella , a nun .
" When we tried to prevent them , they attacked me and and our mother before exploding bombs and fleeing . "
A police team recovered the severed hand from the compound of a house about 200 m away .
The 52 - year - old lecturer was rushed to a private hospital where his condition is serious .
Police recovered the van in which the fanatics reached the scene .
Two men , said to be activists of the Popular Front , a new incarnation of the hardline National Democratic Front , have also been taken into custody .
Special police squads are searching sensitive areas in and around the town .
" Personnel from this district and neighbouring places are working as a team and we 'll nab the assailants soon , " said IG B Sandhya .
In March this year , Islamic outfits had carried out protests against Joseph , who was a lecturer in the church - run Newman college in Thodupuzha in Idukki district over a portion in the Malayalam question paper for an internal examination for BCom students .
They claimed that the question paper insulted the Prophet .
The college later suspended Joseph who had set the questions and a criminal case was registered against him .
The case is pending trial .
Reacting to the incident , state home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan told reporters in New Delhi that the police would probe if any communal or terrorist outfit was involved .
The BJP alleged that the home department could not evade responsibility for the growth of terror outfits in Kerala .
" This is a direct consequence of the soft attitude adopted by the Left and Congress towards terrorist outfits , " said BJP state chief V Muraleedharan .
SHANGHAI / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - China gave Google Inc approval to keep operating its Chinese search page , resolving a months - long censorship dispute that had threatened its future in the world ’s top Internet market .
Two office workers walk out of Google 's head office in Beijing July 9 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Bobby Yip
The move , announced by Google on Friday , removes another thorn in U.S. - China relations and reflects Beijing ’s desire to be seen as friendly to major foreign companies in spite of ideological differences , analysts said .
Shares of Google rose 2.4 percent as the news erased some concerns that China would eject the company for taking a hard line against Internet censorship .
But analysts said Google ’s position in China remained fragile and that the country likely would account for a fraction of Google ’s revenue for some time .
“ It ’s good for Google that they still have some presence .
But they ’re clearly in a more compromised competitive position , ” said Ryan Jacob of the Jacob Internet fund , which holds Google shares .
“ Google is going to have a very difficult time gaining share , and will probably lose share over time . ”
Google embarrassed China in January by drawing global attention to Beijing ’s Internet censorship practices , a function of the government ’s belief that keeping a tight grip on information helps it maintain control .
The Internet company also accused Chinese hackers of orchestrating a sophisticated cyber attack on Google and other major U.S. companies .
Google then declared that it was no longer willing to offer censored search results .
This exacerbated tensions between Washington and Beijing , which were also sparring over China ’s currency , U.S. arms sales to Taiwan , and Tibet .
Washington has forcefully argued against Internet censorship and demanded that Beijing investigate and explain the alleged cyber attacks .
Over the months , tensions between the two countries have eased .
But analysts said that while the United States would likely welcome the Google agreement , deeper divisions over freedom of information , Internet policy and cyber security would likely continue .
FACE -SAVING COMPROMISE
Google said on Friday that China had renewed its webpage license , which means it can continue to run the Chinese language search site google .cn .
There was no immediate comment from the Chinese or U.S. governments .
Last week , Google offered Beijing a face - saving compromise : it stopped automatically rerouting google .cn to its uncensored Hong Kong site .
Now , visitors to google .cn must click once to go to the Hong Kong page .
Analysts said Beijing had sent a reassuring signal to foreign businesses that it would play by its own rules while keeping an innovative global company such as Google in its domestic market , where Chinese companies can compete with and learn from it .
“ They want Google there , ” said Rebecca MacKinnon , a China expert at the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University .
“ The Chinese government clearly sees Internet and mobile innovation as a major driver of its global economic competitiveness going forward . ”
China , the world ’s No. 3 economy , has made no bones about its desire to attract foreign investment and technology .
But despite Beijing ’s eagerness to project a pro-foreign investment image , executives from multinational companies have long complained about Chinese policies that encourage home - grown corporations over foreign ones .

General Electric Co’s Chief Executive Jeff Immelt was cited by the Financial Times newspaper as saying in July that he felt Beijing was growing increasingly protectionist , and suggested his conglomerate was eyeing prospects elsewhere .
Analysts estimate Google ’s revenue in China at $ 300 million to $ 600 million out of its $ 24 billion annual revenue .
It has around a 30 percent share of China ’s 7 billion yuan ( $ 1 billion ) search market , which local rival Baidu Inc dominates .
Baidu shares , which have soared about 75 percent since Google ’s problems in China emerged , fell 1.6 percent .
Elinor Leung , an analyst with CLSA in Hong Kong , expects traffic from Chinese visitors to continue to drop for Google and for advertisers to turn to local choices like Baidu .
“ This does n’t really change anything about Google ’s position in China .
The redirection to its Hong Kong site is ongoing so it is the same problem as before , ” said Leung .
Google ’s difficulties in China come at a time when investors are concerned that the company ’s growth rate is slowing .
Google faces a plethora of regulatory inquiries and is spending heavily on new but unproven businesses , such as its Android mobile operating system .
Its stock is hovering at its lowest level since September 2009 , and has declined 26 percent in 2010 .
“ Google has been a company which people have invested in because they expected the company to outstrip expectations -- and it ’s not that company anymore , ” said Hamilton Faber , an analyst at Atlantic Equities .
Its “ growth outlook is certainly slowing from where we were a few years back .
The company seems to be back on the path of heavy levels of investment .
We are back into a situation where margins are declining , ” Faber said .
China offers
Google huge arena for growth .
With nearly 400 million users , China has an Internet penetration rate of 25 percent with huge market opportunities in search , e-commerce and online gaming , analysts said .
“ China does n’t necessarily want Google to exit the country .
China just wants to exert its control over Google in its country , ” said Colin Gillis , BGC Financial ’s research director .
He said disputes between Google and China over censorship could flare up again .
“ It ’s going to continue to be a distraction for management .
It may look like a positive for now , but it does n’t change the fact that Google is still offering uncensored results , ” Gillis said .
“ It ’s going to continue to be a drag on management ’s focus .
“ In our opinion , there is no chance for Google to earn profits in China in the near term , ” Gillis said .
So , the clean - up of BPs Gulf oil spill may cost U.S. taxpayers after all .
President Obama has insisted BP would bear the entire cost of cleaning up the spill and making the injured business and wildlife whole again .
And yet BP said today it plans to cut $ 9.9 billion off its tax billbased on the $ 32.2 billion charge it is expecting to take from the costs of the Gulf oil spill .
That means that $ 9.9 billion that might have been going into the federal governments general fund will be used to cut BP 's spill ...

You guys !
Check out this amazing homemade high chair .
It looks exactly like a giraffe – well , maybe a bit shorter but otherwise so lifelike !
I wish I could tell you where you can go buy one of these .
Unfortunately it ’s a custom piece of furniture that a friend of my brother - in - law ’s made for his granddaughter .
I imagine the baby who enjoys this beautiful chair will either grow to love giraffes or to be scared of them …hopefully the first !
But I would definitely argue that this giraffe high chair is the coolest thing ever .
Update : I ca n’t believe how many people have expressed an interest in purchasing a handmade giraffe high chair in the blog comments .
Unfortunately I ’m sure it would be thousands of dollars , if you could even find someone to do it .
Enjoy !
Today I found out how the completely blind dream .
It turns out that if they went completely blind before around the age of 5 - 7 years old , they will typically dream without any visual experiences .
In the very few cases where some report having visual experiences in their dreams , these experiences are more in the abstract sense where they feel like they were seeing something , even though they could n’t actually recollect or describe when they woke up what the thing looked liked that they saw .
This is similar to how occasionally in dreams you can just “ know ” something , even though there is nothing specifically that you are experiencing in the dream which should indicate what you know .
For instance , in a dream where when you wake up , you remember feeling like you were in danger in the dream , even though nothing you can recall in the dream indicated any danger .
There was just some abstract sense of it .
Outside of the interesting “ around the age of 5 - 7 ” cutoff for visual dream experiences , the dreams of those who are completely blind before this age tend to be principally auditory in nature .
However , what is also fascinating is that , compared to those who can see and hear , the blind report drastically increased taste / smell / touch sensations in their dreams , not just auditory sensations taking over for the lack of visual sensations .
Now if they go completely blind after around the age of 5 - 7 , the vast majority of completely blind people will at first dream very similar dreams to those who are not blind , albeit , once again , with more non-visual sensory experiences than is reported by those who can see and hear .
But nevertheless , their visual experiences in their dreams tend to be quite similar to those who can see .
If they had diminished vision early on in life though , perhaps only seeing colors , then their visual experiences in their dreams tend to be similarly diminished based on those visual experiences .
As time passes , they typically will report more and more prevalence of experiences from the other senses and less and less visual experiences in dreams .
Often the visual experiences will become more vague and “ blurry ” as time passes , but they do seem to remain to some extent throughout the blind person ’s entire life .
Bonus Facts :
Rapid eye movements ( REMs ) during sleep occur very mildly and often not at all in people blinded before around the age of five to seven .
Before her teacher first came to her , Helen Keller , in her autobiography , stated that her dreams were devoid of any kind of sound / sight / thought / etc. and only contained fear and strong abstract sensations .
She states , “ My dreams have strangely changed during the past twelve years .
Before and after my teacher first came to me , they were devoid of sound , of thought or emotion of any kind , except fear , and only came in the form of sensations .
I would often dream that I ran into a still , dark room , and that , while I stood there , I felt something fall heavily without any noise , causing the floor to shake up and down violently ; and each time I woke up with a jump .
As I learned more and more about the objects around me , this strange dream ceased to haunt me ; but I was in a high state of excitement and received impressions very easily .
It is not strange then that I dreamed at the time of a wolf , which seemed to rush towards me and put his cruel teeth deep into my body !
I could not speak ( the fact was , I could only spell with my fingers ) , and I tried to scream ; but no sound escaped from my lips .
It is very likely that I had heard the story of Red Riding Hood , and was deeply impressed by it .
This dream , however , passed away in time , and I began to dream of objects outside myself . ”
Deaf people experience a parallel effect in their dreams as blind people .
Those who ’ve been deaf from early childhood do n’t hear sounds in their dreams and people talking in their dreams do so in sign language .
Their dreams have also been shown to be much more vivid in terms of imagery and colors than people who can hear and see .
People who lucidly dream are called “ oneironauts ” .
This is from the Greek “ Oneirology ” meaning “ the study of dreams ” .
During sleep , with your eyes being closed , all sensory signals except the sense of smell end up passing through your thalamus .
During your sleep cycle , the brain suppresses thalamic activity and thus principally only processes signals from itself .
Long story short , some researchers believe that this suppressed input and output creates neural oscillations , which may be the source of dreams .
Another theory , suggested by Eugen Tarnow , is that dreams are simply excitations of long - term memories , but without the normal executive brain function that interprets long term memory through a “ reality check ” sort of filter .
This is somewhat based on researchers Penfield and Rasmussen ’s study showing that stimulating the cortex with electrical pulses will produce a waking dream - like experience .
Many researchers believe that dreaming is part of some sort of mechanism for setting the day ’s activities more firmly in long term memory , although the mechanism for how this is actually taking place is somewhat of a mystery .
However , a 2001 study seems to have shed some light on what might be happening here .
According to this study , during REM sleep , higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol cause decreased activity between the hippocampus and neocortex .
These researchers theorize that , similar to what happens when some memory is created when one is experiencing something in the waking world under stress , once memories are linked with similar memories during sleep , the stress hormone that shows up during REM sleep works to firmly set the links and memory in place .
Blind people obviously have a very different sense of how they find something “ pretty ” or “ ugly ” .
In doing research for this article , it was interesting to note that several blind people I read about found things “ pretty ” or not based on how smooth the object was , with the more smooth something is the more pretty it is .
I ’m curious from any blind readers of this article if you also find things pretty or ugly based on smoothness and if this is as common as it seemed from my readings ?

Bob Lawless points me to this 2006 blog post by Elizabeth Warren .
Warren describes a first - year contracts class on the case that upheld a fine - print forum selection clause ( a clause saying that if you want to sue us , you have to sue us in X jurisdiction – Florida , in this case ) on the back of a cruise ship ticket .
Warren ’s entire class ( Harvard , let me say for the record ) insists that , as a factual matter , this decision is good for consumers because . . . well , regular readers of this blog should be able to fill in stock Mickey Mouse economistic hand - waving as well as any first - year law school student .
Of course !
Forcing people to sue in Florida ( or to accept binding arbitration in the forum of the company ’s choice ) deters frivolous lawsuits and lowers costs for the company , and it can pass those savings onto consumers .
Why does it pass those savings onto consumers instead of putting them into shareholders ’ ( or managers ’ ) pockets ?
Because in a perfect competitive market , if Alpha Cruise Lines does n’t , then Beta Cruise Lines will , and Beta will underprice Alpha , . . .
Consumers will read the fine print and can make an informed choice between the lower price with the forum selection clause and the higher price without the forum selection clause .
Anyway , this is what Warren ’s post is about–how people think that logical inferences from unrealistic assumptions somehow produce “ facts . ”
And it is n’t just first - year law students .
I ’m reminded of Frank Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit asserting that sophisticated investors ensure that prices are set rationally , protecting unsophisticated investors–on the basis of a single , purely theoretical law review article ( those in the legal world will appreciate the italics ) .
This is , in a nutshell , why the field of economics has been able to do so much damage in just a few decades–at the same time that economic thinking itself has become much richer ( think Akerlof , Stiglitz , Kahneman and Tversky , Ariely , Levitt - Wolfers - Ayres - Donohue , Duflo , etc. ) and probably better as well .
I ’d like to say that Yale is better , but my contracts class had its own Mickey Mouse economics as well –which I felt compelled to respond to here .
( Actually , Yale is better–just not along that particular dimension . )
I wrote a post last week headlined " Will There Be an ' Inception ' Backlash Before the Movie Even Opens ? "
And the answer , of course , is ... yes .
New York magazine 's David Edelstein , normally a man of considerable sanity ( not to mention wealth and taste ) , not only took a few roundhouse swings at Chris Nolan 's upcoming thriller , but also managed to take some swipes at his critical peers , not to mention Nolan fans themselves , in a barbed review that was instantly flamed by tons of Nolan acolytes .
Here 's how Edelstein led off his review :
" With its dreams , dreams within dreams , and dreams within dreams within dreams , Christopher Nolan ’s Inception manages to be clunky and confusing on four separate levels of reality — while out here , in this even more perplexing dream we call ' life , ' it ’s being hailed as a masterpiece on the order of ' 2001 : A Space Odyssey . '
Slap !
Wake up , people !
Shalalala ! Slap ! "
It only went downhill from there , with Edelstein mocking Nolan 's lofty ambitions ( " So it 's , like , ' Mission Impossible ' in the ' Dreamscape - Matrix ! ' " ) while dissing the director as being " too literal - minded , too caught up in ticktock logistics , to make a great , untethered dream movie . "
And as for the people , like his fellow critics , who 've been over the moon about the film ?
Edelstein thinks they 're cracked , or as he put it : " It 's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that ' Inception ' is a visionary masterpiece and -- hold on ...
Whoa !
I think I get it .
The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype - - a metaphor for itself . "
I give Edelstein points for lively writing , but in an era where critics have enough credibility issues as it is , the last thing we need is a critic thrashing a film because , in part , he 's chagrined to see it get so much open adulation .
If you want to write that after the movie has opened , fair enough .
But it 's the wrong stance to take before people have even had a chance to make up their own minds .
As it happens , Edelstein's own readers gave him quite a spanking , calling him a charlatan , a schoolyard bully and , well , even worse .
As one reader put it : " You know , it 's fine to dislike a movie that many other people like .
But to call them all delusional because they have a differing opinion is terribly arrogant of you .
Shame on you , sir !
Go back to watching ' Avatar ' and its easy - to - understand eye - candy . "
According to another reader , Edelstein 's condescending dismissal of the movie 's supporters " makes you even worse than [ fabled contrarian film critic ] Armond White , " which in critical circles is faint praise indeed .
So far , all Edelstein has accomplished is lowering " Inception 's " initial Rotten Tomatoes score from 100 to 97 .
But now that the backlash has officially begun , I suspect it will go lower still .
Apparently , there is no greater sin than for a filmmaker to make a movie that some people just like too much .

This meme started when a student at NTNU lost his pulse watch after a trainingsession at university and sent out a e-mail to every single student at the university ( 20 k+ students ) where he asked if anyone had seen / stolen it .
A sarcastic group was then started on facebook " Vi som IKKE har tatt , men vil hjelpe Gard Olve med å finne pulsklokken " http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=125328430818220#!/group.php?gid=125328430818220
( We who DIDN 'T steal , but want to help Gard Olve finding his stolen pulse watch )
The group started out small , but has at this moment reached over 2 k members .
A lot of them are posting images of the watch in question combined with other memes ,
NOTE : The group is now over 6,000 members strong .
The red supergiant variable star Betelgeuse , estimated to be 530 light years from Earth ( although measurements by different means vary from 495LY to 640LY ; 530LY is considered the " best compromise " measurement ) is the ninth brightest star in the sky , the ninth largest star known to exist in the universe , and has the third largest apparent size as observed from Earth of any known star , after the Sun and R Doradus , which is almost three times closer to Earth .
R Doradus is believed to lie 200 +/- 25 LY from Earth , and has an angular diameter of approximately 0.057 arcseconds , making it roughly 370 times the diameter of the Sun , or about 3.46 AU , where one AU is the average radius of Earth 's orbit .
Placed where the Sun is , R Doradus would contain all of the inner planets and most of the main asteroid belt .
Betelgeuse 's angular diameter of just under 0.055 arcseconds makes it almost three times larger , 950 to 1000 times larger than the Sun ( 8.8 to 9.3 AU , or roughly to the orbit of Saturn ) .
It is one of only about a dozen stars whose apparent size is so large it has been imaged telescopically as a visible disk rather than a point .
Why is this important ?
Well , you see , Betelgeuse has been shrinking continuously since 1993 , at an increasing rate .
By June 2009 , it had shrunk 15 % from its size as measured in 1993 .
But wait !
There 's more .
It is rumored , though I have been unable to find any reliable confirmation of the source ( which is claimed to be first - hand ) that the latest observations from Mauna Kea show that Betelgeuse is now shrinking so fast it is no longer round .
( Due to conservation of angular momentum , when a massive star collapses gravitationally , it collapses faster at the poles , becoming increasingly oblate — flattened — as its final collapse accelerates . )
What does this mean ?
Well , briefly , what it means — if true — is that Betelgeuse could be within as little as weeks of a Type II ( core collapse ) supernova .
( Astronomers have considered for some time that Betelgeuse has the potential to go supernova any time in the next thousand years or so .
" Any time " may just turn out to be rather sooner than expected . )
IF this happens , not to put too fine a point on it , it will almost undoubtedly be among the most dramatic astronomical events ever observed by human eyes .
A type II supernova can briefly outshine an entire galaxy ... and this one will be only a little over five hundred LY away .
The supernova that created the Crab Nebula , SN 1054 , was bright enough to see in daylight for 23 days , and remained visible for 653 days ... and it was 6,300 LY away .
Betelgeuse is almost 12 times closer , and can be expected to appear around 140 times brighter by virtue of that alone .
And as noted at the beginning of this post , Betelgeuse is the ninth largest star known to exist in the universe .
If the rumor is true , this is going to be one hell of a show , and we 'll have a front - row seat .
( Relatively speaking . )
( Do n't panic , though .
It is not believed that a Betelgeuse supernova would present any threat to Earth , and we 're not anywhere near Betelgeuse 's axis of rotation and therefore in no danger from a gamma-ray burst . )
Clarifications :
When we say Betelgeuse " is within a few weeks of " going supernova , what we really mean is the light front from the speculative supernova is a few weeks from reaching Earth .
If the rumored Mauna Kea observations are both true and correct , we can infer that in fact , Betelgeuse already went supernova about 530 - 540 years ago , and the light from the final stages of collapse leading up to the supernova are just now reaching Earth .
It should also be observed , as Dan Neely points out in comments , that the brightness estimates in the doomers .us article are wildly exaggerated .
Supernova SN1054 is estimated to have been around apparent magnitude - 6 ; the 11.9:1 distance ratio alone between Betelgeuse and the Crab Nebula would be expected to put a Betelgeuse supernova in the - 11 to - 12 range .
Supernova SN1006 , however , is estimated to have reached apparent magnitude - 7.5 , despite being a thousand light years further away than SN1054 ; if SN1054 and SN1006 had the same absolute luminosity , SN1006 's apparent brightness would have been only around three quarters that of SN1054 , whereas in fact it is believed to have been around four times brighter .
This would imply that SN1006's absolute luminosity was around 5.2 times higher than SN1054's .
If we assume that the speculative supernova SN2010A is no brighter in absolute luminosity than SN1006 , its distance means it could approach apparent magnitude - 14 , about 2.5 times brighter than the full Moon .
The Sun 's magnitude - 26.7 , though , is FAR out of reach .
( As also pointed out by Dan , one also cannot directly compare Betelgeuse to SN1006 , as SN1006 was a Type 1a supernova .
Nevertheless , it serves as a useful yardstick for this purpose . )
Update ( finally , solid data ! )
20100601 -22:02 : However much fun it would have been to watch the light show , it seems finally a reputable source , the Bad Astronomy Blog on discovermagazine.com , has weighed in .
And , as most of us expected from the start , the original rumor is just that and nothing more :
An unsubstantiated rumor .
There 's no actual new observations of Betelgeuse that would suggest it's any closer to going supernova than we already believed it was 20 years ago .
" No BOOM ! today . "
I can't say I 'm surprised , but I 'll admit to being a little disappointed .
A relatively nearby supernova would have been a truly memorable event .
Ah , well .
Just remember —
" There 's always a BOOM ! tomorrow .
Sooner or later ... BOOM ! "
about skating in Golden Gate Park as they are today .
The San Francisco Recreation and Parks Dept. built a roller rink in the park where people could rent skates .
It was considered the elagant , even chic thing to do .
In 1894 , the Midwinter International Exposition was held in the park , giving us what is now the Japanese Tea Garden and the M.H. de Young Museum .
In 1906 , the earthquake and fire turned the park into a temporary haven for approximately 200,000 people left homeless by the disaster .
By 1967 , as the hippies were flocking to the Haight Ashbury in the Summer of Love , John F. Kennedy Drive , the main road in Golden Gate Park , was closed to all car traffic on Sundays .
It was the closing of this road to traffic would one day lead to the biggest explosion of skating anyone could ever imagine .
I
Skating did n't see really big numbers rolling in the park until about 1978 .
This is when the first skate vendor trucks began to line up along Fulton St .
The summer of 1979 saw estimates of 15,000 to 20,000 skaters using Golden Gate Park on Sundays .
There were over 35 skate vendor trucks that rented skates alongside the park border , each truck containing between 200 and 500 pairs of skates .
The free enterprise system was in full force .
Skate rental trucks would park along the border of the park every Sunday .
Soon there were complaints .
People who lived in the neighborhood complained of skaters doing everything from parking in their driveways to urinating on their premises .
The numbers of injuries became a serious strain on the San Francisco Ambulance Service .
The question of what to do about the skaters was soon before the Recreation and Parks Commission .
The media called it " The Great Skate Debate " .
The sentiment to ban skating in Golden Gate Park was very strong .
After months of public discussion and meetings , the Recreation and Parks Department designated four ( 4 ) areas in the park where skating would be prohibited .
The Conservatory of Flowers , the Music Concourse , Stow Lake and Children 's Playground are known worldwide and are very busy with pedestrian traffic every day .
If skaters could not be kept out of these areas , the Recreation and Parks Commission would recommend a total skate ban in the park .
Peter Ashe , Assistant Recreation and Parks Superintendent presented the idea of forming a " skate patrol " that would keep skaters out of the restricted areas .
Each skate vendor truck provided two ( 2 ) skaters to volunteer for " roller patrol " duty .
A total of sixty ( 60 ) skaters were gathered and made up the first skate patrol .
Eventually , the city passed an ordinance banning all " recreational equipment vendors " ( skate trucks ) from operating in San Francisco , but the skaters stayed together and became the Golden Gate Park Skate Patrol .
The Golden Gate Park Skate Patrol - July , 1979
James Johnson was and STILL IS high jump champion of Golden Gate Park .
His record stands at 4ft. 8in. without a ramp .
In the late 1970's and into the 1980 's roller disco was king .
The skaters would gather in the park on the bridge between 8th and 10th Ave. on JFK Drive .
The area was smooth and formed a natural outdoor roller rink .
Every skaters that could boast even the weakest of moves would be there every Sunday .
If you did n't like to skate in one spot , there was " Dr. Funk " .
He would lead what was called " The Blood Clot " This was a group of skaters ( mostly African American ) who would skate up and down JFK Drive dancing to the beat from Dr. Funk 's gigantic boom box .
This was an era of magic , but it could not last forever .
By the mid 80's the numbers of skaters began to drop .
Skateboarding and BMX bikes began to rise and outnumber the skaters .
We were now all sharing the same space on the bridge with other every form of wheeled contraption known to man .
The skaters had to find a space of their own .
In 1985 , David Miles , the Skate Patrol Coordinator , worked with the Park Planner Deborah Learner to permanently close off 6th Ave and Kennedy Drive .
The idea was to create a permanent place for skating in Golden Gate Park that could be used every day anytime .
At the time the area was being used by only a few skaters who did n't like the big crowds .
The closure began as a 30 day trial closure .
That was extended to 60 days and then 90 days .
Finally , the area was relandscaped and repaved with smooth asphalt to make it look and feel more like an outdoor roller rink .
In the next few years it would become the center of roller skating in Northern California .
Lateef and Clair were the first skaters to use 6th Ave. for skating on a regular basis .
If you have a pair of skates and are ready to boogie , THIS is the place to be on a Sunday afternoon .
Although roller skating did experience a dramatic drop in numbers nationwide , you could always find roller skaters at 6th Ave. or " Skatin ' Place " as some have called it .
By 1988 Rollerblades hit the scene .
A lot of roller skaters rediscovered the sport through inlines .
Skate moves that were strictly for roller skates were now being done on inline skates .
The numbers at 6th Ave. began to grow and grow .
History was repeating itself in 1991 exactly 100 years since John McLaren built the first roller rink in Golden Gate Park as thousands began flocking to park again to skate , dance and groove to the music .
The skate area at 6th Ave. and Kennedy Drive is the center of activity for recreational park users on a Sunday Afternoon .
Here we are presenting the Red Bull Great Skate Freestyle Roller Dance Championships .
Most people coming out to skate these days do n't realize the history behind the skating they are so lucky to be able to enjoy .
There is n't enough time for me to tell the whole story .
In 2003 the skate area was transformed again making it bigger , wider and smoother than ever before .
It will serves as an example to every city who wants to bring this fun , exciting and healthy experience to their area .
Venice Beach has one .
New YORK
City has on as well .
Hopefully it is only a matter of time until every city has on .
Keep Rollin ' , D. Miles Jr .

It ’s one thing to block Elizabeth Warren from heading the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .
It ’s quite another thing to deny in public , for the record , that any such blocking is going on ( e.g. , see this report ; Michael Barr apparently said something quite similar today ) .
There is a strong groundswell of opinion on this issue from the left – see the BoldProgressives petition .
But the center also feels strongly that , given everything Treasury has said and done over the past few months , it would be a complete travesty not to put the strongest possible regulator in change of protecting consumers .
( See Ted Kaufman on the NYT ’s DealBook , giving appropriate credit to the SEC , and apply the same points to broader customer issues going forward . )
This can now go only one of two ways .
Elizabeth Warren gets the job .
Bridges are mended and the White House regains some political capital .
Secretary Geithner is weakened slightly but he ’ll recover .
Someone else gets the job , despite Treasury ’s claims that Elizabeth Warren was not blocked .
The deception in this scenario would be nauseating – and completely blatant .
“ Everyone was considered on their merits ” and “ the best candidate won ” will convince who exactly ?
Despite the growing public reaction , outcome # 2 is the most likely and the White House needs to understand this , plain and clear – there will be complete and utter revulsion at its handling of financial regulatory reform both on this specific issue and much more broadly .
The administration ’s position in this area is already weak , its achievements remain minimal , its speaking points are lame , and the patience of even well - inclined people is wearing thin .
Failing to appoint Elizabeth Warren would be the straw that breaks the camel ’s back .
It will go down in the history books as a turning point – downwards – for this administration .
You can tell the bestest rides by the lines .

( Newser ) – The man charged with firing on Oakland cops in a highway shootout was on a rampage against liberals and hunting down Glenn Beck enemies .
Unemployed carpenter Byron Williams was after the ACLU and the Tides Foundation , a particular favorite villain of Glenn Beck , who has repeatedly lambasted the organization as part of President Obama 's " liberal cabal . "
Williams opened fire on cops earlier this week while on his way to " start a revolution " because he was upset about Congress ' " left - wing agenda , " according to his mom .
It 's too early to know if Beck 's attacks were the inspiration for Williams , but the relatively obscure Tides Foundation is n't likely viewed as much of an enemy beyond Glenn Beck 's fan base .
The group , which describes itself as a promoter of economic justice , robust democracy and a healthy environment , has been ripped repeatedly by Beck as an " army of thugs " behind Obama 's agenda , and the " nasty of the nastiest , " reports Talking Points Memo .

A long campaign is coming to an end after approval was given Friday for the creation of an internet domain dedicated to pornography .
Net overseer Icann ( Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ) is having a conference in Brussels , where the earth was presumably moved by the news , as initial approval was granted for that elusive .xxx domain .
ICM Registry , which is firmly behind the domain , said .xxx makes it easier to filter out inappropriate content .
Chairman Stuart Lawley claimed it was , “ great news for those that wish to consume , or avoid , adult content . ”
Lawley expects to make $ 30 million a year in revenue by selling each .xxx site for $ 60 — and pledged to donate $ 10 from each sale to child protection initiatives .
ICM expects the first .xxx domains to go up early next year and has over 110,000 pre-reservations for .xxx domains .
So it looks like a happy ending for .xxx : in 2005 initial approval was given but then rescinded following protests from conservative groups .
But in light of a panel of U.S. judges ruling in February 2010 that Icann erred in denying approval , Friday ’s decision is n’t entirely unexpected .
Whether porn on the internet takes off remains to be seen …
The Library of Congress is fascinating – kind of a miniature portrait of U.S. history .
It has existed for almost as long as Congress itself , has suffered in war and felt the pinch of recession , serves as a repository of many of our national treasures , and in its very design and decoration reflects our both the universality of our ideals and the limited range of our vision .
It should also , by certain “ strict constructions ” of the Constitution , not exist .
The Library was created by an act of Congress in 1800 to be , essentially , a legal reference library for members of the legislature .
But the dirty British burned it down in the War of 1812 ; Thomas Jefferson , in retirement at Monticello and somewhat strapped for cash , offered to sell Congress his 7,000 - volume collection as a replacement .
This sparked something of a debate in the chambers of the legislature — why , many asked , should the Congress purchase books on architecture and astronomy and theology for what was supposed to be a law library ?
But Jefferson , a good salesman , answered that he could not think of any subject that was not relevant to lawmaking .
His argument carried the day , and his eclectic tastes molded the character of the new library .
That was in 1815 , and for 50 years the Library labored under a number of difficulties : it faced competition from the Smithsonian Institution , which was jockeying to become the national library ; it was underfunded ; an 1851 fire destroyed two thirds of the collection , including most of Jefferson ’s original endowment ; and during the Civil War it became , needless to say , a less than urgent priority for the federal government .
But after the war , Congress chose as its Librarian the splendidly - named Ainsworth Rand Spofford , an able manager and apt politician who radically revised the role of the Library , asked for and received funding for vast new facilities , assumed control of the Copyright Office , and generally exploded the LOC into a massive federal spending program .
( Well , you know — massive for a library .
Still tiny by the standards of , say , the War Department . )
The part about the Copyright Office is especially worth noting , because Spofford got it by promising to administer copyrights for “ free ” — i.e. , with no additional appropriations — in exchange for being allowed to take keep two copies of every text registered for copyright .
This had the effect of massively expanding the Library ’s collection , of course , which right away ought to have clued Congress in to the fact that this was going to cost them more money .
But the promise of “ free ” administration allowed them to pretend they were getting something for nothing , and it allowed the LOC to grow into something larger and more useful — our national library .
Unfortunately , there is no provision in the Constitution that allows for the creation of a national library .
And recently some , er , Tenth Amendment enthusiasts have been making the claim that said amendment prohibits Congress from doing anything not specifically mentioned in the Constitution — especially anything as dangerous to the Republic as regulating health care .
And , in fact , they may be right .
Here is the text of that Amendment :
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
A literal reading of that text is kind of a bummer for all those liberals who spend their nights dreaming of eco-sustainable flying cars powered by the sheer authority of the federal government .
Apparently that source of energy is smaller than we had at first thought .
Here ’s a section of the Constitution detailing Congress ’s powers , laid out by our infallible Founders in convenient bullet - point format .
I wo n’t quote the whole thing here , but go ahead — click the link and have a read .
Seriously , come on .
It ’s one short section in the world ’s shortest written constitution .
I ’ll wait .
…
[ whistles jaunty tune ]
…
Now , you might be thinking that such phrases as “ provide for the… general welfare ” and “ all Laws which shall be necessary and proper ” allow the federal government to just go around imposing its will on the states and taxing us to pay for such things as health care and President Obama ’s secret plan to build a mosque in every town square in America .
Not so , says some lawyer interviewed by a news service I ’ve never heard of .
According to CNSNews.com ,
David B. Rivkin , a constitutional lawyer with Baker & Hostetler , told CNSNews.com that [ Democrat Steny ]
Hoyer ’s argument was “ silly , ” adding that if the general welfare clause was that elastic , then nothing would be outside of Congress ’ powers .
“ Congressman Hoyer is wrong , ” Rivkin said .
“ The notion that the general welfare language is a basis for a specific legislative exercise is all silly because if that ’s true , because general welfare language is inherently limitless , then the federal government can do anything .
“ The arguments are , I believe , feeble , ” he said .
As if to back up this randomly - quoted guy from some website , no less a figure than Jefferson himself also took a hard line with regard to the Tenth Amendment in the Kentucky Resolution of 1798 ( against the Alien and Sedition Acts ) :
Resolved ,
That the construction applied by the General Government … to those parts of the Constitution of the United States which delegate to Congress a power “ to lay and collect taxes , duties , imports , and excises , to pay the debts , and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States , ” and “ to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution , the powers vested by the Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof , ” goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to their powers by the Constitution : that words meant by the instrument to be subsidiary only to the execution of limited powers , ought not to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited powers , nor a part to be so taken as to destroy the whole residue of that instrument … .
Powerful stuff .
Jefferson clearly did n’t want those phrases to be interpreted to mean that the federal government had unlimited powers .
And just to clarify , he added :
Resolved ,
That the Constitution of the United States , having delegated to Congress a power to punish treason , counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States , piracies , and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations , and no other crimes , whatsoever ; [ cites the 10th Amendment specifically ] … therefore the act of Congress … intituled “ An Act to punish frauds committed on the bank of the United States , ” ( and all their other acts which assume to create , define , or punish crimes , other than those so enumerated in the Constitution , ) are altogether void , and of no force ; and that the power to create , define , and punish such other crimes is reserved , and , of right , appertains solely and exclusively to the respective States , each within its own territory .
This sounds pretty bad on the surface — it sounds like Thomas Jefferson , practically the face of republican democracy , did n’t think much of using the “ General Welfare ” clause to justify any and all acts of Congress , and that he was especially cranky about the federal government defining new crimes ( such as , for example , making it a punishable offense not to have health insurance ) .
But Jefferson , especially as played by Stephen Dillane on The Sopranos , was always a bit of a reckless revolutionary , more inclined to ideological absolutism and resounding rhetoric than the nuts and bolts of practical lawmaking .
The above business about the federal government ’s ability to define crimes , for example , is clearly nonsense : if Congress has the right to create a national bank , for example , it obviously has the right to outlaw fraud against it and to prosecute said fraud .
Who else , exactly , would prosecute fraud against a national institution ?
Jefferson was a kind of prose berserker , a man who never let mundane realities curb his philosophical posturing , which is why he was the perfect person to write the Declaration of Independence — a florid recitation of grievances and an appeal to high - minded principles — and why the Constitution , on the other hand , was written by more sober , thoughtful , legalistic authors .
Largely unencumbered by any petty drive to moral or intellectual consistency , Jefferson was able to appeal to both God and nature in his condemnation of the slave trade in the original draft of the Declaration while simultaneously exploiting slaves for profit until the end of his life .
Similarly , Jefferson was a fan of limited and enumerated powers when the federal government tried to trample on established rights ( as in the Alien and Sedition Acts ) .
But he saw no great threat to democracy in letting the Congress buy his books and help pay his debts — even if he had to resort to a sophist ’s trick to justify the purchase .
When his ire was up and his principles were outraged , he was an anti-federalist and a libertarian ; but under ordinary circumstances , he was as interested as anyone else in a little government largesse .
And Jefferson was one of the strictest of the Founders when it came to the Tenth Amendment — like some today , he was even in favor of state nullification of improper federal laws .
Others among the Revolutionaries and the Framers were less sure that the Tenth Amendment meant what Jefferson seemed to think it did .
Alexander Hamilton , debating Jefferson on the constitutionality of a central bank , noted that :
Congress , says he [ Jefferson ] , are not to lay taxes ad libitum , for any purpose they please , but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the Union .
Certainly no inference can be drawn from this against the power of applying their money for the institution of a bank .
It is true that they cannot without breach of trust lay taxes for any other purpose than the general welfare ; but so neither can any other government .
The welfare of the community is the only legitimate end for which money can be raised on the community .
Congress can be considered as under only one restriction which does not apply to other governments , they cannot rightfully apply the money they raise to any purpose merely or purely local .
But , with this exception , they have as large a discretion in relation to the application of money as any legislature whatever .
The constitutional test of a right application must always be , whether it be for a purpose of general or local nature .
If the former , there can be no want of constitutional power .
The quality of the object as how far it will really promote or not the welfare of the Union must be matter of conscientious discretion , and the arguments for or against a measure in this light must be arguments concerning expediency or inexpediency , not constitutional right .
Whatever relates to the general order of the finances , to the general interests of trade , etc. , being general objects , are constitutional ones for the Application of money .
Hamilton , an avowed Federalist , was of course vastly more comfortable with a strong central government than was Jefferson .
But he was also much more involved in the drafting of the Constitution and therefore presumably in somewhat better position to interpret its more ambiguous clauses .
Nor was Hamilton alone in finding implied powers in the Constitution .
“ Brutus , ” one of the anonymous authors of the Anti-Federalist Papers , noted unhappily in AFP # 84 that Section 9 of Article 1 seems to directly imply powers not enumerated in Section 8 :
We find they have , in the ninth section of the first article declared , that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless in cases of rebellion , - that no bill of attainder , or ex post facto law , shall be passed , - that no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States , etc .
If every thing which is not given is reserved , what propriety is there in these exceptions ?
Does this Constitution any where grant the power of suspending the habeas corpus , to make ex post facto laws , pass bills of attainder , or grant titles of nobility ?
It certainly does not in express terms .
The only answer that can be given is , that these are implied in the general powers granted .
Two points , then , emerge out of the swirling darkness of our constitutional history .
The first is that Jefferson and other anti-federalists were correct : institutions created by government have a way of taking on a life of their own , and an act as simple as establishing a law library for the members of Congress can lead to the creation of a large and permanent organ of governance , with a meaningful budget and actual legal powers .
When you interpret governmental powers broadly , you run the risk of unintended consequences .
But Hamilton was right , too : by allowing the government latitude and discretion to “ provide for the national defence and the general welfare , ” you allow a flexibility that simply ca n’t be achieved by trying to add or subtract enumerated powers through a cumbersome constitutional amendment system .
Today ’s world , it is perhaps too easy to note , would have been completely unimaginable to the authors of the Constitution ; Jefferson called them “ demi-gods , ” but even those Herculean thinkers in knee - britches could n’t possibly have thought of everything a modern government might be called on to do .
In their world , “ health care , ” a term which did not exist , would have meant a doctor to hold your hand and comfort you at the absolute best , leeches and the theory of humors at worst .
Here is a list of things Congress ought not to be allowed to do if we do not read the General Welfare clause broadly and wield the 10th Amendment lightly :
Build interstate highways .
Maintain an air force or , arguably , any sort of standing army .
Provide social security benefits .
Regulate local ( i.e. , non-interstate ) pollution .
Regulate food and drug safety as long as the products are n’t sold across state lines .
Build monuments .
Define federal crimes .
Investigate federal crimes ( goodbye , FBI ! ) .
Create national parks .
Declare holidays .
Engage in disaster management .
Fund medical and scientific research .
Subsidize farmers .
Authorize civilian agencies to gather intelligence against foreign powers .
Declare commissions on pornography .
Found a national library .
Many people would like to get rid of some of the above government programs and practices ; it ’s a rare bird who wants to get rid of all of them .
And so , as Hamilton argued , we should confine our arguments to “ expediency or inexpediency , ” and not get bogged down in narrow definitions of “ constitutionality . ”
It might be best for us to admit that the Constitution is , in places , quite poorly written and poorly thought out , and even when it is not , it is often irrelevant .
The Supreme Court has more than once declared the Tenth Amendment to be very nearly a tautology — “ a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered . ”
To the degree that it is not tautological , it is fundamentally an obstruction to good governance and ought to be removed , or else amended so as not to be stupid .
It will not be removed or amended , of course , for the same reasons that the Second Amendment , now hopelessly outdated , will never be properly clarified — because the Bill of Rights is at this point a sacred text , and because 10 is a nice round number .
But the next time some nitwit governor or Tea Partier gets all sweaty and shiny - eyed at the prospect of invoking the Tenth Amendment as an end run around our national democratic process , just ask that person whether he ’s ready to give up everything on the above list .
( Hint : farm subsidies probably wo n’t be the first to go . )

The Elemental Workshop III is the third instalment in the Elemental Workshop quest series , wherein you discover more about Vitruvius and his apprentice , as well as gaining access to another vital part of the workshop .
Contents show ]
Official description
A number of restored texts have been made available in the Seers ' Village chapel , and one stands apart from the others .
In a book embossed with a curious pattern , the story of Vitruvius is continued , as he attempts to bring his assistant to life using the mysterious properties of the ' body ' .
There are lessons to be learned from this new book , as you put Vitruvius 's theories into practice again in the Elemental Workshop .
Only those with the ability to unravel the most devious puzzles may , perhaps , be able to unlock the workshop 's latest secret ...
Walkthrough
A dead shell
To begin , search the bookcases in the Seers ' Village church until you receive a ragged book .
The book develops on Vitruvius ' , and his assistant 's , story - Vitruvius unsuccessfully performs extensive experimentation on the primed bar holding his assistant 's consciousness , hoping to revert it into his body .
Broken but not defeated , he turns his focus on body runes with hopes to re-animate his assistant 's body .
Unfortunately , he was only able to generate enough ' body energy ' to revive a single arm , which reacted by flailing violently and attacking the assistant itself ; Vitruvius amputates the limb but vowed to re-arm his assistant one day .
Go to the workshop by clicking on the " odd looking wall " in the house with the anvil , and climbing down the stairs .
Now , obtain 3 elemental ores by killing a few earth elementals in the western chamber .
You must turn each of these ores into elemental bars , by using a piece of ore and four pieces of coal on a furnace - you may use the one in the southern chamber .
Make sure you 've read the book , and use the soft clay on the ragged book to make a key mould .
With the key mould in the inventory , use one elemental bar on the furnace to make a ragged elemental key .
Elemental energy
Climb down a level in the workshop and prime the remaining two elemental bars ( see primed bar on how to do this ) .
After you 've created the primed bars , head down another level and use the ragged elemental key to unlock the ' body ' door halfway down the hall on the west side .
You will now be in a large chamber with a small room in front of you , and a large , geared mechanism below it .
Proceed down the steps near the ' body ' door .
The purpose of this mechanism is to charge the body room above , with body energy and allowing you to convert a primed bar into a body bar .
Ultimately , you must lower the central tower , spin it , and raise it again - this process is depicted on a scroll that can be found inside a crate in the north - east corner .
Note that whenever you are on this floor , a magnifying glass icon appears in the upper - left part of the view .
Clicking this icon toggles between the normal view and a bird 's - eye view of the lower level , making it easier to move around the mechanism .
The body puzzle
The puzzle mechanism is in the form of a large square matrix , with levers located in series on every side of the matrix .
There are six initial geared blocks , a charging tower and an empty space inside the matrix .
Additionally , there are two counters lying on the left and right sides of the matrix , and a moving drive gear occupying a tile on the bottom - centre edge .
The objective of the puzzle is to form a connection of gears from the drive gear to the various key points in the matrix .
Upon entering the puzzle room , an interface will display the layout of the room and location of the levers .
You can control the levers by clicking on them within this interface ; you can also physically move around the room to pull the levers .
Moving a lever will slide all pieces perpendicular to that row ( or column ) of the lever , and in the row ( or column ) of the empty space , towards the empty space .
The counter above the matrix shows the allotted number of moves ; every pull of the lever that moves one or more tiles decreases the counter by one .
When the counter reaches 0 , no more pieces can be moved and the puzzle must be reset by pulling the reset lever next to the counter .
An undo lever is also provided ; however , it only has an undo-memory of one move .
Notes :
Make sure to change to the overhead view by using the magnifying glass button in the top - left corner of the screen .
To help you keep track of your progress in each section , you can click on the rows of letters and numbers to mark them up .
Using the undo option only undoes the last move made ; the move counter does not return the lost move .
However , the next move does not turn the counter .
After finishing a puzzle section , any unlocked progress ( extra moves or lowered towers ) is not lost if the reset lever is pulled .
There are several different possibilities for solving each section , and the solution provided may not be the shortest method .
As a quick reference , each of the levers have been assigned a number or a letter ( as shown in the image on the right ) .
Also note that pulling the lever on the opposite side of the matrix has the same effect .
The 2 - layered gear block
Objective : Connecting the driving motor block to the north terminal of the right - side counter .
To create the connection , pull the levers in the following order :
C , 2 , F , 6 C , 2 , F , 6 C , 2 , E , 5 B , 3 , F , 2 B , 3 , F , 2 E , 4 , F , 2
Once you have completed it successfully , a cutscene ensues showing a two - layered cog being lowered .
Reset the puzzle using the lever above the puzzle matrix .
50 move cap
Objective :
To connect the driving motor block to the south terminal of the right - side counter .
( This part of the puzzle is optional .
If you do choose to complete it , you will gain an extra 50 moves , which allows you to make a few mistakes in the next section without having to reset the puzzle . )
To create the connection , pull the levers in the following order :
5 , A , 6 , F 5 , A , 6 , F 5 , B , 6 , F 5 , C , 6 , F 5 , D , 6 , F 5 , E , 6 , F 5 , E , 3 , F 4 , E
Another solution , with less levers :
A , 5 , C , 6 B , 5 , D , 6 C , 5 , E , 6 C , 5 , F , 6 D , 5 , E , 3 F , 4 , E
When complete , your counter will now obtain a cap of 50 moves .
Pull the reset lever again .
Note that no cutscene would play after completing this ; the only notification for successful completion is the increased move cap .
The 3 - layered gear block
Objective :
To connect the driving motor block to the north terminal of the left - side counter .
To create the connection , pull the levers in the following order :
2 , B , 6 , A 5 , B , 6 , C 5 , B , 2 , C 5 , B , 3 , E 6 , F , 5 , B 3 , C , 6 , F 2 , C , 6 , E 3 , B , 5 , E 6 , F , 4 , E 6 , F , 4 , E 5
As you put the final block into place , a three - layered cog is lowered onto the matrix floor .
Pull the reset lever a third time .
Infinite moves
Objective :
To connect the driving motor block to the south terminal of the left - side counter .
To create the connection , pull the levers in the following order :
2 , C , 3 , B 2 , A , 3 , E 2 , B , 3 , F 2 , C , 3 , F 2 , C , 5 , F 2 , E
Completing this section puts the left counter out of order , providing you with infinite turns .
Pull the reset lever .
Lowering the tower
Objective :
To connect the driving motor block to the top - centre terminal of the matrix .
To create the connection , pull the levers in the following order :
B , 2 , A , 3 B , 2 , F , 6 B , 2 , D , 3 F , 6 , C , 5 D , 6 , F , 5 C , 6 , F , 2 E , 5 , F , 2 E , 5 , D , 6 F , 4 , E , 6
This effectively lowers the central tower .
Pull the reset lever .
Spinning the tower
Objective : Connecting the driving motor block to the central tower .
To create the connection , pull the levers in the following order :
4 , E , 6 , F 4 , E , 6 , A 5 , B , 6 , E 5 , A , 6 , F 5 , B , 2 , A 3 , B , 4 , C 2 , B , 6 , E 5 , C , 2 , D 3 , E , 5 , C 3 , F , 6
The middle tower should now be spinning .
Do not pull the reset lever - doing so will require you to get the tower spinning again .
Raising the tower
Objective : Raising the spinning tower back up to enable you to charge the room above with ' body ' energy .
Make sure that the puzzle looks exactly as shown in the above ' Spinning the tower ' step for the following instructions to work :
B 4 C 3
Instead , if you have a similar combination , but with the left and right sides inverted , use :
B 4 C 5
The tower should now be raised and the room charged with the ' body ' energy .
Do not pull the reset lever .
Body body
Go upstairs and insert one of the primed bars into the slot next to the door , to unlock the room .
Enter it , flip the lever to close the door and push the big red button to infuse the ' body ' energy into the primed bar and create a body bar .
Make sure the central tower is charged and in its highest position , or else the button will not be usable .
Hitting the button also temporarily drains your Defence by 33 , so if your level is below 66 you must use your restores or boosts now .
You need two body bars to complete the quest , hence you will need to recharge the room again by lowering , spinning and raising the central tower a second time .
Flip the lever to open the door and retrieve the body bar .
Go downstairs and pull the levers in the following order :
Guide position 2 ( The tower drops ) 4 , B ( The tower spins ) C , 3 ( The tower rises )
or
Inverse position 4 , 3 ( The tower drops ) 4 , B ( The tower spins ) C , 3 ( The tower rises )
Once you 've done this , head back upstairs and insert the second primed bar and repeat the steps to create the second body bar .
With the ragged book and two body bars , use a workbench on the first - level basement to smith the body body .
Congratulations , quest complete !

Trivia
When the quest first came out the spoiler reads :
The spoilers for this quest have been accidentally transferred into a primed metal bar .
Once we manage to reverse the machine 's polarity and modulate its frequency , we should be able to bring you the details .
The main puzzle of this quest used to take at least an hour , even when following a guide , because of all the running that was required , but this was eventually changed to a static interface in which you could complete the quest .
Upon completing the quest , your Adventurer 's Log says : " I used the machine found in the body room to make new body armour . "

As we reported this week , the Virginia - based law firm of Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver has filed suit against 14,583 anonymous " John Doe " P2P defendants in the first six months of 2010 .
The charge : sharing various indie films online without permission .
Once a
Doe 's identity is revealed by his or her Internet service providers , the lawyers then demand a settlement of between $ 1,500 and $ 2,500 , or they threaten to seek $ 150,000 in federal court .
Some users have been fighting back , trying to keep their identities a secret .
" Motions to quash " have dribbled into the Washington , DC District Court from around the country , several of them scrawled by hand .
Each contains a plea — one goes so far as to say that she is " now throwing myself on the mercy of the courts to have this [ subpoena ] quash or vactated . [ sic ] "
Lawyers are rarely involved , and the motions are badly formed , sometimes unsigned , often missing key sections or failing to address basic arguments .
They are the response of citizens who find themselves one day suddenly caught up in a federal lawsuit happening in Washington .
They are alternately weird , sad , or outraged .
What they are not is " effective . "
" Strong hardship for me "
In each of the cases it brings for its clients , Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver seeks subpoenas that convert IP addresses into real names and physical addresses .
These subpoenas go out to ISPs like Verizon , AT&T , and Time Warner Cable , who do the actual lookup .
Before sending back the requested information , though , the ISPs generally notify their customers about the subpoena in order to give them time to object to the court .
A handful — perhaps as many as two dozen total — have done so .
On April 2 , for instance , a handwritten two - page letter arrived at the DC District Court from one Gwen W. , who provided her full name and street address in Fort Wayne , Indiana .
The fact that Gwen 's " motion to quash " was meant to keep this very information private shows how little grasp of the legal process some of these respondents have ;
Gwen 's name and home address are now visible to the world through the court 's electronic PACER records system .
Gwen 's handwritten motion to quash , page one
In the motion to quash , Gwen pleads with the judge , saying that she " had no knowledge that ; Intellectual Property Copyrights , ( 17:101 ) Copyright Infringements , was being done or even being uploaded and / or downloaded by Internet from Worldwide Film Entertainment , LLC , by his or her computer , or even on his or her computer .
[ sic throughout ] "
Gwen was accused of sharing a movie called The Gray Man , produced by Worldwide Film Entertainment .
In her motion , she tells the court that she " does now have his or her computer under control and is now being monitored , so if this is what have been happing it will not happen again on ( Does 1 - 749 ) his or hers computer .
[ sic throughout ] "
Reading a narrative into these lines is tough , though they could be interpreted to mean that a household computer was used by kids or a spouse or friends and that it 's possible something illicit happened .
The sheer disparity in resources here is striking ; the law firm on the one hand , and on the other a Fort Wayne woman who says that she " sented " a copy of her motion to Comcast as well .
But the law rules on facts .
Despite Gwen 's claim that this is a " very strong hardship for me , all of this being over a 100 miles away , and me not having any knowledge of this at all , " the federal judge overseeing her case rejected the motion .
For one thing , Gwen " has not demonstrated that compliance with the subpoena imposes any burden on her at all , " noted the judge , especially because Gwen did not need to pay or do anything .
Her ISP was the one handling the subpoena .
Secondly , the key issues of fact need to be settled later ; the judge has no real information yet on Gwen 's case .
" Movant ’s denial of knowledge of the alleged infringement cannot be evaluated in the context of the motion to quash the subpoena served upon Comcast , " wrote the judge .
" This court has observed that ' factual and technical arguments ... are unrelated to any appropriate inquiry associated with a motion to quash . ' "
I 'm a ... journalist ?
In the same DC court , a Doe defendant from Georgia took a different tack .
This Doe , who describes himself as " a student , a father , and a reserve police officer , " was accused of sharing the film Uncross the Stars .
In his motion to quash , he claimed that " the Subpoena violates my First Amendment right to speak anonymously . "
He then claimed that he was protected by a Georgia shield law for journalists while admitting that he used P2P networks — but only to report piracy to rightsholders as a sort of freelance copyright vigilante .
" I have only passed the information on to the proper contacts that have a better chance of getting the information off of the internet , " he wrote , adding :
I have to report the things that I find in a way that protects my identity at all times .
On several occasions I have went [ sic ] to sites that allow downloading of materials through filesharing .
These sites have all types of material and they continue to post new files daily .
I have done my best to stay up - to - date on what the sites have and report my findings .
I am also writing about my finding and doing various researching activities to find information .
On one hand , the information that I have found falls under the Freedom of Speech rights that individuals have .
The other side is that they are finding the information so easily on the Internet that I am only trying to get the information removed ...
As mentioned , I have been on these sites for researching and reporting only and not for personal use .
He goes on to say that " none of the files in question are on my computer and during the time in question my computer was not in service .
Compaq had to walk me through a reset of my system due to my system being cloned .
This is what made me want to find out the various uses for and what happens on the peer - to - peer and other social networking sites .
I have young children that hear about many sites form [ sic ] other students at their schools and I try to make sure that the sites that they hear about are not those that pedophiles and other sick individuals may be on . "
The judge had no sympathy for this frankly bizarre document , pointing out that issues of fact will be resolved at a later date .
" Moreover , the Georgia reporter shield law cited by John Doe is not applicable .
That law protects from disclosure ' any information , document , or item obtained or prepared in the gathering or dissemination of news . '
Even if the unauthorized download of Plaintiff ’s movie could qualify as newsgathering activity , the Georgia shield law would not prevent disclosure of John Doe ’s identity because John Doe ’s personal information was not the information ' obtained or prepared ' within the meaning of the statute . "
Malware got me
Finally , we 'll highlight a third motion to quash , this one from a Worldwide Film Entertainment case .
The respondent , who apparently lives in Denver , sent a Colorado County Court form to the DC District Court on which was scrawled in tiny handwriting a " motion to quash . "
The DC court accepted the document , which reads , " My computer was infected with a virus that was installed without my knowledge or permission and is responsible for any and all acts of infringement of a copyrighted work .
Upon receiving notification of the subpoena from my Internet provider on 3/10 / 10 , my son - in - law 's brother used ' hijackthis ' to search for any suspect applications .
There were many which prompted him to reformat , reinstall a fresh copy of Windows , and help me purchase antivirus software to prevent this from reoccurring .
I have a copy of my confirmation of purchase for the antivirus software that I purchased on 3/14/10 that can be provided if needed . "
This is the complete motion , and of course it failed to move the judge ; it contains questions of fact that the judge is simply not positioned to rule on at this point in time .
Malware troubles
It 's also a textbook example of why consulting with a lawyer can be a good idea in these matters .
Dunlap , Grubb , & Weaver note in their settlement letter that " you have been on notice of our claim since you received a notice from your ISP that we subpoenaed your information ...
If in the course of litigation the forensic computer evidence suggests that you did delete media files following receipt of the letter from your ISP , our client will amend its complaint to add a spoliation of evidence claim against you . "
Getting a subpoena notification letter from your ISP and then promptly reformatting the computer 's hard drive is ... not a smart move .
The real world
The homespun motions to quash that litter the DC court dockets provide tiny glimpses of the real people who stand behind all those IP addresses .
Judges have routinely rejected the motions for good reasons , but they 're still useful documents that show the bewilderment and panic that can descend upon households when hit with a federal lawsuit .
Most of those targeted by this new crop of lawsuits are no doubt liable , but the motions to quash remind us of just how many defenses exist .
We 've now heard from those who claim to be totally innocent , those who claim to be freelance copyright cops , and those who claim that malware did it .
Are they all telling the truth ?
Who knows .
But those who are submitting these filings face a daunting set of legal bills as they hire lawyers to litigate a case that could be taking place in federal court hundreds or thousands of miles away — and they face the prospect of $ 150,000 in statutory damages if a jury rules against them .
Even if found not liable for infringement , legal fees at this level can be severe .
Perhaps it 's just easier , and cheaper , to settle .
That 's what the plaintiffs are apparently banking on .
The reaction to the Wikileaks exposure of US war crimes – and Afghan corruption – has been quite interesting : the President responded by averring that there ’s nothing new here , that " the fact is these documents do not reveal any issues that have not already informed our public debate on Afghanistan , " but the facts are quite different , as anyone who peruses even a small sampling of the documents – such as is offered by the Guardian via a convenient interactive map – can readily ascertain .
After all , the public debate was certainly not informed of the existence of " Task Force 373 , " an American assassination squad that roams the Afghan countryside wreaking murder and mayhem at Washington ’s direction – and that killed seven children , as revealed by the Wikileaks document dump , in a strike at a supposed terrorist compound .
And the public was definitely not informed that US intelligence had picked up evidence of Osama bin Laden ’s personal participation in a series of meetings on the Afghan - Pakistan border as late as 2006 , as revealed in the documents .
Certainly the public debate could have been better informed if Leon Panetta ’s interlocutor could have asked him about that when the CIA director , in a recent televised interview , denied having received any new information as to bin Laden ’s whereabouts " in years . "
What President Obama really meant was that the " public debate " among government insiders in Washington – as opposed to ordinary mortals like ourselves – was not affected by one iota , and in that he is indubitably correct .
Just after the " Afghan logs " were published and made available online , Congress renewed funding for the war , and the " mainstream " media took up the presidential line : move along , nothing to see here .
Ensconced in his Washington bubble , where government is the end all and be all of human knowledge and possibilities , our President smugly derides the significance of the biggest security leak in American history , to the hosannas and " amens " of his court pundits .
Outside the Washington Beltway , however , reality is beginning to intrude .
Even as Obama disdains the Wikileaks revelations as irrelevant due his glorious " new strategy , " that strategy is being undermined by Bradley Manning ’s gift to the American people .
For if anything pulls the rug out from under the " nation - building " theories of the COIN - dista grand strategists behind the Afghan " surge , " then surely it is the appalling incompetence and corruption of our Afghan " partners " in the government of President Hamid Karzai .
Hundreds of Wikileaked documents detail gun battles between the Afghan " National " Army , the Border Police , and other " security forces " ( i.e. gangs of armed thugs ) whose " training " and daily bread are paid for by you and I .
As the Border Police go into " battle " stoned on opium – courtesy of the long - suffering US taxpayers – the much vaunted credibility of our Washington technocrats appears to be crumbling .
Which is why they ’re now beginning to bare their fangs , even as they bring Pfc Bradley Manning , the courageous 22 - year - old intelligence analyst suspected to leaking the material , back to the states and prepare charges .
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , barked that
" Mr Assange can say whatever he likes about the greater good he thinks he and his source are doing .
But the truth is they might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family . "
Mullen furthermore admits " We do n’t know how many more there are out there .
It could be a substantial additional number of documents .
And we have no idea what their content is , either . "
As the Guardian reports :
" He dismissed the idea of talking to Assange to learn more about further information that might be released .
‘ I ’m not sure why we would , ’ he said .
‘ Do you think he is going to tell us the truth ? ’ "
What he fails to mention , however , is that Assange and Wikileaks sent the leaked material to the White House for them to vet in advance : they had every opportunity to scrub the released files of any information that could endanger , say , the lives of Afghan informants .
If anyone ’s blood is spilled as a result of the leak , it ’s on their hands , not Assange ’s or anyone else ’s .
So the question Mullen asked is turned on its head :
Does anyone think the US military and the government that gives Mullen his marching orders is going to tell us the truth ?
Of course not .
Which is precisely why we need Wikileaks .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN

A top aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out in unusual detail Friday what he called the Obama administration ’s unprecedented security assistance to the Jewish state .
“ Our security relationship with Israel is broader , deeper and more intense than ever before , " Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro told the Brookings Institution on Friday .
Shapiro said the Obama administration would honor a 2007 commitment to provide Israel $ 30 billion in security assistance during the next 10 years .
Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid .
The U.S. also gives Israel something it does not give to any other beneficiary of U.S. foreign military financing , Shapiro said .
“ Unlike other beneficiaries of Foreign Military Financing , which are legally required to spend funds in the United States , Israel is the only country authorized to set aside one - quarter of its FMF funding for off - shore procurements , ” Shapiro said .
The Obama administration is also continuing to commit itself to preserve Israel ’s Qualitative Military Edge — “ its ability to counter and defeat credible military threats from any individual state , coalition of states , or non-state actor , while sustaining minimal damages or casualties , ” as Shapiro defined it .
That also means that the U.S. will sell Israel sophisticated defense equipment that it will deny to other U.S. allies in the region .
“ This means that as a matter of policy , we will not proceed with any release of military equipment or services that may pose a risk to allies or contribute to regional insecurity in the Middle East , " Shapiro said .
In addition to $ 2.75 billion in U.S. foreign assistance to Israel in 2010 and $ 3 billion in 2011 , the Obama administration has requested that Congress approve $ 205 million in U.S. funds to support production of Iron Dome , an Israeli - developed short - range rocket defense system .

The biggest key is the BLUE AND RED BARS on the side of the screen .
If your blue bar is smaller than their red bar , you lost no matter how many shots you take .
Drawing first gives you a boost to the bar but apparently less accurate shots .
Letting them draw first gives them the boost but your shots are more accurate .
I never noticed any real difference in accuracy .
Draw first to get the little boost to your bar .
When it says draw , use L2 or down then up on the RS .
This will bring up the cross hairs for you to target them .
Now you move the RS to where you want to shoot them .
You can paint them with the RB or the RT , it works both ways .
Now WATCH THE CROSS HAIRS , they will flash red to white ... red being not a good shot or no shot at all , and the smaller and whiter they are when you paint them , the more accurate the shot and also affects your blue bar , so watch the bar when you paint the target .
You do n't need to unload your clip either , if you want to do one shot , just do one shot but the key is that your blue bar has to be larger than their red bar with that one shot .
Paint the targets , watch the bar and then just wait for the dead eye to end , and as long as your bar is bigger you win .
Disarming them gets you like 100 fame and 200 honor .
Just target their shooting arm and that usually fills your bar pretty full .
Hope this helps ... just feel free to add comments and enjoy dueling .
One more thing , easy way to build fame and honor with dueling is this .
Get the Elegant Suit from Thieves Landing so you can cheat at poker .
Find a low buy in game , usually 10 bucks .
Attempt to cheat and let them catch you ... instant duel .
Disarm them in the duel and there is your 100 fame and 200 honor .
Go back to the game and repeat .
I thought I would put this on here cause I had the same issue as a lot of people .

Gizmodo's leak of the iPhone 4 already made Monday 's Apple keynote slightly awkward .
But the most uncomfortable moment was when part of Steve Jobs ' iPhone 4 demo failed due to Wi -Fi issues .
Watching the video below ( shot by IDG ) , you can almost feel the increasing frustration of the CEO , and you can only imagine what was going on backstage to resolve the problem .
After about a minute of troubleshooting – and a failed attempt to connect to AT&T's 3G network instead – Jobs explained that over 500 Wi-Fi devices were being used in the crowd , likely causing interference with his demo unit .
He even asked bloggers to stop doing their jobs for the sake of the demo .
" All you bloggers need to turn off your base stations , " Jobs said .
" If you want to see the demos , shut off your laptops , turn off all these MiFi base stations and put them on the floor , please . "
At one point Jobs asked Scott Forstall , vice president of iPhone ( now " iOS " ) software , if he had any suggestions , and someone in the crowd shouted " Verizon ! "
Google also ran into similar network problems that stalled its demonstration of Google TV last month .
In Apple 's case , Jobs was referring to users of Verizon 's MiFi , a device that creates a portable hot spot that can be shared by up to 5 users .
Some smartphones , such as the Palm Pre and some modified Android phones , are also capable of serving as a hot spot .
The iPhone currently permits tethering ( a one - to - one connection with a laptop ) but AT&T has not permitted that service for its customers , and the iPhone can only act as a hot spot if it has been jailbroken .
With over 500 Wi-Fi hot spots in a room of 5,000 people , it 's a sign of how popular hot - spot–sharing devices or features have become .
To be fair , if Verizon were the iPhone 's carrier , it would likely suffer from the same issues as AT&T .
But the problem of an overloaded cellular network would be mitigated if the iPhone were available on multiple carriers as opposed to just one .
During his glitchy keynote , Jobs was probably feeling our wireless woes more than any other day .

Rocco Castoro of Vice wrote an article about a multi- level marketing company called Amega Global .
He told me , " Basically they are the Amway for people who think a metal tube full of ' granulated minerals and crystals ' can fix your bad back , make crappy wine taste better , reduce the acidity of lemons , energize your food , etc .
I went to a ' wanding party ' in Westchester , and it was very weird indeed . "
The AMwand was released in the US in January , and since then a steadily growing number of Amega associates across America have discovered that the wand and the company 's other products are capable of grand things .
The short list of its supposed powers includes relieving various body aches and pains , stimulating the circulatory system , reducing the acidity of lemons , increasing the potency of food , alleviating migraines , and " energizing " just about any organic or inanimate object you can shake a stick at .
According to the company 's website , Amega Global was formed in Singapore in 2006 by a consortium of three companies : a wellness - product manufacturer , an investment firm , and a " people - development company . "
Most of their products are made in Asia and Australia .
If you were wondering , its founders came up with the name Amega Global because they wanted to create " a mega global company . "
And if you 're to believe Amega 's distributors , the program has been a runaway success .
Other Amega dealers told me that the AMwand produced approximately $ 42,000 worth of presales in December 2009 , $ 885,000 in its inaugural month on the market , and an astounding $ 2.5 million in February .
( More recent figures were not available at the time this piece went to print . )
There is no way to ascertain whether Amega 's sales figures are legit .
None of the emails I sent or voice mails I left for administrative members of Amega were returned .
In fact , the only direct employee of Amega who would speak with me on the phone was a customer - service representative who told me they do not have a public - relations department and he did not have access to sales information ; he advised me to send an email to a general address ( which was never answered ) .
Yet every distributor I spoke with was extremely enthusiastic about the products and claimed to be making a healthy supplemental or full - time income from their sales .
In fact , many of the Amegans I contacted mentioned that the program has been so successful it 's spawned cheaper bootleg wands available on the internet ( which , according to them , do not work ) .
The following items were extracted from Wikileaks ’ newly released Afghan War Diary .
The files were downloaded from the raw HTML dump , and then searched using “ HTT ” –there were no results when using HTS or HTAT as search words .
While we reserve commentary and analysis for an upcoming post , we welcome readers to not only copy all of this–or you can download the PDF or Word version–but to also leave their initial reactions , impressions , analyses , and related comments below .
Very few names of HTT members appear , seemingly only that of Tracy St. Benoit .
The materials begin in June of 2007 , and end abruptly after the attack on Paula Loyd ( not mentioned by name ) , on 04 November 2008 .
There are virtually no reports for 2009 .
This seems to be a very limited set of reports , and if it is an indicative sample , Wikileaks has obtained only a very small fraction of all reports generated , no more than 110,000 at most .

Child suicide bomber .
June 2 2007 an Afghan official approached an HTT and reported that a child was used as a suicide bomber .
The Taliban put a bomb vest on the boy and told him to go to the District Center amd when you get there just push the switch .
The boy confused when he arrived at the District Center , told an unnamed official at the center that he was asked to go tehre and push the switch that he carried .
The official promptly disarmed the boy .
The unnamed child was allegedly an orphan and was taking care of himself but had limmited help from others .
The Afghan indicated that this was typical of the Taliban to target orphans to become suicide bombers .
There were other villigars who in separate interviews ve rified the same story .

2007-07-31 17:05 Non-Combat Event MEDCAP NEUTRAL
At 0850L the CMA team began a MEDCAP / VETCAP at the town of Kandaw Kalay ( WB 3312 9460 ) , Shwak district .
The event ended at approximately 1330L .
Approximately 251 people were treated during the MEDCAP ( 46 x males over 30 ; 32 females over 15 ; 72 x male children under 14 ; 35 x females under 14 ; 66 x males from 14 -30 ) .
The predominant illnesses were gastro - intestinal ailment and minor aches and pains .
The VETCAP treated approximately 301x animals ( donkeys , goats , cows , camels ) .
The HTT team also gathered the following information :
- Kandaw Kalay is referred to as Hori Khel by the local residents .
-roughly 400 x families live in Kandaw Kalay ( 8000 x in the village ; 12000 in Pakistan for various reasons )
- The following tribal sub-clans were identified :
Sarmat Khel ( tribal elder : Ibrahim Jan )
Zinoor Khel ( tribal elder : Hajji Jan Khan )
Qalandar Khel ( tribal elder : Mir Zaman )
Niat Khel ( tribal elder : Hajji Khialee )
All the above clans are sub-divisions of the Tori Khel Tribe .
- The dominant leader of the town in Hajji Hali .
He has a nephew named Anwar Khan .
The family owns a construction company named : the Abdullah Gombad Construction Company .
The Khan family has a tight control over the population in this town .
- The elders complained of ANP stealing from local households as they conducted cordon and searches .
They also claimed that the ANP rifled through the personal belongings of women , which is very demeaning and is meant as a show of dominance by the ANP .
Elders requested that elders be present when ever a search took place .
- Main currency in the town is Pakistani Kaldaris ( rupees ) , not Afghans .
That indicates close economic ties of some sort with Pakistan .
The Haqqani network may be a possible link between this town and Pakistan .
–HTTs assessments are that the town and its population are basically loyal to whoever can provide the largest economic benefits .
- Large widow population identified .
They pose an economic burden upon the community .
Women targeted economic / micro loans programs may be beneficial to the community .
–HTTs impression is that the MEDCAP was definitely staged by the Khan family .
The event seems to have been attended mainly by Hajji Halis supporters , meaning that the average resident was not represented .
It seems that the event was Hajji Halis way of asserting his authority to the population .

Gerda Zerai Shura , Main Topics
ANA BDE Commander :
– The need for local support in establishing security in Gerdai Serai
– The need for tribal solidarity against the ACM
– ANAP recruitment from the Gerda Serai Tribes
– Needs of the community .
Future projects and development
– $ 100 K District Development Committee concept
– MEDCAP / VETCAP availability at Gerda Serai
Dep. Prov. Governor :
– Need for locally established security and tribal cooperation .
– Compared tribally established security in Jajji with the lack of security in Zurmat .
Used Jajji as a good example to follow .
– The tribal land dispute between the Parangai , Sultan Khel , and Kha Khel tribes was address .
The following COAs were mentioned for conflict resolution :
– Hold a Tribal Jirga at Gardez with all the conflicting tribes attending in order to come up with a solution
– Invite UNAMA to mediate between the conflicting tribes in order to find a solution
– The conflicting tribal elders get together on their own IOT find a solution
– ANA and ANP recruitment needed .
Gerda Serai elders agreed to provide 30 ANAP by 31AUG07 .
– The Dep. Gov. offered to let the tribal elders choose their own DC .
Otherwise , he would choose one for them .
He also promised to write a petition to MOI for official recognition of Gerda Serai as a district .
Haji Maipir Khan ( Gerda Serai Head Elder )
– He expressed that the people of Gerda Serai are poor .
Any and all projects , including the road construction , must employ local labor in order to boost the economy .

– $ 100 K from the District Development Committee must be spent on building a Madrassa .
This will keep local young men from going to Pakistan for education , which radicalizes them .

- Used example of Jajji and Mangal tribes uniting against ACM forces in their districts .
Promoted tribal solidarity against ACm .
- Discussed new refugee ID card process and aid available to incoming refugees in Paktya .
- Promoted the State run Hajj program ( state pays for trip to Mecca and back ) which is based upon a lottery system .
Promoted local registration for the lottery .
-ANAP recruitment .
Asked for 30x ANAP from the district .
TRIBAL ELDERS :
- The people of this district have been happy with the performance of ANA and CF forces .
However , the ANP needs closer supervision .
They have a tendency to steal and to rifle through the belongings of women .
When the Russians were here , we did not allow them to search our homes and look at our women .
But now we have our own muslim brothers going through the personal belongings of our women .
Instead of searching our homes , consult the elders and we will help you find the ACM .
- For the past 35 years there have been nothing but conflict in this country .
The people are used to fighting .
So you cant blame us for the occasional attacks on vehicles traveling through the KG Pass .
The people are poor and they are tempted by commerce traveling in the pass .
Not all attacks are from ACM .
- Corruption in the IRoA is overwhelming .
Government officials in Kabul do not care about the people .
Only care about their own pockets .
- Elders were so frustrated with IRoA corruption and lack of promise keeping , one elder walked off in a fit .
- In Wazi Zadran , we have already chosen to keep foreign fighters out .
We have security .
- The District Development Committee ( DDC ) $ 100 K is only a drop in the bucket .
Too little money .
Over 100,000 people in this district alone .

ANA distributed the following HA at the town of Ali Mohammad in Wazi Zadran district :
200 x school kits ; 40 x teacher kits ; 80 x hygiene kits ; 80 x adult shoes ; 60 x childrens shoes ; 40 x adult coats ; 40 x childrens coats ; 2 x red rugs ; 1 x large green carpet ; 4 x elder Korans ; 1 x mullah Koran ; 4 x prayer rugs ; 1x PA system , and 16 x cans of paint .
The CA TM conducted KLEs with the tribal elders of the Shabak Khel tribe in Shwak district .
The Shabak Khel is one of the two dominant tribes in Shwak , the other being Ibrahim Khel .
Topics of discussion included projects from the District Development Committee ( DDC ) .
A list of projects from the Ibrahim Khel tribe was also collected earlier in the day .
The list included 8 x wells and 2 x retention walls .
The village well locations follow :
Gul Khan : 1 x well
Ker Khel : 1 x well
Khojat Khel : 2 x wells ( POC : Qadir Khan , 0799735482 )
Lambali / Wali Khel : 1 x well
Kori Khel : 1 x well
Ghoran : 1 x well
Landi Kot : 1 x well
The CA TM also requested school supply kits , winter clothes , construction tools for irrigation work , and wheat seed for villages in Shwak .
The above items will be delivered ASAP via ANA 5 ton vehicles .
The CA TM also discovered that the Tori Khel tribe of Kandaw Kalay , which is where the last MEDCAP / VETCAP took place , is actually considered to be a part of Gerda Serai as opposed to Shwak .
This is in contrast to the official district boundary .
However , since the perceptions of the tribes are what matters the CA TM at Shwak proposed another MEDCAP / VETCAP at the Shwak high school for the tribes of Shwak .
In the next 24 , the CA TM will continue to conduct population assessments and focus primarily on the Shabak Khel Tribe .

The PRT engineers assessed that an 8 room structure could be built for approximately $ 100 K as an addition to the current school .
In the next 24 , the CA TM will get a written agreement amongst the four main tribes ( each with DDC members ) for the expanded school .

Team ,
Today a MEDCAP / VETCAP was conducted at Gerda Serai IVO the residence of a local doctor , Omar Gul ( WB 33491 91383 ) .
Turnout was lesser than the first MEDCAP / VETCAP , and the participants were predominantly male .
Festering tribal conflicts are suspected for the poor turn out .
MEDCAP : 149 x men , 7 x women , 7 x children .
VETCAP : 100x goats , 19 x sheep , 2 x donkeys .
ANA is also coordinating the distribution of wheat seeds ( 100 x bags into 4 parts ) via the DDC members .
During the meeting with the DDC , the tribal members failed to come to an agreement on where the school that they requested with the $ 100 K will be built .
As a result , the DDC will have to reconvene again in the future for an alternate project request .
At the meeting the DDC members , some of whom are members of the conflicting tribes in the district , also discussed possible COAs for resolving the conflict .
Having a neutral judge in Gardez rule on the conflict was identified as the preferred course of action .
A temporary cease fire was agreed upon until Sunday in order to await the ruling of the provincial judge .

ANA attended a shura at the village of Seyyed Khel in order to discuss the future construction of a joint , inter- provincial , security building at the Khowst side of the K - G Pass .
The following are the talking points from the shura ( written by CPT Russel , PSYOPs OIC ) :
This shura was called by the ANA CDR to ask the elders for land to build a new security outpost .
Seyyed Khel was chosen due to its proximity to the provincial border .
Themes for the shura were security , support the government ( cooperation ) and opportunities .
There were approximately 35 elders present .
The ANA hosted the event that included a short meeting about the land , visiting the site and lunch .
The BDE RCA opened the meeting with Koran versus and prayer .
The ANA BDE CDR opened the meeting with themes of security , cooperation and opportunities .
ANA BDE CDR
OPERATION KHYBER is bringing opportunities for the people of the KG Pass .
We are all brothers and we should all follow the rule of the government .
We apologize if we searched the wrong homes .
The people that were arrested were taken to Gardez .
If they are not guilty they will be brought back to your village .
Work with your District Sub Governors .
We want to build new check points and a new security outpost here near the provincial line between Khost and Paktia .
Both Khost and Paktia will work together to keep the pass secure .
The districts will also work together with the tribes of Shamal and Waze Zadran to ensure fairness in creating new jobs .
You need to work together to provide an answer on where to build the outpost by tomorrow .
LTC WOODS

Woods echoed all these same themes and messages .
HAJI GHANJI KHAN , VILLAGE ELDER
This project is important to us .
But one thing is there are two tribes that should be involved with this decision and only one is present , Jawal and Ghawak .
We are concerned that there is no space in Seyyed Khel .
There is no place to land the helicopters .
The ANA CDR interrupted the elder and reminded him that they needed to makes a decision .
The elders went to there small groups for about 15 minutes and returned , Haji Khan continued that they had made a decision on a location .
The location is west of Seyyed Khel and we can take you there .
The team went to the site and returned for lunch at the school .
It was decided that further shuras were needed with the provincial leadership and that the engineers needed to assess the site location .

DDC members from Gerda Serai visited the ANA TAC in order to request a micro - hydro power project with its $ 100 K .
However , not all the DDC members were present and $ 100 K is not nearly enough to pay for a micro - hydro project .
They were informed that once the DDC had proven that it could work together as a united body by making good use of its initial $ 100 K , more funds would be made available for long term projects .
During the meeting the representatives asked for a road linking Gerda Serai to the main K - G Pass .
An initial proposal was made to employ 400 x males from all four of the conflicting tribe for 4 months .
It would be a labor intensive project with no heavy equipment involved .
The DDC members agreed to hold a shura with 3F6 on 08SEP07 at the Gerda Serai DC IOT further discuss the road project .

GERDA SERAI TRIBAL CONFLICT ASSESSMENT

Main Tribe : Zadran Tribe
Sub -tribe : Supail , Mayzai
Population estimate : 127,000
Mayzai sub-tribes ( Gerda Serai Tribes ) :
- Soori Khel
- Toori Khel
- Sultan Khel
- Kha Khel
- Parangi
- Bakharai
- Shapak
- Ibrahim Khel
Majority Tribes : Sultan Khel , Toori Khel , Soori Khel
Minority Tribes : Parangi , Ibrahim Khel ( dominant in Shwak ) .
Most of the Parangi and Ibrahim Khel tribe members are currently in Pakistan .
Tribal Conflict : Sultan Khel vs. Parangi
Cause of Conflict : Land dispute .
Fighting over Gurba Mountain ( WB 308 901 ) and its various resources ( i.e. pine nuts , fire wood , etc . )
History behind conflict :
The current land dispute in Gerda Serai has been ongoing for the past 63 years .
In the past several decades alone 32 people have died from the conflict .
The Sultan Khel tribe claims that they have the official land deeds for the mountain .
However , the Parangai claim that the deed is fabricated .
The Parangi tribe wants IRoA intervention and mediation instead of local resolution because they fear both local and ex-patriot repercussions .
As the minority tribe in the district , the Parangi tribe probably does not expect to win a local struggle against the majority Sultan Khel tribe .
Ironically , the Parangi tribe also fears retribution from its large and influential ex-patriot community in Pakistan .
If it attempted and failed to resolve the conflict locally with a favorable outcome , they believe that ex-patriots who still claim land on the mountain will disapprove .
It is believed that a local Parangi mosque recently underwent a $ 100,000 refurbishment with funds donated by a wealthy Parangi nuclear scientist in Germany .
The ex-patriot link is obviously very strong in the tribe .
ACM influence in Gerda Serai : Haqqani himself belongs to the Sultan Khel Tribe .
Some of Haqqanis sons and many of his extended relatives are still reside in Gerda Serai .
Gerda Serai is without a doubt , a Haqqani network stronghold .
The Parangi tribe is also subject to strong Taliban influence , although the Parangi are not believed to share the Talibans ideology .
They simply provide shelter and material support .
Once OPN Khyber ends , it is believed that HQN and Taliban forces will return to the district in force .

- boys under 14 : 71x
- boys 14-30 : 44x

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES Unit : PRT Gardez
POLITICAL : NSTR
MILITARY :
8SEP07 , Waze Zadran , 1LT Orsini CA
Team ,
ANA picked up a truck load of HA consisting of winter clothing , farming tools , and school kits from the TAC site IOT conduct a HA drop in Shwak in the next 24 hours .
The CA team from Waze Zadran moved to L/U with 2A in order to assist in the HA drop .
8SEP07 , Gerda Zerai , 1LT Newman CA
Team ,
ANA along with 3F6 conducted a shura at the Gerda Serai DC IOT discuss the Gerda Serai DDC and it list of projects .
The following are excepts from the shura .
Main Topics :
-3F6 discussed te $ 100K DDC fund available to Gerda Serai .
He emphasized that the $ 100 K was just a drop in the bucket compared to all the money that would be available in the future , but he made it clear that the 4 tribes had to prove their ability to cooperate with each other before big projects could be vetted .
-3F6 stated that due to the tribal dynamic and conflicts in Gerda Serai , the IRoA and the CF refused to discuss large scale projects ATT .
We had to be extra careful here .
- Also the latent ACM threat in the area made us even more cautious of big scale projects at this time .
-3F6 also discuss the future Gerda Serai unimproved road project .
He explained how it would employ 300x men over the difficult winter .
He also emphasized that local security was crucial to the projects success .
-3F6 stated that we were ready to start the road project in about 3 - 4 weeks .
- He promised that there would be future shuras in order to hammer out the details of the road project .
- However , before we could discussed the road any further , 3F6 asked for the DDC project list .
- One of the elders explained that due to the tribal dynamics in the region , they had to pick 12 DDC member .
3 from each tribe .
They also included the new DC , Izzat Khan , to the committee , which made the committee 13 strong .
- The elder listed three categories of projects in order of priority :
1 ) Micro hydro power
2 ) Health clinics
3 ) Schools
- The elders claimed that all four of the tribes had water sources that could power a micro hydro plant .
-3F6 once again emphasized that a project of that magnitude would cost far too much .
$ 100 K was not nearly enough money for micro hydro .
- The ANA BDE CDR expressed frustration at the DDC for not being able to agree on a project list .
Especially when all the other districts had already succeeded in doing so .
- At this point , 3F6 made an ultimatum .
He told the DDC that until they managed to come up with a common project list at the DC today , the district would lose not only the $ 100 K but also the $ 260 K for the road .
He stated that the CA team and 2C PL would stay behind with the DDC until they came up with a project list .
-3F6 stated that at 0900L tomorrow we would meet again at the DC in order to get the DDCs final decision .
-3F6 and the ANA BDE CDR left the shura at that point .
- 1 hour later , the DDC managed to come to an agreement on a common school located at a central location .
2C moved to the school site along with the DDC in order to confirm the site .
8SEP07 , Shawk , PRT Medic , HTT , and SECFOR
ANA along with the CMA and HTT teams conducted a MEDCAP / VETCAP at the Waze Zadran DC .

RC EAST : 27JAN08 TF Fury PRT Gardez conducts KLE with the Zormat Chief of Police IVO Zormat DC
Who : CPT Cho ( 3F S9 ) , CPT Dost Mohammad ( Zormat Police Chief ) , LT Richards ( B40 ) , 1 x interpreter
What : Conducted a meeting at FOB Zormat in order to discuss the following :
- Allegations of corruption amongst the labor supervisors for the Zormat unimproved road project
- Tax collection at the Zormat District Center
- The District ban on motorcycles in Zormat
When : 27JAN08
Where : FOB Zormat
Why :
1 ) Allegations of corruption in the Zormat unimproved road project :
3F S9 received information from the HTT after conducting population assessments at the Zormat Bazaar area that some of the road project supervisors may be siphoning money from the workers .
3 F S9 asked the ANP chief to conduct a formal investigation of the allegations and brief B6 of his findings after one week .
The ANP Cheif swore to seek out the sources of these allegations .
2) Tax collection at the Zormat DC :
The Zormat Chief of police stated that tax collection at the District Center was a complete legitimate process that started during the time of the Taliban .
He reported that all the money was deposited into government bank account in Gardez ( Afghanistan Bank ) .
According to the CoP , the taxes were collected by private contractors hired by the Ministry of Municipalities in Kabul .
Taxes are levied primarliy on the shop owners in the Bazaar .
The tax rates were based upon 6 % of whatever stockages were in the individual shops and the ANP chief was responsible for enforcing the collection of taxes .
Normally , tax collection is supposed to be managed by a bazaar mayor , however , there is no mayor at Zormat at this time .
3 ) Motorcycle ban in Zormat :
According to the Police Chief , motorcycles were used extensively by Taliban forces before the ban .
The motorcycles served as a significant force multiplier for the Taliban as it provide maneuverability and stealth .
The Police Chief stated that the district center was prepared to provide registration for motorcycles in Zormat , however , in order to do so the government required an elder from each of the tribes to vouch for the motorcycle owners .
However , due to the weak tribal system and the almost systematic eradication of elders by the Taliban , the district center was unable to implement the motorcycle registration process .
According to the HTT the ban on motorcycles is a significant point of contention amongst the people of Zormat towards the government .
3 F S9 will discuss the feasibility of using this high demand for motorcycles in order to empower local elders in the district ( i.e. re-establish the tribal system ) with the Zormat DC .
By giving local elders the power to vouch for locals who need motorcycles ( the demand for which is great at this time due to sky rocketing fuel prices ) we may be able to use this problem to our advantage .

We need to talk , discuss , and negotiate .
Three centuries we have killed each others .
We have lost 1.5 Millions mortars but , have failed in making this country free .
Government
Because of the Bonn agreement signed in Germany we have an elected president .
Afghanistan has elected government officials ( President , parliament , constitution ) .
This is a government of freedom with freedom of speech .
If we support the government we would not have the current problems .
My office is open to you , to the Taliban , to anyone that wants to talk .
I will go to the villages but , we need time to solve these issues .
Reconstruction
Why the younger work in other countries ?
There are good opportunities here if there is no fight .
We have natural resources but , we do not even know how to work with those .
That is why we need assistance from the foreigners .
If we a pipeline that goes to other countries we will have more jobs .
The Arab Countries is a beautiful example of working together for the progress .
Why we are in poor conditions ?
We have 400 road workers in Zormat .
Electricity for the Bazaar will be a future project .
ANA , Religious Cultural Advisor , talked about the following :
OPN SM
This operation was conducted to listen to you , to unit the people , separate the enemy from you , bring security , and bring reconstruction projects .
Work with the government because , if not this opportunity will not happen again .
Village needs and comments
We need water wells
We need schools .
We have 100 families and they do not even know how to write their name .
In 8 years no one has done anything for us , no facilities .
The government has not showed , asked , solved , and will not solved our petitions .
We lost 30 people in previous fights and the government did not even ask for their names , answer this .
We have beautiful security here but , we need security from both sides .
If you are truthful we will go to your shuras but , you got to be with us .
DC talking points after the Villagers comments
If you do not come to the shuras for 1 , 2 , 3 years you will be late in the reconstruction for that amount of time .
You need leadership to represent you at the government .
We will do water projects but , you will do the caress .
In the future 4 more schools will be built in Zormat .
Sit together and lots of problems will get solved .
It is not easy to rebuild when the enemy has destroyed all areas for years .
You have not seen what is being done in other areas of Paktya .
Key elders present :
Haji Nurgul
Hommid Khasmir
Mohammad Salin
Abdul
Pachan Khan
Anwar Khan
Karim
Sahir
Hid Mohammad
Amir Mohammad
Panis Chi
Panas
At a later conversation with the DC he mentioned the following :
When he was the DC for Jaji he started stopping truck to check if they were exporting minerals illegally ( Asking for the tax papers ) .
After that he receives a call from parliament members to stop doing that .
People in parliament do not want peace for Zormat .
( Maj Matos asked him :
Why is this ? )
As an example , he mentioned that Uyounio Kanony , Chief of Parliament has being getting lots of money since the Americans are here .
If everything is solved we will not have to pay him .

RC EAST : 28 JAN 08 TF 3 FURY conducts Tribal Shura Meeting IVO Zormat DC
28JAN08 Zormat Tribal Shura
LOCATION : Zormat District Center
ATTENDEES : Zormat District Commissioner , CPT Faisul ( 1 Kandak RCA ) , CPT Cho ( 3F S9 ) , Haji Eido ( head of shura ) Zormat tribal shura members , Gorjay tribal edlers , HTT
SITUATION :
- The district commissioner conducted a district tribal shura at the district center today .
Unexpectedly , elders from the village of Gorjay arrived at the tribal shura in order to plead the release of 3 detainees that had been incarcerated on the 27JAN08 .
Elders :
- The elders of Gorjay stated that CF and ANSF forces should leave the village once the cordon and search operations were completed .
He claimed that our prolonged presence at the center of the village only put the local villagers at risk .
The elders feared TB attacks against CF and ANSF forces staging out of the village , which would in turn put the villagers at risk .
They claimed that the CF and the ANSF were more than welcome to search the homes of suspected TB members , but dont linger in populated areas .
- The elders also vouched for the innocence of the 3 men detained on the 27JAN08 .
They asked for their release .
District Commissioner :
- The DC asked how the elders of Gorjay expected the IRoA and the CF to cooperate with them when they refused to cooperate with the IRoA .
- DC stated that an investigation was underway and that if the 3 men were found innocent , they would be released .
- The DC emphasized again the need for tribal unity against the TB and the current golden opportunity for development and progress .
- He stated that if the people of Afghanistan found unity and learned to solve its own problems , the CF would leave .
Elders :
- The elders stated that the IRoA was not strong enough to provide security in Zormat .
That it was too week to be relied upon .
They stated that the DC didnt have the power to make the CF leave .
District Commissioner :
- The DC assured the elders that once Zormatis learned to secure its own villages , the CF would leave .
He then asked why only Zormat had so many problems .
How many young men from Gorjay have joined the ANSF ?
Elders :
- Elders stated that many of them traveled abroad for long periods of time in order to provide for their families .
As a result they could not vouch for their young mens behavior .
The temptation to join the TB for prestige and money was too great .
- The elders stated that CF soldiers raided the homes of the 3 detainees on the 27th without ANSF support .
-3FS9 responded by telling them that that was against the rules and that the CF would never enter a Qalat unless it received direct fire from one .
- The elders thanked 3 F S9 for the explanation .
Haji Eido :
- Eido asked if the CF kept records of their cordon and searches .
He claimed that in the past couple of years , his home alone was searched 7 times .
He asked why that was .
- Eido stated that the reason there was so much TB presence and activity in Gorjay and Dalwatzai villages is because the TB knew that the people of Gorjay and Dalwatzai supported the IRoA .
He stated that ongoing operations and detentions in the two villages ironically served to punish the people for their support of the IRoA .
- Except for the cordon and search of the home in Gorjay on the 27th , Haji Eido complimented the ANSF on their conduct throughout OPN S&M .
He stated that the ANP and ANA actually asked permission to enter Qalats from local elders and mullahs and that they behaved very well when conducting searches .
They insured that they got permission to enter Qalats and that the women of the household were properly segregated during the search .
- He also stated that the 3 detainees from Gorjay stated that they had many suspicious electronic devices at their homes because electronics were their hobbies .
They loved watching foreign movies on their cell phones ( 3F S9 almost gagged on his chai with incredulity at this point ) .
- Eido stated that the ban on Motorcycles was a growing problem for the people of Zormat .
It had a significant economic impact upon the local residents and it did nothing to hinder the ACM from riding motorcycles .
He claimed that it was only the innocent that were harmed by the ban on motorcycles .
The ban also served to significantly discredit the IRoA and its judgment as no other district in Paktya had a similar ban .
HTT :
- Rep. from the HTT asked what weaknesses the Zormat Tribal shura had .
Haji Eido :
- Eido stated that there were many weaknesses in Zormat .
One of them being geographic .
He stated that Zormat was surrounded by 4 provinces and that TB from all these provinces traveled to Zormat .
- He also stated that Zormat wasnt the problem .
The problem was the lack of IRoA support .
He stated that many of the elders of Zormat supported the IRoA but they have only been persecuted .
- He stated that the main weakness was with the government .
For example , none of the shura members have ever been paid for their services to the district .
He also stated that a number of elders have been imprisoned and sent to BAF and Guantanamo by the former corrupt ANP .
- Another major issue that Haji Eido identified with the IRoA was the predominance of high ranking former communists in the provincial level government .
He stated the example of the former governor Rahmatullah and the current provincial CoP , BG Esmatullah .
Both were communist aparachniks under the old communist regime and they are much hated by the predominantly former mujahadeen elders in Zormat .
Key HTT findings at the Bazaar area :
- The return of the old ANP from Jalalabad is much feared .
Many local residents have stated that they will rise up in armed revolt if the old ANP ever came back .
- The HTT team was almost mobbed by local shop owners and residents at the Bazaar when the issue of the ban on motorcycle use came up .
The following are the negative effects of the ban :
1 ) The ACM are the only ones riding motorcycles in Zormat at this time .
2 ) The rising price of fuel is forcing people to pay extreme prices of taxis or walk long distances in the snow .
3 ) Business in the central bazaar has suffered significantly this year due to the lack of consumers traveling to the bazaar .

Yet even as it feeds the art houses along with the red- carpet monster ( or tries to ) , Cannes continues to make room for films that fall outside the commercial mainstream .
The greatest proof of this is unequivocally “ Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives , ” the single most adventurous film in the competition .
It opens with a mysterious and lovely scene of a buffalo shaking loose its tether and roaming deep into the forest , an image that might be from one of Uncle Boonmee ’s past lives .
It is also a metaphor for how to watch Mr. Weerasethakul ’s films :
You need to shake loose all your preconceived ideas about how and why movies make meaning and just plunge in .
On Saturday the Certain Regard prize went to “ Ha Ha Ha , ” a wistful , intricately structured comedy from the South Korean director Hong Sang - soo .
In a festival that tends to be crammed with films that skew toward the grave  religious fundamentalism was a recurrent theme  the humor in “ Ha Ha Ha ” was also a relief .
The on - screen death count at Cannes tends to be high and this year the blood flowed , squirted and sprayed in films like Olivier Assayas ’s “ Carlos , ” a portrait of the terrorist and mercenary Carlos the Jackal , which surely would have won a major award if it had been shown in competition .
Although the Certain Regard films are not part of the main competition , this section has consistently become a showcase for some of the strongest , most innovative and daring work at Cannes .
Such was the case this year with a largely well - received slate that also included Manoel de Oliveira ’s “ Strange Case of Angelica ” ; Jia Zhang - ke ’s “ I Wish I Knew ” ; Jean - Luc Godard ’s “ Film Socialism ” ; and Cristi Puiu ’s “ Aurora . ”
The Certain Regard jury prize went to Daniel and Diego Vega ’s “ October . ” ( Mr. Panahi won the same award in 2003 for “ Crimson Gold . ” )
At the Saturday afternoon awards ceremony for the Certain Regard , the leader of the jury , the French director Claire Denis , expressed particular appreciation for Mr. Oliveira ’s film , saying that it had cast a bright light over the entire festival .
Three actresses from the Argentine title “ The Lips , ” directed by Ivan Fund and Santiago Loza , won a performance prize .
Rounding out the awards the Caméra d’Or , the prize for first feature , was awarded to “ Año Bisiesto ” by Michael Rowe .
The Palme d’Or for best short film , presented by the weird duo of jury members Atom Egoyan and Michelle Rodriguez ( who name - dropped “ Avatar ” ) , was awarded to “ Chienne d’Histoire ” ( “ Barking Island ” ) , directed by Serge Avédikian .
In Director ’s Fortnight , one of the parallel sections at Cannes , top honors went to “ Lily Sometimes , ” “ Le Quattro Volte ” and “ Illegal . ”
In Critics ’
Week , another parallel section , the grand prize went to “ Armadillo . ”
The independent Ecumenical Jury gave its highest award to “ Of Gods and Men , ” and commendations to “ Poetry ” and Mike Leigh ’s “ Another Year . ”
The critics ’ group , Fipresci , divided the love between “ Tournée , ” “ Pal Adrienn ” and “ Todos Vós Sodes Capitáns ” ( “ You Are All Captains ” ) .
The ebola virus is one of the nastiest pathogens known to man .
It corrodes blood vessels and stops clotting , leaving most of its human victims bleeding to death through their pores .
And guinea pigs – along with opossums , wallabies and insect - eating bats – have it in their genes .
A genomic hunt for virus genes traced sequences to Ebola and the closely related Marburg virus in no fewer than six vertebrate species .
Echoes of the less - gruesome borna virus family appeared in 13 species , including humans .
The genes appear to have been mixed in about 40 million years ago , and have stuck around ever since .
" Some of these sequences have been conserved , " and that 's almost certainly not a coincidence , said cell biologist Ann Marie Skalka of the Fox Chase Cancer Center .
" We speculate that some of these must have provided an evolutionary advantage . "
Skalka specializes in RNA viruses , which unlike most common viruses are made from single strands of primitive genetic material , rather than DNA .
Common viruses , better known as retroviruses , insert their DNA into the genomes of infected cells .
They hijack its function and , should the cell survive , leave pieces of themselves behind .
Retroviral leftovers have accumulated for hundreds of millions of years in animal genomes ; they account for about 8 percent of the human .
RNA viruses , however , were long thought to leave no leftovers .
They float outside a cell 's chromosomes , hijacking its machinery from afar and ostensibly leaving genomes intact .
But that assumption proved wrong .
In 2007 , Israeli scientists studying a bee - infecting RNA virus noticed that some colonies were unusually resistant .
When they analyzed the bees ' genomes , they found fragmented gene sequences resembling those from the virus .
The match was n't exact ; instead , the fragments seemed to date from some ancestral infection .
The findings spurred Skalka to compare more animal genomes to other RNA virus sequences .
She was n't alone :
While writing the latest paper , published July 29 in Public Library of Science Pathogens , researchers from the University of Texas published a landmark finding of ancient borna virus genes in the human genome .
While those findings stole the thunder from the latest study , Skalka 's work has now expanded the evidence for genomic RNA viral fossils across the animal kingdom .
" We were amazed at how many we found , " she said .
Skalka 's team found evidence of 80 ancient RNA viral jumps in 19 of 48 vertebrate genomes , from lampreys to cows and humans .
With two exceptions – genes from the little - known Midway virus in zebrafish , and Tamana bat virus genes in a fish called the Medaka – the genes came from borna viruses or filoviruses , a family containing the dread Ebola and Marburg .
In addition to the aforementioned guinea pigs , insect - eating bats , opossums and wallabies , shrews and palm - sized primates called tarsiers contained filovirus fragments .
Among the species joining humans in carrying borna virus fragments are cows , lemurs and mice .
How these gene fragments jumped from viruses to vertebrates is a matter of speculation .
Skalka suspects that malfunctioning machinery in sperm or egg cells could have copied RNA virus genes , then slipped them into chromosomes later duplicated during reproduction .
Also speculative is what these viral fragments did – or still do , given their conspicuous lack of random mutations that gather in unused genes – for their unwitting recipients .
In the Israeli bees , the RNA virus genes appear to be protective ; they may act like a vaccine , or jam invading viruses with almost - but - not - quite - alike proteins .
That could also be the case with humans , who are generally resistant to borna virus infection , and other animals flagged by the study .
" You could imagine that the proteins made by these genes would look like the virus proteins , but they 're not exactly the same .
And if these funny proteins are there , maybe they muck up the works , " said Skalka , who plans to focus her research on fragments in the human genome .
" There would be a real advantage to that . "
According to Ian Lipkin , a genetic epidemiologist at Columbia University , Skalka 's " elegant study " underscores the complicated , species - spanning nature of our bodies .
" The more we delve into genomics the more we become uncertain as to who and what we are , " said Lipkin .
" Fragments of retroviruses represent up to 10 percent of the human genome .
The number of bacteria on and in our bodies outnumber human cells by 10 to 1 .
These are not silent passengers . "

HEY
Hey , it could be over - again - for Daryl Somers , with Channel 9 set to decide the retro variety show 's future at week 's end .
The move follows dismal ratings for the Somers - hosted show in recent weeks .
Hey Hey It 's Saturday averaged 801,000 viewers last week - a third of the audience for last year 's reunion specials .
It was smashed by MasterChef Australia , which hit more than two million viewers last week .
Nine is to screen two more episodes of Hey Hey , culminating in the much - publicised appearance by Kylie Minogue on the July 21 show .
Hey
Hey was set to run for 15 episodes , ending on August 4 , followed by another five later in the year .
Nine 's decision has stopped the show in its tracks after 13 episodes .
Nine programming director Michael Healy praised its performance " as a terrific job in a competitive environment " , and said Nine hoped to schedule the remaining episodes .
Somers last night told viewers reports of the show 's demise should be disregarded .
He said the initial run of shows had actually been extended and the remaining episodes would air after the Commonwealth Games .
" We will be back at the end of the year and that comes from the programming department , " he said .
But critics doubt it will be back .
" They ( Nine ) ca n't afford to have it at 7.30 pm with only 800,000 viewers , " media analyst Steve Allen said .
" Providing Nine has the programming firepower ( to replace Hey Hey ) you wo n't see it again . "
A Nine insider said , " I do n't think a decision will be made until the end of the week . "
One of the show 's stars , Russell Gilbert , recently admitted it was taking the crew time to hit their straps after the mega - success of last year 's reunion specials .
" We 've been finding our feet , " he said .
" It 's like a footballer who does a knee and misses a year .
We broke our legs and missed 10 . "
Corrinne Lawrence , the fan who spearheaded a Facebook campaign to bring the show back , defended it this week .
" Daryl is only doing this for us - he could be doing anything but he 's doing this for our nation , " Lawrence said .

By some accounts , having states collaborate more closely with ICE could improve public safety .
ICE has repeatedly urged police departments to take advantage of its Law Enforcement Support Center in Vermont , a 24 - hour network that is distinct from the controversial 287 ( g ) program .
With Congress mired in an increasingly angry debate over the 12 million illegal immigrants nationwide , police are left to contend with the fallout , from hard - core criminals who hide their identities to hard - working laborers who drive without licenses because they need to earn money to send home to their families .
The wildly disparate approaches of the two neighboring states — one that helps federal officials enforce immigration law , one that does not — illustrate how police are often caught in the middle between politics and public safety .
“ We investigate not just traffic violators but also homicides , sexual assaults , drug trafficking , and any number of serious , violent crimes , ’’ said David Procopio , Massachusetts State Police spokesman .
“ We cannot have some of these people fearing that they ’re going to be deported if they talk to us . ’’
Massachusetts troopers say they work with federal immigration agents on criminal cases , but otherwise focus on enforcing state laws .
But it is a practice that Governor Deval Patrick ’s opponents in the governor ’s race are urging Massachusetts to revive .
The Patrick administration has staunchly opposed having state troopers enforce immigration laws , and shortly after he took office in 2007 , the governor rescinded a pact by his predecessor , Mitt Romney , to assign 30 troopers to the so - called federal 287 ( g ) program , which trains local police to enforce federal immigration law .
Rhode Island ’s collaboration with federal immigration authorities is controversial ; critics say the practice increases racial profiling and makes immigrants afraid to help police solve crimes .
“ There are police chiefs throughout New England who hide from the issue . . . and I ’m not hiding from it , ’’ said Colonel Brendan P. Doherty , the towering commander of the Rhode Island State Police .
“ I would feel that I ’m derelict in my duties to look the other way . ’’
From Woonsocket to Westerly , the troopers patrolling the nation ’s smallest state are reporting all illegal immigrants they encounter , even on routine stops such as speeding , to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement , known as ICE .
If the accident had happened 15 miles north in Massachusetts , the man would probably have been arrested for driving without a license , which carries a fine of up to $ 1,000 and 10 days in jail , then released pending an appearance in district court .
The man said he did not have a license , and under questioning , confessed that he was here illegally from Guatemala .
SCITUATE , R.I. — Rhode Island State Trooper Nuno Vasconcelos was patrolling Interstate 95 a few months ago when he came upon a two - car accident in heavy traffic .
The trooper pulled up , stepped out of his cruiser , and asked one of the drivers for his license .
Bruce Foucart , special agent in charge of ICE in New England , said the center helps police verify the identities of immigrants who are suspected , arrested , or convicted of crimes , and aids ICE by informing them about people who are here illegally .
The federal agency can then decide whether to detain an immigrant for deportation or release them pending a hearing in immigration court .
“ Does that make for good public safety ?
Yes , ’’ Foucart said .
“ How do you know who it is until you check him through the [ center ] ? ’’
Since Patrick rescinded Romney ’s order , Massachusetts State Police communication with the Vermont center has plunged .
Last fiscal year , Massachusetts troopers checked the immigration status of 575 people with the federal support center in Vermont , an 87 percent drop from 4,461 checks in 2006 .
Instead , Patrick had the Department of Correction screen inmates and report those here illegally to federal officials .
Since 2007 , the Department of Correction has turned over 524 inmates to federal officials .
In Rhode Island , a much smaller state , the State Police checks soared in the same time period , from 125 to 222 .
Providence police started using the Vermont center daily in 2008 after an illegal immigrant with prior arrests and an outstanding deportation order kidnapped and raped a woman .
Patrick ’s challengers for governor , Republican candidate Charles D. Baker and independent Timothy P. Cahill , called on Massachusetts to reinstate Romney ’s plan .
They raised the issue in May after an illegal immigrant from Mexico rear - ended a state representative ’s car .
In Rhode Island , home to 1 million people and 30,000 illegal immigrants , the immigration debate has been far more incendiary .
In 2008 , Governor Donald L. Carcieri , a Republican , issued an executive order mandating immigration checks on all new state workers and ordering State Police to assist federal immigration officials .
Sitting in his office in an old farmhouse off a country highway , Doherty said the State Police had collaborated with federal immigration officials before , but the relationship has become more formal in recent years .
In 2007 , he said , he trained all state troopers in how to deal with noncitizens because of widespread confusion and because Congress did not resolve the issue of illegal immigration .
Troopers learned to notify consulates when noncitizens are arrested , how to recognize different forms of identification , and how to deal with different cultures .
In 2009 , Doherty took it a step further and enrolled in the 287 ( g ) program , which designated four troopers as immigration task force agents to assist in investigating drug and human trafficking and other crimes .
They also help regular troopers report illegal immigrants to ICE .
Troopers say the issue typically comes up during criminal investigations or when motorists do n’t have driver ’s licenses , and police need to verify their identities with the center in Vermont .
Troopers also ask for passengers ’ identification , which they say is standard policy .
Passengers could decline , but most hand over their identification .
The Rhode Island ACLU and other critics say they are concerned that the State Police ’s efforts are leading to racial profiling .
Steven Brown , ACLU executive director , said police should focus on enforcing state law , not federal law , and questioned why they are singling out immigrants for enforcement .
For instance , he said , if they stop a young white man driving a Porsche for speeding , would they also check with the IRS to see whether he is paying his taxes ?
“ If everything ’s in order , why are you pursing anything at all in the absence of the crime ? ’’ he asked .
Juan Garcia , a community advocate in Providence , said he regularly receives reports that State Police are appearing more frequently in mostly Latino neighborhoods .
“ They ’re stopping Guatemalans and Latinos , ’’ he said .
“ We ’ve seen a growth in this . ’’
Separate ride - alongs with two troopers , Vasconcelos and Al Ruggiero , recently showed that troopers often have little time to react before deciding to pull someone over .
Cars weave in and out of traffic or zip by at high speeds .
Both troopers said they run into illegal immigrants occasionally , perhaps once every few weeks or months .
“ They ’re treated with respect , ’’ Ruggiero said .
“ We ’re not out profiling . ’’
Vasconcelos , the son of Cape Verdean immigrants who was born in Mozambique , said troopers feel compassion for undocumented immigrants who are just here to work ; but , he said , troopers must enforce the law .
“ To be honest , being an immigrant myself , I do feel , in a way , bad , but the law ’s the law , ’’ he said .
“ My job is to enforce the law .
You try not to let personal emotions get involved . ’’

In today ’s Internet , data traveling through optical fibers as beams of light have to be converted to electrical signals for processing .
By dispensing with that conversion , a new network design could increase Internet speeds 100 - fold .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The heart of the Internet is a network of high - capacity optical fibers that spans continents .
But while optical signals transmit information much more efficiently than electrical signals , they ?re harder to control .
The routers that direct traffic on the Internet typically convert optical signals to electrical ones for processing , then convert them back for transmission , a process that consumes time and energy .
In recent years , however , a group of MIT researchers led by Vincent Chan , the Joan and Irwin Jacobs Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , has demonstrated a new way of organizing optical networks that , in most cases , would eliminate this inefficient conversion process .
As a result , it could make the Internet 100 or even 1,000 times faster while actually reducing the amount of energy it consumes .
One of the reasons that optical data transmission is so efficient is that different wavelengths of light loaded with different information can travel over the same fiber .
But problems arise when optical signals coming from different directions reach a router at the same time .
Converting them to electrical signals allows the router to store them in memory until it can get to them .
The wait may be a matter of milliseconds , but there ’s no cost - effective way to hold an optical signal still for even that short a time .
Chan ’s approach , called “ flow switching , ” solves this problem in a different way .
Between locations that exchange large volumes of data — say , Los Angeles and New York City — flow switching would establish a dedicated path across the network .
For certain wavelengths of light , routers along that path would accept signals coming in from only one direction and send them off in only one direction .
Since there ’s no possibility of signals arriving from multiple directions , there ’s never a need to store them in memory .
Reaction time
To some extent , something like this already happens in today ’s Internet .
A large Web company like Facebook or Google , for instance , might maintain huge banks of Web servers at a few different locations in the United States .
The servers might exchange so much data that the company will simply lease a particular wavelength of light from one of the telecommunications companies that maintains the country ’s fiber - optic networks .
Across a designated pathway , no other Internet traffic can use that wavelength .
In this case , however , the allotment of bandwidth between the two endpoints is fixed .
If for some reason the company ’s servers are n’t exchanging much data , the bandwidth of the dedicated wavelength is being wasted .
If the servers are exchanging a lot of data , they might exceed the capacity of the link .
In a flow - switching network , the allotment of bandwidth would change constantly .
As traffic between New York and Los Angeles increased , new , dedicated wavelengths would be recruited to handle it ; as the traffic tailed off , the wavelengths would be relinquished .
Chan and his colleagues have developed network management protocols that can perform these reallocations in a matter of seconds .
In a series of papers published over a span of 20 years — the latest of which will be presented at the OptoElectronics and Communications Conference in Japan next month — they ’ve also performed mathematical analyses of flow - switched networks ’ capacity and reported the results of extensive computer simulations .
They ’ve even tried out their ideas on a small experimental optical network that runs along the Eastern Seaboard .
Their conclusion is that flow switching can easily increase the data rates of optical networks 100 - fold and possibly 1,000 - fold , with further improvements of the network management scheme .
Their recent work has focused on the power savings that flow switching offers :
In most applications of information technology , power can be traded for speed and vice versa , but the researchers are trying to quantify that relationship .
Among other things , they ’ve shown that even with a 100 - fold increase in data rates , flow switching could still reduce the Internet ’s power consumption .
Growing appetite
Ori Gerstel , a principal engineer at Cisco Systems , the largest manufacturer of network routing equipment , says that several other techniques for increasing the data rate of optical networks , with names like burst switching and optical packet switching , have been proposed , but that flow switching is “ much more practical . ”
The chief obstacle to its adoption , he says , is n’t technical but economic .
Implementing Chan ’s scheme would mean replacing existing Internet routers with new ones that do n’t have to convert optical signals to electrical signals .
But , Gerstel says , it ’s not clear that there ’s currently enough demand for a faster Internet to warrant that expense .
“ Flow switching works fairly well for fairly large demand — if you have users who need a lot of bandwidth and want low delay through the network , ” Gerstel says .
“ But most customers are not in that niche today . ”
But Chan points to the explosion of the popularity of both Internet video and high - definition television in recent years .
If those two trends converge — if people begin hungering for high - definition video feeds directly to their computers — flow switching may make financial sense .
Chan points at the 30 - inch computer monitor atop his desk in MIT ’s Research Lab of Electronics .
“ High resolution at 120 frames per second , ” he says : “ That ’s a lot of data . ”

Pakistani president Musharraf allegedly said today that Omar Sheikh was an MI6 ( British intelligence services ) agent .
The article covering Musharraf 's statement says " At some point , he probably became a rogue or double agent . "
This is interesting , because Mr. Sheikh is claimed to be one of the masterminds , trainers and / or funders of 9/11 .
Did Mr. Sheikh in fact become a rogue or double agent ?
Or was he still working for MI6 when he played his role in the 9/11 attacks ?
