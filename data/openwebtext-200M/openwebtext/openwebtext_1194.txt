in space , no one can hear you nuke
The Soviet Union wanted to detonate a nuclear warhead on the Moon as a show of force .
But without an atmosphere and 238,900 miles away , what would that look like ?
Speaking of bombing the Moon with nuclear warheads , there ’s a long standing reader request that I ’ve waited to fulfill next time there ’s a story about weapons of mass destruction in space .
If you were to set off a massive nuke on the lunar surface , what would happen ?
How would the explosion form and radiate ?
Would it be a real show of force , or would the result be an underwhelming blink - and - you - miss - it flash ?
And could our planet be affected by the power of the blast ?
In this post , we ’ll answer all your questions about bombing an alien world as well as take a peek under the hood of modern nuclear weapons to understand how they work in space .
Let ’s start with how thermonuclear devices actually work .
Fusion bombs are multi-stage mechanisms which are made up of a fission core and fuel consisting of deuterium and a type of lithium that produces tritium when bombarded with radiation .
Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with a neutron and tritium has two neutrons .
When subjected to enormous temperatures and pressures , they combine into helium , releasing a small amount of energy and a stream of neutrons .
And this is exactly why there ’s a fission bomb in the device .
When the high explosives inside it compress its plutonium and uranium core , the blast momentarily provides the pressures and heat necessary to kick start a fusion reaction .
The process is very inefficient and only a very small amount of the weapon ’s mass is converted to energy .
In fact , a quick and dirty back of the envelope calculation of what amount of mass turns to radiation in a 10 megaton blast gives us just 465.5 grams in the following manner …
m = 4.18 × 1016 J / 299,792,4582 m/sec = 4.18 × 1016 / 8.99 × 1016 = 0.4655 kg
The rest is catapulted high into the atmosphere or even space and comes down as the nuclear fallout we all know and very rightfully fear .
Predicting the exact yield of a nuclear weapon is a tricky business due to all the variables involved .
From the intricate and mostly classified inner workings of the actual devices , to the many impurities even enriched nuclear fuel has , you ’ll never know exactly how many megatons you ’re going to get until you actually push the button and see the mushroom cloud .
And here ’s where things get interesting since that symbolic mushroom cloud is caused by the movement of the dust and debris in a dense atmosphere .
In fact , you can see clouds like that form in many explosions , the question is how much they rise and how huge they ’ll get .
The destructive pressure waves and the deafening 200 +
dB roar are also the effects of a nuke in an atmosphere and would vary depending on the the density of the air in which the explosion occurred .
But wait a second .
The Moon does n’t really have an atmosphere .
Sure , there ’s a negligible amount of gasses floating around the surface but for all intents and purposes , the lunar surface is basically a vacuum .
So there would be no sound , no pressure wave and no mushroom cloud .
There would certainly be a shockwave racing along the lunar surface and through the Moon ’s interior , meeting at the antipodal point and possibly causing a small quake there if the blast had enough power .
However , without the weight of a dense atmosphere , there would be no resistance to the growth of the nuclear fireball .
It would expand in a fraction of a second and give off radiation in the form of heat , light and gamma rays .
And to be seen from 238,000 miles away , the device by itself would have to be enormously powerful , even more monstrously potent than the Soviet Tsar Bomba with its estimated 57 megatons .
That bomb had a theoretical upper bound of 100 megatons but the design was n’t pushed to its maximum potential to reduce fallout .
In space , where everything is already radioactive , fallout is really not a major concern .
In fact , the devices would need to be pushed as far as they can go to show off their destructive potential to an alien audience .
However , because the result would just be a brief flash which would raise a big plume of pulverized dust and rock , detonating even a gigaton weapon on the Moon would n’t be much of a show for Earthlings .
Sure , some of the debris would be hurled towards us , but the vast majority of it would burn up in the atmosphere or end up in the ocean .
There could be a shallow crater on the lunar surface and the blast would uncover some volcanic rocks from the Moon ’s ancient past , but that ’s about it .
If the explosion goes off in the wrong spot , at the wrong time and we ’re not straining our binoculars and telescopes on the right place on the Moon , we could very well miss the very brief pinpoint of light .
Though we certainly would n’t want to send a satellite to observe the event too closely because a burst of X - rays and gamma rays could fry its electronics .
As I ’ve written before , using a nuke in space would be like shooting off electromagnetic pulses .
It would interrupt communication between enemy targets and damage computers that lack protective shielding , but it would n’t be nearly as effective as it could be when set off in an atmosphere where its effects would be amplified by the density of the air .

Cap D’Agde in the South of France is just like any other holiday village , except that the holidaymakers there wear no clothes .
A curious Deirdre Morrissey , pictured , got her kit off and joined the nudists , the swingers , the hedonists and those who are simply trying to spice up their sex lives .
It was to be a holiday she would never forget .
Packing for my recent trip to the South of France , I had anticipated many new experiences , but having trouble with my luggage was not one of them .
My boyfriend was not amused when I joked , " Well , I wo n't be wearing any clothes , so maybe there 's no point packing a suitcase " , but that was the truth of it .
At Cap d'Agde , my destination , clothes are optional -- and in some cases outlawed -- so I puzzled over what to bring with me .
Never before had I left home for more than two days without an overweight bag full of countless changes , each outfit complete with matching shoes and bags , but all I imagined needing this time was modest hand - luggage of sandals , accessories and shades .
As I zipped up my bag , I felt strangely naked already .
A few weeks prior to heading off , I had read a review of Cap d'Agde , one of the world 's best nudist resorts , near Montpellier on France 's Mediterranean coast .
Devotees raved about this huge , gated , self - contained village , which offers all the amenities common to every village , plus one major difference : everyone 's naked .
In high season , 40,000 naturists from all over the world swarm to this resort to swim , dance , shop and dine out in the buff , and my mind boggled with images and questions .
I 'd only ever seen nudist communes in movies , where they were inhabited by weird , cultish types .
I wondered what kind of people go there -- are they old and wrinkly or young and hot ?
If they are young and hot , is everyone walking around in a constant state of arousal ?
I was n't sure if it was all about sex , or just getting a tan without strap marks ; whether it was a philosophy or a perversity , and I wondered , most of all , if I had the balls for it .
So to speak .
I decided I had to find out more , and rang my photographer pal , Emily Quinn , to see if she'd be willing to join me in my natural state and take the pictures .
" I do n't have to take the photos in the nip , do I ? " Emily asked , panic - stricken .
I laughed at the absurdity of offering someone a job that required them to take their clothes off .
There have been major sexual harassment cases over less , but in the end she was up for it , though the suitcase full of flesh - toned thongs that she brought to Cap d'Agde suggested she had some reservations .
Apart from the packing issues , going on holiday to Cap d'Agde could n't be more straightforward -- anyone can enter this naked city .
There is no initiation ceremony ; you do n't need to crack a code or find a secret map ; you just get a flight or a train , pay a small local tourist tax at the gate and you 're in .
We flew to Marseilles and stayed overnight before heading to the train station the next morning for the short journey to our clothing - optional resort .
At the SNCF station , I innocently asked a group of security guards for the train to Cap d'Agde and they smirked and laughed to one another in French , the glint in their eyes suggesting they were picturing us walking around in a state of undress .
Or maybe that was my imagination .
In any case , this was our last experience of anyone thinking it was smutty or silly to be letting it all hang out on holiday .
As we entered the resort and made our way to Hotel Eve , it was a struggle to keep the eyes from popping out of our heads .
Bare bodies cycled merrily by on bikes and wandered in and out of their houses with all their bits on show .
We passed couples sitting on high stools at the bar , sipping margaritas , not wearing a stitch .
Every lounger by the pool was occupied by people wearing nothing but their shades , and a group of nude , middle - aged folk were frolicking in the pool .
They were all as brown as caramel and seemed extremely at ease and comfortable in their skin .
At the hotel reception , people checked in and out completely starkers .
The manager , a young Frenchman called Jeremy , never lost eye contact or changed the expression on his face as he dealt with the naked guests , though .
It later emerged that Jeremy was brought up in a naturist family , so nudity 's the norm for him .
Once in the privacy of our room , Emily and I giggled like schoolgirls at the strangeness of it all .
And then set to deciding what was appropriate to wear .
Or not wear .
Emily went for the flesh - coloured underwear -- which , back in Ireland , she thought would pass for naked -- and I put on my bikini bottoms and so many accessories that I was completely covered , albeit officially half - naked .
We hit the beach first and feasted our eyes on two miles of glistening , naked bodies , all brown as berries .
A couple of Pamela Anderson lookalikes came walking towards us with their boyfriends .
Emily and I agreed that one of the girls had the hottest body we 'd ever seen , but this could well be because we 've been imprisoned in the so - called ' textile ' world for so long that we have n't seen too many naked women up close and personal .
But there was every variety of human form on display .
Saggy , baggy bodies with lumps and bumps in all the wrong places .
Vibrant , toned , young bodies with everything where it should be .
The mystique of boobs was over for us very fast as we took in every shape and size on show , ranging from big , drooping bosoms to tiny treasure chests and back up again to big , plastic melons with nipples that look like rockets set for space .
As for the men , it was just like being at a sausage counter with an array of frankfurters , cocktail sausages , Mexican sausages , larger chorizos and the occasional extra - large full salami .
It was comical to see how small they shrivel up when cold and wet , fresh from the sea .
Oh , and there was at least one Italian who was hung like a stallion .
We stopped to watch a group of aesthetically pleasing specimens playing volleyball .
You could see every sinew in these guy 's bodies .
The aforementioned stallion 's beautiful Swedish girlfriend -- who had big , perky , plastic boobs with rocket nipples -- watched from the sideline with her naked , seven - year - old daughter and told me they 're nudists because they love being naked and exhibiting their bodies in public .
Three generations of hippies were also playing volleyball .
The grandparents , Ann and Paddy Dufour , knocked the ball back and forth with their 29 - year - old son and their five - year - old grandson , all of them in their noodles .
The Dufours are the real deal : naturist old stock .
When Ann was 15 , she started dating Paddy , and the pair have lived the past 26 years as naturists , spending six months of the year in a naturist jungle community in Papua New Guinea , and the other six in Cap d'Agde .
They looked like characters from The Beach ; they had no inhibitions , they were lean and fit and carried none of the usual signs of stress and emotional baggage .
The different subcultures within the naturist village gradually unfolded before us .
In 1963 , when the resort was officially designated a naturist village , rules were set requiring total nudity as the norm , and banning photography , the wearing of provocative clothing , and the display of indecent items .
Voyeurs and exhibitionists were not welcome .
These rules were originally enforced by the authorities , but , by the beginning of the Nineties , for financial and commercial purposes , the rules were relaxed and there was an invasion of the libertine movement .
Libertines believe in pure hedonism , including exhibitionism , as we discovered when we sampled the nightlife .
That night , a bit overwhelmed by the day 's experiences , we decided on a quiet dinner in The Bounty , but got more than we bargained for .
Over our apres - dinner cappuccino , we were a little surprised to see a buffed - up guy dressed in a police uniform mincing around the seating area of the restaurant bothering the patrons .
His performance ended with him thrusting his naked bits at a pair of female diners , like some sort of bizarre , hedonistic digestif .
Next , out came a female Hulk Hogan type packed into a corset , who ripped some random punter away from his wife and up onto the stage .
At first , what we found to be a little tongue - in - cheek fun turned into plain old cringe - comedy as she performed a full - on lap dance , which climaxed with her sliding her naked body over his , and simulating fellatio on the not unwilling diner .
This is not an after - dinner activity I would like to see again .
We awkwardly asked the wife of the gentleman on stage if she was OK with this performance , and she took this as a cue to join us .
As her husband pulled up his jeans I noticed that he'd shaved all his body hair off and was wearing a silver and diamante cock - ring .
They told us that they both enjoyed the experience , because this is what they come to Cap d'Agde for .
They were not naturists , she explained , but echangistes .
That 's swingers to you , and so , another Cap d'Agde subculture unfolded .
This husband and wife revealed to us how they lie to family and friends about where they go on holiday , and how they come to Cap d'Agde every summer to fulfil their sexual fantasies .
They refused to be photographed to protect their anonymity .
They told us the best part of the resort was the adults - only beach where couples openly performed sexual acts in front of each other .
We passed up their kind invitation to join them there .
" Nobody judges anyone here , " the husband told us .
" Everyone is accepted for who they are and what they are .
If a woman in her 50s wants to dress up in sexy , kinky outfits , that 's cool .
I 'm 30 now , and it frightens me to think we might have to stop expressing our sexuality at the age of 50 .
I love it that here , people of all ages are confident enough to flaunt their naked bodies .
In society , we get too used to just seeing the aesthetically perfect form of the physical body exposed .
Everybody , every shape and every form , is beautiful . "
When we parted with this pair outside the restaurant , Emily and I watched them walk away , the wife 's tight dress pulled up to reveal her bare bum to anyone who might be interested .
The next morning , when we told the hotel manager Jeremy where we had dined , he was obviously disappointed .
" There are an increased number of these echangistes guests , " he said , disapprovingly , " who treat the free atmosphere of d'Agde as the Eldorado of sleaze .
The resort was cooler when it was ruled by peace and love years ago -- when it was just real naturists coming here .
But I suppose we are still all part of the same carpe diem philosophy . "
At breakfast on the roof garden , everyone was again in the nude , and I decided that when in Rome , I should do as the Romans do , so I got my kit off .
Funnily enough , I had got more attention from the other guests when I was dressed , though at the pool in the afternoon , it felt wonderfully liberating to lie back and let the sun soak into every inch of my body .
Walking around the resort naked , however , I was less laid back .
I anxiously looked around me , expecting the men in blue to come and lock me up .
I felt most indecent and scuttled along , trying to hide behind Emily , clenching my butt cheeks together and taking minuscule steps in an attempt to keep my private parts private .
A guy whizzed by on a bike and , forgetting I was in the nip , I ran after him and asked him for a photo .
A few seconds later the realisation struck me : here I was , starkers on the street , asking a guy equally starkers if we could take photos of him .
This genuine naturist was a little shy , but he agreed to do a few laps around us while Emily jigged about trying to find an angle that left the man a little dignity .
I thought about how badly things could go wrong with just one slip of the pedal , at the same time marvelling at how quickly it felt perfectly normal to be standing around in the nude .
In one of the resort 's coffee shops we met a lovely couple from Berlin : Katherine and Hans .
Hans sat opposite me with a sarong tied loosely around his midriff , his package on full display like a pink elephant in the room that everyone was ignoring .
I kept my eye line steady as I asked this nice , middle - aged couple why they come to Cap d'Agde .
" To me , coming here is like coming home , " said Hans .
" I know the owners of some restaurants for 20 years .
I met Katherine seven years ago , and she fell in love with the place , also .
Cap d'Agde is my paradise .
The first thing I do when I park the car outside our apartment is strip .
I think as soon as you put off the clothes , you put off the sorrows .
Normally , if you fly overseas , you need two or three days to forget the stresses of business life , but here you take off the clothes and you instantly reveal another person .
When people remove their clothes they break down the barriers that clothes put between them . "
At night , the village again became a haven for hedonists , swingers and gays .
The streets were lined with sex shops full of dolly - bird punters selecting seductive gear , with their proud fellas on hand to pick up the tab .
Women strutted out of the shops wearing tops with peepholes for their boobs ; others were togged out in cowboy hats , boots and nothing else .
Impossibly tall transvestites were dressed up as schoolgirls in short skirts and long socks .
Academic - looking men strolled around in leather hotpants .
As we walked past Melrose , one of the busiest nightclubs on the strip , Emily and I stopped to absorb the atmosphere , but we were prevented from entering the club as we were inappropriately dressed .
The irony of being refused entry to a nudist nightclub because we were n't wearing the correct footwear was hilarious .
Standing , rejected , in my flip - flops , thinking about the boxes of Louboutins stacked up at home , screaming for such an outing , I could n't help but laugh and I concluded that it 's better to have it and not need it , than need it and not have it .
Enjoying a nightcap back at the hotel , we sat by the pool as an older French couple had sex in the water .
Post - coitus , the couple came and sat near Emily and myself and struck up a conversation .
They told us that throughout their 40 years of marriage they had enjoyed a great sex life and were both deeply saddened when it died .
They discussed it with their doctor , and his prescription was to go to d'Agde , in the hope that the sexual stimulation there would reawaken their sexual energy !
Well , there was no arguing with the wisdom of their GP , though I doubt there are many Irish doctors who would recommend the same .
It made me realise how we had so quickly become accustomed to this place , a world away from home and its rules and rigidity .
Never mind naturist villages , there are no nude beaches in Ireland , which keeps us all a little out of touch with our bodies .
And I must admit that in an ocean of nudity one actually becomes less aware of personal body image , and begins to realise that we are all just variations of the same thing .
The more nudity I saw , the more immune I became to it .
What 's the big deal about bums and tummies ?
We do n't look much different to our animal friends when we 're stripped of our polo shirts , Wonderbras and Spanx .
Then again , on what naturists refer to as ' textile ' beaches , the suggestive nudity in bikinis and swimsuits is far sexier .
When everything is laid out on a plate , there 's nothing left to our most powerful sexual organ : the imagination .
A guy seeing a sexy woman strutting by in a bikini could dream all day about undressing her , but when she 's already naked , what 's left to do ?

Hot water heaters are an indispensable appliance in the modern home , but can also cause considerable damage to the home and its occupants if it is not maintained properly .
This article will go over hot water heater 's major components , inspection points , and repairs .
This article is geared towards gas - fired hot water heaters as these include additional components such as baffles , vents , and burners .
Hot Water Heater Components
Cold Water Supply Valve – this item is to control flow of water to the water heater .
It should be a full bore gate valve or ball valve .
Without a cold water shut - off , the water main must be used .
Most areas require cold water shut off within arms length of the front of the water heater .
Temperature / Pressure Relief ( TPR ) Valve – Inside the TPR valve is a spring loaded disc that will open should the temperature reach 210 degrees or the pressure reach 150 lbs.
TPR valves are mandatory on water heaters .
The correct location for the valve is within the top six inches of the tank .
Some are top mounted ; others are side mounted .
Gas water heaters without TPR valves have been known to go through the roof of a home .
Relief valves should also have a discharge vent line terminating near the floor .
Some areas , however , do require them to be piped outside .
In addition the pipe must be full - sized , usually 3/ 4 inch , and never threaded at the outlet end nor trapped in any way .
If piped to a sink or floor drain , it must have an air gap between the outlet end and the rim of the sink or drain .
Gas Line Shutoff – Should an emergency arise , the gas shut off valve can be used to shut down the water heater immediately .
It can also be used to shut off the gas for servicing or repairs .
The inspector may want to barely turn the gas valves , just enough to determine they are not frozen shut , but no more .
Drain Valve – Draining a few quarts off the bottom of the tank once a year ( or as often as manufacturers suggest ) may prolong the life of the water heater .
Over time sediment and sludge build up at the base of the tank .
This sediment contributes to the deterioration of the tank and also prevents heat transfer .
The drain valve is generally not located directly at the base of the tank , so some sludge will remain no matter how often it ’s drained .
The popping noises sometimes heard while a water heater is operating can most often be attributed to the sludge buildup .
This sediment may also block the valve during testing , in which case it will need to be replaced .
Thermostat Control –
The temperature of domestic hot water should not be above approximately 120° F to help prevent scalding .
This corresponds to a dial setting of about halfway ( needle pointing straight up . )
Turning the thermostat all the way up could result in temperatures of approximately 180° F .
Many newer gas controls have built - in stops to prevent thermostats from being set too high .
This type of control is usually set at 140° F. Temperature settings for residential heaters should be around 130° F to kill Legionella bacteria .
Sacrificial Anode – Water will always try to corrode something .
In every water heater there is an anode , usually composed of aluminum , zinc - aluminum alloy , or magnesium , which will most likely corrode before the tank begins to corrode .
Once this anode is completely gone or is removed , the tank will begin to corrode .
Replacement of the anode is a simple process and can greatly increase the life span of the water heater .
Sometimes it has to be removed and replaced with a rod of another composition because of the adverse chemical reactions to the rod supplied .
Burner – Located at the bottom of the heater where gas , or oil , is burned to heat the water inside the tank .
The burner is set under the steel tank and flue gases rise through a tube and baffle that runs through the tank .
Baffle – Inside the tank vent for the water heater is a helical shaped baffle .
The purpose of the baffle is to help deflect heat to the tank and increase the efficiency of the burning process .
Often when carbon monoxide is discovered at the water heater it is because this baffle has fallen down into the flames at the base of the water heater .
Vent Pipe – Galvanized metal ducting that removes combustion gases from the burner as it passes through the baffle .
The Temperature Pressure Relief ( TPR ) Valve
If replaced , the valve must meet the requirements of local codes , but not less than a combination temperature and pressure relief valve certified as indicated in the above paragraph .
The valve must be marked with a maximum set pressure not to exceed the marked hydrostatic working pressure of the water heater ( 150 PSI = 1,035 kPa ) and a discharge capacity not less than the water heater input rate as shown on the model rating plate .
For safe operation of the water heater , the relief valve must not be removed from its designated opening nor plugged .
Replacing the TPR is relatively simple .
The TPR unscrews from the tank easily especially if it 's been installed with pipe - thread seal tape .
What 's connected to it and how it was piped can complicate matters .
Code requires , at minimum , a pipe leading to within about six inches of the floor to prevent injury when testing .
As to testing the relief , you accomplish this by pulling up on the handle , holding it a few seconds and letting go .
Water should flow through the line while the handle is raised and stop when you let go .
If there is no water flowing , it wo n’t stop flowing , or wo n't stop dripping within a few minutes after releasing the handle , the TPR should be replaced .
If sediment coats the temperature probe on the interior it will need to be replaced .
This is due to dissolved minerals in the water collecting on the probe over time .
This creates a thermal insulator that will prevent the TPR from tripping at its design temperature .
Anode Rod
The sacrificial anode rod is probably the most important component of the hot water heater that is never thought about , or even seen .
The warranty provided by hot water heater manufacturers is based on the expected life of the anode rod .
This can vary however due to water conditions and maintenance routines .
The head of the anode is a 1 – 1/16 inch hex head protruding from the top of the tank .
Some manufacturers use a combination rod which is attached to nipple of the hot water outlet , you will know you have this type of anode if there is no hex head apparent at the top of the tank .
Due to the properties of the metal , aluminum rods are less reactive and dissolve slower than magnesium , but offer slightly less protection .
There are also health concerns with aluminum that I will not go into here .
Aluminum rods are also cheaper , which is why they are commonly used for anode rods .
Aluminum does have an advantage over magnesium in reducing the “ rotten egg ” odor that occurs .
Softened water will dissolve either anode more quickly due to the salt and aluminum rods will leave behind a greater amount of sediment which will need to be flushed from the tank .
Hard water will consume rods more quickly and also deposit minerals on the TPR valve as discussed earlier .
Sediment Control
The process of heating hard water will cause minerals to come out of solution and be deposited on the tank bottom .
This is why manufacturers recommend flushing the tank at least annually .
An increase in sediment will lower the heater ’s efficiency since the sediment will insulate the water from being heated and potentially overheat the bottom of the tank .
Follow the instructions in you owner ’s manual for this , but basically it entails opening the drain valve at the bottom of the tank slowly .
I usually hook up a garden hose to the valve and run it to my sump pump pit .
You can also run it to a sink or outside , even into a 5 gallon bucket if you have no other option .
Since the water is hot , wear gloves to prevent scalding , also the heat may cause the hose fitting to expand and come off , so make sure that it is on tight .
Run the water until clear .
An important part of flushing the tank is the dip tube .
This is a long plastic ( PVC ) tube on the nipple of the cold water line inside the tank that brings the cold water down to the bottom of the tank to be heated .
These become brittle overtime and can fall apart .
Some companies sell curved dip tubes which will create a circular water flow to help direct the sediment to the drain valve .
Replacing the original drain valve with a ball valve will help flush the sediment out faster .
Also , after about 10 years , the dip tube can disintegrate to the point where you may find small pieces of it in your aerators of your faucets .
At this point the dip tube will need to be replaced .
Burner
Look at the tank for any signs of corrosion or blackened areas near the burner .
Corrosion can be coming from a leak inside of the tank or from high moisture content in the area .
Blackened areas near the burner are almost always from improper combustion or back drafting .
Insulation blankets can be purchased to wrap water heaters , but when blankets are installed on gas water heaters , the fire hazard may outweigh the minor if any cost savings of the wrapping .
Insulated covers on newer water heaters are worthless as far as insulation goes .
More often than not they pose greater fire hazards because of the proximity to the draft diverter or the combustion chamber at the base .
Energy Use
Here is a chart describing the energy use over the life of the hot water heater .
You should choose the heater that best suits your specific needs and fuel options .
If you decide to lower the water temperature , every 10 degree reduction will save about 3 - 5 % in energy costs .
From American Council for an Energy - Efficient Economy Posted : November 26 , 2007
Leaks
By installing an Automatic Shutoff Valve , you can not only reduce the chance of water damage and fire in your home , but you may be able to reduce your insurance premium and increase your peace of mind .
Several manufacturers have developed devices to prevent or lessen the leaks created by a tank failure .
One of these is a Water and Gas Safety ( WAGS ) Valve by Taco , Inc. , which will shut of the water and the gas to the hot water heater when it senses a leak .
The cold water lines will need to be piped to the bottom of the heater and also have a drain pan installed to hold the water .
When the water reaches a height of ¾ inch , a fiber element dissolves and releases a spring loaded valve which shuts off the water .
In gas - fired water heaters , this action also breaks a fuse that shuts off the gas supply to the heater .
It requires no outside power source .
WAGS Valve
Watts has developed WDS FloodSafe® Water Detector Shutoff that protects the homeowner from catastrophic damage due to the water heater leaking .
The FloodSafe® will detect the presence of water on the floor beneath the water heater and will automatically shutoff the water supply and power source to the water heater .
There are models for gas , electric , and oil heaters , and also has an optional battery backup unit available .

Most of the work described in this article can be performed by the homeowners , but when adding components to the heater , or replacing gas or electric elements , it is best to hire a professional .

For Immediate Release , October 19 , 2009 Contact : Randy Serraglio , Center for Biological Diversity , ( 520 ) 396-1143 Study Shows Water Shortages in Southeast United States
Are Due to Overpopulation , Likely to Be Repeated TUCSON , Ariz . —
A new study by Columbia University climate experts has determined that the drought that caused water shortages in the southeastern United States in 2007 and 2008 was not unprecedented in severity , but in fact a “ typical event . ”
The researchers concluded that the resulting water shortages were actually due to explosive population growth in the region .
Between 1990 and 2007 , the state of Georgia ’s population leaped from 6.5 million to more than 9.5 million , an increase of nearly 50 percent over just 17 years .
“ Despite attempts to blame this water crisis on Mother Nature , intrusive regulations , or endangered species , this study clearly identifies the true culprit , ” said Randy Serraglio , conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity .
“ The culprit is us — a rapidly growing human population with unsustainable consumption habits . ”
When Lake Lanier reservoir , the foundation of Atlanta ’s water supply , shrank to historic lows in the midst of the drought , Georgia Governor Sonny Purdue led the charge to avoid the uncomfortable reality of unsustainable population growth .
Calling the drought “ manmade , ” he sought to halt or severely restrict water releases from Lake Lanier reservoir , directly threatening numerous aquatic species downstream , including endangered mussels and sturgeon .
The crisis triggered litigation and inflamed decades - old tensions into a full - blown water war involving the states of Georgia , Florida , and Alabama .
“ The Columbia research shows that while the drought was a natural event , the water shortages were indeed caused by humans , ” said Serraglio .
“ This is what happens when you have a dramatically increasing population relying on the same limited supply of water .
Unfortunately , it is usually other species that pay the price for our inability to responsibly manage growth and consumption . ”
In July 2009 , a federal judge ruled that Atlanta , where water demand is projected to double over the next 30 years , must find another source of water , and made the following observation : “ Too often , state , local , and even national government actors do not consider the long - term consequences of their decisions .
Local governments allow unchecked growth because it increases tax revenue , but these same governments do not sufficiently plan for the resources such unchecked growth will require .
Nor do individual citizens consider frequently enough their consumption of our scarce resources , absent a crisis situation …. ”
“ No one should be lulled into complacency by recent heavy rains in the region , ” said Serraglio .
“ When the natural cycle of drought returns — as it certainly will — water shortages will return with it , unless bold steps are taken to reduce consumption and control population growth . ”

What makes more sense , burning virgin vegetable oil in car engines , or burning it in power stations ?
The answer is neither .
In both cases you are snatching food from people 's mouths .
But Andrew Mercer , chief executive of Blue - NG , the company which owns the UK 's first power station running on vegetable oil , appears to believe that he is doing the world a favour .
In arguing the case for his grotesque trade , Mercer begins by maligning the Green party .
He contends that " The Green party toured the country this summer during the European elections campaign in a bus fuelled by UK - sourced rapeseed biodiesel " .
Because this is a less efficient use of virgin rapeseed oil than burning it in power stations , he is greener than the Greens ( or so he says ) .
That someone else has allegedly done something even more damaging is hardly a persuasive justification .
But is it true ?
I spoke to the Green party this morning , and discovered that Mercer had left out a crucial piece of information .
The biodiesel used in its bus was made from waste cooking oil , not virgin oil .
As I 've been arguing since I first started attacking the practice of feeding cars rather than people , used cooking oil is currently the only sustainable feedstock for biofuel : once it is unfit for human consumption it can only be dumped or burned .
It makes sense to burn it in place of fossil fuels .
The Green party has now published a response in the comment thread and is requesting a correction .
Burning virgin vegetable oil is an entirely different matter .
In doing so , you are directly commissioning farmers to do one of two things : divert cropland which would otherwise have been used to grow food , or break land which would otherwise have been left fallow .
In either case you are harming people or the environment .
Mercer says : " There are millions of hectares of land lying idle across the EU " .
Another way of putting it is that there are millions of hectares currently supporting wildlife and storing carbon .
If farmers bring them back into production to fuel power stations like his , there would be dire consequences for wildflowers , butterflies , songbirds and other wildlife .
Were it a choice between preserving this wildlife and feeding the hungry , I could understand the need for a pay - off .
But the only reason that it 's commercially viable to burn virgin vegetable oil in power stations in this country is that the government is perversely offering a massive subsidy .
It gives generators two renewable obligation certificates for every megawatt hour of electricity they produce , which is twice as much as you get for onshore wind .
I refuse to accept that the EU 's wildlife must be sacrificed for what looks like a grant - harvesting operation .
As two papers published last year in Science show ( here and here ) , the carbon released by ploughing idle farmland to grow biofuels takes many years to repay .
If we 're to have a high chance of preventing climate breakdown , the major cuts must be made today , so this policy makes no sense at all .
When you consider the other greenhouse gases produced by growing crops it looks even dafter .
The Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen has estimated that emissions of nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas arising from the use of nitrogen fertilisers – wipe out all the carbon savings biofuels produce ( pdf ) , even before you take the changes in land use into account .
It 's significant that Andrew Mercer talks only about CO2 .
Even then he does n't say how he has produced his figures – I strongly suspect that he does n't take land use change into account .
Were he obliged to consider all greenhouse gases from all sources , I suspect he would discover that burning virgin vegetable oil is far more polluting than burning fossil fuel .
Mercer then contends that oilseed rape is roughly the same price as it was 10 years ago .
This is n't true either , as you can see from the IMF figures reproduced here .
In October 1999 , oilseed rape cost $ 398 / tonne .
Last month the average price was $ 857 .
Prices this year have consistently been about twice those of prices ten years ago .
The idea that oilseed rape is just a " break crop " is risible .
It is a major international commodity , grown because it makes money .
The notion that you can draw any conclusions about commodity trends from a single year 's production in one small country is equally daft .
It 's as stupid as saying , for example , that a cold snap in the United Kingdom shows that global warming is n't happening .
And no one would be dumb enough to do that , would they ?
The reality is that whenever there 's a global shortfall in rape production , as there was last year , palm oil helps to fill the gap .
Compare this graph of palm oil prices to this one of rape oil prices and you 'll see that the price trends are almost identical .
So while Mercer boasts that he is not burning palm oil in his power station , whenever his trade helps to cause a shortfall in rapeseed stocks , the result is likely to be an increase in the sales of palm oil .
Growing rapeseed to burn is crazy , growing oil palm to fill the gaps is madness on a different scale altogether , in view of the massive impacts on climate , indigenous people and wildlife when the forests of Indonesia and Malaysia are cleared to plant it .
Like Biofuelwatch and other green groups , I will keep putting pressure on the government to drop its perverse subsidies .
I 'm offering Andrew Mercer a £ 10 bet that if we succeed , Blue - NG will stop burning virgin vegetable oils .
This is what happened in the Netherlands : as soon as the Dutch government stopped paying companies to make electricity from food , the business ground to a halt .
Let 's bring this obscene , subsidised trade to an end here too .

A portrait of the president greets you at reception , the managers espouse socialism , the guests wear red T - shirts and the decor promotes Latin American solidarity : welcome to Hotel Chávez .
What used to be the Caracas Hilton today soars over Venezuela 's capital as a bold symbol of Hugo Chávez 's leftist revolution , a 36 - storey , state - run declaration of intent .
The government took it over from the US hotel chain two years ago as part of a sweep towards greater state economic control .
Renamed Alba – " dawn " in Spanish and also the acronym of Chávez 's regional grouping , the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas – the hotel hosts summits which condemn US imperialism and chart a brighter , leftist future .
" We are the first socialist hotel but hopefully not the last , " said Katiuska Camaripano , its general manager .
Last week it acquired a sister : the government seized the Hilton on Margarita island , Venezuela 's tourist playground .
It had angered Chávez during a meeting of African leaders he hosted at the hotel .
" The owners tried to impose conditions on the revolutionary government .
No way .
So I said , ' Let 's expropriate it . '
And now it 's been expropriated . "
A presidential decree transferred its assets , including 280 rooms , 210 suites , shops , restaurants and a casino to the tourism ministry .
A Hilton spokeswoman said the chain was " evaluating " the government 's action .
The state 's Margarita acquisition may also be renamed Alba , consolidating the brand name .
Venezuela has also partly funded a small Alba hotel in Managua , capital of its leftist ally Nicaragua , said Camaripano .
" It would be wonderful if we became part of a socialist chain . "
Two years after it became a political as well as geographic landmark , the Caracas Alba draws mixed reviews .
Managers say it blends socialist values with business savvy and top - notch service .
Critics say it is a dump in which nothing works .
There are some striking changes .
Gone are the American and European managers and well - heeled foreign guests who used to snap up jewellery and cosmetics in the shops .
Red - clad government officials and Cuban delegations have largely taken their place .
" Business is dead .
All we 'll sell is chewing gum and antibiotics , " lamented one store owner .
The Italian restaurant now serves more Caribbean fare such as chicken in coconut sauce and cachapa , a corn - based pancake .
The gift shop offers a range of ceramic Chávez mugs and sculptures ranging from $ 20 to $ 240 .
The bookshop which sold glossy magazines and Dan Brown novels has been replaced by a culture ministry outlet offering political tracts such as Transition Towards Socialism and Venezuela : a Revolution Sui Generis .
The titles are all subsidised , with some costing the equivalent of just 50 p .
" The problem is people buy the books and sell them on for profit , " said Nicola Castilla , the bookshop clerk .
" It 's not easy instilling a socialist conscience . "
Top floors offer superb views of downtown Caracas , the Ávila mountain and hillside slums , but the hotel 's surrounding district , a hub of theatres and museums , has become dilapidated and crime - ridden .
Many middle - class Venezuelans who used to visit now go only when participating in opposition marches .
As they pass the Alba they chant " out " , apparently directed at the Cubans .
Managers say the 400 staff – who were retained from the Hilton era – reflect socialist values by doing voluntary work such as rubbish collection on their days off .
The hotel says it does its bit by giving staff generous benefits not stipulated in their contracts , such as paying for babysitters , and by hosting poor children and hospital patients .
A basic room costs $ 286 a night but discounts are offered to the needy , said Rayneth Oleaga , a spokesman for the government agency that administers the hotel .
" It is for the people .
It is accessible to all . "
The hotel has 900 rooms , but under Hilton management only 545 were in service , a number the Alba has increased to 782 .
Last year 's 90 % occupancy rate owed much to government delegations , said Camaripano .
Occupancy this year has fallen to 65 % but the hotel still makes a profit .
" We are getting a lot of ordinary tourists as well as official delegations . "
Travel agents dispute that .
Venezuela 's capital has a shortage of hotel rooms but foreign tourists often refuse to stay in the Alba , citing bad service , credit card rip - offs , musty smells , tatty furniture and overpriced food .
Online reviews have dwindled but the few that are posted tend to be scathing .
" I would never under any circumstances go back there , even if it were free , " said one former guest on tripadviser.com .
" It reminded me of hotels behind the iron curtain in the 60s , very depressing .
I was glad to leave . "

The original referred to a grouping by its previous name , the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas .
This has been corrected .
State of play
Venezuela 's government has accelerated its rate of nationalisations and expropriations but tends to pay fair compensation to business owners .
Takeovers include :
• A majority stake in four oil projects operating in the Orinoco river basin worth an estimated $ 30bn .
• A gas injection project belonging to Williams Companies and a range of assets from local energy - related service companies .
• A eucalyptus tree farm owned by Ireland 's Smurfit Kappa .
• An Argentine - owned steel mill and Mexican cement company .
• Assets of the US - based AES Corp which was Venezuela 's largest private power producer .
• Hundreds of large farms , including the UK - owned Vestey cattle ranch .
Photo lists are my favorite to read and write about , so I ’m always trying to think of new subject matter for a photo list that would complement the others on the site .
Recently my brother discovered some old pictures of our grandfather .
We never knew they existed , and it gave me the idea for this list .
This list looks at some rare and hopefully interesting photographs that were uncovered in recent years along with descriptions of the photos and how they were discovered .
10 Scopes Trial
Taken : 1925
Discovered : 2005
In 2005 the Smithsonian Institution announced that it had some never - before published pictures of the Scopes Monkey Trial which was dubbed “ The Trial of the Century , ” The negatives were discovered after looking through archival material donated to the Smithsonian back in 1971 .
The photo shows William Jennings Bryan ( seated at left ) fielding questions from Clarence Darrow .
The heat that summer in east Tennessee was the worst in memory , so the judge moved the trial outside the County courthouse to a cooler venue and to accommodate the enormous crowds .
The proceedings were held on a platform that had been erected in front of the Rhea County Courthouse for the benefit of ministers who wanted to preach during the time of the trial .
Interesting Fact :
One explanation of why this picture was never published at the time is that the trial ended the next day , and Scopes was found guilty .
When Bryan died five days later , the image ’s immediate news value diminished .
9 Florence Nightingale
Taken : 1858
Discovered : 2006
Florence Nightingale is one of nursing ’s most important figures .
She gained worldwide attention for her work as a nurse during the Crimean War .
She was dubbed “ The Lady with the Lamp ” after her habit of making rounds at night to tend to injured soldiers .
Early photographs of Florence Nightingale are very rare because she was extremely reluctant to be photographed , partly for religious reasons and also because she regarded any personal publicity as detrimental to the causes of public health .
The photo was discovered in an album of mid 19th century photographs and shows Florence sitting reading outside her family home in Embley Park , Hampshire two years after her return from the war .
Interesting Fact : Another photo of Florence Nightingale surfaced just last year .
The photo was taken in 1910 ( 52 years after the one above )
It ’s the last photograph taken of her and shows 90 year old Florence in her bedroom at her home in South Street , London near Hyde Park .
The photo was taken by Lizzie Caswall Smith , a noted studio photographer in the early 1900s who specialized in celebrity and society studio portraits .
On the back of the photo Caswall Smith wrote , “ Taken just before she died , house near Park Lane .
The only photograph I ever took out of studio .
I shall never forget the experience . ”
You can see the photo here .
8 Jonathan
Taken around : 1900
Discovered : 2008
I realize that a recently discovered photo of a tortoise named Jonathan is not very exciting .
However , when the photo shown above was found , it backed up the claim that Jonathan is the oldest living animal on earth .
Jonathan was brought to the small island of St Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean in 1882 along with three other tortoises when they were 50 years old .
The photograph above was taken around 1900 and was recently discovered as part of a collection of Boer War images .
It shows Jonathan , eating some grass with a Boer War prisoner and guard next to him .
Jonathan was about 70 years old when this picture was taken which makes Jonathan approximately 177 years old .
I know many will ask ( like me ) how they know for sure that Jonathan was already 50 years old when he came to the island .
Others may ask how they are sure that the photo of the tortoise is really Jonathan .
The truth is , I ’m not sure .
I found this information from several different sources so I decided to give good ol ’
Jonathan the benefit of the doubt .
Interesting Fact : Locals say that despite Jonathan ’s age , he still has the energy to regularly mate with the three younger females .
Jonathan is owned by the St Helena government and lives in a specially built plantation on the governor ’s land and is treated like a celebrity due to his legendary status .
You can see a recent picture of Jonathan here .
7 Lincoln ’s Second Inauguration
Taken : 1865
Discovered : 2008
The Library of Congress recently discovered three new glass negatives of President Abraham Lincoln ’s second inauguration .
The photo above was originally mislabeled as President Grant ’s inauguration ceremony .
A curator discovered the photographs while reviewing a log book noticed the caption “ Lincoln ” in the margins .
After careful comparison between the only known photos of the inauguration ( just two existed ) it was concluded that this photo is actually a crowd scene at Lincoln ’s second inauguration .
The glass stereograph above shows crowds of people attending the special event including African - American troops marching in an inauguration for the first time .
Interesting Fact : American
History buffs get very excited when a new Lincoln photo surfaces .
There are two recently discovered photographs of Lincoln but they have not been officially verified .
This Photo was discovered this year in a personal album of President Ulysses S. Grant and apparently shows Lincoln in front of the White House .
Another photograph discovered a couple of years ago might be a photo of Lincoln at Gettysburg possibly arriving at the stage on horseback .
You can see every picture ever taken of Lincoln including the two questionable ones mentioned above here .
6 Neil Armstrong ’s Face
Taken : 1969
Discovered : 2009
This image was just recently published and is from a film camera that was mounted on the Apollo 11 lunar lander .
I know technically this might not be considered a photograph but it ’s very rare to see an astronaut ’s face on the moon except in sci - fi movies so I wanted to include it in the list .
The image was discovered while viewing NASA films .
As Armstrong raised his gold reflexive visor ( which normally obscures the astronaut ’s face ) , his face appears just for a split second on the film .
The footage was transferred into high definition format and then a single frame was made into the image above .
Interesting Fact : Because Armstrong was the guy with the camera most of the iconic pictures are of Aldrin and very few of Armstrong .
This year on the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing Armstrong was presented this picture .
Despite his modesty Armstrong was impressed to receive the print of himself as a souvenir .
5 New York City
Taken : 1848
Discovered : 2008
After a tremendous amount of research it was established that this daguerreotype photo is one of the earliest photographs of New York City .
It was discovered at a small New England auction but the significance of the photograph was not known .
The photo was taken around 1848 and shows a hilltop house with a lawn surrounded by a picket fence .
It also shows a blurred horse - drawn carriage in the foreground .
The area is now Manhattan ’s Upper West Side .
The photo was sold at auction this year and this time it fetched $ 62,500 .
Interesting Fact :
One of the main factors in determining the legitimacy of this photo is a note that was found in the plate ’s original leather case which describes a road near the house .
The note reads as follows : “ This view was taken at too great a distance , & from ground 60 or 70 feet lower than the building ; rendering the lower Story of the House , & the front Portico entirely invisible .
( the handsomest part of the House . )
The main road , passes between the two Post & rail fences .
( called , a continuation of Broadway 60 feet wide . )
It requires a maganifying [ sic ] glass , to clearly distinguish the Evergreens , within the circular enclosure , taken the last of October , when nearly half of the leaves were off the trees .
May 1849 . L. B . ”
4 King Edward VII
Taken : 1909
Discovered : 2009
This recent find could be the only color photograph of King Edward VII .
The photograph shows the King in Highland costume enjoying the autumn grouse season in Scotland .
The picture is an early color photography process called autochrome , patented in France in 1903 .
It remained the principal color photo process until the advent of color film during the mid 1930s .
The photo was taken by banker Lionel de Rothschild in 1909 .
The autochromes were forgotten in a cupboard in Exbury House until they were discovered by de Rothschild ’s grandson wrapped in old newspapers .
Edward died eight months after the photo was taken .
Interesting Fact :
The picture was found alongside 700 other images from the early 1900s , including this one which is probably the first color photograph of London Zoo , taken in 1910 .
3 Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan
Taken : 1888
Discovered : 2008
This is the most publicized photograph on the list so many will be familiar with it .
The photo was discovered while combing through a large family photo collection that was donated by a New England Historic Genealogical Society member .
The man that donated the photograph is not sure which family member actually took the photo .
He said , “ I never thought much about it , ” and added , “ It just seemed like something no one would find very interesting . ”
The photo was taken in Brewster , Cape Cod , Massachusetts and shows eight - year - old Helen Keller hand in hand with her teacher Anne Sullivan .
Both Keller and Sullivan indicated later in their journals that “ doll ” was the first word Helen Keller learned in sign language in March 1887 .
This photograph was taken about sixteen months later and is believed to be the only known photograph of Helen Keller holding one of her dolls .
Interesting Fact :
You can watch a very interesting video here filmed 42 years after this photo was taken .
It shows Anne Sullivan and Helen Keller demonstrating how Helen learned to talk and understand speech .
2 Peter Schiff
Taken : 1939
Discovered : 2008
In Anne Frank ’s Diary Anne called Peter Schiff her “ one true love . ”
In 1940 at the age of 11 she writes ‘ Peter was the ideal boy : tall , slim and good - looking , with a serious , quiet and intelligent face .
He had dark hair , beautiful brown eyes , ruddy cheeks and a nicely pointed nose .
I was crazy about his smile , which made him look so boyish and mischievous . ’
For more than 60 years there were no photographs known of Anne Frank ’s childhood sweetheart .
The photo above was discovered when a childhood friend , Ernest Michaelis , now 82 , came to realize that the childhood friend that gave him this photograph ( before Michaelis had left Germany for Britain ) was the 13 - year - old boy Anne Frank wrote about in her diary .
Interesting Fact : Peter Schiff does not reappear in the diary until January 6 , 1944 , after Anne had been in hiding for more than one and a half years .
After she has a dream about Peter she writes ‘ At that point I woke up , still feeling his cheek against mine and his brown eyes staring deep into my heart , so deep that he could read how much I ’d loved him and how much I still do , and now Peter , my dearest Peter .
I ’ve never had such a clear mental image of him .
I do n’t need a photograph , I can see him oh so well . ’
The photo of Peter Schiff along with a note that reads ‘ A friendly memento of your friend Lutz Peter Schiff ’ was donated to the Anne Frank museum by Ernst Michaelis .
Like Anne Frank ’s family , Peter ’s family fled Germany for the Netherlands and died in Auschwitz or Bergen - Belsen .
1 Phineas Gage
Taken : Around 1850
Discovered : 2009
Phineas Gage was a railroad construction worker from New Hampshire and is known for his incredible survival after an explosives accident in 1848 .
The explosion propelled an iron rod ( shown being held above ) traveling at high speed to enter the side of Gage ’s face , pass behind his left eye , and then exit at the top of his skull .
The iron rod was recovered some 30 yards away , smeared with blood and brain .
Gage recovered from the accident and retained full possession of his reason , but his wife and other people close to him soon began to notice dramatic changes in his personality .
This is possibly the first recorded case suggesting that damage to specific regions of the brain might affect personality and behavior .
The photo above was discovered in July 2009 and is the only known picture of Gage that exists .
It was first thought to be a picture of a whaler with a harpoon and was posted on flickr under daguerreotype photographs .
After seeing the picture , members of whaling groups commented that what the man was holding was not a harpoon .
Another commenter then suggested that it could be a picture of Phineas Gage .
When the photograph was compared to his life mask it was confirmed to be Gage around the age of 25 .
Gage died 11 years after the accident from a series of increasingly violent convulsions .
Interesting Fact : Phineas
Gage ’s brain was not subjected to any medical examination at that time , but seven years later his body was exhumed so his skull could be studied .
Today Gage ’s skull is on permanent display at Harvard ’s Countway Library of Medicine .
You can see a picture of Phineas Gage ’s skull and life mask here .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Facing a recent erosion of public support for health - care overhaul , President Obama lashed out at his opponents Saturday for spreading " outrageous myths " on the Internet , television , and at town hall forums .
President Obama talks about health care reform Thursday in Washington .
Republican leaders , in turn , said it was Obama who is guilty of playing " fast and loose with the facts . "
They repeated their assertion that the president 's proposed government - funded public health insurance option would destroy the current private insurance - based system .
" I 'm glad that so many are engaged , " Obama said in his weekly radio address .
But it should " be an honest debate , not one dominated by willful misrepresentations and outright distortions , spread by the very folks who would benefit the most by keeping things exactly as they are . "
Obama emphasized that , contrary to the assertions of many , illegal immigrants will not get health insurance under a reform plan .
" That idea has never even been on the table , " he said .
He said the charge that funding for abortions would be mandated is false , as is the notion that federal " death panels " would be established to discourage care for the sick and elderly .
Watch as the president debunks what he calls the myths about health care »
The health - care bill advanced in the House of Representatives would include coverage of end - of - life counseling for Medicare beneficiaries who want it .
The provision was recently dropped , however , by Senate negotiators .
Obama asserted that his plan would not lead to " a government takeover of health care , " and said the proposed public option is just " one idea among many to provide more competition and choice . "
" If you like your doctor , you can keep your doctor , " he said .
" If you like your private health insurance plan , you can keep your plan .
Period . "
Republican Rep. Tom Price of Georgia had a different take .
Watch Rep .
Price outline his opinions »
" The plan being promoted by the White House would give Washington the power to make highly personal medical decisions on behalf of patients -- on behalf of you , " Price , a former physician , said in the weekly GOP address .
Obama " has also said that he thinks the government should compete with your current health care plan .
" But we all know that when the government is setting the rules and is backed by tax dollars , it will destroy -- not compete -- with the private sector .
The reality is , whether or not you get to keep your plan , or your doctor , is very much in question under the president 's proposal , " Price said .
Price also argued that under Obama 's plan " every health care plan will have to meet a new federal definition for coverage -- one that your current plan might not match , even if you like it . "
Price urged a " bipartisan solution that puts patients in charge " and rejects " a government - centered approach . "
The latest charges and countercharges came after another week of highly publicized arguments among congressional Democrats over the political viability of a public health option .
One of the top Senate negotiators , Sen. Kent Conrad , a North Dakota Democrat , has insisted that a public option cannot get the 60 votes required to overcome a Senate filibuster .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asserted Thursday that a bill cannot pass the House of Representatives if it does not include a public option .
The No. 2 Democrat in the House , however , seemed less definitive .
Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland , told reporters Friday on a conference call , " As I 've said in the past , I 'm for a public option but I 'm also for passing a bill .
...
But , you know , we 'll have to see because there are many other aspects of the bill as well . "
After Hoyer 's conference call , an aide told CNN that the majority leader is in full agreement with the speaker over the need for a public option , and that it will be hard to pass the House without one .
What he was acknowledging , the aide said , was the reality that a public option will be hard to pass in the Senate and therefore in Congress as a whole .
The public option has been cleared by three committees in the House as well as by the Senate Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee .
But a bipartisan group of six negotiators on the Senate Finance Committee -- the last committee that needs to clear health - care legislation before it can be taken up on the Senate floor -- is considering dropping a public option in favor of nonprofit cooperatives that would negotiate collective polices for members .
Some top Democrats have responded in recent days by hinting that they may instead try to short - circuit the traditional Senate legislative process by passing a health - care bill through an obscure tactic known as reconciliation , a type of budget maneuver that requires only a simple majority -- 51 votes -- to pass .
Such a maneuver would boost the prospects for Senate passage of a public health option .
But Republicans have equated such a move to legislative warfare .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs reiterated Friday that the president remains committed to crafting a bipartisan bill .
House Democrats are looking at re-branding the public health insurance option as Medicare , an established government healthcare program that is better known than the public option .

The strategy could benefit Democrats struggling to bridge the gap between liberals in their party , who want the public option , and centrists , who are worried it would drive private insurers out of business .
While much of the public is foggy on what a public option actually is , people understand Medicare .
It also would place the new public option within the rubric of a familiar system rather than something new and unknown .
The idea has bubbled up among House Democrats and leaders in the past week , most prominently in a caucus meeting last Thursday .
Rep. Mike Ross ( D - Ark. ) spoke out last week in favor of re-branding the public option as Medicare , startling many because he has loudly proclaimed his opposition to a public option .
Rep. Jim Oberstar ( D - Minn. ) , the veteran chairman of the House Transportation Committee , also voiced his support , as did House Majority Whip James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) .
John Schadl , a spokesman for Oberstar , explained the congressman likes the idea because people are familiar with Medicare .
“ One of his concerns is that people do n’t know what a public option is .
Medicare is a public option , ” Schadl said .
He said Oberstar started talking about “ Medicare for Everyone ” during August town hall meetings .
A notable incident last summer demonstrated the popularity of Medicare and the confusion over the public option when a man famously told Rep. Bob Inglis ( R - S.C. ) , “ Keep your government hands off my Medicare . ”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) planned to unveil a proposal to her caucus Tuesday night that would include the public option favored by liberals in the healthcare bill Democrats want to bring to the floor , according to two House sources .
The plan , called the “ robust ” option or “ Medicare Plus 5 ” in the jargon that has emerged on Capitol Hill , ties provider reimbursement rates to Medicare , adding 5 percent .
Leaders are planning to roll the bill out next week , and are hoping to vote the first week in November
Some Democrats say there ’s no need to rename a legislative concept that ’s gained steadily in support since being lambasted as a “ government takeover ” in August .
A Washington Post - ABC poll published Tuesday showed 57 percent of the public supports the idea — up five points since August — while 40 percent opposes it .
“ It keeps polling better and better as a public health insurance option , ” said a senior Democratic aide .
“ I do n’t think it ’s changing . ”
Polling experts , however , have documented that many people do n’t know what a public option is , and that small changes in language can cause poll results to vary widely .
An August poll by Penn , Schoen and Berland Associates showed that only 37 percent of those polled correctly identified the public option from a list of three choices .
“ Before this year , few people had ever heard of the term ‘ public option , ’ ” Ross said last week .
It ’s not clear exactly how the new Medicare idea would work .
Some want to expand Medicare itself to uninsured people under 65 .
Others want to simply rename what is now called the public health insurance option .
Oberstar , who supports a “ single - payer ” system that would be completely run by the government , does n’t want a Medicare public option to be based on existing Medicare rates because he believe Minnesota is one of the states shortchanged by Medicare reimbursements .
Republicans mocked the idea of re-branding a plan they still consider a government takeover of healthcare .

Five things we learned from this year 's primaries Bad blood between Pelosi , Meadows complicates coronavirus talks MORE ( R - Ohio ) .
“ No matter how the Democrats ‘ re - brand ’ their government takeover of healthcare , the American people oppose it . ”
Republicans also note that Medicare is already $ 37 trillion in the hole and is projected to go bankrupt by 2018 .
“ Has anyone noticed that Medicare is completely broke ? ” said Andrew Biggs , a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who worked in the White House on President George W. Bush ’s plan to overhaul Social Security .
The public health insurance option would be a government - run plan designed to push all insurance premiums down by creating more competition in a business where one or two insurers dominate many markets .
The idea has gotten a cool reception from some Senate Democrats , and Republicans are adamantly opposed .
But Pelosi has flatly stated that the House bill will include a public option .
In a closed - door caucus meeting last week , Ross , one of the most conservative Democrats in the House , offered support for expanding Medicare , saying it would prevent the need to create a new bureaucracy .
He said he was n’t advocating a plan , however , and added that the new coverage would have to have much higher reimbursements for physicians and hospitals .
He also said it would need to compete with private insurers .
In an odd reversal , that idea was shot down as too liberal by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , himself a liberal champion .
Waxman said expanding Medicare would essentially move toward a fully government - run single - payer system , while the public option was designed to spur competition .
People have been talking about some sort of Medicare Part E since Congress debated the prescription drug benefit , Medicare Part D , in 2003 .
In the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) called his single - payer coverage proposal “ Medicare Part E . ”
The idea of expanding Medicare while still keeping private insurance was proposed in 2007 by Johns Hopkins University Professors Gerard Anderson and Hugh Waters .
They presented a paper at a forum of the Brookings Institution advocating “ Medicare Part E( veryone ) , ” and said their proposal would expand Medicare to ensure universal coverage while allowing people to stay on their employers ’ health plans .
Cheeseburger Pumpkin Art Looks Good Enough To Eat
Everyone knows how Halloween is filled with Candy , Costumes and some of the most artistic Pumpkin Carvings ever , but this Cheeseburger Pumpkin is just ridiculous .
This huge Pumpkin Hamburger seems like Halloween ’s best answer for carnivores , as they receive both one of the biggest hamburgers they have ever seen and it is also an amazing and creative Pumpkin art .
It is true that it is not necessarily a Pumpkin carving , but it can not be denied .
I mean …adding the Pumpkin seeds on top to resemble sesame seeds makes it art , and the creativity makes it highly appealing .
Thanks Rob for the Image !
Happy Halloween .

In my previous post , I began describing the primitive species and species operations supported by my combinatorial species library ; we looked at the ring structure on species , that is , the primitive species and , and the operations of species sum and product .
Today we ’ll continue by looking at a few more primitive species : singletons , sets , and cycles .
[ By the way , all the diagrams for this post and the previous one were generated programmatically using my diagrams library .
I ’ll probably put the code up as an example on the diagrams website sometime in the near future . ]
X
The species , also known as the species of singletons , is picky in a way similar to the species .
Whereas only puts a structure on the empty set of labels , X only puts a ( single ) structure on singleton label sets .
If you give it more than one label , or none , it turns up its nose and refuses to do anything .
> take 10 $ labelled singleton
[ 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 ]
> generate singleton ( [ 'a ' ] :: [ Char ] )
[ 'a ' ]
> generate singleton ( " abc " :: [ Char ] )
[ ]
A few exercises : try to work them out yourself , then use the species library to check if you are correct !
Describe the species .
Show that it is isomorphic to the species .
Describe the species .
E
The species of sets , on the other hand , is n’t picky at all : it will happily put a singleton structure on any label set .
Usually we identify this structure with the label set itself ; that is , the only - structure on a label set is itself .
> take 10 $ labelled sets
[ 1,1, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 ]
> take 10 $ unlabelled sets
[ 1,1, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 ]
> generate set ( [ 1..3 ] :: [ Int ] )
[ { 1,2,3} ]
> generate set ( [ ] :: [ Int ] )
[ {} ]
We can now also describe the derived species of elements , also known as the species of pointed sets .
The only way to get any structures is by partitioning the label set into a singleton and all the rest , in which case we get exactly one structure ; so there is one structure for each element of .
> take 10 $ labelled ( x * set )
[ 0,1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ]
> take 10 $ unlabelled ( x * set )
[ 0,1, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 ]
> generate ( x * set ) ( [ 1..3 ] :: [ Int ] )
[ ( 1, {2,3} ) , ( 2, {1,3} ) , ( 3, {1,2} ) ]
( x is just a synonym for singleton . )
Noteworthy is the fact that this is the first species we ’ve looked at which has different numbers of labelled and unlabelled structures !
This makes sense : there are labelled - structures on a size set ; but if we ca n’t tell the difference between the labels , any one of them is just as good as any other , so we only get one unlabelled structure ( unless the label set is empty , when we do n’t get any structures : the still requires us to have at least one element ! ) .
Note also that element is a special synonym for x * set with a special semantics under generate : if we really want to pick elements of the label set , then we probably do n’t want to actually see each element paired with a set of the leftover elements , we just want to see the element itself :
> generate elements ( [ 1..3 ] : :[ Int ] )
[ 1,2,3 ]
C
The final primitive species — and the only one so far that does n’t feel quite so utterly trivial — is the species of cycles .
puts no structures on an empty label set , but given any non-empty label set , generates the set of all cyclical orderings of the labels .
Of course , the above diagram only shows six of the cycle structures on five labels ; the ellipsis is meant to suggest the others not shown .
So … how many labelled cycle structures are there on five labels , or generally on labels ?
( Of course there is only one unlabelled - cycle . )
I ’ll leave it as a ( hopefully easy ) exercise ; and of course you know how to check your answer !
> generate cycles ( [ 1..4 ] :: [ Int ] )
[ < 1,2,3,4 > , <1,2,4,3> , <1,3,2,4>, <1,3,4,2>,<1,4,2,3>,<1,4,3,2 >]
As you can see , cycles are indicated with angle brackets ; it is understood that < 1,2,3,4 > , < 2,3,4,1 > , < 3,4,1,2 > , and < 4,1,2,3 > are all equivalent .
At this point , you ’re probably thinking about a certain species and wondering why I have n’t mentioned it yet — it seems pretty fundamental and primitive .
Are you thinking of … the species of lists ?
It turns out that we do n’t have to take lists as primitive — we can define the species of lists as the derivative of the species of cycles !
The derivative of a regular type is its type of one - hole … but I ’m getting ahead of myself .
We ’ll look at species differentiation ( along with several other operations on species ) in the next post !

BLUESTONEHENGE : TECHNICAL DETAILS
The circle is just under 10 m in diameter and was surrounded by a henge  a ditch with an external bank  with an entrance to the east .
The henge ditch is 25 m in diameter and sits at the end of the 1¾ - mile avenue that leads from Stonehenge to the river .
Excavations in 2008 established that this outer henge was built around 2400 BC but arrowheads from the stone circle indicate that it is likely to be much earlier , dating to around 3000 BC .
Nine stone holes were identified , part of a circle of probably twenty - five standing stones .
Only the northeast quadrant of the circle , and a small past of its west side , were excavated .
Six stoneholes ( A - F ) were found in the northeast quadrant and three ( I - K ) were found in the western trench .
( Stoneholes G and H are putative stone sockets lying between the excavated ones ; their positions are extrapolated from the known stones ) .
The centres of Stoneholes A- F are spaced at an average distance of 1.12 m from each other .
However , Stoneholes J and K are more widely spaced .
Given the arrangement and curvature of the known stones , the maximum number of stones in the circle was 25 .
It may , of course , have contained fewer .
The dimensions of the holes are too wide and too shallow for them to have held wooden posts .
The imprints of the stones bases and the shapes of the sockets from which they were withdrawn indicate that these were too small to have been sarsens .
They compare exactly with the dimensions of the bluestones in the inner oval at Stonehenge .
The stones were extracted whole and were not broken up ( as was the practice in the Medieval period ) .
As a result , only two bluestone fragments were found , both of spotted dolerite .
The bluestone circle was succeeded by a henge , comprising a circular ditch 23.4 m wide with an external bank .
Little trace of the henge bank remains except where it was pushed back into the ditch on its north side .
A date from the tip of a broken antler pick in its basal fill places its construction within the period 2470 - 2280 BC .
The henge had at least one entrance  this was on its east side where the northern ditch terminal contained a special deposit of antlers , an antler pick , cattle bones and stone and flint tools as well as a burnt organic container .
We found the riverside end of the Stonehenge Avenue ( previously only traced to a spot 150 m to the north ) .
It consisted of two parallel ditches , 18.1 m apart .
These formerly held upright posts , forming a small palisade on either side .
The Avenue was traced to within a few metres of the henge ditch and presumably terminated at or close to the outer bank of the henge .
It and the henge may have been built at the same time given their proximity and symmetrical positioning .
The western arm of the henges ditch silted up gradually during the Bronze Age , with silts interspersed with flint cobble surfaces in the ditch bottom .
After the ditch had fully silted up , its northeastern quadrant was re-cut .
The henges interior was also re-used in the Late Bronze Age with the digging of a small penannular ditch which terminated at its northeast in a large timber post .
This and two other posts formed a façade or structure within the centre of the henge .
A fourth posthole on the west side of the ditch contained tiny fragments of clay metalworking moulds .
The next phase of activity was during the Medieval period , specifically within the 13th century , when a complex series of east - west and north - south ditches were dug and filled .
Ditches and pits continued to be dug into the post -Medieval period .
Although there was no evidence for domestic occupation during the Neolithic , the riverside was inhabited during the Mesolithic ( 8000 - 4000 BC ) and during the Bronze Age ( 2200 - 700 BC ) .
Until radiocarbon dates on antler picks give us firm dates for construction and dismantling of the stone circle , our best dating evidence is from the two arrowheads found in

GOP : HOW DARE OBAMA SPEAK AT ALL ?
" It would be different , of course , if he read ' The Pet Goat ' while we were under attack , or like Ronald Reagan who told them all about how bad government and taxes are . "
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON - ( PTSD News ) -
After a week of expressing outrage that President Barack Obama planned to speak to American school children , in an attempt to build an Obama Youth Corp in the model of Hitler Youth , Republicans have expanded this campaign to stop Obama 's speeches altogether .
" No American should have to listen socialized fascist propaganda if they do n't want to , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
" Of course , it 's too late for the traitorous liberal Democrat socialists , but what about the true patriot who is in a car when his dial breaks and he is forced to listen to that Communist Nazi ? "
" Is n't Barack happy that he is not working in the fields and has become the White House Negro ? " asked GOP Acting Chairman , Rush Limbaugh .
" Those affirmative action people will never be satisfied . "
" Those leftist liberal progressive terrorist - loving America - hating bigots will try and tell you Obama has a First Amendment right to speak , " said Fox News host Glenn Beck , " but what about our First Amendment right to shout him down and our Second Amendment right to shoot him down ? "
" How dare Barack Obama try to tell our children about hope and school achievement ? " asked House Minority Leader John Boehner .
" It would be different , of course , if he read ' The Pet Goat ' while we were being attacked , or like Ronald Reagan , who told them all about how bad government and taxes are . "
To quell the angry attacks about his speech , the Obama Administration has released a transcript of his entire revised script which reads , " Our children are the future . "
" We think those five simple words can get bipartisan support , " said a White House spokesperson .
But there may still be opposition to this speech .
" More lies from Obama , " said Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley ( R ) , " Our children have no future . "

CLG Index
In 2000 , the influential think thank RAND Corporation crunched some numbers regarding a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan , and concluded that " any near - term Chinese attempt to invade Taiwan would likely be a very bloody affair with a significant probability of failure " – especially if the U.S. raced to the island nation 's defense .
But nine years later , a new , much - updated edition of the RAND study found that China 's improved air and missile forces " represent clear and impending dangers to the defense of Taiwan , " whether or not the U.S. is involved .
" A credible case can be made that the air war for Taiwan could essentially be over before much of the Blue [ American and allied ] air force has even fired a shot , " the monograph notes .
It 's a potentially controversial assertion – and one that might have fueled the ( now - resolved ) debate over whether the U.S. Air Force should buy more F - 22s .
RAND found that F - 22s flying from the relative safety of Guam could be surprisingly effective in blunting a Chinese air assault .
Still , with or without F - 22s , the Chinese air and missile force " dramatically outnumbers [ U.S. and Taiwanese ] forces and wins the war of attrition , " according to Steve Trimble 's summary of the RAND study .
The Chinese lose 241 jets on the first day of fighting , while the U.S. and Taiwan together lose 147 , but this lopsided kill ratio does n't matter , when China has hundreds more planes to put into the air .
Moreover , most of the U.S. and Taiwanese planes lost , are destroyed on the ground by barrages of Chinese ballistic missiles .
( It 's not for no reason that the U.S. Air Force is working hard to win new friends , each with juicy new bases , all over the Pacific . )
Before you panic , though , consider the many caveats RAND sneaks into the study – especially in the footnotes .
In light of how close the Chinese and Taiwanese economies have grown in the last decade , a Chinese invasion would amount to Beijing " shooting itself in the foot . "
" China ’s IT sector , in particular , could be devastated . "
Never mind that the U.S. and Chinese economies are also irrevocably interdependent .
What 's more , despite focusing on the air battle for most of the report 's 185 pages , RAND admits that dogfighting can't conquer an island .
" Ultimately , there is only one military course of action that guarantees China control of Taiwan : a successful invasion and occupation . "
An amphibious assault across the 200 - mile - wide Taiwan Strait would represent " by far the most challenging military operation ever undertaken " by the Chinese .
The entire Chinese navy could only carry 31,000 troops in the first wave – a number RAND admits would " almost certainly not " suffice , " assuming that Taiwan ’s government , military , and populace chose to put up a fight . "
It would take just one successful attack by Taiwan 's missile boats , or one day 's sorties by the island 's attack choppers , to incapacitate the whole Chinese assault fleet .
For that matter , RAND admits that successful attacks by just four U.S. B - 1B bombers could also disable the invasion fleet .
But let 's assume China does sweep the sky of U.S. and Taiwanese planes , bombers included – and even manages to take out Taiwan 's missile boats and choppers .
The RAND study glosses over , in a single footnote , the force that would really play the biggest role in halting a Chinese invasion : the U.S. Navy 's huge , lethal fleet of nuclear submarines .

ALSO :
I ’m going to warn you right now , if you ’re one of “ those ” people that feel you need to buy a baby wipe warmer to clean your precious little one ’s hindquarters you may just want to move on today , WiseBreads got some nice stuff going , but if you ’re not , read on .
The Beginning
You see that beauty above , that was my first car .
A 1977 AMC Gremlin , desert tan thank you very much although sadly that is n’t my actual car above it ’s a 1974 , but the color is the same .
It sported the worlds worst engine a 232 Straight 6 pumping out about 9 HP coupled to a manual 3 speed transmission that was designed by Lucifer himself .
Even my full rear window covering “ Oakley : Thermonuclear Protection ” sticker could n’t mask its ugliness , nor the custom chrome wheels my Dad had lovingly purchased .
This indeed was my present for my 16th birthday .
Now before you tell me I should have been lucky to have such a funky classic car , return with me now to the year 1989 .
Wayne ’s world had not come out .
AMC Gremlins , Pacers or Hornets were definitely not cool .
I was actually laughed at by scores of kids the day I drove it into the parking lot of our high school .
I was absolutely mortified .
I was bitter for some time about that car , especially because I had saved up my own money to purchase my first car myself .
In my head I dreamed of owning a Chevelle , a real muscle car , but what did I get ?
The first real American economy car .
And I use the term economy loosely because we had to put 2 clutches in it during the 2 years I owned it and its gas mileage was subpar .
But it did teach me some valuable life lessons .
It was something I could n’t grasp at the time , but now in adulthood I look back rather fondly at that ugly little car and think about how it shaped a tiny bit of the person I am today .
So let ’s go over those important life lessons we can learn from owning a crappy car as your first vehicle .
Lessons Your Kids Will Learn by Driving a Piece of Crap
Resourcefulness .
When you have a piece of junk odds are most things in it are n’t going to work , like the radio .
Your kids should learn how to fashion some custom subwoofer enclosures out of particle board , or how to wire in some house speakers to their 300w amp they picked up at the swap meet .
With their limited cash flow you ’ll see all sorts of creative ways to “ customize ” their beater .
Mechanical Skills .
Yeah it ’s going to break down .
Kids need to learn how to do some basic auto maintenance .
Teach them to change the oil , check the fluids , rotate the tires , replace an alternator , hammer out a smashed fender .
It will be quality bonding time as well .
Character Building .
If you go out and buy your kid a brand new car what is that going to teach them ?
That their parents have a lot of money to waste on their so called “ safe ” car .
Giving your kid a cosmetically challenged uncool rig encourages them to be the person they should be .
Teach them to stick up for themselves and to develop their self esteem .
Their first car should be one that inspires them to give it a name like “ Wilamena ” , “ The Blue Bomber , ” the “ Death Star . ”
Let them get their creative juices flowing and they will quickly learn not to be defined by the things that they own .
Snap materialism in the bud right at the age of 16 just by the gift of a Ford Fiesta , a K - Car , or a Terdcel .
Frugality .
Be honest this clunker is not going to get good gas mileage so they are going to need to be pumping a lot of petrol in their tank .
They ’ll quickly learn the art of hypermiling and negotiating with friends .
“ Yeah you want to go to the football game ?
Great , give me 5 bucks . ”
You could be creating the next young entrepreneur .
Hand Eye Coordination .
Sure it would be handy to be able to disengage the emergency brake without breaking the dash but think of the coordination they will have by reaching their right foot gingerly under their left to cushion its blow while applying just the right pull with their hand .
Thankfulness .
This will be a delayed gratification for you but it will teach your kids to be thankful for what they have .
Yeah I had an ugly car , but I had a car , parents who loved me and a real appreciation for good quality newer vehicles .
It only took me about 20 years to realize this .
Entitlement .
If this is n’t the scourge of the earth right now its people ’s underlying feeling that they “ deserve ” something .
You know what you deserve ?
A 1990 Toyota Camry Station wagon .
See Thankfulness above .
To the Naysayers
I ’m already prepared for it .
What about the safety of newer vs. older cars FiscalGeek ?
I ’m not advocating you get them a rolling shrapnel wagon , you can find plenty of reasonable crappy cars that are perfectly safe .
What about the reliability ?
We do n’t want Jimmy or Cindy stuck by the side of the road at night .
Give them a prepaid cell phone and a AAA card .
Done .
Should kids even have cars ?
Well if you live in the sticks like we do , there is n’t much choice in the matter , there ’s one bus a mile away that runs about 8 times a day .
At the age of 16 we ’re all going to be done hauling them around from practice , to their game and then on to the math olympiad .
Reader Rides
I ’m very interested to hear your comments about your first cars or what type of car you ’ll buy your little angel or if you will at all .

Paralysis Cases in Walnut Creek
There is hardly anything more frightening than losing physical control of your mobility .
Typically caused by spinal cord injuries , neck injuries , or traumatic back injuries , paralysis is life changing .
The spinal cord , if severed or crushed during an accident or bruised because of damage to surrounding discs , rarely rebuilds itself .
The damage to the spinal cord from an injury results in reduced sensation , mobility , and function to all or part of the body .
In severe cases of paralysis , the individual may suffer permanent loss of these senses .
The two types of paralysis include :
Paraplegia – being paralyzed from the waist down
– being paralyzed from the waist down Quadriplegia – partial or total loss of all limbs
While quadriplegia is considered a more severe form of paralysis , both types can be seriously life - altering .

People are often unable to care for themselves , requiring assistance with the chores of daily living .

Comparing the Costs of Paraplegia vs. Quadriplegia
Any form of paralysis can be life - changing — especially when it is caused suddenly by an act of negligence or misconduct .
From car accidents to slip and falls to sport accidents , paralysis can be caused by a number of different incidents .
Our firm works closely with you to determine not just the cause , but the party that may be held liable .
Depending on the type of severity and placement of the nerve damage , the type of paralysis faced will be different .
These factors can all factor into the compensation recovered .
For example , quadriplegia and paraplegia differ in the following ways :
Paraplegia – Loss of function , mobility , and sensation in the legs and lower body , limiting a person ’s ability to perform daily activities as before .
Likely , the victim will be restricted to a wheelchair and need major adjustments made to their household to ensure it is accessible .
They will also likely have challenges returning to work — if at all .
– Loss of function , mobility , and sensation in the legs and lower body , limiting a person ’s ability to perform daily activities as before .
Likely , the victim will be restricted to a wheelchair and need major adjustments made to their household to ensure it is accessible .
They will also likely have challenges returning to work — if at all .
Quadriplegia – Resulting in total paralysis of the four limbs , this form of paralysis leaves a victim unable to move their upper or lower body .
In severe cases , victims may even have trouble controlling their breathing .
A person will likely require major remodeling of their living area — or be forced to move — regular care , assistance , and support on a daily basis .
They will also likely have high medical expenses , care costs , and other related financial challenges .
While both forms are severe and life - altering , quadriplegia victims are often eligible for much more compensation based on their circumstances .
Our law firm helps people who have become paraplegic or quadriplegic obtain the resources they need to live as fully as possible .
We have a record of accomplishment in helping people who have suffered catastrophic injury through no fault of their own .

Do n't attribute to mere stupidity what can more plausibly be explained by malice ( or greed ) .
Those who control our governments , NGOs and inter-governmental organizations ( such as the WHO ) , and those higher up in the hierarchy who control them , have implemented a plan — namely , the imposition of lockdowns ( akin to house arrest ) , restriction of movement , cancellation of public events , etc. , under the pretext of a pandemic crisis — which will result in the ruin and deaths of millions of innocent hard - working ordinary people and in the devastation of our societies , built up from the work of generations of those who preceded us .
Was this due simply to misinformation , ignorance and stupidity by government officials ?
Or was this crisis manufactored , and cleverly taken advantage of , by psychopaths seeking control on a global scale ?
If so then eventually , if we still have any freedom , dignity and self - respect left , those responsible for what has happened must be , and will be , brought to justice .
The origin of this panic seems to have been a report from CNN on January 26 of an alleged statement by China 's health minister Ma Xiaowei that people who are ( supposedly ) infected by the virus can infect others without themselves showing any symptoms of illness .
If that were true then you could be infected just by walking down the street — clearly a reason to panic .
Ma did n't explain why he thought the virus can be spread before someone has symptoms , but that did n't stop Dr. William Schaffner , a longtime adviser to the CDC , from taking this claim seriously — in effect endorsing it .
Other CDC officials took up the theme .
Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases picked up the ball and ran with it .
Dr. Fauci is quoted as saying , " the Chinese did not tell U.S. health authorities that the virus could spread before someone is symptomatic " , thus implicitly suggesting that indeed that was the case .
This was denied by epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm , who stated , " I know of no evidence in 17 years of working with coronaviruses ... where anyone has been found to be infectious during their incubation period . "
On January 30 the New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from 16 German doctors claiming that a symptomless Chinese woman ( arriving from China ) had infected a German man in Munich , but when they got around to actually asking her , she said that while in Munich she had in fact shown symptoms , which worsened on her return to China .
Thanks to CNN , Dr. Fauci , and the German doctors , the rumor of symptomless transition morphed into " fact " among government officials and the general public .
From then on the MSM issued increasingly alarming reports of deaths due to this ( allegedly ) new illness , ignoring the fact that people were ( as usual ) dying of the ( not reported ) seasonal flu .
John Nolte : Dr. Fauci Is Either a Liar or a Fraud
And for a devastating exposé of the 36 - year career of this vile quack doctor see the final article in William Engdahl 's Covid article compilation here .
[ Added 2020 - 08 - 18 : Fauci has now been sidelined . ]
In February , as Italy began reporting infections , Prof. Neil Ferguson , Head of the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London , dusted off a computer program he had written 15 years ago implementing a model for infectious disease spreading .
Using data available from Italy he concluded ( following his history of vastly over - estimating deaths in previous epidemics ) that 510,000 people ( 2.5 million in the U.S. ) could die if the U.K. government did n't abandon its strategy at that time of allowing the disease to spread .
On February 23 in Italy the first lockdowns and compulsory " social distancing " began .
Early in March Britain also imposed lockdowns , later extended to the entire U.K. , despite the fact that Prof.
Ferguson had revised his death toll estimate from 510,000 down to 20,000 .
The term " lockdown " normally means keeping prisoners locked down in their cells , typically following a riot .
It was also used in the MSM following the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013 ( likely a false flag ) to confine people to their homes until given permission to come out — a trial run ?
On March 7 one Dr. James Lawler ( U. of University Medical Center ) misinformed the world ( to the delight of the MSM ) that about 96 million Americans could become infected with coronavirus , of whom about half a million would die .
On March 11 the WHO , after much delay , declared COVID - 19 a global pandemic .
On March 15 New York mayor Bill de Blasio declared ( with no evidence ) that the virus can spread rapidly through " close interactions , " and issued an order ( which was soon after repeated by governors of many other states ) to close restaurants , bars and cafes .
On March 16 most European countries imposed lockdowns and border closures .
On March 20 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ( along with governors of many other states ) shut down all " non-essential businesses " , thereby depriving millions of people of their jobs and their livelihoods , leading to bankruptcies and suicides .
By March 30 approximately 265 million Americans were under indefinite lockdown and martial law in all but name .
In late April a ' revised ' version of the computer code written by Ferguson to predict 510,000 deaths in the U.K. was released to the GitHub code repository .
It was examined by an anonymous ex-Google software engineer , who found numerous flaws and bugs , in particular that , from the same input data the program would produce very different outputs .
This makes it useless for scientific purposes , and also worse than useless as a basis for political decisions ( and consequently as a justification for government orders ) .
Further details at Computer model that locked down the world turns out to be sh*tcode .
The thing that really has me pissed off , is that my government [ the U.K. ] ( and many others around the world ) , jumped in and spent hundreds of billions of dollars and suspended the civil liberties of millions of people indefinitely and destroyed the livelihoods of countless small business people based on just one unverified source [ that is , Ferguson ] .
There was ZERO due diligence done .
The first thing that should have been done was to require the production of the full source code for the simulation software ( as it was run , not this " cleaned up " stuff ) , and all input data so that it could be verified .
If they did n't want to provide it , then the simulation results should have been discarded .
Ferguson's " scientific " advice was bogus , and Boris Johnson was criminally negligent in accepting it and ordering the lockdown of the entire U.K .
But will they ever see jail time for wrecking the U.K. economy and ruining the lives of millions of people ?
No way .

A map of France is cracked by a Roman standard driven into the ground .
To one side a magnifying glass focuses on a “ Gaulish village ” surrounded by four Roman outposts : Aquarium , Totorum , Laudanum and Compendium .
Who would have thought – given such adverse circumstances – that one of that village ’s most famous denizens , namely , Asterix the Gaul , would live to reach the grand old age of 50 ?
But on 29 October , the tiny settlement ’s shrewd , miniature protector – along with Obelix , his menhir - sized mate , and various neighbours – will celebrate their half century .
To mark the occasion , the books ’ publisher , Orion , is organising an exhibition showcasing some of the original Asterix artwork at the only surviving Gallo - Roman monument in the whole of France ( in Bourgogne – looking at the map at the beginning of an Asterix book , that ’s almost in Lutetia territory , or Luxembourg ) .
Also celebrating the birthday is a new book of short stories , Asterix and Obelix ’s Birthday : The Golden Book , published next Thursday .
Asterix began life in 1959 as a serial in the French comics periodical Pilote .
The comics were written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo , by that stage a veteran comic - writing partnership of seven years .
When Goscinny died in 1977 , Uderzo continued to write the books himself – and we ’re very glad he did .
His inventive , bacchanalian characterisations of gluttonous Romans and their wily opposition has managed to wow successive generations of school children ( and their potion - swilling ways inspiring at least one Disney cartoon , Gummi Bears ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
My own introduction to Asterix came in the late 1980s .
Asterix gradually seeped , rather than crashed into my consciousness .
There was always one or two of Goscinny and Uderzo ’s books – Asterix and the Normans , Asterix and the Big Fight , Asterix and the Cultural Stereotype ( maybe not the last one ) – knocking around the school library .
With the annuals ’ healthy length and quirky one - liners – despite some parts being lost in translation – they were always an unusual , if fun choice .
You could almost split the class into two halves , those who liked the unrelenting slapstick of Asterix , and those who liked the more intelligent , more formal plot structure of the Gaul ’s Belgian competitor - with - a - quiff , Tintin .
The proof , however , is in the boar ’s tripe .
Asterix has now been translated into over 100 languages , sold 325 million copies of 33 books , spawned eight animated adventures and three live action films ( how did Gérard Depardieu ever live his turn as Obelix down ? ) .
The unsung heroes , though , as far as British audiences are concerned , have to be Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge , who have translated the books into English .
Without their work , there would be no “ by the gods , ” or “ by toutatis ” , just two of many catchphrases they have helped popularise .
Altogether now : “ These Romans are crazy ! ” Rob Sharp
Less film director , more remote controller
When an actor or director produces a mediocre performance , they ’re often accused of having “ phoned it in ” .
But prior to the release of the new , stop-motion animation adaptation of Roald Dahl ’s Fantastic Mr Fox , its director Wes Anderson admitted that he went one better : emailing his directions from 300 km away .
Anderson was present all the way through the pre-production process , recording the voice performances of his enviable cast , which includes George Clooney and Meryl Streep .
However , according to a profile in the LA Times this week , when principle photography began in London in early 2008 , Anderson decamped to Paris for the duration .
And his employees were n’t exactly overjoyed to discover that they ’d have to email him digital clips of their work , after which he would respond with his thoughts and further instructions .
In a rare example of Hollywood candor , Mark Gustafson , the film ’s director of animation , said Anderson had “ made our lives miserable . ”
But while he may not have made his crew happy , Anderson ’s film – which opens the London Film Festival tonight – has nonetheless been hailed as his best work for years .
Hit & Run can think of a few other directors whose work might improve if they stayed away from the set altogether .

A purse that gives wallets a wallop
Brrrr .
The chill wind of recession is still swirling through the streets and money seems to be slipping through the fingers more swiftly than ever .
So now ’s the perfect time to downsize from that huge wallet , with its acres of empty space where banknotes and store cards used to reside , to something with more appropriate dimensions .
A coin purse , say .
And look , here 's just the thing – a ‘ wristlet ’ – it loops round your hand – from Balenciaga .
With just enough space for a couple of quid and a packet of chewing gum , it 's perfect for those with reduced circumstances .
Perfect , that is , until we come to the price tag .
Because this little pouch , this 18 cm x 16 cm sneeze of a coin carrier , costs £ 770 .
Now that ’s enough to send a shiver down anyone ’s spine .

Manthropology : The Science of the Inadequate Modern Male .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A new book claims even modern athletes could not run as fast , jump as high , or have been nearly as strong as our predecessors .
The book , Manthropology : The Science of the Inadequate Modern Male , by Australian anthropologist Peter McAllister , describes many examples of the inadequacy of the modern male , calling them as a class , " the sorriest cohort of masculine Homo sapiens to ever walk the planet . "
Given spiked running shoes , Indigenous Australians of 20,000 years ago could have beaten today 's world record for running 100 and 200 meters .
As recently as last century , some Tutsi males in Rwanda could have easily beaten the current high jump world record , and bodybuilders such as Arnold Schwarzenegger would have been no match in an arm wrestle with a Neanderthal woman .
Twenty thousand years ago six male Australian Aborigines chasing prey left footprints in a muddy lake shore that became fossilized .
Analysis of the footprints shows one of them was running at 37 kph ( 23 mph ) , only 5 kph slower than Usain Bolt was traveling at when he ran the 100 meters in world record time of 9.69 seconds in Beijing last year .
But Bolt had been the recipient of modern training , and had the benefits of spiked running shoes and a rubberized track , whereas the Aboriginal man was running barefoot in soft mud .
Given the modern conditions , the man , dubbed T8 , could have reached speeds of 45 kph , according to McAllister .
McAllister also presents as evidence of his thesis photographs taken by a German anthropologist early in the twentieth century .
The photographs showed Tutsi initiation ceremonies in which young men had to jump their own height in order to be accepted as men .
Some of them jumped as high as 2.52 meters , which is higher than the current world record of 2.45 meters .
McAllister , interviewed in his temporary residence in Cambridge , UK , also said women of the extinct hominids such as the Neanderthals carried around 10 percent more muscle than modern European men , and with training could have reached 90 percent of the bulk of Arnold Schwarzenegger at his physical prime .
Her shorter lower arm would have given her a great advantage in an arm wrestle , and she could easily have slammed his arm to the table .
Other examples in the book are rowers of the massive trireme warships in ancient Athens who far exceeded the capabilities of modern rowers , Roman soldiers who completed the equivalent of one and a half marathons a day , carrying equipment weighing half their body weight , and Australian Aborigines who could throw a spear over 10 meters further than the current javelin world record .
McAllister attributes the decline to the more sedentary lifestyle humans have lived since the industrial revolution , which has made modern people less robust than before since machines do so much of the work .
The fact that we are constantly improving and breaking athletic records is because they are only in comparison to the performances in recent decades .
If you compare today 's athleticism with that of humans much further back we see a real decline .
According to McAllister humans have lost 40 percent of the shafts of the long bones because they are no longer subjected to the kind of muscular loads that were normal before the industrial revolution .
Even our elite athletes are not exposed to anywhere near the challenges and loads that were part of everyday life for pre-industrial people .
The Cro-Magnons , the first anatomically modern Europeans , living around 30 - 40,000 years ago , were impressively tall ( many over 6 feet 6 inches ) , strong , fit , and with larger brains than humans of today .
They had an active lifestyle and an abundant and balanced diet of meats and vegetables .
The advent of agriculture ( described by anthropologist Jared Diamond as the worst mistake in history ) meant a steady supply of food , but it also meant our diet became lower in quality , less varied and contained fewer nutrients .
The result was that we became smaller and weaker , only regaining size and strength in the last century or so after improvements in sanitation and the development of medicines such as antibiotics .
The good news from the findings described in the book is that the human body is plastic , and can change over generations .
Each individual body can also change over much shorter periods of time .
With a good balanced and varied diet and with plenty of exercise , there is plenty of scope for improvement in almost all of us .

The blast froze the men in their final acts .
A police officer waving cars away from the warehouse fire , a gas station attendant aiming a hose at the flames , a fire chief directing the battle and the teenager who first saw the blaze helping with the fight .
Only moments before , they had noticed the word Explosives on the red delivery truck parked only four feet from the burning building .
The truck 's sides curdled in the heat .
One man tried to move it but the doors were locked .
Then the truck caught fire and someone yelled for everybody to run .
Seconds later , a flash consumed them all .
The force of the exploding truck raced outward .
Many in Roseburg had come to watch the fire , unaware of the danger , and where they stood determined if they lived or died .
A family watched the warehouse burn from their window about a block away .
The husband had stepped away to use the bathroom .
When the blast hit , collapsing walls saved his life as razors of glass shredded his wife and 4 - year - old daughter .
Parked less than a block away , a pregnant woman -- the wife of the teenager fighting the fire -- survived in her car as her husband and the buildings around her vanished .
The blast moved on .
It caught two women who walked side by side away from the fire .
One woman flew straight down the street and lived ; the woman next to her went sideways , through a car dealer 's plate glass window .
They found her a few days later , impaled .
The blast -- faster than the sound of the explosion itself -- then met one person running toward the light .
George Rutherford was the first person who understood what the flames meant .
That was his truck -- carrying 6 1/2 tons of dynamite and blasting agent -- parked by horrible coincidence next to a building now on fire .
Rutherford ran down Oak Street from his hotel three blocks from his truck .
He had to get it out of there .
If he could only get there in time --
Rutherford came to among rubble and glass .
Other survivors found him , his nose hanging by a thin band of flesh .
They did n't know who he was , just a crazed man trying to run back toward the scene of the blast , and they held him back .
" Let me go , let me go , " he cried .
" I 've got to go back to see how many people I 've killed . "
In Roseburg , this moment -- 14 minutes after 1 in the morning of Aug. 7 , 1959 , a Friday -- is known simply as the Blast , one of the worst disasters in Oregon history .
The blast killed 14 people , hurt 125 and destroyed or seriously damaged more than 100 buildings , including a school and a Coca - Cola bottling plant , apartments and homes .
The percussion tossed people from their beds , and windows burst nine miles away .
Some people saw a mushroom cloud that clear summer night and thought the Russians had attacked .
Roseburg , then a town of 12,000 , made worldwide news .
Lawmakers rewrote the rules about how explosives are handled , the federal government issued a damning report and the city tried to rebuild .
Investigations piled up and lawsuits flew .
Then 50 years went by .
More than 100 commemorated the blast this month with a solemn walk to the blast site , now marked by a boulder and simple bronze plaque .
The blast has been documented in articles , studies and a film .
But a lot of what people know about it comes by way of legend and rumor and twice - told tales .
Together , their voices sing a chorus of confusion and loss of a moment that for many people divided their lives into before and after .
The story has always lacked one voice .
George Rutherford was n't from there .
He drove deliveries for Pacific Powder Co. in Tenino , Wash . , and lived in Chehalis .
After he got out of the hospital he went home and did n't have to hear the Roseburg coffee shop chatter about what kind of a fool parks a locked truck loaded with dynamite in the heart of their town .
He did n't have to hear it .
He knew what he had done .
He lived with it for the rest of his life , and kept the story within him as if a chunk of the city had been blown deep into his chest .
George Rutherford ran away from home when he was 13 .
He fled the cruelty of his father on the family ranch in Durkee , near Oregon 's border with Idaho , and went off to work on his own for a hard season haying .
When he went to collect his $ 130 check at season 's end , he found that his father had claimed the money and taken it for himself .
He learned how to drive buses and trucks , he married a girl named Doris and they moved to Seattle .
For years he drove a bus and later a laundry truck ; then he heard about a job with Pacific Powder Co .
The company wanted a driver to deliver its explosives around the West .
People , laundry , dynamite -- he could move them all , it did n't make a difference to him .
Rutherford and Doris had two children , Joy and Lonny , and he was n't around as much as he wanted to be , what with all the driving .
When he was home , his children saw a cheerful , energetic man .
He was a blur around the house , building this and fixing that , taking his son to ballgames , helping neighbors and folks from church .
" He was always a jokester , always laughing and making people smile , " says Lonny Rutherford , who was 13 at the time of the explosion .
" He was just one of those guys you wanted to be around . "
On Aug. 6 , 1959 , when he was 46 , Rutherford rolled into Roseburg , a routine delivery .
His new Ford had a cargo area with metal walls and a roof , and a tarpaulin curtain in the back .
He was hauling 2 tons of dynamite and 4 1 / 2 tons of the bagged blasting agent nitro- carbo - nitrate , sold under the name Car - Prill .
Rutherford arrived at Gerretsen Building Supply , a regular customer , around 8 at night .
Someone at the store -- it 's not clear who -- told him they 'd unload the truck the next day and that Rutherford could leave the truck on the street .
Rutherford said he was told a security guard -- called a merchant policeman -- would watch it .
Rutherford locked the truck and walked three blocks up Oak Street to the Umpqua Hotel , had dinner and tried to sleep .
He could n't .
Something about the truck did n't feel right .
After 10 o'clock he walked down to check the truck .
All looked fine , so he went back to the Umpqua and slept until sirens woke him .
Years later , people who should have been at the Gerretsen fire talked about how lucky they were to be somewhere else -- and how tragic it was that others ended up there .
No one is sure how it started but the fire broke out around 1 a.m. in the Gerretsen warehouse , where they kept barrels of paint thinner .
Dennis Tandy was a 17 - year - old millworker driving home with his pregnant wife , Marilyn , after a swing shift .
He was the first to spot the fire , and told Marilyn to call it in and stay in their Fiat , well away from the flames .
A young policeman , Norm Neal , said he should have been on duty that night but was working another job as a rural firefighter .
His crew was sent out after the blast .
Another officer , Don DeSues , 32 , worked that night shift .
A gas station attendant , Richard Knight , 20 , had experience fighting fires and volunteered to take over for Lyle Wescott , a firefighter whose hands were seriously burned in the first few minutes after arriving at the warehouse blaze .
Wescott lived because he went off to the hospital before the truck blew .
The flames spread outside the warehouse walls and someone noticed the truck with its cream - colored letters that warned : Explosives .
Someone -- probably Assistant Fire Chief Roy McFarland -- told everyone to get away .
When the truck blew up , McFarland , Tandy , Knight and DeSues died instantly .
Bonnie Jo Berg had grown up in Roseburg but was visiting from out of town when she met her childhood friend , Carol Marical , after Carol 's shift at the Umpqua Hotel 's restaurant .
They had stopped on their walk home to watch the fire , felt the heat grow and decided to move away from the blaze just seconds before the explosion .
The blast threw Berg through the car dealer 's windows .
All Marical could remember was trying to stand up amid flying ash and sparking snakes of power lines .
Doctors later took a quart of bolts , nuts and washers out of her back .
She could n't feel the pain then .
" I just wanted to find Bonnie , " she said .
" But Bonnie had disappeared . "
Harry Carmichael worked at a cigar store and was on his way home when the blast knocked him down .
He got up and helped direct rescue workers to where people were trapped in the rubble .
Then someone noticed Carmichael 's arm had been blown off .
He refused help .
Later at the hospital he bled to death .
Marilyn
Tandy got out of her car .
She had been less than a block from the blast .
The Fiat was smashed , the windows blown out , but she was largely unhurt .
" I walked up the street and looked back , and there was nothing or nobody there , " she says today .
" I knew my husband was gone . "
Dawn revealed the smoking ruins .
The truck had opened a crater 52 feet across and 20 feet deep .
The local newspaper , the News - Review , rushed out an issue within hours filled with eyewitness accounts .
The next day , the newspaper 's lead story opened by telling readers the disaster area smelled of burning flesh .
Rutherford 's family was away from home when they heard his truck had exploded .
They did n't know if he had died .
His son - in - law drove to Roseburg and found him in the hospital .
The Rutherfords returned to Chehalis and found reporters and photographers at their house .
Writers from papers and magazines such as Life and Look begged for an exclusive interview .
The Rutherfords holed up in their house for a week .
Rutherford 's bosses at Pacific Powder told him to disappear for a while and keep his mouth shut .
The family slipped off to Grayland Beach for 10 days .
When they returned , reporters still were camped on their lawn .
Meanwhile , investigators swarmed over Chehalis asking people what kind of man Rutherford was .
They got the same answer : kind and thoughtful , God-fearing and sober .
The federal Interstate Commerce Commission and the state Public Utility Commission convened a hearing in Roseburg three weeks later .
Rutherford was ordered to testify .
His bosses from Pacific Powder dropped all the blame on him .
The company 's supervisor called the blast a " failure in judgment of the man . "
But investigators had already discovered Pacific Powder 's troubling record .
Three days before the Roseburg blast , a federal safety inspector visited the Pacific Powder plant and was alarmed by the shoddy safety practices .
The company , the inspector learned , often left explosives trucks unattended .
Investigators also found the company had created problems for Rutherford on the Roseburg trip .
The company often used an explosives depot outside town to park loaded trucks , but Rutherford 's boss ordered him not to park it there .
The company was afraid someone might steal the cargo .
Then they sent Rutherford on his way , knowing he would have to park the truck overnight but lacked an approved place to do it .
Rutherford testified he thought a security guard was watching the truck .
The questions were withering .
" You mean , " one investigator asked , " you believed you were attending a vehicle if someone might occasionally see it , who was n't paid to watch it or had n't been contacted about it , comes around once an hour ? "
" Yes , " he replied .
Darkness fell over Rutherford .
" He was quieter and sad a lot , " his son Lonny says now .
" No one ever talked then of seeing a counselor or asking for help .
You just had to take it , to live with it .
Sometimes we 'd find him just sitting in the chair looking off into nowhere . "
The pressure mounted .
The federal government charged Pacific Powder with breaking safety rules .
The Douglas County district attorney had a grand jury indict the company ( but not Rutherford ) on manslaughter charges .
Lawsuits piled up -- from families of the dead , from the injured , from property owners .
The damages went into the millions .
Process servers delivered lawsuits to the Rutherfords ' house .
Lonny recalled reading one suit in which a Roseburg resident sued to recover the cost of a damaged coffeepot .
" They kept coming back asking him the same questions again and again , " Lonny recalls .
" He felt they were trying to trip him up .
So he just never talked about it .
We just never talked about it around him .
He would just clam up if someone wanted him to talk about it . "
If Rutherford left the house , Doris would whisper to friends about the blast .
She might even take out a hidden scrapbook with clippings and photos and show them to people so they might understand what Rutherford had gone through .
In time , memories of the blast faded .
The lawsuits got settled and insurance paid most of the costs .
The federal case was thrown out of court on technical grounds , and the Oregon Supreme Court told the Douglas County DA he could n't charge a company with manslaughter .
Pacific Powder had given Rutherford a desk job but he did n't like it and quit to take up carpentry .
The darkness lasted years .
Rutherford died from lung problems in 1996 .
He was 83 .
Reporters had come around through the years -- usually near anniversaries of the blast -- seeking interviews .
He always said no .
He and Doris moved to New Mexico in 1982 , near where Lonny had opened a construction business a decade earlier .
Rutherford by then had all but emerged from the sadness .
He worked with Lonny now and then , and he and his wife hosted dances at the senior center .
He finally found a way to enjoy life again .
About four years before his death , he and Doris hosted a dinner for a woman named Marilyn Mobley , Lonny 's new girlfriend and future wife .
Marilyn did n't know Lonny 's family very well yet , and knew little about their history .
Rutherford was in good spirits at dinner , funny and interested in what Marilyn had to say .
For some reason -- she can't recall now why -- Rutherford looked at her and said , " You know , I 'm the one who drove the dynamite truck that blew up Roseburg , Oregon . "
Everyone at the table got quiet .
Marilyn , who knew nothing about the taboos of the subject , asked him , " What are you talking about ? "
In a deliberate rhythm Rutherford told her the story .
" If only I had done something else that night , " he said .
Today , Marilyn recalls the pain in his eyes .
" He was never trying to excuse himself , " she says now .
" He took full responsibility for his part in it .
It was almost like he let me see into his heart -- all of that trauma and this overwhelming burden to carry . "
That night at dinner , Marilyn kept asking questions -- had he been hurt ?
Yes , he told her , but that was nothing compared to what others went through , all that damage , all that loss .
Then he told her he had been running for his truck and was within a block of it when it exploded .
" I should have died .
I was that close to the truck .
I should have died . "
Then he looked at Marilyn .
" An angel picked me up and carried me away . "
Rutherford told her he was running toward the truck and was almost to it when a pair of powerful hands lifted him by the shoulders and carried him through the air , floating away , away as the truck exploded , and then set him down back at the Umpqua Hotel .
" That 's where the angel carried me , " he said .
" To the steps of my hotel . "
What Marilyn did n't know -- what no one at the table knew that night -- was that the Umpqua Hotel was three blocks from where Rutherford was when the blast hit him .
Could the force have thrown him back to the Umpqua Hotel ?
No .
He probably staggered about after being knocked down , his nose slashed by metal and glass , and somehow wandered through the ash and heat back the way he'd come .
But Rutherford had it right -- it 's near the Umpqua where dazed hotel guests came out into the street and found him .
That 's where they heard him beg to be let loose so he could run toward the fire and see how many people had died .
And that 's where they put him into a taxi for the hospital .
No one knows for sure how George Rutherford ended up back at the hotel .
But he knew .
" An angel carried me there , " he said .

From the Indonesian province of Aceh — epicenter of the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami five years ago that killed 230,000 people — comes fresh evidence that in the Muslim world , the most common disasters tend to be man-made .
On Monday , the provincial parliament stiffened its interpretation of Shariah law by introducing the classical Islamic penalty of stoning to death for adultery .
Premarital sex and homosexuality drew a lighter rebuke ; for them , the pious lawmakers recommend 100 strokes of a rattan cane .

Nowadays many of us in the industrialized world spend way too much time sitting in the classroom , workplace , or living room watching TV .
According to one study , Americans spend more than eight hours a day in front of televisions , computers , cellphones or other devices .
This is not what our bodies have been evolutionary designed to withstand .
Our ancestors would spend the majority of their waking hours migrating , hunting , and gathering in order to find food and shelter to survive .
They were always on their feet .
But now with the rise of video games and technology we have even more distractions to decrease our time being physically active .
One result of too much time spent sitting is poor posture , which according to doctors and chiropractors has become somewhat of an epidemic in the United States .
Another study even showed how poor body posture can affect confidence in your own thoughts .
The importance of good posture for a healthy body and mind cannot be underestimated .
Computers are of course becoming one of the biggest contributors to bad sitting posture .
I know this is certainly true for me , but how many of us can honestly relate to the first image above where our spine would be perfectly erect ?
More than likely – our bodies resemble the last two photos , where our bodies are slouched either forward or backward .
But we ca n’t avoid computers for the rest of our lives , they have become an integral part to modern society , so why not adapt to them in a way that optimizes good health ?
This does n’t mean we have to blog less or stop going to work – it simply means we take some time to focus on building better computer posture .
First we need to become more conscious of how we sit throughout the day , then we can correct it and over time build it into an automatic habit .
Here are some tips you can apply to help correct your sitting posture and improve your physical and mental health :
1 . I first recommend to watch this short video on The Alexander Technique , an incredibly powerful tool designed to improve body awareness , posture , and coordination .
It was first developed by a Shakespearean actor between 1890 - 1900 in order to alleviate breathing problems and hoarseness .
It is not widely used in various physical therapy facilities , dance schools and acting studios .
Here is another video posted by the British Medical Journal in response to a study showing the positive effects of the Alexander Technique on pain and physical stress .
2 . Of course having good sitting posture is a huge plus , but why not also try to actually be active while sitting on the computer ?
In fact , according to some studies physical inactivity is beginning to pose one of the biggest health risks to Americans .
So what types of things can you do while on your computer or watching TV ?
You ’ll notice that even while sitting up straight you can still mobilize your head , neck , shoulders , hips , and legs .
Try to see how many different stretches you can do while still sitting at your computer desk .
Sometimes after long periods of time sitting down I simply continue what I am doing on the computer while standing up ( no one says you have to sit down while surfing the web right ? ) .
In a standing up position you can get even more little exercises accomplished while still doing things on the computer .
My only warning is to make sure you adjust the height level of your computer monitor so that your neck does n’t have to bend down to see the screen .
3. Take a short 3 - 5 min. break from the computer every hour or so .
Do some push ups or sit ups , take a lap around the office , or do more in depth stretching – but whatever you do make sure it is some sort of physical exercise .
Wrapping Up
Of course , like all good things , the hardest part is first being aware of what you are doing wrong .
This means seeing where your body is building up physical stresses , which parts are n’t being properly attended to , and observing when your posture gets lazy .
Consistency is key if you want to build these habits into your natural way of acting .
I recommend dedicating a whole week or two to posture awareness and see what you learn .
Find your weak points and then work from there .
For those who are already trained at applying mindfulness to everyday activities this should already be a familiar practice .
For those who are n’t yet skilled in mindfulness , this may not be a bad place to start ; the Alexander Technique after all is a technique of mindfulness .

The Saudi king has waived a sentence of flogging on a female journalist working for a TV channel which aired graphic accounts of sex in the kingdom .
King Abdullah cancelled the sentence of 60 lashes against Rozanna al - Yami , after being briefed on the case .
The programme broadcast by Saudi - owned Lebanese channel LBC caused a huge scandal in the conservative kingdom .
Three men who bragged about their sexual adventures in the show , as well as the cameraman , have been jailed .
No reason has been given for the king 's decision .
It is the second time he has intervened in a high - profile flogging sentence in two years .
The original programme was part of a series called Red Lines , examining taboos in the Arab world , including extra-marital sex in Saudi Arabia .
Mazen Abdul Jawad provoked outrage by describing his techniques for meeting and having sex with Saudi women .
He has apologised and claimed LBC tricked him , but he was jailed for five years and sentenced to 1,000 lashes .
Three of his friends who appeared on the show got two years each and the cameraman was jailed for two months .
The station 's offices in Saudi Arabia were closed down and two of its producers - both female - put on trial .
LBC has made no comment about the cases .

Greetz fellow belgian pirates ,
Here \'s list of Skynet ADSL Logins for you folks that like me came from the usa and are disgusted at the lack of bandwidth this shitty country with shitty ISPs has to offer us :
[ snip 30 logins ]
There \'s an exploit on their BBOX2 ( which is also present on the dommel routers btw ) that allows any remote attackers to have any info they want from the router ( Even if WAN access is disabled )
I \'ll post the exploit if the quotas aren\'t abolished by the 30th November 2009 .
Be warned shitty ISPs , if you do n\'t want me to share the exploit along with over 285.000 ADSL logins just stop this shitty bandwidth capping :
Internet is supposed to be a right for everyone and not limited .
I \'ll post 1000 ADSL Logins ( Starting with a small number as a warning ) next week and following weeks until the 10/30/09 .
By then , if Belgacom Skynet \ 's quota are n\'t abolished , i\ 'll prolly post the exploit for you guys to make your own collection of adsl logins .
Change , does not roll in , on the wheels of inevitability .
But comes through continuous struggle .
Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor .
It must be demanded by the oppressed .
Take it .
Demand it .
We are Anonymous .
We are Legion .
We do not Forgive .
We do not Forget .
This is only the beginning .
Expect us .

We got Skynet by the balls now , do n\'t we ?

New York ( CNN ) --
The teen who mysteriously turned up in New York with apparent amnesia emptied her bank account and left behind " everything " before she left her home in Washington , police told CNN .
The woman , now identified as Kacie Aleece Peterson , 18 , of Hansville , Washington , withdrew about $ 400 from her Bank of America account , said Scott Wilson , spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff 's Office in Washington .
But Peterson " left everything , " including her wallet , identification , cell phone , clothes and even her bike , which was secured outside a Wal - Mart , Wilson said .
Police still do not know how Peterson traveled cross-country to New York City .
The woman mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago , claiming to have no memory of her family , her home -- or even her own name .
There 's no indication that she 's feigning her memory loss , said Paul Browne , deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department .
At the same time , because Peterson is an adult , authorities have not ruled out the theory that she left home to re-establish herself elsewhere , Wilson said .
The teen 's father , Henry Peterson of Colville , Washington , told Kitsap County authorities his daughter had occasional memory lapses , Wilson said .
In May , Kacie Peterson was found lying on the ground next to a creek at the family farm , Wilson said .
She had blacked out and did not remember who she was , he said .
Kacie Peterson was briefly hospitalized after the incident , he said .
Her father also told investigators that in another incident his daughter was found unconscious on her bedroom floor , Wilson said .
Henry Peterson reported his daughter missing on October 2 , Wilson said , after the family friend she lived with told him that the last time she saw Kacie Peterson was September 30 .
Kacie Peterson moved in June from eastern Washington with her father to western Washington to live with a friend of her mother , who died when she was 7 , Wilson said .
Henry Peterson told police he agreed to the transition , Wilson said .
The teen 's father described their relationship as " difficult " and " that he had put too much pressure on his daughter to do well and get good grades , " Wilson said .
Kacie Peterson , a high school senior , started anew at Kingston High School in Kingston , Washington , but only attended for three weeks , said Chris Case , director of community relations for North Kitsap school district .
Enrolled in the Running Start program there , Kacie Peterson had two advanced placement classes at the school and also classes at Olympic College in Poulsbo , about 10 miles away , Case said .
Kingston high school officials said Kacie Peterson was quiet , shy and that " she had no friends , " Wilson said .
The last time she showed up for class was on September 29 , Case said .
The next time some employees of the school saw the student she was sporting a new look .
" The school here is telling me she had long hair past her shoulders , " Case said .
In the photo New York police showed of the teen during their investigation to identify her , Kacie Peterson had hair that looked only about a couple of inches long on top and tapered low on the sides .
Police asked for help identifying the teen after she was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. on October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter .
The organization had said she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility .
A security guard for the shelter noticed her walking around on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her .
Finding her unresponsive , he called police .
Officers interviewed her , but it became clear that she could n't provide authorities with any information about herself .
A photo of the then - unidentified woman aired on CNN , and a viewer in Maryland who was familiar with Kacie Peterson alerted authorities .
Police established a positive identification .
Police say they do not know how she lost her memory .
She is still in New York and receiving care from the city agency , Browne said .
CNN 's Susan Candiotti , Khadijah Rentas , Erica Hill and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report .
Just when you think the Weekly Standard 's institutionalized contempt for gay people could not get any worse , along comes James Bowman 's defense of barring openly gay men from military service :
Facing enemy bullets -- is inextricably bound up with ideas of masculinity .
We also know that most heterosexual males ' ideas of masculinity are inextricably bound up with what we now call sexual orientation .
In other words , " being a man " typically does mean for soldiers both being brave , stoic , etc. -- and being heterosexual .
Another way to put this is to say that honor , which is by the testimony of soldiers throughout the ages of the essence of military service , includes the honor of being known for heterosexuality , and that , for most heterosexual males , shame attends a reputation as much for homosexuality as for weakness or cowardice .
Beneath the elegant prose and the admission that gay soldiers are as good as straight ones - and as American as anyone else - is an old schoolyard epithet : no sissies allowed , and all fags are sissies .
Or rather , if others believe without evidence that they are sissies , the burden of proof must lie on those being calumnied rather than those expressing fact - free generalizations .
It is true that for much of human history - with many many exceptions in the ancient world - masculinity has been conflated with heterosexuality .
But that 's because the gay men have been rendered so invisible and so oppressed that the counter - evidence has never been fully revealed - except in small circumstances and with individuals on the battlefield .
But now we do know better - and the next generation of civilized men and civilized intelligent warriors understand this .
Giving individuals a chance to prove their mettle as openly gay , and giving straight soldiers a chance to demonstrate that they care more about their duty than prejudice , is so obviously the right thing to do only bigots resist it at this point .
And , in case Bowman thinks I am somehow denigrating sissies , let me point out to this bigot that he might want to avoid a fight with a sissy , because many of them could take his sorry ass to the cleaners , and because many more , over the centuries , have fought and died for their country and are more men than he , from his armchair , will ever be .
And , of course , part of the reason for forcing gay soldiers into the closet and holding persecution over their heads is precisely to conceal the plain truth that these stereotypes are false .
I remind Bowman that the first soldier to lose a limb in the Iraq war was a gay man .
That he risked all for his country , that he showed immense valor , should make him a hero to his country and to his commander - in - chief .
And what did they do to him ?
They fired him .
Get angrier .

Hard decisions are in store for state and local governments in Utah as Government budgets worse than anticipated .
The state 's bleak finances appear to be even worse than previously thought .
The revenue figures for the last three months show the economy is hammering government budgets .
Bob Springmeyer is the president of Bonneville Research .
He has been doing economic analysis and planning for local government since 1976 .
When he saw the quarterly tax revenue numbers for the first three months -- July through September of this fiscal year -- he was stunned .
He said , " This is the first time I 've seen this kind of dramatic drop across the board . "
No one expected good news , but the real numbers were worse than projected .
Taxes in numerous broad categories , for both state and local governments , were down .
Springmeyer said , " I think we 're going to have a budget bloodbath this next legislative session . "
Overall , revenues fell 16 percent , totaling $ 275 million .
Sales and use taxes , which fund general government and higher education , slumped 23 percent , nearly $ 100 million .
Income taxes , which pay for public schools , slid downward $ 40 million .
Taxes on corporations , the franchise tax , were in free fall , plummeting 73 percent .
He said , " That 's one that I think is probably the most scary .
That means that businesses are way down , that means employment is going to be down . "
It was the same story for local governments .
Revenues from public transit , for instance , dipped $ 11 million .
The transient room tax , which supports the Salt Palace and Convention and Visitors Bureau , was off 25 percent .
" Local governments and state government are going to have to make some really hard decisions , " he said .
" Are we going to raise taxes , or are we going to cut services ?
Salt Lake County 's mayor is now asking for a $ 13.4 million property tax increase , despite nixing a similar proposal from the county council months ago .
Peter Corroon said the county simply can't cut anymore after trimming jobs , wages , 401 ( k ) contributions , open days at county outdoor pools and Sundays at 10 county recreation centers .
" At some point you have to say there are things we wo n't sacrifice , " Corroon told KSL Newsradio in an interview Wednesday .
" I said I wo n't sacrifice public safety and I wo n't sacrifice programs for our seniors and our children , so that 's where we drew the line . "
In prepared remarks to the county council on the budget , Corroon said Salt lake County is now " in the eye of the storm " when it comes to the economic downturn .
The 2009 county budget was $ 801 million .
The proposed 2010 budget stands at $ 638 million .
Corroon said he did not believe the county can cut any further " without harming the essential services " the county has to provide .
Nearly four months ago , Corroon said no to a $ 5 million tax " shift " proposed by the county council .
Corroon says this is also considered a tax " shift " -- switching revenue sources from declining sales tax revenues to a property tax increase voters have already approved .
Checking the “ female ” box when buying health insurance is likely to cost extra — perhaps up to 50 percent more than a man would pay for the same coverage .
Gender - rating — or what some term as flat - out sexual discrimination — is linked to the simple fact that women , particularly those under age 50 or so , go to the doctor more often than men .
But outrage over how women are treated in the individual health insurance market is mounting as stories emerge of companies refusing to cover maternity benefits and denying coverage because of past domestic violence or cesarean sections , including a Colorado woman who was told she would have to get sterilized to qualify for insurance .
Federal proposals , as well as pending state legislation , would ban gender - rating and require maternity coverage , even as the insurance industry warns that lowering premiums for younger women could mean higher premiums for most everyone else .
Colorado women age 40 and under shopping for health insurance in the individual market , not through an employer , pay from 10 percent to 59 percent more than men , according to analysis by the National Women ’s Law Center .
They pay more even when maternity coverage is not included .
And in many cases , a female nonsmoker pays more for health coverage than a man who smokes .
“ Women should not be penalized because their plumbing works differently and needs ongoing maintenance , ” Colorado Insurance Commissioner Marcy Morrison told a state health care task force .
As a state lawmaker , Morrison fought insurance companies to stop “ drive - through deliveries ” so women could stay in the hospital longer after childbirth .
She said gender - rating is discrimination tied to decades - old salary disparity , particularly in female - dominated professions such as nursing and teaching .
And she is skeptical of insurance company claims that “ the sky is going to fall ” and premiums would rise if gender - rating were outlawed .
America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the industry ’s national association , proposed ending gender - rating and the practice of rejecting customers based on pre-existing conditions .
In exchange , insurance companies want powerful legislation that would compel everyone to buy insurance .
Discrimination against women in the insurance market goes far beyond premium rates , reform advocates said .
Sterilization suggested
Take , for example , Centennial resident Peggy Robertson , who was denied insurance by Golden Rule Insurance Co. because she delivered her second child by cesarean section in 2006 .
Maternity benefits were n’t even part of the package .
Robertson , whose husband is a self - employed chiropractor , contacted the International Cesarean Awareness Network and filed a complaint with the state Division of Insurance , arguing the denial was unfair and that the company had asked her offensive questions during the application process .
Later , she received a letter from Golden Rule telling her the company would consider covering her if “ some form of sterilization has occurred since the caesarean - section delivery . ”
“ It was just really horrific and terribly insulting , ” said Robertson , a stay - at - home mom of two boys .
“ You felt like you were a herd of cattle or something . ”
Robertson ’s recent testimony before the U.S. Senate health committee in part prompted Sen. Michael Bennet , D - Colo. , to write a letter to Senate leaders adding his voice to the call for reform to ban gender - rating and other “ harmful insurance industry practices . ”
Since denying Robertson , Golden Rule , an Indianapolis - based division of United Healthcare , now covers women who have had cesarean sections but only with increased premiums to cover the risk of a future cesarean birth or with exclusionary riders — clauses that deny coverage for cesareans for a certain number of years or forever .
“ This helps us extend coverage to more people while keeping premiums lower for all of our customers , ” said Ellen Laden , public relations director for Golden Rule .
“ The real issue is how to deal broadly with providing access to health care for everyone while still keeping health insurance from being cost- prohibitive . ”
Bennet and others , including the National Women ’s Law Center , are calling for an end to coverage denials based on pre-existing conditions such as pregnancy and surviving domestic violence or sexual assault — a problem revealed in a recent report from the law center .
Lack of maternity benefits
Another common frustration among women who buy insurance individually — and there are 125,000 such women in Colorado — is that maternity benefits are almost nonexistent .
Suzanne Pariser , a Denver lawyer and mother of 2 - year - old Willa , is putting off expanding her family because she cannot find an affordable insurance plan that includes maternity coverage .
“ That ’s the main reason we ’re not having a baby right now , ” she said .
“ We definitely want to have another child . ”
Pariser is annoyed that insurance company executives , in essence , are determining her family planning .
“ My anger is mostly that insurance companies view having a baby as a medical complication that costs them money , ” she said .
“ They view it as a disease . ”
The only plan she could find that offered maternity coverage was more expensive in the long run than paying out of pocket to have a baby , Pariser figured .
Costs vary by hospital or birthing center , but the average bill for a vaginal birth with no complications is about $ 7,500 and for a cesarean section , $ 13,200 .
The insurance industry in Colorado has not taken an official position on statehouse bills that would ban gender - rating in the individual market and require maternity coverage .
Their stance likely depends on national reform — and in particular , whether federal law will force everyone , even the healthiest people , to buy insurance .
But industry officials point out that higher premiums for women are based on analysis from actuaries , which show women are much more likely to visit the doctor .
The rate at which women visit primary care physicians is more than 50 percent higher than for men , according to the New America Foundation .
By about age 50 or 55 , men typically begin using health services more than women , and premiums for older men are typically more expensive than those for older women , said Ben Price , executive director of the Colorado Association of Health Plans .
“ The insurance industry is engaged in its own internal discussion on this issue , and health plans here in Colorado are of course taking a fresh look at gender - rating and many other issues that have been raised as a part of the debate both in Washington and here in Colorado , ” he said .
Officials with Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado have “ strong reservations ” about eliminating gender - rating and requiring maternity coverage .
The practice is rampant in the auto insurance industry , they argue .
“ The most expensive purchase in auto ( insurance ) is the young , invincible male ; they are the risk - takers , ” said Rebecca Weiss , director of government affairs .
“ For some reason , auto insurance does n’t seem as inflammatory to people as health insurance .
“ Should n’t health insurance premiums be based on some degree on how many medical services you receive so that everyone is paying according to what they are using ? ”
“ It would raise prices ”
Insurance companies probably would have to raise prices on other groups to make up the difference if they were forced to lower prices for younger women , said Tom Gosselin , director of small - group underwriting at Anthem .
“ It definitely would raise the prices , is the simple thing , ” he said .
“ You are now charging the 22 - year - old guy who has no concept in the world about having a baby for maternity .
He ’s more likely to choose not to have health insurance at all . ”
Eleven states ban gender - rating in the individual insurance market .
A review by the National Conference of State Legislatures found that those states had not determined whether their bans caused health insurance rates to rise .
In Montana , which outlawed gender - rating in 1983 , some lawmakers want to repeal the ban , arguing fewer insurers are willing to operate in the state because of it .
Colorado is among several states that have banned gender - rating in the small - group insurance market , which in this state applies to businesses with 50 or fewer employees .
For businesses with more than 50 employees , insurance companies can consider age and sex when setting rates — but the risk is spread throughout the company so everyone ’s premiums are equal .
Reform advocates argue the policy adversely affects businesses where the workforce is predominantly female , such as child - care centers or home health agencies .
Care requires doctor visits
A Denver Post review of online health insurance quotes found that a woman living in the same Denver ZIP code with the same date of birth would pay $ 20 to $ 35 per month — or up to $ 420 more per year — than a man for the same coverage .
The rates reviewed were for basic , high - deductible plans , ranging from $ 71 to $ 158 per month .
NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado is among those fighting for change in the law , arguing that women are typically the responsible sex when it comes to birth control and that those prescriptions often require an annual doctor visit .
“ Under the current health care system , women are penalized for taking responsibility for their own health , ” said Toni Panetta , NARAL ’s political director .
State Rep. Beth McCann , a Denver Democrat sponsoring the bill banning gender - rating , said insurance companies failed to produce “ sufficient factual basis to charge different premiums for women and men . ”
“ It seems as though it ’s somewhat arbitrary , ” she said .
“ It ’s a matter of equality and fairness . ”
If the state legislation passes during the next legislative session , it probably would take effect about two years ahead of national reform .
Mary Saracino , a self - employed writer in Lafayette who has had to purchase insurance on the individual market , said she is shocked “ and , dare I say , angry ” that monthly premiums for women are higher .
“ It seems highly discriminatory , ” said Saracino , 55 .
“ Would consumers put up with that if , say , men had to pay more for tires than women because some statistic says that male drivers are harder on their cars than female drivers ? ”

Crash v. crashed , crash-ing , crash-es
a .
To break violently or noisily ; smash .
b. To undergo sudden damage or destruction on impact .
This happens often in bike racing , often due to one or more of these six reasons :
1. Mechanically induced ( puncture at high speed , snapped chain etc ) .
2. Slippery surface .
3. Contact with other rider in peloton leading to loss of control .
4. Individual rider taking risks and losing control or grip .
5 . Loss of concentration , leading to distraction and loss of control .
6 . Close proximity to anybody going through the above five .
Yesterday , on stage four , the number and scale of the crashes were primarily due to number two , although the origin was almost always a number four .
Unfortunately , number two , by its very nature , would cause number threes and , as a result , lots of number sixes .
The reason number two has such an overbearing presence is easy to understand when one thinks about the basic physics of bicycle road racing .
It involves , on average , 70kg balanced vertically 4 - 5 ft off the ground on roughly three square inches of inflated rubber .
That ’s a lot of stress to put on those three square inches of rubber in dry conditions , and as for the wet ?
Forget about it .
When it's wet avoidance braking , or simply turning , results in loss of grip and control , and inevitably concludes with a crash .
For this reason stage four of this year 's Vuelta was scary .
Coming down into Liège I could barely see anything through the spray and my glasses ( which were now for protection from water rather than light ) , we were ripping it as well , close to 80 km / h .
What ’s is particularly scary is how reliant we are on each other .
There are 200 of us , and yet it takes just one to think he ’s Valentino Rossi ( or maybe more appropriately , Thor Hushovd ) , lose control and cause the chain reaction that can take down dozens of us .
That ’s why it was scary ; I do not implicitly trust my peers in those conditions .
As pro cyclists we trust each other an enormous amount .
After all , it ’s the only reason we can race for so many kilometres together under more - often - that - not extreme circumstances - be they geographical , climatic , physical , or psychological - and not crash more often .
But there are times when that trust is not implicit .
Racing downhill after 200 km at 80 km / h in heavy rain is one of those times .
Fortunately , I think everyone of us feels the same ( scared shitless ) which is what saves us from what could possibly be a horrific crash .
What happened in the final on Tuesday was a horrific crash .
We had made it through almost 230 km of bad conditions and on the entry to Liege I had my escape of the day when guys crashed in front of me , causing the first pile - up .
It started on the left and rippled out across the whole road , somehow , I was lucid enough to hold my line and not turn or brake .
More importantly , I was VERY lucky not to have a body or bike cross my path .
Making it through that offered a moment of euphoria amid the fatigue and discomfort .
It also allowed me to believe maybe we ’d had our mass pile up for the day .
The gift of adrenalin given was very welcome and I was sure that I was going to make it to the finish in one piece .
Tyler and I were on a mission .
We had gone through the finish line on the first circuit and got a good look at the last kilometre .
We had the 19 km lap to negotiate with the gentler side of the Cote Saint Nicholas to be tackled , although this was n’t too complicated as both of us were feeling well in control .
When we got to 9 km to go we found each other .
" Ok Ty ? " I asked .
His reply was so matter of fact it could be nothing but the truth .
" Get me through that last corner first and I ’ll win . "
That was it .
That was all that was said .
We made eye contact and I nodded .
We were so in control considering the conditions and the day we ’d already been through , Svein got to the front with about 6 km to go and lifted the pace to what was for the majority too high to allow them to move up and so making it easier for Ty and me to pick and hold our position .
Our plan was to let Columbia and Quick Step do the lead out , then , in the last kilometre , I would come over the top of them .
So we were sitting near the front , but not right at the sharp end .
We really were picking and choosing what we were doing , lucidity at its best .
Unfortunately it was n’t our own universe .
We were starting to string out into single file as the speed increased and the finish approached , we came under the 3 km banner and entered a big roundabout , not something that should have caused much of a problem , even in the wet , as we were battle hardened to the conditions by this point .
That ’s when the human factor kicked in , I am yet to see any of the footage so I do n’t know what the initial cause was ( I ’m presuming a number four , which led to a number three and because of number two , caused a massive number six ) , but I lived the effect .
The first thing you recognise is the sound .
You almost always hear a crash before you see it .
It ’s a horrible sound because of what it represents .
Shoes being ripped out of pedals , metal dragging , plastic and carbon grinding ; it ’s a cacophony in the truest sense .
There are no human sounds , just man-made materials being bashed against each other and the road .
When it ’s wet you see it coming more so than the dry ( in the dry there ’s a chance you ’ll escape it right up till the last second , not so in the wet ) .
One normally hits the ground before making any contact with anything or anybody simply because even the mildest evasive manoeuvre means a loss of grip and subsequent crash .
This is what happened in Liege , I heard the crash ahead , then I saw a guy about five or six riders in front of me hit the ground independently of what ever the noise had been and then it began .
Every single racer in front of me hit the ground .
You see it coming ; I knew I was going down , as soon as I saw the domino effect commenced I simply waited .
It feels like a long time , but is actually probably no longer than a second .
THUMP .
I ’m on the ground .
Now comes the really horrible bit .
I ’m sliding in the middle of the cacophony and I know there ’s a concrete barrier that I ’m going to hit at speed .
The impact of this is not a concern , rather it's what ’s going to be hitting me from behind is what I ’m scared of .
There ’s no pain , just fear .
So as I ’m sliding I try to curl up and am very conscious of closing my eyes tightly .
Then BANG !
Followed by silence .
Everything has stopped and nothing really bad has happened .
This is when it starts to hurt , nothing in particular just everything is sending out alert signals .
The only way it ’s possible to trace most of the injuries at that moment is checking where my kit is ripped up .
All I want to do is lay on the ground , but I have a feeling there are some properly hurt guys around me , so I get up and sit on the concrete barrier to show I ’m relatively unscathed .
Sitting there , looking around I realise the scale of the crash and notice there are a few guys not getting up .
Ty , who was on my wheel at the time , is on the ground behind me , to my relief he ’s okay as well .
Less than 10 seconds before we ’d been at max heart rates , adrenalin filled , fully in the zone preparing to take ourselves to our maximum .
It ’s amazing how much can change in a handful of seconds .
If ever there is a moment of being dazed and confused , that ’s it …

July 10 , 2009 --
Most of the coverage of the military coup in Honduras from bourgeois and liberal circles , and from many Western foreign ministers , has focused on what various governments are doing to influence or force an outcome to this struggle .
Statements from Honduras ' President Manuel Zelaya , his foreign minister Patricia Rodas , and from leaders of other ALBA countries ( especially Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez , Nicaragua 's Daniel Ortega , Ecuador 's Rafael Correa and Bolivia 's Evo Morales ) have emphasised the role of the mass movement in Honduras .
So have the most astute analysts of the rapidly moving events unleashed by the coup .
The great fear , from the point of view of imperialism and of the oligarchic ruling classes in Latin America , is that Zelaya will become embedded and tied to the mass movement and its class interests , unleashing a ``Bolivarian '' upsurge from which they will never recover .
That is the objective and subjective source of their demonisation campaign against Chavez , Morales , Ortega and Cuba .
But the US and Latin American ruling classes ' great fear can only be our great aspiration -- to unite the mass resistance in Honduras and across the region into an unbeatable force , and to use the attack on the Honduran people 's elected government by the military ``gorillas '' to score major advances towards popular , democratic rule in Honduras .
To move beyond formal , restrictive " representational " democracy ( where we get to vote every five years or so about how long the slave drivers ' whips should be ) to participatory democracy that takes us out of servitude and towards real self - government and self - determination .
The popular resistance to the coup has formed a resistence front , whose key demand has been the immediate restitution of the government of Manuel Zelaya , and the restoration of democratic and constitutional rights and guarantees .
Zelaya is now in Costa Rica for the talks with President Oscar Arias has arranged , under pressure from US President Barack Obama and US secretary of state Hilary Clinton .
He arrived with a delegation that included government ministers and leaders of Honduras ' social and trade union movements that are part of the Resistance Front .
Coup leader Roberto Micheletti , ( known popularly as Pinocheletti and Goriletti ) is also in Costa Rica .
At the time of posting this material , we are still waiting for an official announcement of what was discussed and decided .
Talks at various levels , it is reported , will continue tomorrow and possibly over the weekend .
Zelaya has said that one thing he is not discussing with Arias ( or Pinocheletti ) is the worldwide demand for his immediate return to govern as president of the country .
Or for the immediate release of many political prisoners detained during and after the coup .
Below is a July 6 statement made by the Frente Nacional Contra el Golpe de Estado ( National Front Against the Coup d'etat ) .
The National Front has since issued a statement addressed to the current " talks " in San Jose .
Its key proposal is for the convoking of a constituent assembly to resolve the crisis in favour of genuine democracy and the right of working people , Indigenous people and oppressed sectors to participate in day - to - day government and national development decisions .
Also below are items from Via Campesina , the main farmers ' and producers ' association , which is part of an international network of campesinos and farmers .
Included also is the most recent interview with Rafael Alegria , on of the key leaders of Via Campesina .

9th communiqué of the National Front Against the Coup d'etat
The National Front Against the Coup d'etat in Honduras , made up of the different organised expressions in the country , on our feet in the struggle until the reinstatement of the constitutional order , communicates :
We reiterate that the coup d'etat was conceived by the oligarchy and executed by the armed forces in collusion with the Supreme Court of Justice , the National Congress , the public ministry , the Human Rights Commission , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , the Liberal , Nationalist Innovation , Social Democratic Unity and Christian Democratic parties , and the Catholic and evangelical churches .
We demand that the meetings planned between President Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti Bain take into account the position of the National Front Against the Coup d'etat , which includes as a main point the installation of a National Constitutional Assembly .
We demand pubishment for those responsible for the death of our fallen comrades and the repression of the mobilisations and locations of the popular movement .
We reject the possibility of the legitimation of the de facto authorities and reaffirm that the only acceptable solution is the return of the institutional order .
We make known the naming of a commission that represents the National Front Against the Coup d'etat to participate in the meetings in San José , Costa Rica .
We continue to demand the restitution of individual guarantees immediately , as the suspension is a clear violation of people 's human rights .
Statement of the National Front Against the Coup d'etat in Honduras
July 6 , 2009 -- The National Front Against the Coup d'etat ( Frente Nacional Contra el Golpe de Estado ) , composed of the different movements organised in Honduras , considering the situation created by the coup d'etat , aims to inform the rest of the population about the actions undertaken .
And , at the same time , it would get a reading of this whole process in accordance with the principles governing the people 's movement to transform the Honduran society into a more influential , non-discriminatory one , in solidarity and welfare approached with the country 's majorities .
In this sense , we want to state that :
We make Mr Micheletti , and the rest of the coup group , responsible of the police and military force 's actions that ended with Isis Obed Murillo 's death , a sixteen - year - old young man , and with the injuring and beating up of many others .
Amongst the injured are Darwin Antonio Lagos , another young lad , and Judge Guillermo Lopez , last evening .
The National Front Against the Coup d'etat wants to transmit its condolences , respect and solidarity with the family of the murdered young man and with the wounded persons .
This youngster was from a family from the Olancho Department , who were not an activist of any people 's organisation .
They simply were people struggling for a welfare state .
The coup government , and its followers , are lost .
So much so they have resorted to the heads of churches and the police for support and protection .
For the people 's movement it is clear that the religious hierarchies have always sided with the oligarchic groups , and for this reason repudiates the attitude of the pseudo - representatives of the different churches .
That we condemn the terrorist attitude of the authorities imposed by Mr Micheletti and the coup state , who represses with guns the different forms of demonstrations of the citizens .
Police roadblocks and soldiers everywhere are used for with this aim , especially in the public roads where the army searches , with rifles , all vehicles .
The Honduran people thank the comprehension and solidarity received from the Latin American governments , the Organization of the American States and the whole international community , and for the forcefulness and objectivity which the ... coup d'etat suffered by Hondurans has been dealt with and recognised .
We denounce in front of the Honduran people and in front of the international community , that a section of the overnment of the United States of America , such as the military industry and the intelligence agency , is supporting the coup in Honduras .
We believe it is important to recognise this fact
The rally on July 5 in Tegucigalpa was enormous .
About 300,000 people took part in it , and it is important to recognise the discipline and fighting spirit that allowed them to remain in place regardless of the strength of the military repression .
Furthermore , we want to call every woman and man to struggle for their rights .

July 5 , 2009 --
The social movements of Honduras , ready to fight to reestablish constitutional order in the country , demand the reinstatement of President Manuel Zelaya .
Popular and social movements agreed to meet in Tegucigalpa at 8 am .
There , thousands of people from the different social movements that exist in the country , wearing red and black shirts , hats , caps and neckerchiefs and holding up banners , posters and flags , continue to protest on the streets of Honduras demanding the reinstatement of President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales , who has been expelled from power since the early hours of June 28 , by power groups in the country with the involvement of the army , the police and other state powers who undertook the coup d'etat in Honduras .
The protesters have demonstated their decision to keep fighting and do all that is necessary to suceed in establishing constitutional order in the country .
At the same time , a group of people , who claim to defend democracy and want peace in the country , but who in reality are [ coup leader Roberto ]
Micheletti's followers , protested in front of the governmental buildings but these people were highly protected by army elements and the national police .
The media were broadcasting their protest live although actually these people had to be brought in from the centre of country and were paid to take part in the protest .
However , the people from the social movements are making a lot of sacrifices to continue in this struggle and each person is paying their own expenses .
The slogans that the social movements shout when passing the authorities and media buildings are the following : no somos cinco , no somos cien prensa vendida cuantalos bien ( There 's not five of us , there 's not one hundred of us , the sell - out press should count us properly ) ; traidores ( traitors ) ; golpistas , golpistas fuera de Honduras ( Coup supporters get out of Honduras ) ; traidores a la patria el pueblo los repudia , pueblo que escuchas Ãºnete a la lucha ( Traitors to our country , the people condemn you , you can hear the people , unite in the struggle ) amongst others .
Juan Barahona leader of the Popular Bloc in Honduras states : `` The popular resistence against the coup d'etat will continue until whenever necessary .
Today we have undertaken constant protests for six days now and at the moment we are meeting in front of the teaching university in order to move on towards the centre of Tegucigalpa city , then we 'll head towards the headquarters of the Organisation of American States where social and popular leaders will have a meeting with the secretary of this organisation Miguel Insulsa at 3 pm .
In the meantime , our other supporters will remain outside the OAS buildings to show their backing of the organisation 's decision .
We will take a letter signed by all social movement representatives that we will hand to Mr Insulsa where we clearly demonstrate our support for President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales and state that we our grateful for the solidarity that the country has shown towards us .
In addition , we call for the reinstatement of our President Zelaya . ''
The social movement representatives state that this action will continue for the whole day across the whole country and that inicially this was just in Tegucigalpa , but as time has gone by this has spread to other departments in the country such as El Paraso , Choluteca , Cortes , Olancho , Yoro etc. and will continue until constitutional order in Honduras is restored .
Today we 've heard from San Pedro Sula that eight of our members who had been seized yesterday while they were protesting were released during the night .
Testimony of Wendy Cruz of the Honduran Peasant Movement , July 5 , 2009
Sisters and brothers of the World ,
I write this testimony , with my eyes full of tears and a sadden heart after an intensive day of struggle with my sisters and brothers of Honduras .
I am a woman from a humble family .
I am a peasant .
I have gained my militancy and class consciousness along with the peasants who work every day under the hot sun , and who see no future for their sons and daughters who have to migrate to other countries seeking better living conditions because in our country , Honduras , the bipartisan political system ( Liberals and Nationalists have shared the power for more than 100 years ) neglects the majority who live in extreme poverty , without access to health , to a dignified home , without access to a piece of land because the national oligarchy owns the whole country and has pushed 90 per cent of the population into extreme poverty and social exclusion .
Today , Sunday , July 5 , we have completed eight days of peaceful resistance .
Today we marched , more than 500,000 persons in the city of Tegucigalpa , towards the airport of Tonconto­n , with the expectation of welcoming president Manuel Zelaya Rosales .
While we where waiting the arrival of our president , the army started to shoot us with tear gas and real bullets .
Three Hondurans were killed only because they were demanding peace and the right to live in a country with real civic participation , and not the false democracy we have been living for 100 years .
The dead persons included 21 - years - old , Isis Oveth , from the village of Alde de Santa Cruz , Guayape , municipality of Olancho and another young man , Alexis Zavala is among the many persons who were badly injured by the army 's repression .
After the violent attack I was afraid of being arrested by the police because we have a curfew and by the time we escaped the repression it was already night , past the curfew hours .
But despite the repression , my spirit is stronger , because I have the dream that one day my son ( 15 years old ) and my daughter ( 10 years old ) and all the future generations will enjoy a country with equality , equity and more than that , a day when all of us will be the actors of our destiny .
I like to tell all the men and women of the world who have expressed solidarity with our struggle , that all of us in Honduras are decided to achieve VICTORY and to restore the legitimate government of our president Manuel Zelaya in the memory of the martyrs of this Sunday , July 5 , 2009 .
Long live the martyrs for the defense of our rights to be actors of our own destiny !
Long live ISIS OVETH and all the brothers killed today !
WE ARE HONDURAN PEOPLE AND WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN PEACE IN A TRUE DEMOCRACY !
GLOBALISE THE STRUGGLE , GLOBALIZE HOPE !
THANKS TO THE WORLD FOR THEIR GREAT SOLIDARITY .
THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES BECAUSE AS EMILIANO ZAPATA SAID : ``IT'S BETTER TO DIE IN YOUR FEET THAN TO LIVE IN YOUR KNEES FOREVER !''
Interview with Honduran agrarian leader Rafael Alegria :
`We are preparing a massive reception for Zelaya '
Honduras , June 30 2009 .- Exclusive interview with Rafael Alegria , leader of the National Field Worker 's Center ( CNTC by its Spanish initials ) , founder member of the Democratic Union and the farmers ' organisation VÃia Campesina ; adviser to President Zelaya on agrarian issues .
Comrade , President Zelaya announced today that he will return to Honduras on Thursday ( July 5 ) , are you preparing anything in response ?
We are preparing to give President Zelaya a massive reception , the Honduran people are preparing for it and without a doubt we hope that Zelaya will take control of the state and the government as the legitimate president .
This will enable us to bring an end to the efforts we are making , and the confrontation and mobilisations can give way to peace and tranquility and to continue to govern for the good of the majority , trying to reorder the democratic state that we hope for in Honduras .
Today we witnessed violent situations in the areas around the presidential residence , do you have any information about this ?
In terms of the violence around the Presidential Palace , we saw how a peaceful march that brought more than 25,000 people together , met with tremendous repression from the police and the army of Honduras with teargas containing extremely toxic substances , that were fired from helicopters and special guns .
The people resisted but the gas has seriously affected the health of our people , and , according to a statement from the Red Cross in Honduras , more than 50 people were injured .
What is the current situation with the curfew ?
Social movement leaders are being constantly threatened , because we categorically reject Roberto Micheletti as president .
With regard to the curfew , almost no one has respected it in the country , more than 2000 people have stayed in the streets , day and night , in front of the presidential palace .
Today they said that they curfew will start at 6 pm , but nobody complied with it , and we are still here , resisting .
I would like to denounce that this evening the police attacked eight buses that were under the coordination of Father Camayo .
The tyres were destroyed by gunshots .
The repression is terrible and we fiercely reject it .
There has been unanimous support from countries in the hemisphere in support of President Zelaya 's constitutional government , the countries of the ALBA have withdrawn their ambassadors and have announced economic sanctions and the isolation of the de facto regime .
How do the social movements view this ?
We have been very aware of the international actions , deliberations and agreements , and this support gives us infinite pleasure , particularly the actions of the ALBA , that have been followed by the Rio Group and the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , including the declaration from the President of the United States Barack Obama .
These actions reflect a general consensus in the Americas and also in the European Union to rejects the coup and recognise and support Mr Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales as the only president elected by the Honduran people .
All these actions have helped to keep morale up and maintain the resistance that is taking place throughout the entire country .
There has been fierce repression , but this has not demoralised the masses [ in its attempts to depose ]
Micheletti's fascist regime and return President Zelaya to power .
There has also been news of military risings .
Do you know anything about this ?
The comrades responsible for taking the Tela Road said that the soldiers were encouraging people to keep up their peaceful occupation and saying that they would not repress the people because they were opposed to the coup d'etat .
This gives us faith in those in charge of the Atlantic region and there are rumours that the military base in Olancho may follow the same instructions .
We also believe that there are soldiers who do not support the decision of the Joint Chief of Staff .
This coup d'etat is promoted by retired military men who come from a past where they were involved in the violation of human rights in the 1980s .
Anything more to add ?
I would like to call on the whole world , from Honduras , and ask them to maintain their solidarity together with our people and with the Zelaya government , as there is no doubt that the international support for defending our rights gives us hope that we will soon recover our government .

At a town hall protest in San Diego over the weekend a town hall protester tried to say that healthcare reform is unconstitutional , but it did n’t quite come out that way .
He said , “ I got a book here called the U.S.S. Constitution . ”
Ahoy , matey , the U.S.S.
Constitution may not give the government authority to reform healthcare , but the U.S. Constitution does .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
The U.S.S. Constitution scholar said , “ Everybody ’s seen this before .
And you know what ?
I ’ve this book three times now , and I ’ve referenced it dozens of times and I can’t find one little paragraph in here that says the government has the right to take over our health care . ”

Look , this is the Sarah Palin / Michele Bachmann rule .
If you are going to quote talking points in front of a television camera , you better get them right or else you are going to look like a moron .
Other protests said that God will take care of healthcare , and Obama ’s church was based on racism .
One guy was babbling about toilet paper in Cuba .
This was a total fringe freak show .
I do n’t know why any politician is worried about these protesters .
The vast majority of them have no clue what they are protesting .
What they have in common is that they are old , white , and angry about the election of Barack Obama .
These people may have read the Constitution , but I doubt that they actually know what is in it .
The federal government has the legal authority to reform healthcare , and that is what they are going to do .
I wonder what is going to happen to these angry people after healthcare passes .
Are they going lock themselves in their houses and commiserate with the warm television glow of Glenn Beck , or will they attach to another fringe cause ?
North Carolina State University engineers have created a new material that would allow a fingernail - size computer chip to store the equivalent of 20 high - definition DVDs or 250 million pages of text , far exceeding the storage capacities of today 's computer memory systems .
Led by Dr. Jagdish " Jay " Narayan , John C.C. Fan Family Distinguished Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and director of the National Science Foundation Center for Advanced Materials and Smart Structures at NC State , the engineers made their breakthrough using the process of selective doping , in which an impurity is added to a material that changes its properties .
The process also shows promise for boosting vehicles ' fuel economy and reducing heat produced by semiconductors , a potentially important development for more efficient energy production .
Working at the nanometer level -- a pinhead has a diameter of 1 million nanometers -- the engineers added metal nickel to magnesium oxide , a ceramic .
The resulting material contained clusters of nickel atoms no bigger than 10 square nanometers , a 90 percent size reduction compared to today 's techniques and an advancement that could boost computer storage capacity .
" Instead of making a chip that stores 20 gigabytes , you have one that can handle one terabyte , or 50 times more data , " Narayan says .
Information storage is not the only area where advances could be made .
By introducing metallic properties into ceramics , Narayan says engineers could develop a new generation of ceramic engines able to withstand twice the temperatures of normal engines and achieve fuel economy of 80 miles per gallon .
And since the thermal conductivity of the material would be improved , the technique could also have applications in harnessing alternative energy sources like solar energy .
The engineers ' discovery also advances knowledge in the emerging field of " spintronics , " which is dedicated to harnessing energy produced by the spinning of electrons .
Most energy used today is harnessed through the movement of current and is limited by the amount of heat that it produces , but the energy created by the spinning of electrons produces no heat .
The NC State engineers were able to manipulate the nanomaterial so the electrons ' spin within the material could be controlled , which could prove valuable to harnessing the electrons ' energy .
The finding could be important for engineers working to produce more efficient semiconductors .

Working with Narayan on the study were Dr. Sudhakar Nori , a research associate at NC State , Shankar Ramachandran , a former NC State graduate student , and J.T. Prater , an adjunct professor of materials science and engineering .
Their findings are published as " The Synthesis and Magnetic Properties of a Nanostructured Ni-MgO System , " which appeared in the June edition of JOM , the journal of the Minerals , Metals and Materials Society .
The research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation .
Wow .
Maybe he was inspired by his earlier session with Max Blumenthal .
Or maybe it was the way Glenn Beck dissed Mika by telling her to " shut the hell up . "
Or maybe he 's just as sick of Glenn Beck as the rest of us are .
Whatever it was , Joe Scarborough was relentless and on - point this morning in attacking not just Glenn Beck , but the conservatives who condone and empower him .
He took his cue from Peter Wehner 's piece in Commentary , " Glenn Beck : Harmful to the Conservative Movement " :
I understand that a political movement is a mansion with many rooms ; the people who occupy them are involved in intellectual and policy work , in politics , and in polemics .
Different people take on different roles .
And certainly some of the things Beck has done on his program are fine and appropriate .
But the role Glenn Beck is playing is harmful in its totality .
My hunch is that he is a comet blazing across the media sky right now — and will soon flame out .
Whether he does or not , he is n’t the face or disposition that should represent modern - day conservatism .
At a time when we should aim for intellectual depth , for tough - minded and reasoned arguments , for good cheer and calm purpose , rather than erratic behavior , he is not the kind of figure conservatives should embrace or cheer on .
Scarborough was even more damning :
Scarborough :
But when you preach this kind of hatred , and say that an African American president hates all white people -- stay with me -- hates all white people , you are playing with fire .
And bad things can happen .
And if they do happen , not only is Glenn Beck responsible , but conservatives who do n't -- call -- him -- out -- are responsible .
Incidentally , Mark Levin was just as harsh in knocking down Beck .
This is certainly a good start for conservatives serious about rescuing their movement from the abyss into which it is descending .
But again , as with David Brooks , none of them quite grasp the dimensions of what they 're up against .
Sure , the things Glenn Beck says are completely nuts and reflect poorly on the American Right generally .
That 's probably because Beck is in reality a genuine far - right extremist who is gradually coming out of the closet about that -- and as he does , he 's lapping up the ratings .
But Beck is far from the only extremist dragging movement conservatism to the right .
The bridges between the far right and mainstream conservatives are so numerous and widely trafficked that it's hard to keep up , but they range from the extreme religious right connections that Blumenthal describes in his new book in detail , to the " Patriot " wingnut right like WorldNetDaily , which has multiple ties to the Republican National Committee .
And yes , ordinary conservatives do have reason to be concerned .
This is especially the case when it comes to the Tea Parties , which actually reflect the takeover of movement conservatism by right - wing populists .
They have become a fundamentally important nexus for the promotion of extremist beliefs and fringe conspiracy theories .
Because that 's what Joe Scarborough is up against .
Glenn Beck is just the face .
There 's a much larger beast lurking there alongside him .
US Airways Capt .
Chesley " Sully " Sullenberger has flown thousands of flights in the last 42 years .
" But now , " he says , " my entire career is being judged by how I performed on one of them . "
That flight , of course , came last Jan. 15 , when his Airbus A320 suffered a bird strike en route from New York to Charlotte , N.C. , and lost both engines .
Sully and First Officer Jeff Skiles executed an emergency landing later dubbed " The Miracle on the Hudson , " but that description never felt right to Sully .
In January , Capt .
Chesley Sullenberger successfully landed US Airways flight 1549 into the Hudson River after it collided with birds , causing both engines to fail .
He discusses how the event has offered a message of hope to many .
He is a precise , methodical , cerebral man who carefully chooses his words .
In recent months , while working on his new book , " Highest Duty : My Search for What Really Matters , " Sully spent a great deal of time reviewing his life and career .
He has tried to understand what experiences from his past prepared him for Flight 1549 .
As Sully 's co-author , I clearly saw that it was n't only his skills as a veteran pilot that carried him in those tense moments over Manhattan .
It was also his upbringing , his family bonds , his sense of integrity — and his own losses .
Flight 1549 was n't just a five - minute journey from LaGuardia Airport to the Hudson .
Sully 's entire life led him to safely to that river .
He was born in Denison , Texas , the son of a dentist and a teacher who had high expectations .
" I grew up in a home where each of us had our own hammer , " says Sully .
That was because his dad kept enlarging the family home with the help of three not - always - willing assistants :
Sully , his sister and his mom .
" The goal was to do everything ourselves , to learn what we did n't know and then have at it , " Sully says .
The house was n't perfect , but Sully knew where every nail was .
" Sometimes I 'd brood , wishing we lived in a professionally built house like everyone else , " he says .
" But each time the house grew , I felt a sense of accomplishment . "

Captain Chesley Sullenberger
As a boy , Sully was a classic introvert who felt things deeply .
In 1964 , for instance , he saw news reports about a New York woman named Kitty Genovese .
Her neighbors heard her screams as she was being stabbed to death by a stranger outside her apartment .
Allegedly , they did nothing to help .
" I made a pledge to myself , right then at age 13 , " Sully recalls , " that if I was ever in a situation where someone such as Kitty Genovese needed my help , I would choose to act .
No one in danger would be abandoned .
As they 'd say in the Navy : ' Not on my watch . ' "
People tell Sully that his success on Jan. 15 showed a high regard for life .
Their words led him to reflection .
" Quite frankly , " he says , " one of the reasons I think I 've placed such a high value on life is that my father took his . "
Suffering from depression , Sully 's father killed himself in 1995 .
" His death had an effect on how I view the world , " he says .
" I am willing to work hard to protect people 's lives , to not be a bystander , in part because I could n't save my father . "
There are other moments in Sully 's personal life that he feels helped prepare him for Flight 1549 .
Sully and his wife struggled with infertility , then endured the arduous journey of trying to become adoptive parents .
" The challenges Lorrie and I faced made me better able to accept the cards I 've been dealt , " Sully says , " and to play them with all the resources at my disposal . "
The couple eventually adopted two daughters , now ages 16 and 14 .
He first yearned to fly at age five .
At 16 , in 1967 , he began taking lessons from a no - nonsense crop-dusting pilot named L.T. Cook Jr .
Sully was an earnest , hard - working student who paid close attention .
One day he noticed a crumpled Piper Tri-Pacer at the end of Mr. Cook 's grass airstrip .
A friend of Mr. Cook 's had tried to land the plane and did n't realize that power lines stretched across a nearby highway .
The plane slammed into the ground nose first .
The pilot died instantly .
Sully peered into the blood - splattered cockpit .
" I figured his head must have hit the control panel with great violence , " he says .
" I tried to visualize how it happened — his effort to avoid the power lines , his loss of speed , the awful impact .
I forced myself to look into the cockpit , to study it .
It would have been easier to look away , but I did n't . "
Chesley Sullenberger , about to board his first flight in a military jet .

That sobering moment taught Sully to be vigilant and alert .
For a pilot , one simple mistake could mean death .
He went on to the U.S. Air Force Academy , then a military career , and continued to study accidents .
Twelve fellow military pilots died on training runs .
" I grieved for my lost comrades , " he says , " but I tried to learn all I could about each of their accidents . "
As an airline pilot , he helped develop an air - safety course and served as an investigator at crash sites .
He 'd page through transcripts from cockpit voice recorders , with the last exchanges of pilots who did n't survive .
Since childhood , Sully has been fascinated by Charles Lindbergh .
In " We , " Lindbergh 's 1927 book , he explained that his success was due almost entirely to preparation , not luck .
" Prepared Lindy " would n't have had the same magic as his nickname " Lucky Lindy , " but his views resonated with Sully .
One aspect of preparing well is having the right mindset , he says .
" In so many areas of life , you need to be a long - term optimist but a short - term realist .
That 's especially true given the inherent dangers in aviation .
You can't be a wishful thinker .
You have to know what you know and do n't know , and what your airplane can and can't do in every situation . "
Sully has always kept in mind the air - crew ejection study he learned about in his military days .
Many pilots waited too long before ejecting from planes that were about to crash .
They either ejected at too low an altitude , hitting the ground before their parachutes could open , or they went down with their planes .
Why did these pilots spend extra seconds trying to fix the unfixable ?
The answer is that many feared retribution if they lost million - dollar jets .
And so they remained determined to try to save their airplanes .
Sully says he has never shaken his memories of fellow Air Force pilots who did n't survive such attempts .
Having those details in the recesses of his brain was helpful as he made quick decisions on Flight 1549 .
" As soon as the birds struck , " he says , " I could have tried to return to LaGuardia so as not to ruin a US Airways aircraft .
I could have worried that my decision to ditch the plane would be questioned by superiors or investigators .
But I chose not to . "
Sully values the concept of " goal sacrificing . "
When it 's no longer possible to complete all your goals , you sacrifice lower - priority goals .
He instinctively knew that goal - sacrificing was paramount on Flight 1549 .
" By attempting a water landing , " he says , " I would sacrifice the ' airplane goal '— trying not to destroy an aircraft valued at $ 60 million — for the goal of saving lives . "
Able to compartmentalize his thinking , even in those dire moments over the Hudson , Sully says his family did not come into his head .
" That was for the best .
It was vital that I be focused ; that I allow myself no distractions .
My consciousness existed solely to control the flight path . "
Since saving 155 lives that day , Sully has received thousands of emails and now has 635,000 Facebook fans .
His actions touched people so deeply that they felt compelled to reach out and share their own seminal experiences with him .

" I am now the public face of an unexpectedly uplifting moment , " Sully says , and he accepts that .
Still , he 's not comfortable with the " hero " mantle .
A hero runs into a burning building , he says .
" Flight 1549 was different because it was thrust upon me and my crew .
We turned to our training , we made good decisions , we did n't give up , we valued every life on that plane — and we had a good outcome .
I do n't know that ' heroic ' describes that .
It 's more that we had a philosophy of life , and we applied it to the things we did that day . "
Sully has heard from people who say preparation and diligence are not the same as heroism .
He agrees .
One letter that was particularly touching to Sully came from Paul Kellen of Medford , Mass .
" I see a hero as electing to enter a dangerous situation for a higher purpose , " he wrote , " and you were not given a choice .
That is not to say you are not a man of virtue , but I see your virtue arising from your choices at other times .
It 's clear that many choices in your life prepared you for that moment when your engines failed .
" There are people among us who are ethical , responsible and diligent .
I hope your story encourages those who toil in obscurity to know that their reward is simple — they will be ready if the test comes .
I hope your story encourages others to imitation . "
Sully now sees lessons for the rest of us .
" We need to try to do the right thing every time , to perform at our best , " he says , " because we never know what moment in our lives we 'll be judged on . "
He always had a sense of this .
Now he knows it for sure .

Gordon Brown made clear yesterday he would continue as Prime Minister despite being told his eyesight could be affected by a new medical condition .
Mr Brown , who is blind in his left eye after a teenage rugby injury , attended Moorfields Eye Hospital in central London on Friday after tests last month revealed he has two minor rips on the retina – light - sensitive tissue – of his right eye .
He was told about the rips after an annual check - up in his good eye .
Experts yesterday said such tears can lead to a detached retina if not caught early enough and treated .
Downing Street and doctors insisted there was " no deterioration " in his eyesight as a result of the tears .
Yet the development will fuel speculation that Mr Brown could be preparing the ground for an exit strategy from Downing Street after failing to turn around the polls , despite surviving the conference season without any major setbacks .
However , a new opinion poll shows the Tories , on 45 per cent , have stretched their lead to 19 points .
The ICM survey for the News of the World also suggested that voters preferred the Tories in almost every policy area , from law and order to schools , Afghanistan and tax .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It was also " highly likely " that Mr Brown would be asked to repay some of his expense claims , the BBC reported .
The Prime Minister is among hundreds of MPs who may receive a letter this week from Sir Thomas Legg , the auditor investigating parliamentary allowances , requesting either further details or repayment .
Mr Brown 's only noticably contentious expenses claim was that for cleaning services which involved him paying his brother Andrew £ 6,577 .
News of Mr Brown 's health problem would have brought fresh anguish for the Prime Minister , who in his conference speech last year spoke movingly of how NHS doctors fought to save the sight in his good eye after the rugby injury that resulted in a detached retina .
However , the disclosure raised questions over whether he had been completely open with the general public when being questioned about his health on BBC's Andrew Marr programme last month .
Downing Street refused to deny the suggestion that the retinal tears were discovered by tests before the television interview took place on 27 September .
On the programme , Mr Brown told Marr : " Every year I have to check , as I did only a few days ago , that my eyesight is good .
There has been absolutely no deterioration . "
His words , with hindsight , appeared carefully chosen , because by then he would have started monthly check - ups as a result of the condition .
No 10 said yesterday : " This summer , Mr Brown had his annual eye check - up which was fine .
Later , he had his retina checked .
After examinations , surgeons found that the retina had two minor tears .
However , as there has been no further deterioration and no change in his eyesight , they decided against further operations .
Mr Brown visited Moorfields eye hospital yesterday as part of regular checks on his eyes , and this check was also fine .
" Were there to be any change , he would of course make a further statement . "
No 10 said yesterday that the Prime Minister had been " entirely consistent " because there had been no deterioration in his sight .
Asked whether it would affect his ability to continue with the job , a Downing Street spokesman said : " Absolutely not . "
In a book by the Sky News political editor , Adam Boulton , it was claimed that Tony Blair believes Mr Brown may find an excuse to " duck out " of the election , possibly using health grounds as an excuse .
Tears to the retina can develop with no obvious symptoms , but , often , sufferers will experience either flashes of light or floaters – black spots or lines in the field of vision caused by bleeding of torn retinal vessels or the formation of small clumps of vitreous matter .
Left untreated , tears can lead to retinal detachment .
The part of the retina which becomes detached will not function properly , resulting in vision loss or even total blindness .
Dr Winifred Amoaku , the vice - president of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists , said laser treatment was recommended in such cases .
MPs return to Westminster tomorrow amid renewed manoeuvres to oust Mr Brown , including the possibility of rebels fielding a " Brown must go " candidate for the election of chairman of the parliamentary party .
But Mr Brown can find comfort in the news that Sir Thomas Legg , who is investigating MPs ' expenses , could stymie a revolt .
It is understood that Sir Thomas is to send an auditor 's letter to half of all MPs , ordering them to repay money or provide further details of their parliamentary allowances .
Russian soldier returns from army service in coma and extremely emaciated
Radik Khabirov , a nineteen - year - old conscript from Kazan , was brought home from the army in a coma and extremely emaciated : he currently weighs 30kg .
Neither the army doctors nor the commanders of his military unit explained to the soldier ’s father what had happened to his son .
On Thursday , Radik Khabirov was taken into Kazan city hospital .
As his brother Marat explained to Ekho Moskvy radio station that it was army hazing in the unit had driven him to that state .
Russian soldier returns from army service in coma and extremely emaciated
Saitgaray Khabirov , the conscript ’s father , who brought up two children on his own , stated that when Radik had been conscripted , the military medical commission had declared him completely healthy .
Radik ’s last letter reached Kazan at the end of November last year .
“ One month later , I was informed that on the 27th November , my son had voluntarily left the unit , ” said Saitgaray Habirov .
“ The military registration and enlistment office for airplane construction paid us a visit at home and checked that he was not there .
On the 28th February , a telegram arrived , informing us that Radik was at hospital in a coma . ”
According to Khabirov , when he first saw his son after half a year of separation , his began to cry .
In front of him , in the hospital bed , lay the crooked , stretched - out bones of a skeleton .
He had only ever seen such a thing on television , in films about fascist concentration camps .
Radik did not even have the strength to breathe on his own : his lungs could only work with the help of an artificial ventilation system .
His father was informed that his son had apparently returned to the unit on the 20th December and had been sent to the psychiatric department of the unit hospital , with the diagnosis : accentuated personality adaptation disorder .
Later , two more diagnoses were added : bilateral pneumonia and pseudomonas .
But on the night of the 22nd January , Radik almost committed suicide .
They only just managed to drag the conscript from the noose which he had twisted from the bed - sheet , in time .
“ Why did they not inform me straightaway when my son left the unit , or at least when he went to hospital ? ” asked the soldier ’s father .
“ Why did the officers not want to say where Radik had been for twenty days or more ?
I think that even if he escaped the unit , it must have been because someone humiliated him or as a result of a fight .
And they specially kept him somewhere for so long , so that the bruises would disappear .
Well they kept him too long ! ”
The army doctors admitted that Khabirov developed the other illnesses during his military service , or rather in one month of his service , since on the certificate presented to him on finishing his studies in Saratov in November , he was pronounced healthy on 16 counts .
In a few months , Radik gained a little weight , but most importantly , as the army doctors assured Khabirov , although he had not entirely regained his health , he no longer needed treatment under hospital conditions .
For this reason , the soldier , still comatose , was sent to his father .
Habirov was forced to arrange hospital conditions in his home .
“ We cook pureed soups for him , and various nutritious mixtures , ” he said .
‘ We give him different types of juice , vitamins .
I feed him every three hours .
Even at night . ”
Radik only reacts to pain and flinches at loud noises .
“ He will definitely wake up , ” Saitgaray Habirov informed Zhizn newspaper .
“ I know my son .
He himself will tell us everything that happened to him . ”
During the day , having left his son in the care of his grandma , Habirov visited officials .
To this date , he has not been able to obtain either the promised military compensation of seven thousand roubles ( about 250 dollars ) , or an invalid ’s pension for Radik .
At the military unit , the soldier ’s passport was lost and at the Regional Internal Affairs Directorate they said that they will only be able to issue a duplicate copy in a month .
Now the soldier ’s father has one hope : the Russian Minister of Defence .
Saitgaray Khabirov is adamant that he will punish those responsible .

( CNN ) --
More than 1 million babies born prematurely die each year before they are a month old , the March of Dimes said Sunday in the first comprehensive global report on premature births .
A premature baby rests at a hospital in Kabul , Afghanistan , in October 2007 .
The organization suggested the situation could worsen if the rate of premature births increases .
Each year , 12.9 million infants -- or nearly 10 percent of the annual worldwide birth total -- are born before 37 weeks of development in the womb , the organization said .
More than 85 percent of the premature births occur in developing countries in Africa and Asia .
" Premature births are an enormous global problem that is exacting a huge toll emotionally , physically and financially on families , medical systems and economies , " March of Dimes President Jennifer Howse said in a statement .
" In the United States alone , the annual cost of caring for preterm babies and their associated health problems tops $ 26 billion . "
The March of Dimes report , which used data collected by the World Health Organization , breaks down premature birth rates by continent .
The highest premature birth rate is in Africa , where 11.9 percent of births each year are preterm , with more than 4 million premature deliveries annually .
In populous Asia , although the preterm birth rate is lower at 9.1 percent , the number of premature births is higher , at nearly 7 million a year .
While North America -- consisting of the United States and Canada in this report -- counts fewer than 500,000 premature births a year , its preterm birth rate is close to that of Africa , at 10.6 percent of all births , according to the report .
The rate is the world 's second highest .
In the United States , the rate of preterm births has increased 36 percent in the past 25 years , with births between the 34th and 36th week of gestation accounting for the majority of the increase , the organization found .
Much of the hike in preterm births is linked to more pregnancies after the age of 35 and the use of fertility treatments that can lead to multiple births .
" Wherever trend data are available , rates of preterm birth are increasing , " the report said .
Infants who survive premature birth face lifelong health risks , including the possible development of cerebral palsy , blindness , hearing loss , learning disabilities and other chronic conditions , according to the March of Dimes .
" Preterm birth is a global problem that needs greater attention by policymakers , researchers , health care providers , the media , donor organizations and other stakeholders , " the report said .
" The marked disparities in preterm birth along racial / ethnic lines in many high - income countries and the concentration of preterm births in Africa and Asia also clearly indicate that addressing preterm birth is essential for reducing the pronounced inequities in neonatal health and for the world to achieve , " it added .
The March of Dimes , a nonprofit agency engaged in pregnancy and baby health research , said some premature births can be prevented by addressing risk factors in mothers , including diabetes , high blood pressure , nutrition , body weight and tobacco and alcohol use .
Women who earlier gave birth to a preemie face a greater risk of having another .
While doctors know some of the health and behavior factors in mothers that increase the risk of preterm births , doctors have yet to identify a reliable remedy to prevent early labor , said Christopher Howson , vice president for global programs of the March of Dimes .
" While much can be done right now to reduce death and disability from preterm birth even in low - resource settings , we need to know more about the underlying causes of premature birth in order to develop effective prevention strategies , " Howson said .

It is widely known that the brain perceives information before it reaches a person 's awareness .
But until now , there was little way to determine what specific mental tasks were taking place prior to the point of conscious awareness .
That has changed with the findings of scientists at Rutgers University in Newark and the University of California , Los Angeles who have developed a highly accurate way to peer into the brain to uncover a person 's mental state and what sort of information is being processed before it reaches awareness .
With this new window into the brain , scientists now also are provided with the means of developing a more accurate model of the inner functions of the brain .
As reported in a forthcoming ( Oct. 2009 ) issue of Psychological Science , the findings obtained by Stephen José Hanson , psychology professor at Rutgers ; Russell A. Poldrack , professor at UCLA , and Yaroslav Halchenko , ( now a post - doctoral student at Dartmouth College ) , have provided direct evidence that a person 's mental state can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy through functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The research also suggests that a more comprehensive approach is needed for mapping brain activity and that the widely held belief that localized areas of the brain are responsible for specific mental functions is misleading and incorrect .
The research was funded with grants from the U.S. Office of Naval Research , the James S. McDonnell Foundation and National Science Foundation .
The McDonnell Foundation recently awarded Hanson another $ 1 million for ongoing studies in this area .
Over the last several years , much of neuroimaging has focused on pinpointing areas of the brain that are uniquely responsible for specific mental functions , such as learning , memory , fear and love .
But this latest research shows that the brain is more complex than that simple model .
In their analysis of global brain activity , the researchers found that different processing tasks have their own distinct pattern of neural connections stretching across the brain , similar to the fingerprints that distinctively identify each of us .
Rather than being a static pattern , however , the brain is able to arrange and rearrange the connections based on the mental task being undertaken .
" You ca n't just pinpoint a specific area of the brain , for example , and say that is the area responsible for our concept of self or that part is the source of our morality , " says Hanson .
" It turns out the brain is much more complex and flexible than that .
It has the ability to rearrange neural connections for different functions .
By examining the pattern of neural connections , you can predict with a high degree of accuracy what mental processing task a person is doing . "
The findings open up the possibility of categorizing a multitude of mental tasks with their unique pattern of neural circuitry and also represent a potential first , early step in developing a means for identifying higher - level mental functions , such as ' lying ' or abstract reasoning .
They potentially also could pave the way for earlier diagnosis and better treatment of mental disorders , such as autism and schizophrenia , by offering a means for identifying very subtle abnormalities in brain activity and synchrony .
The research showing that specific mental functions do not correspond directly with certain brain areas but rather a unique pattern of neural connections also provides a more accurate direction for mapping the effective connectivity of the brain .
Known as the Connectome Project , the goal of researchers involved in that work is to provide a complete map of the neural circuitry of the central nervous system .
" What our research shows is that if you want to understand human cognitive function , you need to look at system - wide behavior across the entire brain , " explains Hanson .
" You can't do it by looking at single cells or areas .
You need to look at many areas of the brain to even understand the simplest of functions . "
The study involved 130 participants , each of whom performed a different mental task , ranging from reading , to memorizing a list , to making complex decisions about whether to take monetary risks , while being scanned using fMRI .
The researches were able to identify which of eight tasks participants were involved in with more than 80 - percent accuracy by analyzing the participants ' fMRI data against classifications developed from the fMRIs of other individuals .
The researchers also were able to identify what class of objects ( faces , houses , animals , etc. ) a person was viewing before he or she could report that information by analyzing the pattern of brain activity at the back of the brain where information is processed and then conveyed towards the frontal regions associated with awareness .
" It 's the same principle experienced during a car accident .
The car accident actually happens tens of a milliseconds before you are aware you have actually been hit , " explains Hanson .
" By looking at the back of the brain , we can ' read out , ' for example , that a person is looking at dogs and cats before they actually know they are looking at a dog or a cat . "
Unlike most research that has focused on specific areas of the brain , Hanson and his team looked at the pattern of activity across a half million points in the brain .
Interestingly , the patterns of neural networks involved in each of the eight tasks on the surface appear very similar .
The reason , Hanson explains , is that various mental functions tend to draw on many of the same processes .
For example , memorizing a list of words that include the word dog is likely to draw up a memory of a pet , the same as reading a story about a dog would .
Using machine learning techniques ( a support vector machine ) , capable of analyzing and categorizing large amounts of data , the researchers were able to identify those slight differences that allowed them to predict the specific mental function of the participants and what information they would report back .
" It 's like looking at two patterns of identical flower arrangements , " says Hanson .
" They each may have the same flowers but they will not be arranged exactly in the same manner , consequently leading to slight differences in the overall pattern .
Using the pattern analysis methods we have developed , there are clues that can be detected and pulled out . "
As part of their continuing research , Hanson and his team plan to develop a system for identifying neural connectivity abnormalities to assist with the study of such mental disorders as attention - deficit hyperactivity and autism and to produce a handbook for many of the new tools used for pattern analysis and the classification of mental states based on neuroimaging data .

Ok , if this does n't prove we are here to serve the Great 0 bama instead of him serving us , nothing will .
What excuses can the left make that his daughters are not in the risk group ?
Are n't all other US students to get vaccinated ???
Gee , did he sign the opt out form ???
Liar and Dictator - in - Chief .

Is there a National Emergency Obama ?

Risk ??
Low or high ?
Risk of infection ?
Risk of adverse reaction ???
Good old articulate Gibbs .

And the money line of the article is :
At this time only children with chronic medical conditions are receiving the vaccination because their immune system is not strong enough to fight off the strain .
Thus , it would appear that the Obama 's are compiling with the standards recommended by the CDC .

Although I would never say this out loud , I worry about the 0 bama daughters .
They are almost old enough to marry off to an oil sheik , just in the interests of cementing a deal , of course ...

Dr. Rosenfield on Fox Sundays today said the highest risk groups was ages * 2 to 29 *!
Pregnant women were the other highest risk group .
Surely Michelle 's " punishments " Malia & Sasha fall in there somewhere , eh ?

I bet they are n't being vaccinated because the vaccine is a waste of time !

The gov’t supplies all flu vaccine in the US for liability reasons ?
Maybe the gov’t needs to buy some health care insurance from AIG .

" the vaccine is not available to them . . "
What a joke ..
I 'm sure if Obama wanted his little girls to get the vaccine it would be available to them in a heartbeat .

I ca n’t speak for Gibbs , but I know that where I live , with respect to this vaccine , risk = risk of death from H1N1 flu .
So , a child with asthma , epilepsy , cardiac problem is considered at high risk .
Also very young children .
So , only those children might be able to get the H1N1 vaccine .
I know a lot of people were begging for it here and could n’t procure it for their children .
I ca n’t say whether Obama offspring would be vaccine - eligible .

What do you mean , not going during the flu outbreak ?
Would n’t that news have leaked out ?

Actually , I think Muslims have some strange thing about vaccines .
Anybody know more about this ?
I recall reading somewhere that one of the problems with getting vaccines into the Muslim world ( of which Barry is obviously a part ) is that they object to something about the whole concept .

The Obama White House , stepping in where other Democrats feared to tread , has launched a potentially risky fight with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- attempting to bypass the nation ’s most powerful business organization and develop independent ties to corporate America .
In recent weeks , President Obama , his Energy secretary and one of his other most senior advisors have begun criticizing the chamber publicly , casting it as a profligate lobbying organization at odds with its members in opposing the administration on such issues as consumer protection and climate change .
At the same time , the administration has been meeting privately with prominent corporate leaders -- more than 60 of them since June -- in an effort to develop its own pipeline to the business community .
The White House also has gone out of its way to cultivate another corporate group , the Business Roundtable , which is much smaller than the chamber but represents chief executives of many of the nation ’s largest corporations .
Advertisement
“ Our strategy is to reach out directly to the business community , ” said Valerie Jarrett , the president ’s liaison to the corporate world .
“ This is a shift .
Previously , the chamber had served as the sole intermediary for business .
That ’s not our approach . ”
Jarrett praised the Business Roundtable , saying that it brings member CEOs to White House meetings in addition to Washington lobbyists .
In an indirect dig at the chamber , Jarrett said the roundtable meetings were more substantive and valuable because they included not just a trade association leader but someone who actually runs a business .
The White House role in criticizing the chamber has , predictably , riled Republicans .
But it also has made some Democrats nervous .
Advertisement
“ The chamber represents thousands of businesses . . . most of which are apolitical , ” said Rep. James P. Moran , a Virginia Democrat .
“ I ’m not sure that that is the appropriate target to go after . ”
Jarrett and other White House aides say they bear the chamber no ill will , and note that the organization ’s staff continues to meet with administration officials .
Those sessions , Jarrett and others said , remain cordial .
But behind what chamber officials describe as a facade of White House courtesy , the long - unchallenged business group sees barbed comments and a challenge to its hegemony as the voice of corporate America in the capital .
The organization ’s chief lobbyist , Bruce Josten , put it this way : “ They pulled the pin out of the grenades and are throwing them over the fence . ”
Advertisement
And he offered some criticism in return , saying that the Obama White House has shown less interest and been more superficial in dealing with business issues than any he has worked with for the last two decades .
Josten and his boss , Chamber President Tom Donohue , said they would be civil in the face of what they call inaccurate White House claims .
But the chamber is unaccustomed to such high - level criticism .
Not only has it built a powerful lobbying staff , backed by a multimillion - dollar war chest , but the group ’s network of local affiliates has been organized into a powerful grass - roots force .

Republicans have seldom been tempted to challenge the chamber because it , for the most part , has been a soul mate on major issues .
But even Democrats in the past have shied away from head - on challenges .
Under Donohue , the chamber transformed .
Its annual budget quadrupled in a few years to $ 200 million today .
And it became more aggressive politically , developing such a fearsome reputation that Rahm Emanuel , now the White House chief of staff , told a reporter in 2006 that the group worried him more than the Republican Party did .
Emanuel at the time was an Illinois congressman who served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
But that was years ago , said White House spokeswomen Jen Psaki , who announced late Friday that Emanuel had accepted an invitation to speak before the chamber ’s board Nov. 4 .

“ While we have big disagreements on issues like energy and financial regulatory reform , we want to work together on areas where there is agreement , ” she said .
Two weeks ago , Obama criticized the chamber ’s role in opposing a new consumer protection agency , saying the group ’s ads on the topic were “ completely false . ”
“ The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending millions on an ad campaign to kill it , ” Obama said .
“ They ’re trying their hardest to weaken it .
. . .
And they ’re very good at this , because that ’s how business has been done in Washington for a very long time .
“ In fact , over the last 10 years , the Chamber of Commerce alone spent nearly half a billion dollars on lobbying , ” the president said .

The White House complaints , according to the chamber and its allies , coincide suspiciously with a more aggressive campaign by environmental and labor organizations .
The Natural Resources Defense Council has led the criticism of the chamber ’s climate policy , arguing that it is at odds with the position of many of its members .
And the campaign may be having some effect .
Five major companies -- including Apple , Exelon , and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- have withdrawn from the chamber in protest of its opposition to global warming legislation , backed by the White House , that would cap greenhouse gas emissions and allow companies to buy and sell permits to emit pollutants .
Energy Secretary Steven
Chu said he thought the resignations were “ wonderful , ” and he publicly urged the chamber to change its position .
In an interview , Donohue said his organization would stay the course .
The chamber , he said , acknowledged global warming as a problem but opposed legislation that he says could harm the economy by raising energy costs .
And he shrugged off the resignations of some prominent members , noting that former Vice President Al Gore , long an advocate for strong climate - change legislation , sits on the board of Apple .

“ Our membership renewal rates are very , very high , ” he said , noting that the chamber had picked up new members and revenue that more than offset the losses in the days since the resignations were announced .
Though dismissing the White House criticism , Donohue expressed dismay at a report produced by the labor - backed Change to Win organization titled “ Preaching Principle , Enabling Excess : How Tom Donohue Compromised the Credibility of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . ”
The report alleges that Donohue “ hijacked the chamber ’s agenda away from serving the interests of the business community to serving corporate CEOs , ” using the chamber ’s name to aid specific corporate donors and opposing changes focused on executive compensation and corporate governance .
The report looks at Donohue ’s service on several corporate boards , some of which had compensation and governance problems .
Donohue called the document frightening because of the personal nature of the criticism , which he said was false .

In Boston on Friday , Obama criticized those who “ suggest that moving toward clean energy will destroy our economy when it ’s the system we currently have that endangers our prosperity and prevents us from creating millions of new jobs ” -- an indirect reference to the chamber .
Such criticism , coupled with White House attacks against Fox News and conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh , has brought counter - attacks from Republicans .
Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) cited Obama ’s criticism of the chamber as another step in creating an enemies list , a tactic he said reminded him of the Nixon White House .
“ This behavior is typical of street brawls and political campaign consultants , ” Alexander said in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday .
“ As any veteran of the Nixon White House can attest , we have been down this road before , and it will not end well . ”
Advertisement
Democrats called such complaints laughable .
President Nixon used the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies to strike back at critics , they noted , in sharp contrast to the Obama administration ’s approach .
The Obama team ’s actions , however , may bear some resemblance to the hardball tactics employed by Karl Rove , who as an advisor to President George W. Bush used the White House to undermine organized labor and trial lawyers while cementing relations with helpful groups like the chamber .
Whereas labor leaders had relatively few opportunities to talk with the Bush White House , the Obama staff sees its operations as far more welcoming , even to a group like the chamber that opposes key White House goals .
“ Our door is always open to them , ” Jarrett said .

“ It ’s just that they are not the only ones to get through the door , and that is a shift from what they experienced from prior administrations . ”

This approach has many weaknesses .
It entrenches a flawed system .
It creates greater uniformity and rigidity .
It redistributes income from the politically disorganized young to the politically organized old .
It squeezes people into a Rube Goldberg complex of bureaucracies based on their income level .
It will impose huge costs on people as they rise up the income ladder , distorting the whole economy .
The biggest problem is that it will retard innovation .
Top - down systems just do n’t innovate well , no matter how many Innovation Centers you put in the Department of Health and Human Services .
The bill will retard innovation by using monopoly power to squeeze costs .
It will also retard innovation by directing resources toward current care ( and current voters ) and away from future technologies and future beneficiaries .
But the Baucus bill has some advantages over the status quo as well .
It would insure an additional 29 million people , a social benefit critics never grapple with .
It is also more fiscally responsible than any other committee bill .
It courageously cuts Medicare benefits by hundreds of billions .
It raises taxes on the upper and middle classes in many necessary ( and covert ) ways .
The bill will not really be budget neutral , but the authors have taken fiscal responsibility seriously .
They ’ve earned that good score from the Congressional Budget Office .
Most impressively , the Baucus bill includes many provisions to make government - run health care more rational .
It would bundle payments to hospitals and encourage doctors to work in efficient teams .
It would punish hospitals that have to readmit patients .
It would create a commission to perpetually squeeze costs .
It would improve information technology .
It would measure the comparative effectiveness of different treatments .
No one knows how much savings would be produced by these changes in payment method , but they could be significant .
If you asked me to compare the Baucus approach with the Wyden approach , the answer is easy .
But if you asked me to compare it with the status quo , the answer is hard .
The Baucus bill contains hidden bombs that could lead to a rigid bureaucratic system that still does n’t address the fundamental problems .
On the other hand , it contains hidden experiments that could lead to new models that might spread across the system .
If I were in Congress , I ’d figure there ’s an 80 percent chance of something like this passing anyway .
I might as well get engaged as a provisional supporter to fight to make it better , or at least to fight off the coming onslaught to make it worse .

Our results showed that CMV infected subjects had lower scores in the personality dimension novelty seeking than the CMV - free subjects .
Novelty seeking in infected subjects negatively correlated with levels of anti-CMV antibodies .
Negative correlation was also found between novelty seeking and Toxoplasma - infection in Prague , while in villages and smaller cities the correlation was not significant .
The effect of both infections , although highly significant , was rather low , explaining about 2 % of total variability of the novelty seeking in our experimental set .
The study also revealed several other significant effects CMV or Toxoplasma infections and their interaction on personality traits .
While the effect of the infections on novelty seeking was a priori expected , other effects were revealed by an ex post analysis .
Therefore , the results concerning the other effects have to be corrected for multiple statistical tests .
After the Bonferroni's correction for multiple tests , no ex post revealed effect remained significant .
The lower values novelty seeking in the Toxoplasma - positive subjects suggest that infected men are on average more reflective , tend to require more detailed information when making an opinion and are not easily distracted .
They are also more reserved , slow , controlled ; they do not waste their energy and feelings .
They tend to be organized , methodical , and prefer activities with strict rules and regulations .
The association between latent toxoplasmosis and low novelty seeking scores has already been reported [ 18 ] .
The present study showed that the relation between toxoplasmosis and novelty seeking was not caused by parallel correlations between the risk of Toxoplasma infection and size of place of residence and between size of place of residence and novelty seeking scores .
Surprisingly , toxoplasmosis and CMV infections were associated with considerably lower novelty seeking scores only in large cities .
There were no significant differences in novelty seeking between infected and pathogens - free subjects in settlements with fewer than 10 thousand population ( CMV ) or fewer than 100 thousand population ( Toxoplasma ) .
At present we have no explanation for this phenomenon .
A previous study performed on a larger set of experimental subjects revealed that Toxoplasma - infected subjects scored lower in verbal intelligence as measured with the Otis test and showed lower probability of achieving secondary education than Toxoplasma - free subjects [ 18 ] .
It was demonstrated in several countries including the Czech Republic [ 34 ] that prevalence of toxoplasmosis is higher in villages and small cities than in larger cities .
At the same time , the probability of achieving higher education and possibly also higher verbal intelligence could positively correlate with the size of place of residence .
Therefore , the observed effects of toxoplasmosis can in fact reflect a parallel influence of size of place of residence ( and corresponding life style ) on a ) the risk of acquiring Toxoplasma infection and b ) probability of achieving secondary education and higher verbal intelligence .
This model was strongly supported by the results of the present study .
All associations between Toxoplasma infection and education level or intelligence disappeared after adjustment for the effect of place of residence .
It is also noteworthy that CMV infection , which shows a similar prevalence rates in villages and small and large cities , has no association with education level or intelligence .
Neither the psychopathological antecedents nor the pre-infection personality data of the subjects were available for our analysis .
Based on a case - control study , it is not possible to tell whether there is a causal relation between two statistically associated factors ( e.g. infection and lower novelty seeking scores ) and / or to determine the direction of such a relation .
Theoretically , the infection could induce personality changes , personality factors may have influenced the risk of infection and possibly a third factor , such as the socioeconomic status , may have played a role in both personality dimensions and the risk of infection .
In our view , however , the most parsimonious explanation is that the infection , more precisely the presence of pathogens in the brain of infected subjects , induces changes in neurotransmitter levels , causing in turn changes in TCI personality dimensions .
This hypothesis is based on several lines of indirect evidence :
a) Two different neurotropic pathogens with quite different life cycles and transmission routes are associated with the same psychological effect .
This makes the existence of a third factor responsible for both lower novelty seeking scores and higher risk of infection rather unlikely .
Moreover , the existence of such a factor would cause a statistical association between Toxoplasma and CMV infections .
However , CMV infection was detected with equal frequency among Toxoplasma - free and Toxoplasma - infected subjects .
b ) The existence of correlation between novelty seeking scores and levels of specific antibodies ( significant in one - tailed tests ) was observed for both Toxoplasma and CMV .
Such a correlation between the intensity of personality change and specific immunity could hardly be found if novelty seeking would influence the risk of infection or if an unknown factor would independently influence both novelty seeking and the risk of infection .
c ) A decrease in neophilia in naturally neophilic mice and a decrease of neophobia of naturally neophobic rats , probably caused by lower ability of discriminating between familiar and novel surroundings , was also observed in animals experimentally infected with Toxoplasma [ 3 , 4 , 8 ] , and a related behavioral effect ( the apomorphine - mediated decrease of prepulse inhibition ) was observed in rats infected with CMV [ 48 ] .
Therefore , the direction of the causal relation between novelty seeking - related behavioral changes and Toxoplasma / CMV infections has already been experimentally established in rodents .
d ) Lower novelty seeking scores are claimed by several authors [ 29 – 33 ] to correlate with the background level of dopamine in the basal ganglia .
The increased level of dopamine was indeed observed in mice experimentally infected both with Toxoplasma [ 19 ] and CMV [ 49 ] .
The specific neurological mechanism underlying the association between the infections and novelty seeking was not the subject of the present study .
The available results of neuroimmunological studies , however , suggest that several cytokines engaged in inflammation processes , like interleukins 1 , 2 and 6 , directly influence the level and turnover of many neuromodulators , including dopamine [ 50 – 53 ] .
An extremely low concentration of interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) is able to potentiate dopamine release evoked by number of different stimuli , including K+ depolarization in mesencephalic cell cultures [ 54 ] and striatal slices [ 55 ] .
Injections of IL - 2 into the rat striatum have been shown to induce turning behaviors in rats that are typical of perturbation of the dopaminergic system [ 56 ] and subcutaneously administered IL - 2 significantly increases locomotor activity of mice in the elevated plus - maze test [ 55 ] .
Serious neuropsychiatric side effects demanding acute intervention regularly occur in oncological patients treated with IL - 2 and lymphokine - activated killer cells [ 55 , 57 , 58 ] .
Dormant forms of Toxoplasma and CMV persist in the brain of infected individuals for many years .
The activation of acute disease in immunocompromised patients and immunohistochemical data obtained on mice [ 59 ] suggest that under normal conditions both diseases are kept in latent form by the host immune system .
Local immune processes in the brain of subjects with latent infections are probably accompanied by local disturbances in particular cytokine levels [ 60 – 64 ] .
This can influence the background level of neuromodulators and secondarily some of the personality dimensions .
It has been reported repeatedly that both toxoplasmosis and contact with cat , the definitive host of Toxoplasma gondii , are associated with higher risk of schizophrenia [ 20 – 28 ] .
Similarly , schizophrenia was reported to correlate with CMV infection [ 65 ] .
The background level of dopamine is supposed to play an important role in etiology of schizophrenia [ 66–68 ] and autoimmune - like effects on the dopamine system have been proposed as a possible mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and Parkinson 's disease [ 69 ] .
Clinical investigations have detected increased levels of IL - 2 in the CSF of schizophrenic patients manifesting symptoms of psychosis [ 70 , 71 ] .
It can be speculated that the local inflammation - induced increase in dopamine in the brain of infected subjects can be in fact the missing link between schizophrenia and Toxoplasma or CMV infection .
This is a rather strange story .
It has the elements of truth and the elements of deception .
It sounds too far fetched to be true , but has the components of veracity .
It is the story of Pedro Leonardo Mascheroni , a physicist who worked at Los Alamos for many years and may be accused of treason for passing classified information to the Venezuelan Government or someone claiming to represent it .
The story has too many inconsistencies to be the truth , but at the same time , has many consistencies that suggest there is some truth to the whole thing .
We may never know .
Pedro Leonardo Mascheroni is a US citizen and Physicist of Argentinean origin .
He has been a somewhat controversial figure , critical of the US fusion program , but also critical of the US weapon program .
He was dismissed from Los Alamos many years ago and sued the Regents of the University of California , which runs the Los Alamos Lab .
He lost the suit and was not reinstated .
He has been repeatedly described in the New York Times as a “ rebel scientist ” dismissed from the labs as a security risk , but defended by the Head of Security of the same labs .
And here the contradictions begin , as the same Head of Security suggested that the firing of Mascheroni created a national security risk if he went back to Argentina , while others claim all of his work and even the report on his firing were public .
And Mascheroni himself seems to have said contradictory things , as he stated in 1991 that he would never let weapons data fall into unfriendly hands , but then he says that he was the one to first approach the various Governments ( reportedly including the Venezuelan one ) trying to sell his ideas on fusion .
He then says that the Venezuelan Government wanted him to produce a study on how to build a nuclear weapons program and he decided to do it to show to the Chavez Government that this was too expensive .
Instead he wanted to have Venezuela show some interest in his fusion ideas ( the same ones that in 1991 he was fighting to be able to publish , but was unable to do so , so they ca n’t be too public ) as a way of getting the US to be interested in them .
He then proceeds to tell a story of communicating via post office boxes in secret and collecting $ 20,000 in cash from his supposedly Venezuelan contact and then bickering over how to pay him the $ 800,000 for his report and never getting it .
Then , the FBI detains his contact with his report on fusion ( not on whether Venezuela should or not build a nuclear weapons program ) which triggered the raid on Mascheroni ’s home and the suspension of his wife at Los Alamos where she works and has a high security clearance .
He was told that he would be charged with treason , but has yet to be charged and held a press conference to tell his story on Thursday .
And thus the inconsistencies .
Mascheroni paints himself as an altruistic and idealistic scientist trying to get his ideas across , but his work seems to be more on smaller fusion systems using lasers , which is far removed today from being or getting to be a useful weapon .
At the same time , he claims to be dealing with openly available information , but meets in secret and charges or tries to charge large amounts of money for his work , but then claims he did not touch the money and was keeping it for the authorities .
The official story also has holes or gray areas in it .
If the “ Venezuelan ” contact was detained , why is it that he is not named or mentioned or has not been charged ?
Was the FBI visit just a fishing expedition or do they know more than they are letting on ?
Was Mascheroni set up by the US Government ?
So far , the evidence seems to point this way to me , given the fact that all of the news minimizes the Venezuelan connection and the inconsistencies mentioned above .
Finally , there is the inconsistency in my mind that given that there are nuclear experts in so many countries that could provide the same advice for a fee ( Including Mascheroni ’s own Argentina ) , why would the Venezuelan Government approach someone living in the US with all of the potential complications it could entail , including the fact that it could be a set up ?
I think they have learned something from Maletagate and Antonini , they are not dumb .
Thus , I do n’t buy it yet .
I do n’t think Mascheroni is the idealist he is trying to project , nor do I think the Chavez Government is involved .
Too many inconsistencies for my taste .
But there may be lots we do n’t know yet .

But it did make me wonder about how therapists deal with adult patients who have toxic parents .
The topic gets little , if any , attention in standard textbooks or in the psychiatric literature , perhaps reflecting the common and mistaken notion that adults , unlike children and the elderly , are not vulnerable to such emotional abuse .
All too often , I think , therapists have a bias to salvage relationships , even those that might be harmful to a patient .
Instead , it is crucial to be open - minded and to consider whether maintaining the relationship is really healthy and desirable .
Likewise , the assumption that parents are predisposed to love their children unconditionally and protect them from harm is not universally true .
I remember one patient , a man in his mid-20s , who came to me for depression and rock - bottom self - esteem .
It did n’t take long to find out why .
He had recently come out as gay to his devoutly religious parents , who responded by disowning him .
It gets worse : at a subsequent family dinner , his father took him aside and told him it would have been better if he , rather than his younger brother , had died in a car accident several years earlier .
Though terribly hurt and angry , this young man still hoped he could get his parents to accept his sexuality and asked me to meet with the three of them .

The session did not go well .
The parents insisted that his “ lifestyle ” was a grave sin , incompatible with their deeply held religious beliefs .
When I tried to explain that the scientific consensus was that he had no more choice about his sexual orientation than the color of his eyes , they were unmoved .
They simply could not accept him as he was .
Last year , newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky announced she was 12 weeks pregnant , six weeks after she had started a much - fanfared £ 1 million - a- year job as the face of Channel 5 .
Kaplinsky was on a freelance contract and therefore not entitled to full pay while off work , but her employers still had to find another “ face ” to cover for her and then swallow Kaplinsky ’s decision to return to work after nearly five months on reduced hours .
Last week , after just nine months in front of the autocue , Kaplinsky revealed that she was expecting a second child .
A “ source ” said : “ She realises her bosses had hoped she would stay longer before going off on maternity leave again . ”
These same bosses were said be “ relaxed ” about her news , although what they said in private might be unprintable .
Germany Has Voted Merkel Wins German Election , Has Majority for Center - Right Government
German voters re-elected Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday and allowed her to ditch the center - left Social Democrats from her government and form a coalition with her preferred partner , the pro-business Free Democratic Party , instead , according to reliable projections .
Sprint Nextel next year will introduce a new , more open application store on its feature phones , turning to a third party to manage it with the goal of getting new offerings out to consumers in an average of one week .
The third - largest U.S. operator also will remove its own built - in set of application offerings , or " deck , " from future BlackBerry handsets and from Windows phones from Windows Mobile 6.5 onward , said JP Brocket , general manager of wireless consumer applications , at the Sprint Open Developer Conference in Santa Clara , Calif .
Sprint 's Android and Palm WebOS phones already ship without a Sprint application deck , relying on the Android Marketplace and Palm 's own stores .
Carriers have come under fire from mobile application developers for taking too long to approve new applications and placing too many restrictions on them , and they have been moving toward outside app stores since the successful launch of Apple 's iPhone App Store .
Sprint wants to get out of devoting its resources to lengthy evaluations of software for its own deck and believes a third - party specialist would be better equipped to handle the path from development to sale , Brocket said .
" It 's kind of a big new day for us to relinquish that management , " Brocket said .
" But ultimately , if you make good content and customers want it , you should have the right to get it out there and succeed .
... I do n't need 10 people behind a desk , behind a wall , looking at every piece of content and making the call whether it 's good or bad .
Customers will make that choice . "
Sprint plans to start up the new store early in the first quarter of next year .
As long as a potential application works and meets basic requirements such as a core set of controls and support mechanisms , it should be approved for the new store , he said .
The main aim of the new store is to get more applications out to consumers , Brocket said .
In addition to speeding up the approval process , Sprint will bring its revenue - sharing plans with developers in line with the industry norm .
Though the market will be more open , Sprint will offer application providers marketing opportunities to make themselves stand out among others , he said .
In addition to the new , outsourced app store , Sprint is working with GetJar to offer that company 's store for free mobile apps to most of its subscribers , Brocket said .
The carrier will also allow subscribers to download other app stores and over time try to give consumers easy access on their phones to other popular , well - managed stores , he said .
Feature phones , which are less expensive and full - featured than smartphones such as Android and BlackBerry handsets , are about half the phones Sprint sells today and are making up a growing share , Brocket said .
Sprint also aims to add carrier billing for application purchases on all storefronts , including the Android , Windows Mobile , Palm and BlackBerry app stores .
This app store strategy will span all of Sprint 's business units , including Nextel , Boost Mobile and its emerging WiMax network , Brocket said .
On some networks , such as WiMax , it may be even more open , he said .
Some developers at the conference said they were already working in the iPhone arena and were exploring Sprint 's various platforms for expansion .
Vinh Ton , director of product development at Vergence Entertainment , was encouraged by Sprint 's goal of one - week application approval .
Vergence is developing a casual game for the iPhone and also considering other mobile OSes .
In addition to a quick path to market , Ton would like to see more ways of making an application stand out than a straight app - store popularity ranking by user ratings .
Brocket 's reference to marketing opportunities was encouraging , he said .
Another limitation of the mobile world is that it's hard for an application provider to get information from the carrier about the consumers who buy their products , Ton said .
This type of information is a key tool in fine - tuning products and marketing for Web - based and desktop games , he said .
Sprint 's story was not very promising on this point :
Asked about this capability during his presentation , Brocket said Sprint may provide information about consumer preferences based on ratings or handset types but not demographic information , citing subscriber privacy .
" I do n't think sharing full information about customers is something that we 're going to be opening up any time soon , if ever , " Brocket said .
WASHINGTON --
A photo used by conservative blogs to illustrate that as many as 2 million people participated in Saturday 's D.C. Tea Party appears to be at least a decade old .
Say Anything posted the photo and Power Line picked it up from there , but PolitiFact reports it can't be from Saturday 's rally .
For one thing , the National Museum of the American Indian , which opened in 2004 , is missing from the picture .
Furthermore , the picture shows cranes in front of the Natural History Museum , but the museum 's public affairs director said they have n't had cranes in front since the 1990s .
Oops .
Say Anything did n't say how it made the mistake , but posted a different photo from the rally and argued that a 1 million body count is reasonable .
A D.C. Fire spokesman called it an impressive crowd that filled the Capitol grounds and stretched to Third Street .
He estimated between 60,000 and 75,000 but stressed that was unofficial .
The department does n't offer officials crowd estimates because , case in point , they can be politicized , PolitiFact reported .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The hard - hit city of Pontiac , Mich. , is auctioning off the Silverdome , a stadium of more than 80,000 seats that once played host to the Super Bowl .
The Silverdome , the site of Super Bowl XVI in 1982 and the former home of the National Football League 's Detroit Lions , went on the auction block on Tuesday .
Bidding will continue until Nov. 12 , according to real estate auction house Williams & Williams , based in Tulsa , Okla .
Sitting on 127 acres , the Silverdome was the biggest stadium in the NFL when it was built for $ 55.7 million back in 1975 , the auction house said .
Amy Bates , senior vice president of marketing for Williams & Williams , said there is no minimum bid for the Silverdome , and she declined to estimate the value of the facility .
" Auctions are all about price discovery through competitive bidding , " Bates said .
" All of us will understand the value of the Pontiac Silverdome when the auction ends . "
In its 35 - year history , the stadium has played host to the World Cup in 1994 and WrestleMania III in 1987 .
That showdown between Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant drew a record number of fans -- more than 90,000 -- for an indoor sporting event .
The stadium is also the former home of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association .
In its heyday , it featured concerts by Madonna and Michael Jackson and an appearance by Pope John Paul II .
But since then , Michigan has fallen on hard times , and the Detroit area now has the highest unemployment rate in the country .
The stadium has seen little use since the 2001 - 2002 NFL season .
Fred Leeb , emergency financial manager for Pontiac , said the city has spent about $ 1.5 million in annual upkeep .
" The reason we 're putting it up for auction is because the Detroit Lions moved out years ago , and since then it's only been used sporadically , " Leeb said .
" So we want to convert a major premier asset of the city -- convert it from something that 's been languishing into a new , vibrant marquee asset of the community . "
Leeb acknowledged that " demolition is a possibility . "
But the city is willing to work with a buyer to give the Silverdome new life .
" We established a very flexible zoning ordinance to allow people to do virtually anything that makes economic sense , " Leeb said .
Mark Rosentraub , professor of sports management at the University of Michigan and an expert in stadium finance and construction , said the city of Pontiac faces a tough sell in trying to get a good price for the now - empty dome , considering the state of the Michigan economy .
" The Detroit or southeast Michigan market does not need the dome in its current uses , " he said .
" The population base is not expanding , and between The Palace in Auburn Hills , Ford Field and the Joe Lewis Arena [ both in Detroit ] , anyone looking at it has to have an alternate use in mind for the facility or the land . "
ARAB nations and " even the Palestinians ' ' should be allowed nuclear weapons as long as Israel 's nuclear capabilities are tolerated , Libyan leader Moamer Gaddafi said in an interview today .
Israel is widely considered to be the Middle East 's sole if undeclared nuclear state , and Khadafi told Sky News television that the international community should also allow its Arab neighbours to develop nuclear weapons .
" If the Israelis have the nuclear weapons and the nuclear capabilities , then it is the right of the Egyptians , the Syrians , the Saudis to have the same - even the Palestinians should have the same because their counterparts , or their opponents , have nuclear capabilities , '' Gaddafi said .
" And , if we do n't want this situation , so we 'll have to disarm the Israelis from their nuclear weapons and capabilities . ''
The Libyan leader said he would oppose Iran acquiring nuclear weapons if it acknowledges such a goal , but noted Tehran 's insistence that its nuclear programme is peaceful - something that Western powers and Israel dispute .
" Iran , up to now , has n't said it is manufacturing a nuclear weapon : Iran says it is enriching uranium , '' Khadafi said .
" If Iran were to manufacture nuclear weapons , nuclear arms , then all of us , including us , will be against them .
But Iran has not said so . ''

Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) is drawing criticism from his congressional colleagues , but President Obama offered him some warm words at a Miami fundraiser for the Democratic congressional campaign committees last night .
Obama , in introducing the members of Congress in attendance , called Grayson – along with Florida Reps .
Debbie Wasserman -Schultz and Kendrick Meek – as “ outstanding members of Congress . ”
Obama may regret his praise of Grayson , who is now drawing fire from members in both parties for referring to Linda Robertson , the adviser to Obama ’s Fed Chief Ben Bernanke as a “ K Street whore ” in a radio interview last month .
And he ’s received national attention for equating GOP opposition to the Democrats ’ health care plan to wanting sick seniors to “ die quickly . ”
This is n’t the first time the White House political operation has given an assist to Grayson ’s re-election prospects .
He was the first freshman Democrat in the House to receive political help from Vice President Joe Biden , who came down to Orlando to headline a fundraiser for him in August .
During the event , the vice president told Grayson : “ We owe you one buddy … This is a guy who does n't back away from a fight , and does n't back down from what he believes in . "
That much is clear , and even as Grayson continues to draw national controversy for his provocative comments , it does n't look like the administration is making any effort to distance themselves from him .

An agreement to end the political crisis in Honduras has been signed .
It apparently allows ousted President Manuel Zelaya to return to power .
He was removed from office four months ago in a coup by the country 's interim leader Roberto Micheletti .
The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the deal is an " historic agreement " .
However it still requires the approval of the country 's supreme court , which earlier backed the coup .
Stephen Gibbs reports .
Recent seizures of internet gambling funds related to the payment processor Account Services do not appear to be the end of the U.S. Government ’s war against the industry .
This week , it was revealed that funds in six more accounts had been seized .
The six accounts , according to the Baltimore City Paper , are held by Wachovia and appear under the name Forshay Enterprises .
In July and August , other funds were seized in branches of Interstate Net Bank , Bank of America , and First Premier Bank belonging to Electracash and HMD .
Regina Mignogna , a Maryland State Trooper , signed the warrant affidavits for the HMD accounts , which were obtained by Poker News Daily .
Each of the warrant applications was ordered seized “ until further order of this court or until January 20 , 2010 , whichever is earlier . ”
The documents were filed in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore .
Richard Gunn , an Anne Arundel County Police Detective , signed the warrant applications for the Wachovia accounts , which were numbered 2000042478410 , 2000042478070 , 2000042478452 , 2000042478300 , 2000042089414 , and 2000042089427 .
The City Paper linked Forshay Enterprises to TransactSvc.com .
Meanwhile , Electracash was tied to Edward Courdy , who many might remember as one of the defendants in Maryland ’s Bodog case in 2008 .
That news broke last July , when $ 24 million was seized from the popular online poker site .
Funds were taken from four publicly traded U.S. banks , including Wachovia , Bank of America , SunTrust , and Regions .
Account Services , which processed payments for PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker in 2008 and 2009 , filed a motion in July for return of property , namely $ 14 million seized by the U.S. Government .
The money was held in Union Bank and Wells Fargo branches in California .
In retaliation , the Government indicted Account Services ’ Douglas Rennick , a Canadian , on charges of bank fraud , money laundering , and illegal gambling .
He faces up to 55 years behind bars and $ 1.75 million in fines for his actions .
As of the time of writing , he has not settled with U.S. authorities .
In August , Judge Jeffrey Miller denied Account Services ’ motion for return of property , instead electing to wait for the criminal case against Rennick to pan out .
The seizure was part of a larger effort by the Southern District of New York in June during which over $ 30 million was frozen .
The funds in question were allegedly destined for more than 24,000 online poker players and not connected to online wagering on sports .
Bodog operates a full online sports book , an option that does not exist on PokerStars or Full Tilt .
The Poker Players Alliance ( PPA ) filed an amicus brief on behalf of Account Services , a decision the organization stuck by despite Rennick ’s criminal indictment .
Many in the online poker community assumed that the election of U.S. President Barack Obama , a poker player , would ease the attack on the industry .
However , the opposite has been true so far , with federal agencies going on the offensive .
For example , FBI Special Agent Dana Conte swore to the affidavits relating to Account Services .
In the closing months of the Bush Administration ’s stay in Washington , D.C. , the regulations of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ( UIGEA ) were ushered into effect as “ midnight rules . ”
Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist ( R - TN ) was instrumental in attaching the UIGEA to an unrelated port security measure in 2006 .
The SAFE Port Act passed through the House with ease and was approved in the Senate by unanimous consent .
Speaking out during the debate in the House was Congresswoman Shelley Berkley ( D - NV ) , who questioned why internet gambling appeared in the bill .
As a result of the June seizure , which coincided with the running of the annual World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) in Las Vegas , paper checks and e-checks temporarily bounced , leading to reimbursements and cash bonuses from some of the world ’s largest online poker sites .
What effect the latest round of seizures will have on the industry is anyone ’s guess .
Over the weekend , the New York Times revealed an alarming conclusion by the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency : Iran now has enough know - how to put together a workable atomic bomb .
That report , the Times hastened to add , is preliminary .
But the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) estimate of Iran 's bomb - making information goes beyond other assessments made public by several governments .
Yet two key Obama administration aides yesterday ducked questions about whether Iran really has the data to design and build a bomb .
" I ’m not in a position to characterize that report or our own intelligence , " U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said on Meet the Press .
" There are various assessments and they do n’t all align . "
Appearing on Face the Nation , National Security Advisor James Jones also downplayed Iran 's nuclear knowledge .
" Whether they know how to do it or not is a matter of some conjecture , " he said .
" What we 're watching is , ' What is their intent ? ' "
All this speculation comes at a delicate moment .
Iran has agreed to let inspectors visit a newly disclosed enrichment site at Qom on Oct. 25 .
On a visit yesterday to Tehran , IAEA Director - General Mohamed ElBaradei ( pictured here meeting Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ) , said he saw a shift " “ from confrontation into transparency and cooperation . ”
What we do know , however , is that the IAEA has already raised concerns about things like Iran 's experimentation with high explosives .
Here 's a key paragraph from the latest IAEA Board of Governors report , made public in September :
Iran has told the Agency that it has experimented with the civil application of simultaneously functioning multiple detonators , and was asked by the Agency to provide it with information which would prove that such work had been for civil and nonnuclear military purposes .
Iran has not yet shared that information with the Agency .
The Agency would also like to discuss with Iran the possible role that a foreign national with explosives expertise , whose visit to Iran has been confirmed by the Agency , played in explosives development work .
Mastering the design of high - explosive lenses is crucial to the design of an implosion device like the Trinity gadget or the Nagasaki atomic bomb .
In addition , the IAEA has also probed Iran 's interest in ballistic missile design .
In the latest board report , the agency reiterated " the need to hold discussions with Iran on the engineering and modelling studies associated with the re-design of the payload chamber [ for a new ballistic missile ] ... to exclude the possibility that they were for a nuclear payload . "
What we do n't know is whether intelligence agencies have more specific information about some of these activities – say , if someone has tracked down this mysterious " foreign national " with explosives knowledge or obtained the latest blueprints for a re-entry vehicle .

When I was just a little girl , I used to collect acorns by the boxfull as they fell in the fall .
I did n’t know why .
They just felt nice in the hand and somehow a big bunch of them felt satisfying .
Could that be because somewhere in my ancestors ’ time , acorns were a very important food ?
Native Americans all across oak - growing North and South America harvested acorns , which were nearly as important a food as corn or beans .
Such tribes as the Cherokee , Apache , Pima , and Ojibwa routinely harvested and used the acorn .
These Indian gatherers taught early settlers how to harvest and use acorns in their cooking , as they did corn and other traditional foods .
Even today , many Indians gather acorns , both to use themselves and to sell in Mexican markets .
And those bright , shining round acorns are very good for you , besides tasting great .
Health benefits of acorns
Acorns have been tested and found to be possibly the best food for effectively controlling blood sugar levels .
They have a low sugar content , but leave a sweetish aftertaste , making them very good in stews , as well as in breads of all types .
Ground , leached acorn meal , ready to dry .
The bitterness is gone .
They are rich in complex carbohydrates , minerals , and vitamins while they are lower in fat than most other nuts .
They are also a good source of fiber .
An additional benefit from eating acorns is in the gathering .
Acorns , although they “ fall from trees , ” must be picked and processed before eating , which requires a walk , then bending and picking up .
All of these are good exercise .
In fact , that is why many “ primitive ” foods are so healthy .
They require exercise just to put them on the table , not just a short trip to the convenience store or fast food joint .
But acorns taste bitter !
One of the first things I learned as a little girl harvesting acorns was that they tasted awful .
Unfortunately , many acorns do taste bitter .
This is because they contain tannin , a bitter substance in oaks which is used to tan leather .
Real pucker power here .
Some varieties of acorns contain more tannin than others .
They range from the Emory oak of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico , which is so mild it can be used without processing , to some black oaks with very bitter acorns , requiring lengthy processing to render edible .
Generally , the best acorns to harvest are those of the white oaks , such as the swamp oak , Oregon white oak , and burr oak , as they contain less bitter tannin .
Luckily , nearly all acorns can be made usable with natural processing which renders them nutty and sweet .
From the mighty oak
Acorns are one grain that literally grows on trees .
Even a small oak tree can produce a bushel or more of tasty , nutritious acorns .
And that grandaddy oak out in the pasture could produce nearly a thousand pounds .
Now that is a lot of eating from a small area .
There are now several varieties of grafted oak trees , which bear nearly double the harvest of wild trees .
These trees are available for purchase from specialty nursery companies .
Nice fat , ripe acorns , ready to be used for acorn meal or flour
Not only are acorns great food for us , but for many birds and animals as well .
Any deer hunter can tell you that one of the best spots to ambush a wily buck is on a trail to a big oak tree .
Deer and wild turkeys harvest these nutritious acorns to fatten up for winter .
Early settlers must have noticed this , as they soon began to turn their hogs out into the oak woods to fatten on the bounty of acorns .
I accidently had this happen to two of my own pigs .
I had a litter of weaner pigs , six in number in an outside pen .
While we were in town , a stray dog came by and had great fun , chasing the little porkers around the pen .
None were injured , but two of them vaulted the pen wall next to the shed and took off for the woods as fast as their little legs would run .
We hunted , called , and scoured the woods for days .
Weeks .
No piggies .
By then , we figured a black bear , which were numerous in our woods , had a midnight snack of pork on the hoof .
Then one November , I was riding my horse down one of the wooded trails through huge old oaks , when I noticed turned - up fresh soil .
Bear ?
Nope , my “ bear ” had left pig tracks .
I tied my horse and scouted further , discovering seemingly acres of ground dug up underneath those bounteous oak trees .
My lost piggies were found .
But those tracks looked pretty big .
To make a long story short , we corralled those errant porkers and hauled them home .
On putting them in the pen next to their brothers and sisters , we were shocked .
Out in the woods , they really looked big , but now they looked huge .
They were a third again as big .
On butchering , the woods raised hogs weighed 290 pounds , while the grain fed hogs barely made 200 dressed .
So much for “ modern feeding . ”
Of course the pigs had access to roots , grasses , insects , and more .
But I credit much of their hearty size to those fat acorns they were gorging themselves upon .
As acorns hold a long time under the tree , the hogs were feasting on last year ’s crop all summer , then the fresh crop come fall .
Not a bad natural feed .
Harvesting
First of all , you ’ll have to check out your local oaks during the spring when the leaves and underbrush are not as dense .
Get a little pocket tree book and try to identify the oaks you find .
In many areas , there are several varieties of oaks available to the acorn harvester .
Some are quite mild and sweet and others pretty darned bitter .
If you have a choice , try to find a variety with mild meat and only a little initial tang of tannin .
My son , Bill Spaulding ’s hunting “ shack ” sits right in the middle of white oaks , which produce “ grain from trees , ” as some Indian tribes refer to acorns , and also lure big deer , which come to feed
on sweet , fat acorns .
You may have to simply nibble and check , come fall .
Different varieties of oak have different shaped acorns .
Crack a nice fat acorn with no worm hole .
Examine the meat .
It should be yellowish , not black and dusty ( insects ) .
Now , simply nibble and chew up a part of the nut .
If it is very bitter , spit it out and try another kind of acorn .
When you find a grove of relatively mild acorns , note this for next year and harvest away .
As the understory is usually very thin below a decent sized oak tree , the acorns are quite easy to pick up .
Depending on the variety of oak , your acorns will drop between late September and October , more or less , depending on your climate zone .
The best way I ’ve found to pick up acorns is to simply pick a nice dry , sunny day as soon as the acorns begin to drop and take baskets and sacks to the woods and sit down and pick them up .
If you wait too long , the handy dandy squirrels and other wild critters will beat you to them , leaving only the worm - riddled hulls behind .
Processing
The term “ processing ” brings to mind machines and chemical additives .
With acorns , processing simply means making them ready to eat .
When I get home with my bounteous haul , I spread them out a layer thick on an old sheet which I have laid on a roof , corner of the yard , or some other out - of - the - way dry , sunny place .
This lets them sun dry and prevents any possible molding before I get them shelled .
It will also kill any insect eggs or larvae , which might be inside .
If you cannot lay the acorns out in the sun , spread them in a single layer on cookie sheets in a very slow oven for an hour .
Some acorns , such as those of the Emory oak , require no more processing than cracking them open and eating them .
Like most nuts , acorns of all types benefit from toasting on a cookie sheet in an oven at 175° F . Stir to prevent scorching .
However , most acorns do contain enough tannin to make leaching this bitter substance out necessary .
To do this , simply sit down and crack a big bowlful of acorns , carefully examining each nut for black holes , which indicates a worm is inside rather than a wholesome plump yellowish - beige nut .
Acorns are very easy to crack .
The shell is pliable and quite thin .
Pop the cap off , then simply grasp it with a pair of pliers and give a squeeze .
Do n’t mash the kernel .
Simply crack the shell .
Then peel it off and toss the kernel into a bowl .
When all are done , get out your food grinder .
Put a fine knife on the grinder and run the shelled acorns through it .
This makes a coarse meal .
Place this in a large crock or glass bowl .
Then add boiling water to cover and let stand an hour .
Drain and throw away the brownish , unappetizing water .
Repeat .
Then taste the meal .
It should have a bit of a bitter tang , then taste sweet as you chew a piece .
Continue leaching out the tannin as long as necessary .
When the acorn meal is mild tasting , it is ready to dry .
I usually lay out a piece of old white sheet in a basket and pour the wet meal on it .
Then , gathering up the edges , jelly bag style , I press and squeeze , getting out as much of the water ( and tannin ) as possible .
Author grinding shelled acorns in a hand grinder
One caution do n’t let wet acorn meal lie about for hours , or it will surely mold .
Keep at the leaching process .
Spread the damp meal out in a shallow layer on a cookie sheet or on sheets of your dehydrator .
Then begin to dry it .
In the oven , you only need the pilot light or the very lowest oven setting .
As it begins to dry , take your hands and very carefully crumble any chunks which hold moisture .
Slowly your meal will begin to look quite good .
When the meal is completely dry , run it through a fine setting on your grain mill .
The traditional method was to use a stone ( mano in the southwest ) hand grinder to crush the meal on a large , flat stone ( metate ) .
It is now ready for use in your recipes .
If you produced more meal than you need right now , you can store the meal in the freezer or refrigerator in an airtight bag or jar .
The dry , ground meal will last a week or so , stored in an airtight jar on the shelf .
But , because of the oil , the meal will begin to go rancid , as will whole wheat flour and homeground cornmeal .
You can also grind your meal in a food processor or blender a little at a time .
I smile , thinking of the vast difference between grinding acorns between stones and using a food mill .
What would our ancestors think ?
Using acorn meal
Some Native Peoples called acorns “ grain from the tree , ” indicating the use they had for it as a grain in cakes , breads , and thickening for stews and soups .
Today folks use “ cream of this and that ” soups for the same thing .
I think processed acorns taste like a cross between hazelnuts and sunflower seeds , and I often include acorn meal in my multi-grain bread recipes .
Adding half a cup of acorn meal to a two - loaf bread recipe and reducing the flour , as needed , works quite well .
Because the acorn meal is a natural sweetener , I only use a bit of honey to feed the yeast while softening it , relying on the acorn meal to give sweetness to the bread .
No complaints yet .
As acorn meal is very dense , you will have to take care to get your bread to rise when adding it .
One way to ensure this is to use hot liquid and beat in your flour , making a batter .
Then cool so you can add the yeast and the rest of the ingredients .
This helps release wheat gluten to let the bread rise , despite heavy ingredients .
Indian bread was always very dense and heavy , as there was seldom , if ever , wheat or yeast added to the recipe .
It takes wheat gluten , as well as yeast , to make bread rise properly .
Indian breads were often small , thin cakes baked before the fire on large , reflecting rocks .
They were not puffy , large loaves as we are accustomed to today .
While camping some time , why not tuck your food grinder into your kitchen pack and try making some old - time Indian bread out of acorn meal .
It really puts you in contact with past ways in a hurry .
Here is an Apache recipe for acorn cakes .
Apache acorn cakes :
1 cup acorn meal , ground fine
1 cup cornmeal
¼ cup honey
pinch of salt
Mix the ingredients with enough warm water to make a moist , not sticky dough .
Divide into 12 balls .
Let rest , covered , for 10 minutes or so .
With slightly moist hands , pat the balls down into thick tortilla - shaped breads .
Bake on an ungreased cast iron griddle over campfire coals or on clean large rocks , propped up slightly before the coals .
If using the stones , have them hot when you place the cakes on them .
You ’ll have to lightly peel an edge to peek and see if they are done .
They will be slightly brown .
Turn them over and bake on the other side , if necessary .
These cakes were carried on journeys dry and eaten alone or with shredded meat .
We cheat and add homemade butter , too .
But then , we are spoiled .
Multi -grain bread with acorn meal :
Let ’s take a look at one of my mixed grain breads with acorn meal to see how it differs from the Indian cakes above .
1 ½ cups rolled oats
½ cup cornmeal
½ cup coarse ground , leached acorn meal
1 cup lukewarm water
2 Tbsp. dry granulated yeast
2 ½ cups boiling water
1 Tbsp. salt
¼ cup vegetable oil
2 eggs , beaten
About 8 cups whole wheat flour
½ cup honey
butter
Pour boiling water over oats , cornmeal , and acorn meal .
Set aside .
Dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water .
In a large mixing bowl , beat the hot oatmeal mixture with the rest of the ingredients , except for the yeast and butter , adding the flour a cup at a time until you get a medium batter .
Cool to lukewarm .
Then add the yeast .
Mix well and add enough flour until you have a spongy dough that is not sticky .
Knead , adding flour if necessary to keep from being sticky .
Place in a greased bowl and grease the top of dough , then cover it with a moist , warm kitchen towel and set it in a warm place until it doubles in size .
Punch down , knead several times , and let rise again .
Shape into loaves and place in greased bread pans or on a greased cookie sheet .
This also makes great rolls , so you can use a cake pan , making golf ball sized rolls .
Cover and let rise again until almost double .
Preheat the oven to 350° F and bake for about 35 minutes or until the tops are golden brown .
Brush with butter and cool .
You can also make this bread in camp , using smaller loaves and a reflector oven or forming ½ inch thick by 1 inch wide by 8 inch long sticks and twisting the dough around a green stick and gently baking over medium coals never a fire .
So far , we ’ve talked about using acorn meal as a grain .
But the acorn is so much more versatile .
Most Native Americans and early settlers used acorn meal as either an ingredient in mush , which is sort of a thick , mealy soup , or pounded with meat , fat , and berries , making pemmican .
In a survival situation which requires lightweight , high calorie foods , pemmican would be a good choice .
( But , of course , many of us really do n’t need the extra fat in our diets . )
Here are a couple recipes for these uses of the acorn .
When I say “ acorn meal , ” I mean ground , leached - till - mild acorn meal , not raw .
Cornmeal and acorn mush :
4 cups water
1 tsp. salt
½ cup acorn meal , ground
about 1 cup cornmeal
Bring salted water to a boil and sprinkle the acorn meal into the boiling water , stirring briskly with a wire or twig whisk .
Then add the cornmeal .
Add just enough cornmeal to make a thick , bubbling batch in which a wood spoon will stand up fairly well .
Place the saucepan in a larger container holding two inches or more of boiling water .
( Use a double boiler , if you have one . )
Simmer the mush until quite thick , about 45 minutes , stirring occasionally to keep it from lumping .
Cornmeal and acorn mush is very good for breakfast on a cold morning .
It can be served with sweetened milk and a dab of wild fruit jam or homemade butter .
But it is also great as a main course lunch or dinner .
You can also add salsa or bacon bits and grated cheese on top to get great variety .
This mush is very filling and will stick to your ribs .
I often make a double batch and pour the “ extra ” in a greased bread pan .
When cooled in the fridge overnight , it becomes quite solid and can be sliced in half inch thick slices , dipped in flour and fried in oil , first one side , then turn and fry the other .
Fried acorn and cornmeal mush is one of our absolutely favorite camp ( or at - home ) breakfasts .
Serve it with butter , salt , and thick fruit jam or maple syrup .
Of course , David likes his with catsup .
You might want to try your hand at a “ modern ” type of pemmican .
It does n’t keep on the trail for months , but it is pretty good .
Modern pemmican :
1 lb. lean stewing meat , cut quite small
½ cup dehydrated wild plums
½ cup acorn meal
Boil the lean stewing meat .
When it is tender , drain and allow it to dry in a bowl .
Grind all of the ingredients together in a meat grinder using a fine blade .
Grind again , mixing finely , distributing the ingredients very well .
Place in a covered dish and refrigerate overnight .
( Or you can eat right away , but like many foods , the refrigerating allows the flavors to blend nicely . )
You can serve this on any flatbread , such as a tortilla .
It is best served warm , or you can reheat it in the pan in the oven like a meatloaf .
Acorn meal can also be used in place of a good portion ( or all ) of the nuts in most desserts , from brownies to cookies .
It does depend on the variety of acorn you have available and the taste after leaching .
Some acorn meal never gets “ nutty , ” only mild , while the meal of other acorns , such as those of the Emory oak , are so sweet that you can eat them without leaching , or with very little leaching .
You will have to experiment a bit here .
But the end results are usually surprising .
Oh gee !
You say oak trees do n’t grow where you live ?
Well , just because they are n’t “ native ” does n’t mean you ca n’t plant some .
No matter where I go , I always plant a big bunch of food producing trees , shrubs , and perennial plants .
And a lot of them certainly are n’t native to the area .
Of course , you can just plant acorns or buy seedling trees from a nursery .
From an acorn or small seedling , you can usually figure you ’ll begin to get a decent amount of acorns in about 10 years .
Want faster results ?
Several nurseries are carrying grafted oak varieties , meant for food production .
And at least one nursery has a very good hybrid of the burr oak that produces mild acorns requiring no leaching .
You can write to St Lawrence Nurseries , 325 State Hwy .
345 , Potsdam , NY 13676 or find them online at www.sln.potsdam.ny.us.
They have a free catalog which includes many very hardy fruits and nuts .
Oaks do n’t grow where we will be moving , but you can darned betcha I ’ll be planting them so I can enjoy those fabulous acorns .
Until then , I ’ll just have to drive down to my son Bill ’s place near Oak Lake and pick a few baskets so we can enjoy all those good acorn recipes .
I originally came up with this recipe during the summer .
But , I just made them again for my husband to take to work .
They have become a favorite of my husband , who is a major Dew junkie .
Any Dew or citrus lover will think they rock !

It is not mathematics .
When mathematical techniques are used correctly they are extremely helpful -- perhaps essential -- to clear thinking on many topics .
But when questions are restricted due to mathematical tractability , or models are developed which assume what they are supposed to prove , mathematical techniques can hinder progress in the social sciences .
This argument is not new -- especially to careful readers of the Austrian tradition of economic scholarship .
This was essentially the argument with those who developed the mathematical model of market socialism in the 1930s and 1940s , and with those who depicted the market economy in the perfectly competitive general equilibrium model in the 1960s and early 1970s .
These mathematical models Mises , Hayek , Kirzner respectively attempted to demonstrate assumed what they had to prove , and in doing so blocked from our economic view essential characteristics of the market economy --- namely processes of adjustment to changing conditions , competition as rivalry , and entrepreneurial alertness as the driving force of the market economy .
This argument has not been that persuasive to the profession of economists ( to say the least ) .
There have been various warnings over the years about the excessive use of mathematics voiced across the methodological spectrum in economics .
But they have gone in one ear and out the other for the most part .
However , consider this very thoughtful discussion of 2009 Nobel Prize by Paul Romer .
Economists who have become addicted to skyhooks , who think that they are doing deep theory but are really just assuming their conclusions , find it hard to even understand what it would mean to make the rules that humans follow the object of scientific inquiry .
If we fail to explore rules in greater depth , economists will have little to say about the most pressing issues facing humans today – how to improve the quality of bad rules that cause needless waste , harm , and suffering .
Cheers to the Nobel committee for recognizing work on one of the deepest issues in economics .
Bravo to the political scientist who showed that she was a better economist than the economic imperialists who ca n’t tell the difference between assuming and understanding .
Addendum : Roger Koppl has an excellent discussion of the logical contradiction involved with ' magical thinking ' .
Prof Green is a founder of the well - known string theory
Cambridge University has named the man who will succeed Professor Stephen Hawking in one of the world 's most prestigious academic positions .
The celebrated physicist , who has motor neurone disease , completed his last day as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics on 30 September .
The university said Professor Michael Green had been elected as the 18th person to take up the position .
Professor Green will start work in his new role on 1 November .
The academic already holds the John Humphrey Plummer Professorship of Theoretical Physics at the university .
' Internationally known '
He is a pioneer of string theory , the idea that the fundamental building blocks of space and time are tiny vibrating strings .
Peter Haynes , head of the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics , said : " Michael Green has played a leading role in theoretical physics research in the department since 1993 .
" He is internationally known as a pioneer in string theory which over the last 20 years has become one of the most important and active areas of theoretical physics . "
Professor Hawking has taken on a new role as director of research .
The Lucasian Professorship was established in 1663 and previous holders have included Isaac Newton .
This is , I kid you not , the actual title of a paper published in the January 2009 issue of the Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society .
I love it , because it sounds like it could just as easily be the fan - encyclopedia description of some minor creature from a Lovecraft story .
The bees in question are workers from three species , Lisotrigona cacciae , L. furva and Pariotrigona klossi , and were studied –going about their tear - drinking business–in Thailand .
From the paper …
… workers drank lachrymation ( tears ) from human eyes in more than 262 naturally - occurred cases at 10 sites in N and S Thailand during all months of the year .
A few visits were also seen to eyes of zebu and dog , indicating a probable broad mammalian host range .
On man the bees were relatively gentle visitors , mostly landing on the lower eyelashes from where they imbibed tears for 0.5 - 2.5 min , often singly but occasionally in congregations of 5 - 7 specimens per eye .
The authors think the bees have adapted to drink tears as a way to get some protein in their diet and may , possibly , drink tears in lieu of feeding on pollen at all .
That 's pretty nifty , if a bit creep - tastic .
Image shows a
Thai bee , though I 'm not sure if it 's actually one of the species studied in this paper .

Anti-ageing creams , which promise to smooth away the fine lines of maturity , could lead to cancer by stripping the skin of its protective top layer , warn experts
Daily Express
A leading US professor has said that using these revolutionary creams could expose the skin to dangerous toxins and make it more prone to sun damage .
Dr Sam Epstein , chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition , has said that popular ingredients in anti-ageing creams called alpha - hydroxy acids ( AHAs ) were " probably the most dangerous cosmetic products on the market " .
And now , he has urged the American safety body to introduce new regulations to protect consumers and also asked British shoppers to be aware of the risks .
" So many women , and even some men , slather these products all over their skin in the naive belief that they have nothing to fear but ageing , " Thequoted Epstein as saying .
The British cosmetics industry must comply with EU rules on what ingredients to use and what warnings to place on labels .
Currently , there is no requirement for a warning to be placed on creams containing AHAs .
However , Epstein pointed out that in America , the US Food and Drug Administration warned consumers that AHAs " could destroy the upper layers of skin , causing severe burns , swelling and pain " .
But he said that the dangers are equally relevant to British anti-wrinkle creams .
" Anything that strips the surface of the skin not only risks sunlight penetrating the exposed layer but also allows other toxic products in .
All of the toxic effects are massively increased by AHAs , " he said .
Epstein also expressed concern about other ingredients commonly used in anti-ageing products , such as limonene .
" Apart from being an irritant , it is a well documented carcinogen , " he said .
Unfortunately , there 's still one big elephant in the reform room :
There are no restrictions on increases based on age .
Unless something changes drastically in the final version of the bill ( and if you do n't call your congress critter , it definitely wo n't ) , this is a giant shell game in which health insurers will get their profits from one new underwriting emphasis rather than another .
WASHINGTON -- Top Senate Democrats are close to finalizing their health bill and could unveil a measure as soon as early this week that would include stiffer penalties on employers who fail to provide health coverage .
Senate leaders plan to submit the bill to the Congressional Budget Office for a cost estimate as soon as Monday , and make the legislation public as soon as Tuesday , according to a person familiar with the negotiations .
Details of the legislation could change , but its broad outlines are becoming clear .
Employers with more than 50 workers would n't be required to provide health insurance , but they would face fines of up to $ 750 per employee if even part of their work force received a government subsidy to buy health insurance , this person said .
A bill passed by the Senate Finance Committee had a lower fine of up to $ 400 per employee .
The bill to be brought to the Senate floor would create a new public health - insurance plan , but would give states the choice of opting out of participating in it , a proposal that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada backed last week .
The bill is expected to expand health coverage to tens of millions of Americans by giving low - and middle - income Americans subsidies to offset the cost of insurance , and expanding the Medicaid federal - state insurance program to cover a broader swath of the poor .
Most people would be required to buy insurance or pay a fine , though exceptions would be made for those deemed unable to afford it .
Also expected are new rules on insurers to prevent them from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions and from dropping customers ' insurance once they become ill .
This post was originally published on August 21 , 2009 and is now updated as it has been entirely revised .
Both original methods are removed and now replaced by four new methods .
The goal here is a background image on a website that covers the entire browser window at all times .
Let ’s put some specifics on it :
Fills entire page with image , no white space
Scales image as needed
Retains image proportions ( aspect ratio )
Image is centered on page
Does not cause scrollbars
As cross - browser compatible as possible
Is n’t some fancy shenanigans like Flash
Image above credited to this site .
Awesome , Easy , Progressive CSS3 Way
We can do this purely through CSS thanks to the background - size property now in CSS3 .
We ’ll use the html element ( better than body as it ’s always at least the height of the browser window ) .
We set a fixed and centered background on it , then adjust it ’s size using background - size set to the cover keyword .
html { background : url ( images / bg.jpg ) no-repeat center center fixed ; - webkit-background - size : cover ; -moz-background - size : cover ; -o- background - size : cover ; background - size : cover ; }
Works in :
Safari 3 +
Chrome Whatever +
IE 9 +
Opera 10 + ( Opera 9.5 supported background - size but not the keywords )
Firefox 3.6 + ( Firefox 4 supports non-vendor prefixed version )
View Demo
Update :
Thanks to Goltzman in the comments for pointing out an Adobe Developer Connection article which features some code to make IE do cover backgrounds as well :
filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='.myBackground.jpg' , sizing Method=' scale ' ) ; -ms-filter : " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='myBackground.jpg' , sizing Method= ' scale ' ) " ;
But careful , reader Pierre Orsander said they tried this and had some problems with links on the page going dead .
Update : Matt Litherland writes in to say that anyone trying to use the above IE filters and having problems with scrollbars or dead links or whatever else ( like Pierre above ) should try NOT using them on the html or body element .
But instead a fixed position div with 100 % width and height .
CSS - Only Technique # 1
Big thanks , as usual , to Doug Neiner for this alternate version .
Here we use an inline < img > element , which will be able to resize in any browser .
We set a min-height which keeps it filling the browser window vertically , and set a 100 % width which keeps it filling horizontally .
We also set a min-width of the width of the image so that the image never gets smaller than it actually is .
The especially clever bit is using a media query to check if the browser window is smaller than the image , and using a combo percentage - left and negative left margin to keep it centered regardless .
Here is the CSS :
img.bg { /*
Set rules to fill background */ min-height : 100 % ; min-width : 1024 px ; /*
Set up proportionate scaling */ width : 100 % ; height : auto ; /*
Set up positioning */ position : fixed ; top : 0 ; left : 0 ; } @media screen and ( max - width : 1024 px ) { /*
Specific to this particular image */ img.bg { left : 50 % ; margin - left : - 512 px ; /* 50 % */ } }
Works in :
Any version of good browsers : Safari / Chrome / Opera / Firefox
IE 6 : Borked – but probably fixable if you use some kind of fixed positioning shim
IE 7/8 : Mostly works , does n’t center at small sizes but fills screen fine
IE 9 : Works
View Demo
CSS - Only Technique # 2
One rather simple way to handle this is to put an inline image on the page , fixed position it to the upper left , and give it a min-width and min-height of 100 % , preserving it ’s aspect ratio .
< img src= " images /bg.jpg " id =" bg " alt= " " >
# bg { position : fixed ; top : 0 ; left : 0 ; /* Preserve aspet ratio */ min-width : 100 % ; min-height : 100 % ; }
However , this does n’t center the image and that ’s a pretty common desire here …
So , we can fix that by wrapping the image in a div .
That div we ’ll make twice as big as the browser window .
Then the image will be placed , still preserving it ’s aspect ratio and covering the visible browser window , and the dead center of that .
< div id = " bg " > < img src= " images /bg.jpg " alt= " " >
</div>
# bg { position : fixed ; top : - 50 % ; left : - 50 % ; width : 200 % ; height : 200 % ; } #bg img { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; left : 0 ; right : 0 ; bottom : 0 ; margin : auto ; min-width : 50 % ; min-height : 50 % ; }

Works in :
Safari / Chrome / Firefox ( did n’t test very far back , but recent versions are fine )
IE 8 +
Opera ( any version ) and IE both fail in the same way ( wrongly positioned , not sure why )
in the same way ( wrongly positioned , not sure why ) Peter VanWylen wrote in to say that if you add the image via JavaScript , the img needs to have width : auto ; and height : auto ; to work in IE 8 , 9 , or 10 .

Update January 2018 : Trying to get this to work on Android ?
JL García wrote to me saying he needed to add height : 100 % ; and overflow : hidden ; to the html element to get it to work .
The full snippet being :
html { background : url ( images / bg.jpg ) no-repeat center center fixed ; background - size : cover ; height : 100 % ; overflow : hidden ; }
I tested it , and it seemed totally correct .
Without it /
With it .
j Query Method
This whole idea becomes a lot easier ( from a CSS perspective ) if we know if the aspect ratio of the image ( inline < img > we intend to use as a background ) is larger or smaller than the current aspect ratio of the browser window .
If it is lower , than we can set only the width to 100 % on the image and know it will fill both height and width .
If it is higher , we can set only the height to 100 % and know that it will fill both the height and width .
We have access to this information through JavaScript .
As usual around here , I like to lean on jQuery .
< img src= " images /bg.jpg " id =" bg " alt= " " >
# bg { position : fixed ; top : 0 ; left : 0 ; } .bgwidth { width : 100 % ; } . bgheight { height : 100 % ; }
$ ( window ) .load ( function ( ) { var the Window = $ ( window ) , $ bg = $ ( " #bg " ) , aspectRatio = $ bg.width ( ) / $ bg.height ( ) ; function resizeBg ( ) { if ( ( the Window.width ( ) / the Window.height ( ) ) < aspectRatio ) { $ bg .removeClass ( ) .addClass ( ' bgheight ' ) ; } else { $ bg .removeClass ( ) .addClass ( ' bgwidth ' ) ; } } the Window.resize(resizeBg ) .trigger ( " resize " ) ; } ) ;
This does n’t account for centering , but you could definitely alter this to do that .

Works in :
IE7 + ( could probably get in IE6 with a fixed position shim )

Update ( June 2012 ) : Reader Craig Manley writes in with a technique to load an appropriately sized background image according to screen .
As in , do n’t load some huge 1900 px wide background image for an iPhone .
First , you ’d make images like 1024.jpg , 1280.jpg , 1366.jpg , etc .
Then instead of loading an img , you ’d load a shim .
<img id = " bg " src=" data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 " alt= " " style= " position : fixed ; left : 0 ; top : 0 " />
If you do n’t like the gif shim ( personally I think it ’s OK because it ’s not “ content ” it ’s a background ) you could load up one of the real images instead .
This code will account for that .
Then you test the screen width and set the src of the image based on it .
The code below does it on resize , which you may or may not want .
You could just run the code once if you wanted .
( function ( ) { var win = $ ( window ) ; win.resize ( function ( ) { var win_w = win. width ( ) , win_h = win.height ( ) , $ bg = $ ( " #bg " ) ; // Load narrowest background image based on // viewport width , but never load anything narrower // that what 's already loaded if anything .
var available = [ 1024 , 1280 , 1366 , 1400 , 1680 , 1920 , 2560 , 3840 , 4860 ] ; var current = $ bg.attr ( ' src ' ) . match ( /( [ 0 - 9 ] + ) / ) ?
RegExp .$ 1 : null ; if ( ! current || ( ( current < win_w ) && ( current < available[ available.length - 1 ] ) ) ) { var chosen = available [ available.length - 1 ] ; for ( var i=0 ; i<available.length ; i++) { if ( available [ i ] >= win_w ) { chosen = available [ i ] ; break ; } } //
Set the new image $ bg.attr ( ' src ' , '/img/bg / ' + chosen + '. jpg' ) ; // for testing ... // console.log ( ' Chosen background : ' + chosen ) ; } //
Determine whether width or height should be 100 % if ( ( win_w / win_h ) < ( $ bg.width ( ) / $ bg.height ( ) ) ) { $ bg.css ( {height : ' 100 % ' , width : ' auto'} ) ; } else { $ bg.css ( {width : ' 100 % ' , height : ' auto'} ) ; } }).resize ( ) ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Note that screen width is n’t the only possible good information to have when choosing an image size .

[ H/t Dave E / ]
Yesterday , a genuinely historic moment passed with scarcely a blip of attention from the media : President Obama signed into law the nation 's first genuine federal bias - crimes statute .
Everyone interested in advancing civil rights in America and defending the nation 's minorities from the deprivation of their rights by terroristic thugs -- particularly their historic victims , from African Americans and Asian Americans to Latinos , to Jews and other religious minorities , to gays and lesbians and transgender folk -- have real cause to celebrate .
Brian Levin has a nice collection of their thoughts at HuffPo .
Then , of course , there 's the Religious Right , which is holding its collective breath and pouting over the event .
Case in point : Pat Robertson at The 700 Club , ripping into the new law both yesterday and today on his show .
His basis for opposing the law , however , is completely detached from reality .
For instance , Robertson argues :
Robertson :
You know , there ’s a law – what about a law that says it ’s a federal crime to attack somebody because of his religious beliefs ?
Not a chance !
Robertson seems completely unaware that in fact religious bias is one of the categories of bias crime covered by hate - crime laws -- and it has been from the very start , since these laws were first enacted on the state level in the early 1980s !
Hint to Pat : Religion was covered as a bias category from the start because Jews have long been some of the most common victims of bias crimes .
For instance , in the FBI 's hate - crime statistics for 2007 , some 1,400 of the nation 's 7,600 or so reported bias crimes were of the " anti-religion " category ; of those , some 118 were varieties of anti-Christian bias .
Indeed , he needs only read the text of the the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention
Act to see that religion is one of the categories of bias it covers :
“ (1 ) OFFENSES INVOLVING ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RACE , COLOR , RELIGION , OR NATIONAL ORIGIN .
— Whoever , whether or not acting under color of law , willfully causes bodily injury to any person or , through the use of fire , a firearm , a dangerous weapon , or an explosive or incendiary device , attempts to cause bodily injury to any person , because of the actual or perceived race , color , religion , or national origin of any person —
“ ( 2 ) OFFENSES INVOLVING ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RELIGION , NATIONAL ORIGIN , GENDER , SEXUAL ORIENTATION , GENDER IDENTITY , OR DISABILITY . —
“ ( A ) IN GENERAL .
— Whoever , whether or not acting under color of law , in any circumstance described in subparagraph ( B ) or paragraph ( 3 ) , willfully causes bodily injury to any person or , through the use of fire , a firearm , a dangerous weapon , or an explosive or incendiary device , attempts to cause bodily injury to any person , because of the actual or perceived religion , national origin , gender , sexual orientation , gender identity or disability of any person —
, claiming that the law will attack people 's free - speech rights .
This is , of course , a completely bogus claim , since the bill has very specific free - speech language built into it .
Finally , as Media Matters points out , religious discrimination has long garnered special federal attention in the federal criminal code .
The mewling and fearmongering from the religious right should actually tell progressives they 're on the right track here .
Below , I 've preserved video footage of President Obama signing the bill into law .

Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has denied having given Donington a further extension to its deadline , and says the circuit 's boss Simon Gillett is breaching his contract .
Gillett said in a statement on Monday that the circuit was handed a new two - week deadline extension to prove its credentials to host the 2010 British Grand Prix .
" We can confirm that Donington Ventures Leisure Limited has another two weeks from today to further demonstrate our credentials for hosting the British Formula 1 Grand Prix and to provide full information regarding our financial backing and construction timescales , " said Gillett .
Ecclestone , however , made it clear that Gillett has only been given two weeks to solve the contract breach , but that the deadline remained unchanged .
" We have n't decided to give Gillett another deadline at all , " Ecclestone told Telegraph Sport .
" We have informed him he is in breach of contract .
The contract which we have gives him 14 days to remedy the breach .
Most business contracts are like that .
" People interpret things the way they want to interpret them .
It would be hard if you were standing in a court today arguing what he said was wrong .
" But he has n't been given another deadline at all .
He has been given , like the contract says , another two weeks to remedy the breach .
No deadline has changed . "
Ecclestone said he had not spoken to Gillett , but the F1 boss emphasised the deal with Donington would be over if Gillett does n't rectify the situation in two weeks .
" I 've been thinking he 's going to come through all the way along because he 's sort of led me to believe it's all OK , " Ecclestone said .
" But I have no reason to discuss anything with him .
He 's either going to remedy the breach or he is n't .
" If he is n't then that 's the end of the story .
If he is then we 're going to have to make sure that he does all the other things that the contract provides for . "
Others have questioned the impact of the agreement on competition , or asserted that it would limit consumer choice with respect to out - of - print books .
In reality , nothing in this agreement precludes any other company or organization from pursuing their own similar effort .
The agreement limits consumer choice in out - of - print books about as much as it limits consumer choice in unicorns .
Today , if you want to access a typical out - of - print book , you have only one choice  fly to one of a handful of leading libraries in the country and hope to find it in the stacks .
I wish there were a hundred services with which I could easily look at such a book ; it would have saved me a lot of time , and it would have spared Google a tremendous amount of effort .
But despite a number of important digitization efforts to date ( Google has even helped fund others , including some by the Library of Congress ) , none have been at a comparable scale , simply because no one else has chosen to invest the requisite resources .
At least one such service will have to exist if there are ever to be one hundred .
If Google Books is successful , others will follow .
And they will have an easier path : this agreement creates a books rights registry that will encourage rights holders to come forward and will provide a convenient way for other projects to obtain permissions .
While new projects will not immediately have the same rights to orphan works , the agreement will be a beacon of compromise in case of a similar lawsuit , and it will serve as a precedent for orphan works legislation , which Google has always supported and will continue to support .
Last , there have been objections to specific aspects of the Google Books product and the future service as planned under the settlement , including questions about the quality of bibliographic information , our choice of classification system and the details of our privacy policy .
These are all valid questions , and being a company that obsesses over the quality of our products , we are working hard to address them  improving bibliographic information and categorization , and further detailing our privacy policy .
And if we do n’t get our product right , then others will .
But one thing that is sure to halt any such progress is to have no settlement at all .
In the Insurance Year Book 1880 - 1881 , which I found on Google Books , Cornelius Walford chronicles the destruction of dozens of libraries and millions of books , in the hope that such a record will “ impress the necessity of something being done ” to preserve them .
The famous library at Alexandria burned three times , in 48 B.C. , A.D. 273 and A.D. 640 , as did the Library of Congress , where a fire in 1851 destroyed two - thirds of the collection .
I hope such destruction never happens again , but history would suggest otherwise .
More important , even if our cultural heritage stays intact in the world ’s foremost libraries , it is effectively lost if no one can access it easily .
Many companies , libraries and organizations will play a role in saving and making available the works of the 20th century .
Together , authors , publishers and Google are taking just one step toward this goal , but it ’s an important step .
Let ’s not miss this opportunity .
The CIA may have misled Congress at least five times since 2001 , two Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee said Tuesday .
Intelligence subcommittee Chairwomen Jan Schakowsky ( D - Ill. ) and Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif . ) are leading an ongoing investigation into what they described as a practice of incomplete and often misleading intelligence briefings , which arose in the wake of CIA Director Leon Panetta ’s June 24 admission that intelligence officials failed to notify Congress about a top - secret program to assassinate al Qaeda leaders .

“ That is an example of a failure to notify but we think a symptom of a larger disease , ” Schakowsky said on Tuesday .
“ There have been many instances where we ’ve come to a committee hearing , after having read in the paper of something that should have been notified to us , where it ’s followed up my mea culpas by the intelligence community , ” Schakowsky said .
“ And examples where the committee actually has been lied to .
“ You can understand that the committee has felt very frustrated that the executive branch has not notified us of intelligence activity , ” she said .
“ We ’re in the process of reviewing several instances where the executive branch may have violated the [ notification ] requirements that are in the National Security Act .
” One of the instances being closely examined by the two Democrats is the September 2002 briefing on enhanced interrogation techniques that became the basis for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s ( D - Calif . ) claim that the CIA lied to her .
Findings on this point could bolster Pelosi ’s case .
The Speaker came under fire after she said at a testy press conference in May that the CIA had lied to her and other members during a 2002 briefing about its use of waterboarding on detainees .
Pelosi was the ranking member of the Intelligence panel at the time .
“ We were told explicitly that waterboarding was not being used , ” she said at the May press conference .
“ They [ the CIA ] misled us all the time .
” Republicans demanded proof from Pelosi of CIA lies , and the Speaker was also criticized for not objecting to waterboarding when she first learned about it .
Nadeam Elshami , a spokesman for the Pelosi , on Tuesday said that the Speaker ’s May statement speaks for itself .
In June , CIA Director Leon Panetta alerted the House Intelligence Committee about a top - secret program to assassinate top al Qaeda operatives that previously had not been disclosed to Congress .
Later reports indicated that former Vice President Dick Cheney had ordered the CIA not to notify Congress of the program .
Panetta ’s revelation appeared to bolster Pelosi ’s statement from May , and Schakowsky and Eshoo identified “ Director Panetta ’s June 24 notification ” as one of the five instances linked to a complete communication breakdown between the intelligence community and Congress .
“ It is the policy of the Central Intelligence Agency to be clear and candid with the United States Congress , ” CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said in response to a request for comment .
“ Director Panetta has made a relationship of trust , confidence and respect a top priority .
” At least one of the CIA ’s obfuscations was already known .
A 2008 CIA Inspector General ’s report determined that the agency withheld information from Congress relating to the shooting down of a plane carrying missionaries over Peru in 2001 .
In addition , the CIA may have failed to properly notify Congress about the 2005 destruction of videotapes recording the interrogation of al Qaeda operatives by intelligence officials , Eshoo and Schakowsky said .

The State Versus the Final Frontier
On July 21st , 1969 , Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong became the first human beings to land on the moon .
Just short of 3 1/2 years , Eugene Cernan and Jack Schmitt became the last humans to date to repeat the accomplishment .
A grand total of 12 human beings , all Americans , have set foot on Earth ’s nearest neighbor .
That should n’t be surprising :
The moon landings were part and parcel of a political “ space race ” between the US and Soviet governments .
The intent behind that race was n’t to open a gateway to the stars for humankind ; it was to score stature points in the decades - long game of “ Cold War ” posturing .
As President John F. Kennedy allegedly told NASA director James Webb , “ Everything we do ought to really be tied in to getting on to the Moon ahead of the Russians [… ] otherwise we should n’t be spending that kind of money , because I ’m not interested in space [ … ]
The only justification for [ the cost ] is because we hope to beat [ the USSR ] to demonstrate that instead of being behind by a couple of years , by God , we passed them . ”
Since the suspension of the lunar landing program , government - dominated manned space travel has been limited to things like hoisting military and commercial satellites into , and doing limited scientific research in , Earth ’s orbit .
Exploration of the rest of the solar system — of the rest of the universe — has been limited to unmanned missions , and government space agencies have jealously guarded against ( and in some cases brutally suppressed ) private sector efforts to slip the surly bonds of Earth .
That jealous guardianship has recently begun to relax somewhat .
Fans of private space exploration cheered on June 21st , 2004 as Mike Melvill , flying Scaled Composites ’ craft SpaceShipOne , reached an altitude of 100 kilometers and became the first non-government astronaut .
With two subsequent flights , Melvill and Mike Binnie won the Ansari X - Prize for Scaled Composites for fielding the first non-government , reusable , manned spacecraft .
Still , the state remains the dominant force in space travel and offers every indication of intending to maintain that dominance .
There are two good ( from government ’s point of view ) reasons for it to do so .
First , space travel is costly — and likely to remain more costly the longer government retains a grip on it .
That means big money for NASA ’s bureaucracy , and for privileged government contractors who produce expensive parts for expensive spacecraft .
For the military - industrial complex , space exploration is just another way of siphoning money out of your pockets and into theirs through political pull rather than through free exchange .
NASA ’s FY2009 budget is $ 17.2 billion .
That ai n’t chump change — and NASA scatters that money over facilities scattered around the country , buying votes for its congressional patrons with every dollar spent .
Secondly , put yourself in a state official ’s place for a moment .
Imagine that you ’re considering the merits of establishing a permanent colony on — to pick a planet not at random — Mars .
Yes , it ’s a big , long - term project :
Lots of job security for you , lots of money in play for your buddies at Boeing et al .
On the other hand , what you ’re considering is sending a group of human beings to a new home 55 million kilometers from Earth ( at its closest approach ) , and necessarily sending with them the technology to become self - sufficient .
Now ask yourself :
How long before that group decides that the natural next step beyond self - sufficiency is independence ?
How long before you transmit the latest government regulation , order or edict to your “ colonists , ” wait a few minutes ( minimum transmission time of about three light - minutes each way ) for confirmation , and instead watch a digitized photo of someone ’s middle finger roll off the printer in response ?
For that matter , the moon is only 385,000 kilometers away … a lot farther than any expeditionary force has been sent to discipline recalcitrant “ colonists ” before , and it sits at the top of a deep gravity well .
Easy for them to throw stuff at you ; hard for you to throw stuff at them .
Science fiction fans are probably familiar with Robert Heinlein ’s The Moon is a Harsh Mistress , based on precisely such a scenario .
Bottom line :
If you want to get off this rock , do n’t expect government to help .
Its incentives , both positive and negative , run in the opposite direction .
Keeping you here is a lot more lucrative and a lot less risky .
Eventually , you ’re going to have to ask yourself which you value more — the stars or the state .
You ca n’t have both .

OK , I ’m working my way through the climate chapter — and the first five pages , by themselves , are enough to discredit the whole thing .
Why ?
Because they grossly misrepresent other peoples ’ research , in both climate science and economics .
The chapter opens with the “ global cooling ” story — the claim that 30 years ago there was a scientific consensus that the planet was cooling , comparable to the current consensus that it ’s warming .
Um , no .
Real Climate has the takedown .
What you had in the 70s was a few scientists advancing the cooling hypothesis , and a few popular media stories hyping their suggestions .
To the extent that there was a consensus , it was that there was n’t much evidence for anything , and more research was needed .
What you have today is a massive research program involving thousands of scientists and many peer - reviewed publications , with all major international bodies agreeing that man-made global warming is real .
You can , if you insist , dismiss it all as a gigantic hoax or whatever — but it ’s nothing like the isolated 70s speculations about cooling .
And then we come to a bit of economics .
The book asks
Do the future benefits from cutting emissions outweigh the costs of doing so ?
Or are we better off waiting to cut emissions later — or even , perhaps , polluting at will and just learning to live in a hotter world ?
The economist Martin Weitzman analyzed the best available climate models and concluded that the future holds a 5 percent chance of a terrible - case scenario ..
Yikes .
I read Weitzman ’s paper , and have corresponded with him on the subject — and it ’s making exactly the opposite of the point they ’re implying it makes .
Weitzman ’s argument is that uncertainty about the extent of global warming makes the case for drastic action stronger , not weaker .
And here ’s what he says about the timing of action :
The conventional economic advice of spending modestly on abatement now but gradually ramping up expenditures over time is an extreme lower bound on what is reasonable rather than a best estimate of what is reasonable .
Again , we ’re not even getting into substance — just the basic issue of representing correctly what other people said .
Administrative note : I ’m going to block comments here , because I know it will be overwhelmed .
GRAND RAPIDS --
The Beerhorst family chickens are gaining political support in City Hall .
Mayor George Heartwell and two city commissioners representing the Eastown family said Tuesday they favor adopting an ordinance allowing urban chickens .
Meanwhile , the city 's top housing inspector said that Rick and Brenda Beerhorst 's five hens can stay in their backyard roost , while commissioners debate an ordinance that could allow them to stay .
Neighborhood Improvement Director James
Hurt said he will suspend enforcement of the Oct. 13 notice of complaint issued to the Beerhorsts .
The notice , which threatened enforcement steps after Sunday if the chickens remains , has been suspended pending the outcome of a City Commission discussion , Hurt said .
The topic should appear on a City Commission agenda within the next month , he said .
Heartwell said he and his family enjoyed raising chickens when they lived on a hobby farm near Lowell .
He wants to allow the practice within city limits .
" The Beerhorsts are not the only people in Grand Rapids who have chickens in their backyard today , " he said .
" We 're going to create the space through our planning department to talk about this issue . "
Second Ward Commissioners David LaGrand and Rosalynn Bliss also support a chicken ordinance .
" I think it 's consistent with our vision for the city , " Bliss said .
LaGrand said he wants to allow urban chickens without creating a cumbersome permit process .
" It seems to be that every argument against them is theoretical at best , " said LaGrand , adding he would favor " common sense " restrictions on noisy roosters and odors from manure .
Meanwhile , the Beerhorsts said they are heartened by the community support since news of their chickens ' situation appeared in The Press on Monday .
" I did three radio interviews this morning before my oldest teenager was out of bed , " Rick Beerhorst said .
The Facebook page his wife dedicated to the issue has more than 300 friends , so far .
At least 25 major U.S. cities have developed chicken keeping ordinances in recent years , according to city Planning Director Suzanne Schulz .
The city currently classifies chickens as farm animals .

LONDON ( AP ) 
Three British Muslims were convicted Monday of plotting to murder thousands by downing at least seven airliners bound for the U.S. and Canada in what was intended as the largest terrorist attack since Sept. 11 , 2001 A jury at a London court found Abdulla Ahmed Ali , 28 , Assad Sarwar , 29 , and Tanvir Hussain , 28 , guilty of conspiracy to murder by detonating explosives on aircraft while they were in - flight .
Four other alleged conspirators — whom the prosecution said were to have smuggled liquid explosives onboard jetliners disguised as soft drinks — were acquitted of conspiring to blow up planes .
The jury could not reach a verdict on an eighth man .
British and U.S. security officials said the plan — unlike many recent homegrown European terrorist plots — was directly linked to al - Qaeda and guided by senior Islamic militants in Pakistan , who hoped to mount a spectacular strike on the West .
The officials said British plotters were likely just days away from mounting their suicide attacks when police rounded up 25 people in dawn raids in August 2006 .
Their arrests led to travel chaos as hundreds of jetliners were grounded across Europe .
Discovery of the plot also triggered changes to airport security , including new restrictions on the amount of liquids and gels passengers can take onto flights .
Prosecutors said suspects had identified seven specific flights from London 's Heathrow airport to New York , Washington , Chicago , San Francisco , Toronto and Montreal , as their targets .
British authorities estimate that , if successful , around 2,000 passengers would have died .
If bombs were detonated over U.S. and Canadian cities , hundreds more would have been killed on the ground .
Plotters planned to assemble bombs in airplane toilets using hydrogen peroxide - based explosives injected into soda bottles .
" They were to be detonated in - flight by suicide bombers , " including several of the accused , prosecutor Peter Wright said .
Tests by scientists who replicated the bombs in a laboratory showed the devices could produce powerful explosions , though there is no evidence that the terrorist cell had perfected the technique .
Wright told the trial that the group 's suicide attacks were planned by " men with the cold - eyed certainty of the fanatic " and intended as " a violent and deadly statement of intent that would have a truly global impact . "
He said the plot would have caused " a civilian death toll from terrorism on an almost unprecedented scale . "
All eight defendants had denied most charges against them , claiming they were planning a stunt — and not a terrorist attack — to expose failings in Western foreign policy .
Prosecutors were unable to produce evidence that the men had produced a single viable bomb .
The trial was the second to take place in a case which has frustrated prosecutors .
Last year , Ali , Sarwar and Hussain were convicted of conspiracy to murder , but the jury could not reach a verdict on whether they specifically targeted aircraft .
The jury at that trial failed to reach verdicts against other four defendants .
Jurors on Monday cleared Donald Stewart - Whyte , 23 , of all charges .
They found Umar Islam , 31 , guilty of a charge of conspiracy to murder , but could not decide if he was involved in targeting aircraft .
They found three other men : Ibrahim Savant , 28 , Arafat Waheed Khan , 28 and Waheed Zaman , 25 , not guilty of planning to blow up airliners , but could not reach verdicts on whether the three men were guilty of conspiracy to murder .
Each defendant , except Stewart - Whyte , had pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance .
Prosecutor Adina Ezekiel said authorities will announce if they will seek a third retrial .

Paul Krugman has concentrated his fire recently on those " thumping their chests " over the falling dollar .
He has particular scorn for those recommending a return to the gold standard .
In Krugman 's view , a simple look at the historical facts will show that it was a superstitious fetish for the yellow metal that prolonged the Great Depression .
A careful , comprehensive response to Krugman 's charges would involve an explanation of the classical gold standard , and the wonderful peace and prosperity it showered on the world .
It was only after the major countries abandoned gold during World War I that major imbalances in international trade began to fester — imbalances that eventually exploded during the early 1930s .
As a good capitalist pig , I point the reader to my book on the Depression for the full story .
Fortunately , we can take a shortcut in the present article .
Using Krugman 's own graph , we can see that the case for abandoning gold — and devaluing currencies in the process — is not nearly as straightforward as he seems to think .
Krugman 's Graphical Case for Debasement
Here 's Krugman setting up his graph .
Note that the strikethrough , and accompanying text in the brackets , is from Krugman 's post .
What happened is that Krugman originally wrote one order of the countries going off gold , then a reader told him he was mistaken in the comments , so Krugman fixed his apparent error and explained this in brackets .
I have included it as is below , because Krugman 's bracketed explanation makes it crystal clear what his point is :
If there 's one overwhelming lesson from the Great Depression , it is that putting a higher priority on stabilizing your currency than on domestic recovery is utterly disastrous .
Barry Eichengreen pointed out years ago that major economies went off gold in the following order : Japan , Germany , Britain Britain , Germany , US , France .
[ screwed it up in the first draft : the correlation between going off gold and recovery is in fact perfect ]
And here 's what happened to their industrial output … .
Krugman reproduces a chart from this paper by Barry Eichengreen .
This has been quite popular in the progressive blogosphere ; indeed Brad DeLong features a modified version of it on the left margin of his main page .
Here is the chart that apparently clinches the fact that the gold standard caused — or at least exacerbated — the Great Depression :
Inflation - Adjusted Industrial Output
( Index 1929=100 , annual averages , axis notched at year 's midpoint )
Before moving on , let 's be clear on why Krugman thinks the above chart is so damning to the goldbugs .
By 1937 , if you rank the nations ' industrial output relative to 1929 levels , the order is Japan , Britain , Germany , the United States , and finally France .
Now if you ask ,
In what order did countries abandon the gold standard ?
Why , the answer ( Krugman tells us , after making the correction to his original post ) is the same !
So , this is apparently decisive evidence that abandoning gold was the way to get out of the Great Depression .
Quibbles With Dating
The first problem with Krugman 's demonstration is that he 's got his dates wrong .
For example , Krugman himself reproduces the following correction from economic historian Peter Temin :
Germany went off gold before the UK in 1931 , in July and August , that is , before late September when the UK devalued .
The story however is a bit complex because Germany went off gold by eliminating the free flow of gold .
They kept the value of the mark steady all through the Nazi period ( see Adam Tooze 's good book ) , but they controlled the flow of foreign exchange .
The reason that this does not show up on your graph is that the German chancellor in 1931 ( Bruening ) followed the dictates of the gold standard in 1931 , keeping interest rates high and deflating the economy .
This is what I called the gold - standard mentality in Lessons from the Great Depression ( 1989 ) .
So we already see nuances in the official story .
Really , it 's not tying a currency to gold per se that was the problem ; the real problem was refusing to devalue a currency ( which the gold standard made difficult ) .
But then we have another problem .
In the chart , Japan is the best example .
They apparently go off gold first , they have an almost immediate recovery , and they end up with the highest 1937 production .
So here 's my problem :
Why do all these various sites ( e.g. here and here ) from Google tell me that Japan abandoned the gold standard in December 1931 — several months after Great Britain ( in September 1931 ) ?
Now , Japan had only gone back on gold the prior year , in January 1930 , so maybe that 's what Krugman 's dateline is based on .
In other words , whoever is telling Krugman that Japan went off gold first , might be dismissing the January 1930 –December 1931 period as insignificant .
Be that as it may , all five of the countries under discussion were on a gold ( exchange ) standard as of January 1931 .
Then , if you ask in what order did they sever their currencies ' ties to gold , the actual ranking is : Germany , Britain , Japan , the United States , and France .
Notice that the " perfect " correlation cited by Krugman has broken down significantly .
Yes , the 4th and 5th countries go off gold end up ranked 4th and 5th , respectively , in terms of industrial output in 1937 .
But the other three countries are now ranked as if the correlation is precisely the reverse of Krugman 's original claim .
That is , the 3rd country to go off gold ( Japan ) is ranked 1st in output , the 2nd country to go off gold ( Britain ) is ranked 2nd in output , and the 1st country to go off gold ( Germany ) is ranked 3rd in output .
If we just looked at those three countries , we would conclude that " history shows " abandoning the gold standard was the way to cripple your economic recovery .
Krugman can cite other policies if he wants .
That 's the tack Brad DeLong takes , when he titles his version of the chart to indicate that a country needs to go off gold and start its " New Deal " for the medicine to work .
I 'm simply pointing out here that it seems Krugman 's history concerning dates of abandoning gold is just wrong .
When the " pattern " really only works for three out of five countries , it 's time to drop the particular argument and find a different one to make your point .
Does Industrial Output Really Respond to Devaluation ?
Let 's move beyond the quibbles over particular dates .
If it turned out that Krugman 's original ordering of historical devaluations were correct , would that give fans of the gold standard something to worry about ?
Not really .
Remember , the appeal of the above chart is that it seems to show that from 1929 – 1937 , industrial output is proportional to the speed with which a country abandoned its currency 's peg to gold .
But what is so magical about 1929 – 1937 ?
I think the only thing objective about it is that 1937 is the first year all of these countries had abandoned their peg .
If we lengthened the time frames , what would happen ?
After all , the Great Depression certainly was n't over in 1937 , so it 's not clear that we 're seeing the full story with Eichengreen 's chart .
I do n't have convenient access to the raw figures , but it would n't surprise me if the ranking bounced around if you took a snapshot in 1938 or 1939 .
Naturally , the military situation in Europe would be relevant here — but then again , it was relevant in 1937 as well .
Even if we look at the data in the selected time frame , though , it 's not obvious that abandoning gold should be credited with rescuing various countries ' industrial output .
Rather than simply comparing 1929 output to 1937 output , and then comparing the countries ' ranking in this respect to the order in which they abandoned gold , we can use the above chart to see the allegedly beneficial effects of devaluation play out over time .
For example , Germany and the United States both experienced a significant rebound in ( the annual average of ) industrial output from 1932 to 1933 .
Krugman wants to credit the abandonment of gold with this feat .
Yet France also experienced just as significant a recovery from 1932 to 1933 , even though it stayed tied to gold until 1936 .
So , although the chart plausibly shows the benefits to Japan and Britain for going off gold in 1931 , it certainly does n't show the benefits to the United States and Germany .
Of course , Krugman could say that it was the United States and German recovery that lifted France as well — but that causality does n't jump out from the chart itself .
And Krugman was citing the chart as independent evidence of the stupidity of the gold standard .
Finally , let 's look a little more carefully at the case of the United States .
A critic of the gold standard looks at the chart above and concludes , " Sticking with gold drove the economy into the toilet , but once FDR freed the dollar from the peg in March 1933 , it was smooth sailing . "
But no , that 's not what the chart above shows .
Before I can make the point , though , we need to clarify something :
The United States abandoned the historical gold peg at $ 20.67 per ounce in March 1933 when FDR seized Americans ' gold at gunpoint .
Then , he literally set the gold price based on superstitions like " lucky numbers . "
( I explain these apparently crazy claims in my book . )
But in 1934 , the dollar was re-pegged to gold at $ 35 an ounce , where it stayed until that ( allegedly ) conservative free marketeer Nixon truly abandoned the gold standard in 1971 .
See for yourself :
So , with that historical information in hand , look again at Eichengreen 's allegedly damning chart .
Yes , the United States enjoyed a sharp recovery in 1933 relative to 1932 output .
But it also enjoyed significant growth in 1935 and 1936 , well after the dollar had been tied again to gold ( at a lower parity ) .
It 's not obvious at all that it was the gold standard driving the movements of US industrial output during 1929 – 1937 .
Why Going Off Gold Could Have Boosted Output
Remember that " abandoning gold " is n't akin to shaving one 's mustache .
When a country dropped a peg , it effectively ripped off every investor who had been holding assets denominated in it .
Thus it's not surprising that some countries could experience apparent prosperity — especially if we just look at the short run — by abandoning gold .
For an analogy , someone who just bought an expensive house with no down payment , and who does n't plan to apply for more loans anytime soon , could definitely gain a windfall by " abandoning his mortgage " ( assuming the bank could n't seize the property ) .
That does n't mean it 's a shot in the arm for the economy .
( Though of course , all analogies break down in our current crisis .
The pundits really do think " abandoning mortgages " would be a good idea right now ! )
Part of what happened in the 1930s was that the countries who stayed on gold were harmed when other governments reneged on their contractual obligations .
For example , one of the smoking guns in the antigold case is that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates ( after bringing them to unprecedented lows ) in 1931 , in response to Great Britain 's abandonment of gold .
What happened was that investors around the world feared the United States would follow Britain 's example , and so they began redeeming their dollars for gold , thus draining US reserves .
Hence , the Fed had to hike US interest rates to stem the outflow of gold .
Inflation Can Help If the Government Is Propping Up Wages
Another major factor is that governments in the 1930s were interfering with wages and prices more so than at any prior point in ( peacetime ) history .
For example , after the 1929 stock - market crash , President Herbert Hoover began a series of conferences with big business and labor leaders , telling them that cutting wage rates ( the standard response in previous depressions ) would be disastrous , because then the workers would n't make enough to buy the products .
This meant that nominal paychecks fell much more slowly during the early years of the Great Depression than the general price level .
Consequently , if you kept your job , you experienced a higher increase in real ( inflation - adjusted ) wages during the early 1930s , than during the Roaring 1920s !
So , it 's no wonder that unemployment reached record highs during Hoover 's first and only term .
If a president wants to get a huge glut on the labor market during his administration , textbook economics says to prop up wages above their market - clearing level .
Now in this context , when FDR reneged on the US government 's promise to redeem dollars for gold , it allowed the Federal Reserve to flood the economy with new dollars .
The falling price level turned around on a dime , as this chart indicates :
Generally speaking , printing up green pieces of paper does n't make an economy more productive ; it merely redistributes the existing property while making it harder to plan for the future .
But , if the government is also preventing wage rates from falling to their new , market - clearing level , then inflating the currency has the benefit of reducing unemployment .
Of course , this observation is no justification for what FDR did .
Had prices and wages been left to the market , the recovery would have been swift , just as it was in the 1920 – 1921 depression .
Even so , fans of the gold standard need to understand why the economy apparently recovered so quickly after FDR devalued the dollar .
Conclusion
Intuitively , it makes no sense to say that the major dislocations of the world 's economies in the 1930s could have been solved simply by printing up pieces of paper .
When we closely examine the graphical evidence that apparently proves this strange claim , we see it falls apart .
Krugman and Friends need to convince us , first , that their history is accurate , and second , that their charts really prove what they claim .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office projects that the House Democrats ' health care plan that includes a public option would cost $ 871 billion over 10 years , according to two Democratic sources .
CBO also found that the Democrats ' bill reduces the deficit in the first 10 years .
This new CBO estimate , which aides caution is not final , is significantly less than the $ 1.1 trillion price tag of the original House bill that passed out of three committees this summer .
More importantly , it comes under the $ 900 billion cap set by President Obama in his joint address to Congress last month .
CBO analyzed what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls a " more robust " public option -- one that ties reimbursement rates for doctors to current Medicare rates , plus a 5 percent increase .
At a meeting with House Democrats on Tuesday night , Pelosi did not release CBO 's preliminary numbers , but told members that CBO told leaders the House bill would cost well below $ 900 billion .
Aides say final CBO numbers could be released on Wednesday .
Senior Democratic aides told CNN that House Democratic leaders are likely to put this version of the public option favored by liberal Democrats in the final bill they are drafting .
While no final decision has been made , on Tuesday night Speaker Pelosi made the case to House Democrats that this approach saves the most money and would put the House in a better negotiating position when it comes time to negotiate a final health care bill with the Senate .
Pelosi instructed House Democratic Whip Jim Clyburn , D - South Carolina , to begin canvassing all House Democrats on Wednesday to determine whether this bill had enough votes to pass in the House .
According to several sources in the meeting , Pelosi acknowledged she did not currently have the 218 votes needed to pass this version on the House floor , but believed she was close to having around 200 votes .
Moderate , " blue dog " Democrats in the House largely oppose the robust public option and instead argue for a government run insurance option that could negotiate reimbursement rates directly with doctors and hospitals .
CBO 's analysis of that approach was not available according to Democratic sources , but aides say the preliminary analysis shows it does not save as much as the approach pushed by Pelosi .

President Sarkozy had a crowded agenda as chairman of the EU
France 's six - month presidency of the EU in 2008 was one of the most expensive in history , costing about one million euros ( £ 907,000 ) daily , officials say .
The French Court of Accounts put the total cost of the July - December 2008 presidency at 171m euros .
Usually the rotating presidency of the EU costs 70 - 80 m euros .
Only Germany has previously spent as much on it as France , the AFP news agency reports .
The Union of the Mediterranean summit in Paris alone cost 16.6 m euros .
" The scale of this summit , the irregular nature of its procedures and its massive impact on public finances together make this summit a kind of record , " the court report said .
It noted that France spent more than 1 m euros on the summit dinner for 43 heads of state and 653,703 euros on air conditioning , among other expenses .
Big temporary tents and restaurants were installed for the occasion , on 13 July 2008 .
The report said France organised 489 EU events during its presidency , including nine summits , 25 ministerial meetings and 328 seminars and symposiums .
President Nicolas Sarkozy 's expenditure on the presidency overshadowed the previous French presidencies of the EU - in 2000 ( at a cost of 56.9 m euros ) and 1995 ( 14.1 m euros ) .
WASHINGTON — The US manufacturer of the Taser stun gun has advised police not to aim the weapons at the chests of suspects after admitting heart risk concerns for the first time .
Taser International stressed that suffering an “ adverse cardiac event ” after being zapped was “ extremely unlikely , ” but human rights groups say hundreds of people have been killed by the electroshock weapons .

In a bulletin dated October 12 , the Arizona - based company issued new guidelines saying it had “ lowered the recommended point of aim from center of mass to lower - center of mass for front shots . ”
“ When possible , avoiding chest shots with ECDs ( Electronic Control Devices ) avoids the controversy about whether ECDs do or do not affect the human heart , ” it explained .
“ Researchers have concluded that a close distance between the ECD dart and the heart is the primary factor in determining whether an ECD will affect the heart .
The risk is judged to be extremely low in field use , ” it said .
Tasers , which pack a 50,000 - volt punch that can paralyze targets from up to 10 meters ( 30 feet ) away , are used by several police forces around the world , including in Britain , Canada , France , Greece , Israel , and the United States .
Human rights activists have long criticized the stun guns , challenging previous claims from the manufacturer that they are a safe , non-lethal alternative to handguns .

More than 350 people died between 2001 and December last year after being stunned by the weapons , according to Amnesty International , which has been monitoring Taser - related deaths .

Roman Polanski .
After watching the television coverage of the Roman Polanski arrest in Switzerland , I have been amazed by the tolerance the mainline media has shown for the director ’s conviction for raping a 13 - year - old girl in the U.S. in 1977 .
It is as if the act and conviction of the ‘ great ’ director was not really that big of a deal .
After all , is n’t it more important that he produced many highly acclaimed films and that he is among the high society elite ?
Surely these facts make up for this despicable act which was indeed heinous and at that time deserved the stiffest of punishments .
And , although the victim has now nobly forgiven her aggressor , nothing can ever replace her innocence , which once lost can never be regained .
What bothers me most about the whole situation is that any other regular citizen accused of the same action would be characterized as the most vile , foul person on the earth , deserving of being put away for life .
It is this hypocrisy and disdain for any semblance for the rule of law that irks me to no end .
The Founders of this great nation realized that the rule of law was crucial to the maintenance of the republic .
They understood that we would lose our freedom at the very moment we permitted a privileged class to define their own set of rules while imposing a different set of rules upon commoners .
It was with this information in mind that I read about another elitist that has escaped justice and even boasted of his sexual exploits with young boys .
He is none other than the nephew of the late Socialist French president Francois Mitterand .
His name is Frederic Mitterrand and he is France ’s current culture minister .
One only has to wonder what type of “ culture ” this child rapist is promoting to his fellow Frenchmen .
Frédéric Mitterrand .
In his 2005 autobiography entitled “ The Bad Life , ” Mr. Mitterand wrote : “ I got into the habit of paying for boys …
All these rituals of the market for youths , the slave market excite me enormously . ”
He added : “ One could judge this abominable spectacle from a moral standpoint but it pleases me beyond the reasonable . ”
And finally : “ The profusion of very attractive and immediately available young boys puts me in a state of desire that I no longer need to hinder nor hide … as I know that I will not be refused . ”
How could such a man have escaped justice much less become a member of President Sarkozy ’s cabinet ?
It was only in June that he joined the cabinet and “ was considered a great catch for Mr. Sarkozy and proof of his ‘ open ’ style of government ; the minister comes from a grand Socialist family and is admired by many in the Left - wing cultural establishment .
Carla Bruni-Sarkozy , the first lady , was said to have had a hand in his nomination . ” ( 1 )
What respect does this man deserve especially among the “ cultural establishment ” ?
Clearly , his cultural preferences are despicable .
The rule of law would dictate that he be prosecuted for his crime at the victim ’s discretion .
Any Frenchmen with a sense of preserving their liberty should demand he be subject to the same punishment they themselves would be .
Have we really reached a point where the common man is judged to a different standard than the cultural and political elite ?
Can a civilized society exist where the prosecution for rape occurs on the one hand but not on the other ?

I am perplexed about how France could have degraded to such an extent that the protection of innocent children is no longer viewed as sacrosanct .
Indeed , the most important responsibility of any government should be to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority .
What more important and defenseless minority do we have than our children ?
It is their right to freedom from coercion and manipulation , especially into sexual acts by an adult majority , which should be guarded most vociferously .
“ Bear in mind this sacred principle , that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail , that will to be rightful must be reasonable ; that the minority possess their equal rights , which equal law must protect , and to violate would be oppression . ”
– Thomas Jefferson
To top it all off , guess who has been the most ardent defender of Roman Polanski ?
Why , none other than Mr. Mitterrand .
He called Mr. Polanski ’s latest ordeal “ callous ” and “ absolutely horrifying . ”
No , Mr. Mitterand , you and Mr. Polanski are what I would call “ absolutely horrifying . ”
Indeed , you expect that your actions should be judged by a different standard of whether you were able to get away with it or not .
Only an elitist such as yourself would expect such a standard .
As you put it , “ I no longer need to hinder nor hide …as I know that I will not be refused . ”
Since when in our society has the rules of our behavior been judged by whether we were refused or not ?
Clearly , for Mr. Mitterand and among many of the elites , this is so .
Would we be afforded the same leniency ?
I sincerely doubt it .

As a vampire investigator , Alex O'Loughlin was okay .
As a surgeon , Alex O'Loughlin does n't make the cut .
I 'm sorry to put it so bluntly , but it 's the truth .
Every conversation he has is more difficult than the next to watch .
Behind the cool high - tech hospital is an emptiness .
There 's patients , doctors , surgeons , administrators , and all sorts of people you 'd find at a hospital , but at the end of the day , nothing really stood out and nothing really mattered .
The fairly interesting plot is almost derailed by the dialogue which is uncomfortable to watch due to the total absurdity .
There are two separate situations that come together at the end of the episode , one annoying African guy who needs a heart transplant who does n't factor into the episode at all , and one boy who has an itch in his brain .
Some guy falls and is brain dead , another pregnant woman 's heart needs a replacement .
Problem solved , right ?
No !!
After some inhuman behavior ( someone random hospital worker running up to a family member and chiding her for rethinking the donation ) , the family relents and the pregnant woman gets a new heart and the baby is saved as well .
The boy has tweezers in his stomach and Dr. Foster ( Katherine Moennig ) talks to the father .
As always , the situation goes like this : the father bristles at any suggestion the family is to fault , doctor apologizes , father realizes she 's right , doctor treats patient , everyone is happy .
I 've seen the angry family member too many times to remember , but to writers , it never gets old .
I 'm not even sure people react like that in real life .
All it does is make the family member look stupid , because the main character is always right , and everyone lives in the end , most often from a medical procedure .
And then there 's the other problems .
The editing was the most horrendous stuff I 've seen in a while .
Before the end of every commercial , they 'd show 3 situations side - by - side except they'd be in all green , red , or yellow to create the most distasteful crap on television I 've seen in a while .
It 's not innovative , it 's stupid .
The music was equally horrible with primarily rock using a very obnoxious drum that made me want to turn it off .
Occasionally when the location changed , it was accompanied by an idiotic sound of something sliding , and followed in rapid succession with the drums .
Minus the dialogue , the writing was n't terrible which is the only reason why I 'm not giving it a 2/10 .
The casting and characters are fine for the most part and the show could work as an average medical drama , but for all the attention this show was getting a while back ( I'm guessing because of Alex O'Loughlin ) , Three Rivers really underwhelmed .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The World Health Organization is looking into reports in Britain and the United States that the H1N1 flu may have developed resistance to Tamiflu in people with severely suppressed immune systems , a spokesman said Tuesday .
Britain ’s Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) said five cases have been confirmed in Wales of patients infected with H1N1 resistant to oseltamivir -- the generic name of Roche and Gilead Sciences Inc ’s antiviral drug Tamiflu .
The patients had serious conditions that suppressed their immune systems , which can give the virus a better than usual opportunity to develop resistance , the HPA said .
It said the drug - resistant strain had probably spread person to person .
“ We have seen the reports , we need to look into them , ” WHO spokesman Thomas Abraham said in Geneva .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week also reported four cases of H1N1 resistant to Tamiflu at Duke University Hospital in North Carolina .
All were said to be very ill with underlying severely compromised immune systems and multiple other complex medical conditions .
The WHO spokesman said both the reports involved Tamiflu resistance in people with severely compromised immune systems .
“ We ’ll see if we need to put any additional measures in place to protect this vulnerable group of patients .
It might mean that they are at more serious risk than others , ” Abraham said .

People with suppressed immune systems , such as those undergoing chemotherapy or suffering from HIV are more likely to fall ill from infections .
The WHO has previously reported cases of the pandemic virus being resistant to oseltamivir but says these are rare .
Abraham , asked whether the cases in Wales would be the first instance of person - to - person transmission of a Tamiflu - resistant form , replied : “ As far as I know there have been possibilities but it never has been conclusively shown . ”
H1N1 , a mixture of swine , bird and human viruses , has killed at least 6,770 people globally , according to the WHO .
Most people suffer mild symptoms such as aches or fever , but recover without special treatment , it says .
Separately , the WHO said it was still probing whether a mutation in the H1N1 influenza strain , detected most recently in Norway last week , is causing the severest symptoms among those infected .
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said last Friday the mutation could affect the virus ’ ability to go deeper into the respiratory system , causing more serious illness .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ It is a major issue we are looking at , ” Abraham said .
“ If the mutation in fact is associated with severe cases then we really need to know about it .
This might be a signal .
We need to investigate , ” he said .
“ As of now there is no evidence of a particular association with severe cases . ”
So far , antiviral drugs and vaccines have been effective against the mutated form , he said .
There have now been four cases of mutated virus in patients in Norway , following a similar mutation in H1N1 viruses circulating in several other countries since April , he said .
The other countries are Brazil , China , Japan , Mexico , Ukraine and the United States .
“ What we ’ve seen has been pretty much equal in terms of severe and non-severe cases , ” Abraham said .
You may have noticed that the Transportation Security Administration , the agency charged with safeguarding America ’s transportation systems , has a thing for video .
Last week , when it was accused of taking a passenger ’s child during screening , TSA released footage of the woman that shows it never happened .
And yesterday , it posted images of Rep. Jason Chaffetz ’s screening incident at Salt Lake City International Airport ( scroll down for the videos ) .
The congressman had reportedly gotten into a verbal scuffle over the agency ’s use of full - body scanning technology .
You may have also noticed that just yesterday , the agency announced $ 4.9 million in funding for airport surveillance at Philadelphia International Airport .
That ’s a whole lotta taping going on .

Whether you want to call , click , or use one of our travel apps , one thing is clear :
We make it easy to take it easy .
So what ’s the deal with the TSA and video ?
I asked the agency .
Closed - circuit television technology ( CCTV ) is in place at hundreds of airports across the country , although the TSA declines to name the ones that have it , and , more importantly , which ones do n’t .
The government does n’t own the CCTV systems .
Instead , TSA partners with the airport to fund and install cameras at security checkpoints .
TSA provided $ 70 million in funding to install CCTV installation at 20 airports in fiscal 2009 , according to the agency .
How long is the footage archived ?
While each airport has its own policies regarding archived videos and the length of time they are saved , TSA includes an agreement for airports to archive a minimum of 30 days .
There is no audio .
Airport CCTV “ is video only , ” according to TSA .
Who has access to the footage ?
Airports , local law enforcement officers and TSA all can view the tape .
How about air travelers ?
The answer was a little vague .
“ The airport authority in partnership with TSA makes the determination on who has access to view the video , ” a spokeswoman told me .
In other words , you might be able to view footage of your own screening just for the asking , but I would n’t count on it .
You might need to get a court order or file a Freedom of Information Request ( FOIA ) .
So who decides whether the video is released ?
It depends on the investigative , security and privacy considerations , as well as airport authority approval .
“ In the interest of transparency , in some instances we will post the video before the FOIA process is complete , ” a spokeswoman told me .
I ’m left with the impression that TSA ’s video policy , like its CCTV systems , is a work in progress .
If the agency can decide to post screening footage of anyone , for any reason , but average citizens may have to file a FOIA request for the same consideration , I think there are those who might consider that a double standard .
But is there a better way ?
Can all CCTV material be posted to a public site ?
Should it be ?
The existence of these videos also raise larger questions about a surveillance society and our right to privacy .
Questions that ca n’t be answered in this post , but are certainly worth asking .
Personally , I do n’t have a problem with the TSA taping my screening .
But if it does , I think it ’s only fair that I ’m allowed to videotape or photograph my own screening , too .
And that is n’t always allowed , even though technically , it should be , according to the agency .

In waging its war in Afghanistan , the Obama administration faces a big problem , and his name is Hamid Karzai .
This fashion plate , whose name has become synonymous with corruption , claims to be the president of Afghanistan , but this is a double fiction .
In reality , he is , at most , the mayor of Kabul , never having managed to secure control of the rest of the country in all his years in office .
Moreover , his legitimacy is also called into question on account of his having stolen a million - plus votes in the recent Afghan election .
Forced into a runoff anyway with his closest competitor , Abdullah Abdullah , Karzai is understandably miffed .
After all , he is no doubt familiar with Chicago - style politics and probably expected the administration to go along with his electoral grand larceny .
However , the resignation of a prominent U.S. official involved with the election process over the blatant , U.S. - enabled fraud made this politically impossible for Obama , so Karzai must go through the motions once more .
Understandably resentful of his patrons ’ unwillingness to give him cover – honor among thieves , and all that – Karzai has lately taken to attacking the Americans as fickle and flighty .
In a recent interview with CNN , he asked :
" Is the United States a reliable partner with Afghanistan ?
Is the West a reliable partner with Afghanistan ?
Have we received the commitments that we were given ?
Have we been treated like a partner ? "
If we Americans are so unreliable , then why does n’t Karzai find new patrons ?
Maybe the Russians will be amenable to coming back into the country , given the right deal .
Then again , maybe not .
In any case , there are plenty of other possible candidates for the role of Afghan sugar daddy : what about the Chinese ?
They ’re rolling in cash , and they do n’t seem to be the types that would be sticklers for the integrity of the democratic process .
Failing that , I suggest Karzai abandon the fiction that Afghanistan is an actual country , and go the corporate route : he can file papers in , say , Delaware , issue stock , appoint a board of directors packed with the politically powerful , and then lobby for a bailout from the Obama administration .
They can argue Afghanistan , Inc. , is " too big to fail . "
That should garner sufficient sympathy in Washington , especially when Karzai points out how many American jobs are on the line if his government / company goes down .
What will all those U.S. exporters , including mercenary outfits like Dyncorp and war profiteers like Dianne Feinstein ’s husband , do if Karzai & Co. goes the way of Lehman Brothers ?
Faced with this farcical tragicomedy , no wonder Matthew Hoh walked out of his job as the top U.S. civilian official in Zabul province .
Hoh , a former Marine officer , is a veteran of the Iraq war , where he served from 2004 - 07 .
He signed on to the Foreign Service and was sent to Afghanistan , where he was the senior political officer in his region .
In a letter to his superiors that has been posted online , Hoh wrote that he decided to step down because
" I have lost understanding of and confidence in the strategic purposes of the United States ’ presence in Afghanistan .
I have doubts and reservations about our current strategy and planned future strategy , but my resignation is based not upon how we are pursuing this war , but why and to what end .
To put [ it ] simply : I fail to see the value or worth in continued U.S. casualties or expenditures of resources in support of the Afghan government in what is , truly , a 35 - year old civil war . "
This is significant because
Hoh is challenging the fundamental premise on which our policy is based : the idea that there is anything in Afghanistan worth fighting and dying for .
It is n’t a matter of how to win , but whether " victory " is possible , definable , or even desirable .
This is a qualitatively different critique from that of Democrats in Congress and the vice president ’s office who want to carry out a " counterterrorism " strategy , as opposed to launching a full - fledged counterinsurgency campaign .
For the first time in this war , someone in a position to know what we are doing over there is condemning the policy root and branch .
Hoh notes we are fast approaching the ninth anniversary of our attempted occupation of Afghanistan – the same length of time the Soviets ’ Red Army managed to stay .
The parallels are truly ominous , because we know what happened to them .
Hoh is implicitly asking whether the U.S. is prepared to suffer the same fate .
We are , he writes , just " a supporting actor " in a drama that is centuries old .
Like the Soviets , the U.S. / NATO alliance has intervened on behalf of the urban , educated northern elite in their ongoing struggle with the illiterate and deeply religious Pashtun majority in the southern part of the country – an internecine battle that has been going on , in its modern phase , since at least the end of the Afghan monarchy .
The Afghan insurgents are n’t fighting under " the white banner of the Taliban , " avers Hoh , " but rather against the presence of foreign soldiers and taxes imposed by an unrepresentative government in Kabul . "
They are , in short , Afghan Tea Partiers , the Middle Eastern , modern - day version of the rebels at Lexington and Concord who rose against taxation without representation .
Well , then , why are we fighting them ?
For the same reason King George III and his redcoats fought George Washington and the Continental Army : because that ’s what empires do – put down native rebellions .
I suspect I ’m projecting a bit too much of my Western mindset onto the Afghan insurgents – and Hoh ’s evaluation of them – but the main point here is that the insurgents are not the dreaded Taliban .
We have heard much about the supposed separateness of the Taliban and al - Qaeda , but the reality is that neither group is really running the Afghan insurgency – which , as Hoh puts it , is " composed of multiple , seemingly infinite , local groups . "
Against the Afghan Tea Partiers are arrayed not only our own forces , but also the Afghan government , whose failings , says Hoh , " appear legion and metastatic . "
Karzai ’s advisers are described as " drug lords and war crime villains " who " mock our rule of law " and efforts to stem the drug trade and engage in " unabashed " graft and corruption .
As for local officials , they are nothing more than " opportunists and strongmen allied to the United States solely on account of … our USAID and CERP contracts " and have no real interest in reconciliation of opposing factions .
Hoh takes on President Obama ’s contention that we are fighting to deprive al - Qaeda of " safe havens . "
Why invade just Afghanistan on account of al - Qaeda ’s alleged presence , he asks – why not also invade and occupy Yemen , Somalia , Sudan , and all the other countries where Osama bin Laden ’s followers have carved out a niche ?
And if we ’re so concerned about Pakistan and its nukes falling into the hands of our enemies – an oft - stated rationale , now being touted as the " real " reason we ’re occupying neighboring Afghanistan – then why not just march into Islamabad and be done with it ?
I particularly enjoyed Hoh ’s refutation of the " failed state " argument , which says we must not allow a power vacuum to develop where the bad guys can come in unopposed : on that basis , then , we must " increase our commitment to and involvement in Mexico . "
Yeah , that ’s the ticket : take Mexico City – and remember the Alamo !
Our troops ,
Hoh writes , have waged a heroic – and " Sisyphean " – fight on behalf of what is , ultimately , " a Pollyanna - ish misadventure . "
Sisyphus , you ’ll recall , was an ancient Greek whose wrongdoing was punished by the gods in a most unusual manner : he was made to push a stone up a hill , only to have it roll back down – forever .
A more apt description of our task in Afghanistan can hardly be imagined .
Similarly , he writes , U.S. civilians on the front lines , of which he was one , are charged with carrying out an ill - conceived policy " shaped more by the political climate in Washington , D.C. , than in Afghan cities , villages , mountains , and valleys . "
This illustrates a point I have made quite often of late in this space .
Our foreign policy is made not to advance U.S. interests , rationally and objectively understood , but to propitiate the gods of Washington : the lobbyists , the foreign governments , the economic and political interests that stand to profit – or lose – depending on which way the policy winds blow .
American politics , far from stopping at the water ’s edge , as the bromide would have it , reaches all the way to Kabul .
This is a near - perfect dramatization of the libertarian theory of the state : that our rulers , including government officials and the power - brokers who stand behind them , act only in order to ensure and expand their own power and advance the interests and prestige of their supporters .
This is one very good reason why the power of the U.S. government needs to be reined in and strictly limited – and not just on the home front , but overseas as well .
Concluding his letter , Hoh apologizes for his " ill - tempered " prose and asks us to understand the depths of his passion : he , after all , has been there , unlike our laptop bombardiers who write endless newspaper columns urging us onward to " victory . "
He has seen good men and women sacrificed on the altar of the ever hungry god of American hubris , and he can no longer assure the families and loved ones of the fallen that " their dead have been sacrificed for a purpose worthy of futures lost , love vanished , and promised dreams unkept . "
In his letter , Hoh cites an unnamed commander who greets visitors with the news that " we are spending ourselves into oblivion . "
Well , it ’s good to know some in our military have a clear view of the problem , even if the administration ’s favored economists do n’t .
" We are , " writes Hoh , " mortgaging our nation ’s economy on a war which , even with increased commitment , will remain a draw for years to come . "
The timeline he projects is not in years , but in decades – in a generation or so , we may achieve " victory , " whatever that may mean .
Or we may not .
In the meantime , the nation – our nation – is bleeding and losing its vital sustenance at a pace that is frightening and ominous .
Is anybody in Washington awake ?
Are any of the " progressives " listening ?
Do we have to crash on the rocks of yet another foreign joyride and arise one day to find that we ’ve squandered the country ’s wealth – and murdered the cream of our youth – in the cause of corruption ?

I had n’t seen it before but it looks like it was posted on Youtube a few weeks ago .
It ’s difficult to know how accurate the video representation of the circuit is .
Taking it at face value , it seems to share some innovations with Yas Island , home of this weekend ’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .
In particular the run -off areas seem quite small , perhaps because they ’re planning to use the same Tecpro barriers found at Abu Dhabi .
Having said that some of the barrier details look completely unrealistic – the piles of tyres on the inside of some corners , for instance .
The unusual final turn loops around a bay full of yachts which seems to be a pre-requisite for new tracks at the moment .
The 2010 South Korean Grand Prix will be held on the 15 - 17th of October .

Children 's Scorecard ( Excel - PDF )
I developed this for my 8 year old son .
He likes to keep a scorecard while we are at the game , but he is only interested in charting the players ' progress around the bases .
So , I made a card that is easy for him to use and does not include batting or pitching statistics .
1st , 2nd , and 3rd base are represented in the scoreboxes by circled numbers .
Home is a diamond .
My son shades each base where the batter / runner comes to rest and then makes any notations that are necessary .
He used to draw lines between the bases but stopped when he realized that he could place his notations between the bases instead of in the corners .
By looking at the shaded characters , he is able to tell how far each batter / runner advanced during the inning .
At the bottom of each inning is a place to record runs for the inning and to keep a running score .
If you decide to download the Excel version , make sure you have the WingDings 2 font installed on your system .
Otherwise , the characters in the scoreboxes will not show up properly .

DS Scorecards
" Since most scorers are more interested in one team than the other , the attached p1 sheets are for the " home " or favorite team , while p2 versions are for the " enemy " team .
Note that this also eliminates repetition / duplication ; i.e. , entering stuff twice for one game , like the line score .
These sheets were created for youth play ( 7 innings ) .
One set allows pitch - tracking in the barely - visible circles within each batter 's square , and includes columns for total balls pitched ( B ) and strikes thrown ( S ) by each pitcher .
( To more closely adhere to newspaper box scores , the B could be changed to P ( total Pitches ) ) .
' OE ' is reached On an Error , G is groundballs hit ( regardless of hit or out ) , L is line drives hit , F is flyballs hit , and P is popups hit .
They all get recorded in the one big square , keeping the number of G's in the lower left , L's in the center , and F's and P's in the upper right , separated by a slash .
This is very helpful for coaches to diagnose a batter 's strengths / weaknesses , and suggest the proper swing adjustment . " -- David A. Sears , a certified scorer in Cincinnati , Ohio , created these scorecards and provided the description .

Since most youth leagues require every child to play a minimum number of innings , Russ has included a set of columns to track which innings each child has played .
Sex is like crushed red pepper : guaranteed to add heat and spice to recipes that would otherwise be as bland and boring as unflavoured farina .
Consider this dull economic dictum : " Service workers who enjoy their jobs generate more enthusiastic ( and lucrative ) customer response than workers with a bad attitude . "
How obvious !
A rude , unfriendly waiter gets smaller tips from diners .
Even writers like me would n't land decent commissions if our every pitch to an editor carried the undertone " I hate you , Guardian .
I loathe writing for you , and I 'd never do it if I did n't have to support three kids and a cocaine habit . "
No one would deny that " attitude matters " regarding waiters or writers , but observing that a sad and desperate prostitute makes less money than a happy , confident one – as authors Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner do in their new tome Superfreakonomics – generates a controversy that would never exist without that peppery red sex addition spicing up the farina .
My own take on sex work is arguably more liberal than the norm , since I spent my youth working somewhere between waiter and hooker on the service - industry spectrum : to support myself through college and graduate school , I worked as a stripper .
( Actually , " exotic dancer " was the preferred nomenclature when I started in the overly religious part of the American south .
No actual stripping was allowed – we usually wore spangled bikinis on stage , and not until moving to the staid American northeast did I strip down as far as " fully topless " . )
Exotic dancing !
What a marvellous job that was for an 18 - year - old college student who at the time had few other marketable credentials : doll up , jiggle the twins a bit and make more money in an hour than a McDonald 's burger - flipper got all week .
The only real downside came from the condescending attitudes of those who insisted that , to avoid exploitation , I should 've exchanged my bikinis and body glitter for a polyester uniform and made one - tenth as much money hauling fries out of a vat of oil .
Given the dismal state of the economy and my own finances , I 'd go back to part - time dancing this second if I were 10 years younger .
Maybe five .
I did work at McDonald 's in high school , and it was possibly the most exploitative job I 've held .
Those customers had zero interest in me as a person and viewed me merely as a way to get a piece of meat ( with a side order of fries ) .
There 's certainly a world of difference between being a stripper and a prostitute , but both share certain qualities : an unsavoury , sexually charged reputation ; the chance to make far more money than the " respectable " jobs generally available to such workers ; and in both cases , any unpleasant aspects are made immeasurably worse by make - it - go - away moralising .
The women who work at legal , regulated brothels in Nevada or the Netherlands are far less likely to be hurt by abusive customers than the illegal prostitutes who fear not only clients but also the cops .
And unhappy , desperate , low - paid street prostitutes would n't exist if people could work openly in or frequent legal whorehouses , any more than sleazy speakeasies selling blindness - inducing bathtub gin remained in America after we ended alcohol prohibition .
As a dancer I mostly worked in shoddy neighbourhoods but was exponentially safer than any prostitutes in the vicinity , not because I did n't have sex and they did but because my colleagues and I could view cops and security guards as our protectors , not people out to ruin our lives with criminal records .
If prostitution were as safe as any other legal and regulated business , there would be nothing controversial about Superfreakonomics or anyone else saying " The ones who like their jobs do better than the ones who do n't . "
That was certainly true when I was dancing .
One of my single most lucrative nights came when , as soon as I got on stage , I climbed atop the pole and hung suspended several feet above the floor , then called out to the crowd , " I do celebrity impersonations !
Free table dance to the first man who figures out who I am . "
Then , keeping my legs wrapped around the pole , I fell back and hung upside - down , with my eyes closed and my fingertips dangling a foot above the stage , and when the audience gave up guessing I flipped back to an upright position and called out .... wait for it ....
" Mussolini ! "
And my God , how the money rolled in .
See ?
Attitude matters .
undermining biology , one class at a time
A new study confirms what science advocates have long suspected .
Creationism in the classroom undermines the quality of student 's education .
Illustration by Amorphia Apparel
We know full well that teachers bring their personal opinions into the classroom even though they ’re not really supposed to do that .
In some cases , that does n’t matter .
Your beliefs about today ’s politics in the Middle East wo n’t suddenly change the rules of math .
However , when it comes to important events in history or disciplines like biology and astronomy , teachers can and will skew how they explain the basic tenants of cosmology and evolution .
So if you ’re a devoted creationist who just ca n’t resist the chance to proselytize to students and save their souls from the neo-Darwinian path to Hell , chances are that you ’re going to do it , damn the laws and the guidelines which demand that you teach the subject on the basis of facts .
But the big question is whether this breach will have any lasting effects on those students when they enter college .
The short answer ?
Yes , it will .
Two biology professors at the University of Minnesota surveyed a thousand freshmen taking biology classes to find out what sort of biology education they received and how it shaped their opinions .
Their answers were then further divided into those who would be majoring in biology and those who had other plans .
The results showed that a majority of students were sympathetic to creationist views if they were exposed to them .
Oddly though , while as many as 78 % of students who were educated in the basics of evolutionary theory without a creationist intervention thought it was a scientifically valid concept , the numbers fell to 57 % for those given an unwarranted dose of religion in their science classes .
The difference between biology major and non-majors on the lower bound ?
Just 2 % fewer majors expressed doubt on the scientific merits of evolution .
To put that in proper perspective , as many as 41 % of biology majors had doubts about the scientific merit of a theory which underpins their future field of study and has the support of 99 % of experts who study it .
In their explanations for why almost a third of high school classes are teaching creationism , the authors note that almost 25 % do n’t know that it ’s unconstitutional to teach religious ideas in the classroom since it would be a violation of the establishment clause .
And of course the buzzards at the Discovery Institute were all over this with their Wedge Doctrine tactic of pretending they have something legitimate to teach students …
While these statements are legally correct , they leave out a crucial point of law that the NCSE may not wish to publicize : “ scientific critiques of prevailing scientific theories [ may ] be taught provided that such curricula are enacted with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of [ the existing ] science instruction . ”
Memo to the genius who wrote this .
Creationism is about as far from secularism as you could possibly get in any context , whether scientific or rhetorical .
And do n’t give me the nonsense about intelligent design being its own , secular thing because we all know full well that it ’s Christian apologetics drowned in technobabble and advanced by incompetent , self - aggrandizing cranks and an egomaniacal , dishonest scientist along with a whiny lawyer who never stops complaining .
Need a court ruling on the subject ?
How does Kitzmiller v. Dover fit ?
You know , the court ruling which found that ID is just a fancy name for creationism ?
I noticed for some odd reason , the brilliant mind behind this loophole forgot to mention this case in his list of surveyed legal material for the article .
But hey , if you pretend that transitional fossils do n’t exist even though they pack museums all over the world , how hard can it be to forget a four year old trial that shows your loophole as nothing more than smoke and mirrors on feet of clay ?
You can crow all you want about teaching controversies and enhancing education but in the end of the day , if you ’re teaching religious doctrines that will retard the progress of an entire scientific field , you deserve a swift and merciless reprisal .
And if you ’re smugly proud of yourself as you teach the equivalent of putting a square peg in round holes , not only are you a failure as a teacher , you ’re a proselytizing hack who took advantage of a trusting audience .
If you ’re wondering why the U.S. is starting to lose ground in scientific advancements , just take a look in the nearest mirror .
Good job .
Proud of yourself now ?

We ’ve compiled a list of Python ’s 20 greatest sketches ( 15 - 20 below ) from The Life of Python as a tribute to the Flying Circus and some of the silliest comedians of our time .
11 . Spam
“ Spam ” is a Monty Python sketch , first televised in 1970 and written by Terry Jones and Michael Palin .
In the sketch , two customers are lowered by wires into a greasy spoon café and try to order a breakfast from a menu that includes Spam in almost every dish , much to the consternation of one of the customers .
12 . Cheese Shop
A simple premise : man walks into an empty cheese shop , asking for every cheese under the sun , none of which are available .
Cleese again delivers with consummate skill for a superb sketch .
13 . The Bruces ’ Philosophers Song
Any sketch that can ridicule history ’s greatest thinkers with lines such as “ René Descartes was a drunken fart – I drink , therefore I am , ” deserves the utmost praise .
14 . How Not to Be Seen
Done in the style of a public service announcement , How Not to Be Seen is as amusing as it is ridiculous .
15 . Hitler in England
Hitler lodged in a Somerset boarding house , wonderful .

Ever wondered how do the battle looks like for real at night ?
I mean , not as seen by Hollywood movie but a real battle with real combat units , tanks and commanders ?
People say that sometimes it is even more picturesque than in the movies , and here is the report from the Russian army playwar maneuveres that took place recently .
via pesochinsky
Having their car stolen in San Francisco turned out to be just the start of the wild ride for out - of - towners Patrick McDonald and Linda Rogers .
It started back in mid-August , when the couple - he 's from San Jose and she 's from Auburn ( Placer County ) - stepped out of Mel 's Diner on Van Ness Avenue to find their 2004 Toyota 4 Runner was gone , along with thousands of dollars worth of bikes and other gear they were using in triathlon training .
A couple of weeks later , police found the SUV parked on a city street - but because McDonald and Rogers could n't make the 15 - minute deadline to pick it up , the cops had it towed to a storage yard .
After shelling out $ 380 for the towing , storage and processing , the couple found that their bikes and other equipment were gone .
In their place were 20 empty purses , backpacks , credit cards , drug paraphernalia , burglary tools and DVDs on how to pick locks - plus the Canadian immigration ID card of the woman who may have stolen the car , and phone numbers for her relatives .
McDonald and Rogers phoned police , only to be told that the cops would n't investigate because the evidence was too circumstantial and , " anyway , the D.A. wo n't prosecute . "
So , the couple called us and we phoned Police Chief George Gascón , who promised a swift investigation .
Fast forward to Sept. 23 , when police arrested 39 - year - old Melissa Small of Canada on suspicion of car theft and possession of stolen property .
It turns out she was also wanted in Placer County , and that she was in the country illegally and under orders from immigration to wear a tracking bracelet on her ankle while awaiting deportation .
But here 's the real capper .
When police went to arrest her at immigration offices in the federal high - rise at 630 Sansome St. , they emptied her purse and discovered a pair of knives , a sharp metal file and a couple of drug syringes .
All of which she had gotten past the building 's metal detectors .
Gavin going south :
It 's make it or break it time for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom 'sgubernatorial run .
Ex -President Bill Clinton 's endorsement and his touch - down in Los Angeles on Monday to help Newsom raise money are seen by many as the mayor 's last chance to kick - start a campaign that is lagging in the polls , endorsements and funding .
It does n't help matters much that DreamWorks titans Steven Spielberg , Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen have announced their own Tinseltown fundraiser for Newsom 's rival , state Attorney General JerryBrown .
" It 's a huge victory , " said campaign strategist Ace Smith , a former consultant to both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Brown who is not affiliated with either gubernatorial hopeful now .
" It signals that the Hollywood world has come down on a side . "
Plus , Clinton 's endorsement has n't exactly been the game changer that Team Newsom was hoping for .
Since the much - ballyhooed announcement , the Newsom campaign has reported only seven major contributions of more than $ 5,000 , for a total of $ 55,000 .
And as unaffiliated political consultant Chris Lehane , a former Clinton White House spokesman , said : " The only poll that counts at this stage of the game is who 's raising money . "
So far , Brown has outraised Newsom , 7 to 1 .
And now that Brown has opened up his official gubernatorial committee , he 'll be able to raise three times as much money per donor .
But before anyone starts counting his guy out , Newsom campaign strategist Garry South is quick to point out that the last big winner he had for governor , Gray Davis , raised only $ 917,000 in the year leading up to the 1998 primary and quickly burned through most of it .
" We know what happened , " South said .
" Gray beat the other two Democrats 3 to 1 after having been outspent 6 to 1 . "
Up in smoke : San Francisco Police Chief George Gascón 's news conference Wednesday trumpeting the raids of 36 marijuana grow houses in the Sunset since January got a lot of attention .
But , according to vice Capt .
Denis O'Leary , what 's equally important is that District Attorney Kamala Harrisactually pressed charges in all but one of the 45 grow - house cases that his unit brought from August 2008 to August 2009 .
Then again , police say , few if any of the defendants in the roughly 20 percent of the cases resolved so far have gone to prison .
Most were released on probation .
Maybe so , says D.A. spokeswoman Erica Derryck , but those were largely straightforward " possession and cultivation " cases - not ones involving more serious charges such as weapons possession .
" The remaining more serious cases are still being prosecuted by this office , which believes strongly in stopping illegal marijuana grows , " she said .

The EU is struggling to present a united front on funds to fight global warming EU leaders are trying to break an impasse over funding to help poor countries combat global warming on the last day of their Brussels summit .
Sweden 's prime minister called on EU leaders to set a fixed sum , paving the way for other rich donors like the US and Japan to make similar pledges .
But a coalition of nine poorer European nations has threatened to block a deal unless richer EU countries pay more .
Earlier leaders agreed a deal to secure the ratification of the Lisbon treaty .
The Czechs were granted an opt - out from the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights , similar to that of the UK and Poland .
The Czechs are the only one of the 27 EU nations not to have ratified the treaty , which aims to streamline decision - making and bolster the bloc 's role on the world stage .
EU leaders also moved no closer to agreement on a prospective president of the European Council , with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair 's chances of securing the role receding .
Climate wrangle Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Friday that EU leaders had reached consensus on what to offer other countries at December 's UN climate conference in Copenhagen .
" Europe is making three conditional offers , money on the table , saying we will do everything we can to make a climate change deal happen , " he said on Friday .
The EU is committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 and by up to 30 % if other countries join in .
But the BBC's Oana Lungescu , in Brussels , says that with just weeks to go before the Copenhagen summit , Europeans are struggling over how much money to offer developing nations to fight the effects of global warming .
The European Commission has recommended EU nations pay up to 15bn euros ( $ 22bn ; £ 13 bn ) a year from 2013 to developing nations .
A draft text of the summit conclusions , seen by the BBC , says EU leaders agree with the European Commission 's estimate that the total cost of climate adaptation in developing countries could reach about 100bn euros ( $ 148bn ; £ 90 bn ) annually by 2020 .
Do the majority of leaders want someone who can get a hearing at the White House , or do they want someone who will build consensus within the European Union ?
Gavin Hewitt , BBC Europe editor
Read Gavin 's thoughts in full Blair ' excellent ' for EU job - PM EU president : Names in the frame
Of that 100bn euros , international public financing is estimated at 22 - 50bn euros annually by 2020 , " subject to a fair burden - sharing at the global level " .
Polish Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski told the BBC that eastern European nations should be allowed to contribute according to their means , not to how much they pollute - otherwise they were ready to block a deal .
" It 's a coalition of nine countries and there are countries there like Bulgaria and Latvia which are considerably poorer than Brazil and which would be expected to help Brazil in its adjustments to climate change , " he said .
The draft conclusions appear to recognise the eastern Europeans ' concerns , saying that the EU contributions for developing countries " should be based on a comprehensive global distribution key " and " should take into account the ability to pay of less prosperous [ EU ] member states , through an internal adjustment mechanism " .
But the EU does not spell out how the member states ' contributions will be calculated - whether their CO2 emissions or their ability to pay will weigh more heavily in the calculation .
The UK and Scandinavian countries had been calling on the EU to put a figure on its climate help for poorer countries , ahead of the Copenhagen summit in December .
Germany 's Chancellor Angela Merkel was reluctant however to commit to a figure .
The EU says it is " more than ever fully determined to play a leading role " in the climate negotiations , which it says need " new momentum " .
But the draft conclusions also call for firm commitments from other developed countries .
In the US , a bill on cutting CO2 emissions is still going through Congress .
Aid agencies say a deal on climate financing for poorer countries is crucial for the outcome of Copenhagen summit .
Tim Gore , a spokesman for Oxfam International , told the BBC that so far , the EU 's figures were " about half of what we say is needed from the EU " .
" We need the right EU signal to build the momentum needed ahead of Copenhagen , " he added .
' Blair hopes fading ' President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso said on Thursday that reaching a deal to secure the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty had been a long process .
" You know , this new treaty reminds me of a marathon but a marathon with hurdles and I believe that tonight we have removed the last political hurdle , " he told the BBC .
Should the Czech Republic - as now expected - ratify the Lisbon Treaty , it will clear the way for the creation of the post of President of the European Council .
Tony Blair and Luxembourg Premier Jean - Claude Juncker have been touted as the leading candidates for the job .
But the BBC's Jonny Dymond in Brussels says a lack of support from European socialist leaders has served to undermine Mr Blair 's chances .

Something strange is happening in the natural gas and oil markets .
The average real price of natural gas during the last 20 years has been about $ 3.80 per gigajoule , and the average real price of oil in that same period has been about $ 5.90 per gigajoule .
During this time , the long - term ratio between the real price of oil and the real price of natural gas has constantly varied between 1 and 2 with the long - term average hovering at 1.6 .
Since January , however , that ratio has jumped to more than 4 to 1 , which is unprecedented and has implications for long - term energy policy .

Since January , however , that ratio has jumped to more than 4 to 1 , which is unprecedented and has implications for long - term energy policy .
One short - term implication of the low price of natural gas has been low electricity costs across the United States , which is contributing to the slacking interest in alternative energy investment . ”
Much has been written about the relationship between the price of natural gas and the price of oil .
In 2007 , for example , Stephen Brown and Mine Yücel from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas performed an excellent econometric analysis , which corrected for short - term supply and demand disruptions and showed that the price relationship is even stronger than indicated by simply tracking and comparing prices over time .
In particular , they concluded , “ An error - correction model that takes into account crude oil prices , weather , seasonality , and gas storage and gas production disruptions well explains natural gas prices .
Moreover , the model shows that U.S. natural gas prices are related to those of crude oil with natural gas prices adjusting to changes in crude oil prices .
The relationship has complex short - term dynamics , but is quite stable in the long run . ”
Others have built fundamental models to relate the price of natural gas and the price of oil by analyzing the various end users that can switch relatively quickly between the two .
A simple example of this is heating applications , since many residential , commercial , and industrial boilers can burn either natural gas or distillate fuel oil , which has historically been priced about 95 percent that of crude oil .
In such cases , the premium spot price of distillate fuel oil should reflect the higher cost of getting natural gas from Henry Hub–a physical location where several U.S. pipelines meet and is used to set prices for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange –to the end user .
That extra transportation cost has been estimated to be $ 0.50 - $ 1 per gigajoule .
Such fundamental models have done a decent job of explaining the long - term relationship between oil and natural gas prices ; they do about as good as a simple linear regression .
It is nearly impossible , however , to explain the current price anomaly between natural gas and oil with historical data .
So , what ’s going on ?
In 2008 , Terry Engelder , a geosciences professor at Penn State University , claimed that the Marcellus Shale , a geologic formation that extends from Tennessee to New York , would become one of the world ’s “ top super giant gas fields . ”
Engelder is widely considered a foremost expert on Appalachian geology , so his opinion is taken seriously .
Once the media publicized his claims , a land rush for gas - production leases was on in the Appalachian Basin .
Indeed , signing bonuses for gas production leases in the Marcellus Shale jumped from a few hundred dollars per acre to more than $ 2,000 per acre between 2005 and 2008 .
The key to the Marcellus Shale gas deposits is that during the last 300 million years natural gas formed from buried organic matter , all the while expanding and causing vertical fractures in the overlying rock .
After the excess pressure was relieved , the vertical fractures stopped propagating , trapping the gas in thin vertical columns that is difficult to access by traditional vertical drilling .
Recently developed technologies , however , have enabled horizontally drilled wells to contact and reopen these fractures , enabling the economic recovery of gas from the shale .
Over the last year , several wells drilled into the Marcellus Shale have reported initial production rates of more than 4,000 gigajoules of gas per day ( 1 megawatt - hour of electricity production requires 8 - 10 gigajoules of natural gas ) .
At current prices , those wells would initially generate $ 12,000 per day in revenue .
Engelder has estimated the formation ’s ultimate yield by extrapolating these initial production rates along depletion curves from somewhat analogous geologies .
His current estimate is 470 trillion gigajoules .
Since the United States consumes about 22 trillion gigajoules of gas per year , then–assuming Engelder is correct–production from the Marcellus Shale could satisfy current U.S. demand for more than 20 years .
So there ’s little mystery why natural gas prices are so low .
During the last year , what may prove to be the biggest natural gas field in the country started producing , while simultaneously the global financial crisis sent the world into a recession that resulted in a dramatic decline in natural gas demand .
The expectation that demand will decrease further and that supply will increase further has sent long - term gas prices hurdling downward .
But why has the ratio of the price of oil to the price of natural gas changed so dramatically ?
Specifically , why are natural gas prices not depressing oil prices ?
All of the models –both statistical and fundamental–indicate that the price of natural gas is closely related to the price of crude oil .
The most obvious explanation is the time lag in fuel switching .
Some users can switch from oil to gas overnight , but for others , it takes more time .
Since the ratio has trended up for the last three years , most of those who could easily switch probably have already done so .
And thus , with the “ quick ” fuel - switching response more or less complete , additional supply of natural gas has n’t been quickly met with increased demand .
There is , however , enormous potential for additional fuel switching .
Nearly all consumers of distillate fuel oil could–in principle–switch to natural gas , and at the current energy - cost premium of oil relative to gas , there should be little doubt that making such a switch would be economical .
In particular , about 37 percent of distillate fuel oil is used in stationary applications , which are relatively easy to convert to natural gas .
It makes no sense , for example , for anybody to heat their home with oil at the current price ratio .
And if the ratio holds for awhile , then I expect to see municipalities around the country start to invest in additional natural gas distribution .
In addition , I expect to see a rebound in the building of natural gas - fired power plants –which had all but ceased a few years ago .
Furthermore , the remaining 63 percent of distillate fuel oil used in transportation is a decent candidate for switching to natural gas .
Long - haul freight could cut fuel costs by more than 75 percent–at current prices–by converting trucks from diesel .
Although the volumetric energy density of compressed natural gas is 25 percent that of diesel , at current price ratios the cost of bigger fuel tanks and engine retrofits will be paid for very quickly by the fuel savings .
There simply is no way that trucking companies will leave that much money on the table .
Historically 1 joule of oil has been valued about 50 percent more than 1 joule of natural gas .
That difference in valuation is a result of the intrinsic benefits–such as lower transportation and storage costs –of a fuel that is a liquid at surface conditions .
Those intrinsic physical benefits wo n’t go away , but they wo n’t get better either .
Thus , I expect the long - term price ratio of oil to gas will return to its historic levels of between one and two , which means either the price of oil will drop , the price of gas will increase , or both .
One short - term implication of the low price of natural gas has been low electricity costs across the United States , which is contributing to the slacking interest in alternative energy investment .
( I will explore other implications of this phenomenon in my next column . )
Such short - term planning is no different than in 2007 when the price of natural gas skyrocketed to nearly $ 13 per gigajoule and gas - fired power plant construction looked like utter folly .
My advice to policy makers and industry : Look beyond short - term price fluctuations to the bigger picture .
My advice to energy traders :
Go short on oil and long on gas .
All Hallow ’s Eve. Samhain .
Halloween .
Call it what you want , but it is fast approaching !
We have all heard our fair share of urban legends , visited some “ haunted ” houses , been to these locations willingly .
But what if we were simply trying to get from point A to point B ?
We had no intention of exposing ourselves to the paranormal , the supernatural .
A lonely night time drive down the wrong ( or right ? ) road is sometimes all it takes to end up with an encounter you were truly not expecting .
The houses and castles seem to have been hogging all the ghosts lately , why not give the back roads and byways a chance to scare the pants off of us ?
Here are 10 roads that , according to legend , will more than deliver the goods .
SEE ALSO : 10 Unique Halloween Traditions From Around The World
10 A75 Kinmont Straight South West Scotland
For over fifty years this road has been the scene of numerous hauntings .
Reports of paranormal activity have been frequent enough that the road has been nicknamed ‘ the Ghost Road ’
It is thought to be Scotland ’s most haunted road and has received hundreds of reports of unexplained sightings .
In 1957 a truck driver saw a couple walk in front of his truck and he thought he hit them .
When the driver stopped to investigate the couple were nowhere to be seen .
This is something of a typical “ ghost story ” scenario , but that is what Halloween is all about after all !
9 Kelly Road Ohioville , Pennsylvania
A one - mile section of Kelly Road , Ohioville , Pennsylvania is an area that has had numerous reports of paranormal activity and bizarre happenings .
Reports say that when animals have entered this haunted stretch of road they suddenly turn from peaceful and quiet to violent ( think Cujo ) , chasing after other animals and even people .
The road is surrounded by dark , thick and creepy forest where white apparitions and noises that ca n’t be explained have been seen and heard .
No one is quite sure why this short section of road is haunted but theories suggest that is could be somehow connected to cult activity that was once taking place in the area and curses that have been put on the land for some reason .
8 Dead Man ’s Curve Clermont County , Ohio
Dead man ’s curve is a dangerous turning intersection in Clermont County–according to the most common reports , at the place where 222 meets State Route 125 .
The road was part of the Ohio Turnpike built in 1831 , and it has a long list of victims .
On October 19 , 1969 , five teenagers died there when their 1968 Impala was hit at more than a hundred miles an hour by a 1969 Roadrunner .
There was only one survivor : a guy named Rick .
Ever since that day , the intersection has been haunted by “ the faceless hitchhiker , ” whom Rick has seen five times .
It is described as the pitch - black silhouette of a man , a “ three - dimensional silhouette . ”
According to Haunted Ohio III , Rick ’s friend Todd said “ Rick and I were heading home from Bethel to Amelia .
I noticed a man ’s shape on the side of the road .
It turned like it was hitchhiking , with an arm sticking up .
The thing wore light - colored pants , a blue shirt , long hair and a blank , flat surface where the face should have been .
We looked back .
There was nobody there .
I ’ve also seen the black shadow figure , walking its slow , labored , dragging walk by the side of the road . ”
Due to rerouting , the actual location of Dead Man ’s Curve is somewhat in doubt .
They say it is at 222 and SR 125 , near Bantam Road .
As you head east on 125 , 222 turns right towards Felicity and Bantam Road turns left toward East Fork Lake State Park .
The spot is just below a carryout .
7 Boone County Illinois
In the city of Belvidere in Boone Country , Illinois there is an intersection that has been the site of many hauntings , particularly the Bloodspoint Road .
Other roads included in this local haunting are Wheeler , Flora Church , Pearl , Poole , Sweeney , Cherry Valley , Stone Quarry , Fairdale , and Irene .
It is believed that the hauntings on these roads are a result of a number of tragic and spooky events that happened there in the past .
These events include hangings , suicide , various train accidents and the purported inhabitation of a witch .
6 Stocksbridge By - Pass England
Stocksbridge
By - pass is formerly part of the M67 motorway in England , it was then downgraded to a dual carriage way and today it is just a single carriage way .
The road , which was finished being built in 1989 , runs around north side of the Stocksbridge and its valley .
It has been the location of many hauntings .
Over time there have been sightings of children playing late at night under the bridge and a monk who just stands and looks out .
One sighting of the monk prompted a police investigation which ultimately provided no explanation .
Other people have heard the sounds of children singing in the vicinity when there are none to be seen .
Perhaps most frighteningly are the reports of people driving who have suddenly noticed an apparition of the monk sitting beside them in the car !
5 M6 Motorway England
To answer you question , yes , size does matter .
Because in England , many people agree that the longest road is also its most haunted !
Motorists making their way down this road have experienced unusual phenomena : Roman soldiers marching , an upset woman trying to hitch a ride , and lorry going the wrong way down the road !
Apparently with 230 miles and 6 lanes , there is more than enough room for this parade of freaks .
Next time you are utilizing the thoroughfare for travel , beware of a phantom pickup truck .
4 Tuen Mun Road Hong Kong
Even if you do n’t buy into the whole haunted roads business , you would be wise to exercise caution on this road .
The road is very heavily used , yet it has n’t been redesigned to take all of the modern traffic .
It is notorious for it ’s frequent traffic jams wrecks .
And apparently , the ghosts are out to get you on top of this !
Many claim that ghosts will suddenly appear in the middle of the road , causing the driver to swerve to avoid hitting the “ person ” .
And to make matters worse , supposedly the ghosts of the crash victims are being added to the already high spirit count .
Travel this road with caution , and keep an eye out for much less cautious “ pedestrians ” .
3 Highway 666 Utah , United States
Now known as Highway 191 , the route ( the sixth branch of the famous Route 66 ) is notorious for accidents , apparitions , and just plain bad luck .
Linda Dunning writes on prairieghosts.com about an incident with her husband :
“ He [ author ’s husband ] was alone and had n’t seen a car for miles and miles .
Suddenly , he saw a truck that looked like it was on fire heading straight for him , right down the middle of the highway .
The truck was going so fast that sparks were flying up off the wheels and flames were coming from the smokestack .
It scared him so bad that he pulled way off the road and walked 20 feet or so out into the desert away from his car and waited for the truck to pass him , going what he estimated was 130 miles an hour .
He then got back into his car and continued on . ”
If you are n’t careful , hell hounds will shred your tires .
A young girl walking down the road will vanish if you try to help her .
If you are alone , a ghost may just take up residence in your back seat .
Dunning has this to say for you advice :
“ Take a lot of people with you and do n’t leave any space for unwanted passengers who just might decide to appear in your backseat .
Pull off the road if a huge diesel truck comes barring down on you from either direction .
Do n’t be curious to see if there is a driver in that single car passing you in the night .
Do n’t look for lights floating in the sky .
Hope you do n’t see any young girls in white dresses .
Never stop if you spot something peculiar and do n’t pick up hitchhikers .
Lastly , if demon dogs approach you in the night , just keep driving . ”
2 A229 from Sussex to Kent England
“ In November 1992 Ian Sharpe was heading up the A229 from Sussex into Kent .
A girl in white with “ beautiful eyes ” stepped in front of his car and she disappeared under the front Wheels .
In total despair Sharpe stopped the car believing he had killed her and was powerless to help .
On leaving the car he found nothing there .
No girl , no body no white dress – or even any wildlife ; a fox a badger or a rabbit .
Not a sausage … I think you get the point . ”
If you are faint of heart , this road is not recommended .
Another contender for England ’s most haunted road is A229 .
The local constabulary are not strangers to calls of people plowing into pedestrians , more specifically , a woman in white , only to lose track of the body .
If you are passing Lower Bell pub towards Maidstone , do n’t be too surprised if that hitchhiker vanishes before you reach your destination .
The ghost lady is generally regarded as that of Judith Langham , who was tragically killed in a collision of her wedding day , still in her dress .
1 Clinton Road Passaic County , New Jersey
“ What is it about this road ? ” inquires the article on weirdnj.com .
A question that has been on the minds of many .
What causes all the weird happenings ?
While nobody can seem to answer the “ why , ” most can attest to the “ what ” .
If you are visiting the road at midnight , stop by the bridge at Dead Man ’s Curve for a game of catch .
Toss pennies into the water , and the ghost of a young boy will toss them back .
A gray wolf with red eyes will stalk you from the bushes .
Satan worshippers will hang hang up their bloody clothes to dry , right next to the mutilated animals .
The ruins of a castle reside in the woods .
If you find yourself in the wrong section of woods , expect to be chased out by Satanists or the Ku Klux Klan .
Weird animals , speculated to be survivors and interbred specimens from the abandoned nearby zoo , Jungle Habitat , from which most of the animals escaped .
A dangerous curve that has been the demise of many an unwary driver is rumored to be heavily haunted .
Phantom pickup trucks will gladly escort you from the road .
Well , chase you .
Weird lights flying in the sky will draw you attention upward , away from the blood stains on the pavement .
This road is not a joke .
Regardless of your stance on the paranormal , it is confirmed fact that many dangerous groups gather here for less - than - savory activities .
And they do not like to be disturbed .
Arrested :
The grandfather who ‘ attacked ’ an RAF Apache with an £ 8 torch
Questioned : Torben Merriott investigated the noise using a cheap torch
A lighting expert who has worked for the Queen has been arrested for shining an £ 8.45 torch at an RAF Apache helicopter gunship outside his home in the early hours .
Torben Merriott , 63 , was woken by what felt and sounded like an ‘ earthquake ’ outside his bedroom window at 1am .
The grandfather used the torch to identify the aircraft .
He spotted one of two gunships on an exercise just ‘ 10 ft above my garden ’ at his farmhouse in Stradbroke near Eye , Suffolk , and called the Ministry of Defence complaint line .
But instead of receiving an apology for the September 18 disturbance , Mr Merriott was visited three weeks later by police , who arrested him on suspicion of endangering an aircraft by dazzling the pilot .
Mr Merriott was taken to Bury St Edmunds police station where he was questioned and held in a cell for nine hours before being bailed pending further inquiries .
The torch was also seized by officers .
He is now waiting to hear if he will be charged with endangering an aircraft , which carries a maximum two years in jail .
Mr Merriott , who owns a theatrical lighting firm , insists he did not put the aircraft at risk as he has had professional experience of lighting up flying helicopters at a Buckingham Palace event hosted by the Queen .
‘ Do n’t tell the Taliban that all they need is an eight - quid torch to bring down multi-million - pound high - tech gunships , ’ he said .

More than 50 people have been indicted in Southern California , Las Vegas and Charlotte , N.C. , in connection with a “ phishing ” scheme to steal bank account information from thousands of victims in the United States , authorities said Tuesday .
The federal grand jury indictment , which was unsealed Wednesday , names 53 suspects -- 33 of whom have already been arrested -- as well as 47 unindicted co-conspirators from Egypt , said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller .
All of those who were indicted face charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud .
Some face additional federal charges , including bank fraud , identity theft , conspiracy to commit computer fraud and unauthorized access to protected computers in connection with fraudulent bank transfers and domestic and international money laundering .
Among those named in the indictment are suspects from Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino and San Diego counties .

The alleged ringleaders , all California residents , were identified by the FBI as Kenneth Joseph Lucas , 25 , of Los Angeles ; Nichole Michelle Merzi , 24 , of Oceanside ; and Jonathan Preston Clark , 25 , whose residence was not given .
The suspects are accused of posing as legitimate bank representatives and sending e-mails to victims , seeking to “ update ” their records .
After the victims sent their personal information , the suspects allegedly withdrew money from their bank accounts .
The scheme included the recruiting of “ runners ” to set up bank accounts where stolen money from Bank of America and Wells Fargo could be transferred and withdrawn .
At least $ 1.5 million was withdrawn from victims ’ bank accounts , Eimiller said .
Some of that money was transferred to the individuals operating in Egypt .
Eimiller said Egyptian authorities would be seeking charges against the suspects in that country .

Huck Finn , Catcher in the Rye , 1984 , Harry Potter and even Where ’s Waldo ?
have been banned for absurdly ironic reasons .
Saturday , September 26th through Saturday , October 3rd is the 27th annual National Banned Books Week , a week that opposes censorship , the Thought Police , and closeted gay “ family values ” types who sublimate their man-on - man urges through rampant and vigorous homophobia .
Long time readers of this website will know I hate three things : Internet commenters who misuse your and you ’re… hypocrisy … and you ’re mom .
Today ’s list is going after hypocrisy .
( It would go after your mom , but her ass is too big to fit anything after it . )
I searched through lists of books that have been banned at one time or another ( mostly in the U.S. ) , and found the ones whose bans were the most hypocritical , ignorant , and , based on the content of the books , ironic .
1 | Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
This gets the number one spot because , ya know , it ’s an entire novel about the future government banning ( and burning ) books because they could inspire critical thought .
It ’s been banned because , in Fahrenheit , one of the books that eventually gets burned is the Bible .
Sure , Bradbury ’s using that as an example of just how over - the - top The Man is when it comes to book burning and it ’s actually a PRO - Bible message … but to get that point , one would need to infuse logic into a Bible - centered argument .
( Which , as I ’ve said in the past , is not possible . )
On a more cynical level , people have speculated that the book has been banned because it advocates questioning authority … not just letting the government Lemming you off a cliff … and some think it ’d be better for the masses NOT to read such subversive ideas .
Which , again , is exactly the theme of the book .
2 | The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain
Huck Finn is n’t just one of the greatest works of art ever created in the history of mankind ( suck on that , Toulouse - Lautrec ? ) , but one of the finest and cleverest anti-slavery and anti-racism works ever created too .
Of course , to see that message you ( 1 ) have to actually read the book ( 2 ) have to actually think while you ’re reading and ( 3 ) have to recognize that Twain ’s repeated , period - apropos use of the most horrible racial slur is specifically orchestrated to illustrate the dehumanizing awfulness of that word ( and its connotations ) .
But that word , for over a century ( and still today ) , has been the most charged and controversial word in the English language … so the knee - jerk “ see the word , ban the book ” reaction persists .
3 | Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
I guess the people who banned it just did n’t have time to go through and scratch out all the “ Fuck yous . ”
4 | The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie
Rushdie wrote a novel that satirized some of the more narrow - minded and ( to Westerners , at least ) antiquated aspects of zealotous Islam .
He included a murderous , fringe , irrational , power - abusing character modeled after Iran ’s Ayatollah Khomeini .
How did the Ayatollah react when the book came out ?
He decreed a fatwa , calling on “ all good Muslims ” to kill Rushdie .
I know it ’s serious and all , but I have to drop a Simpsons line in to this situation ( from the hilarious but controversial Critic episode ) .
Smithers : I ’m afraid we have a bad image , Sir. Market research shows people see you as something of an ogre .
Burns : I ought to club them and eat their bones !
Anyway , Rushdie went into hiding , avoided getting killed … then had a three - year marriage with Padma from Top Chef . (???)
5 | 1984 by George Orwell
During the Cold War period , Democratic governments wanted to make sure to keep an eye on what their people were reading … and they had no tolerance for something that as pro-Red as the dystopian society of 1984 .
And yes , I intentionally played up contradiction after contradiction in that sentence .
Anyway , if there ’s anything that makes the modern Big Brother look bad , it ’s the show Big Brother .
Big Brother wants you to fear him , not think of him as some second - tier summer reality show .
When the government ’s spying on you I doubt they want you to associate them with the Head of Household challenge presented by The Ugly Truth .
6 | Where ’s Waldo ? by Martin Handford
Believe it or not , in the ’90s , the first Where ’s Waldo ?
book was one of the most banned books in the country .
It all centers around a beach scene that ( kinda ) shows a bare breast .
( Pictured above . )
If anything , it ’s side boob with a black , penciled - in hint of a nipple .
But that was enough to get this book thrown off of shelves in libraries all over the country .
Why did this make my list ?
Because the only way to find nudity in a Waldo book is to rigorously and meticulously search the pictures … which is , as you know , the exact POINT of the series .
7 | Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman
When this book came out , a lot of bookstores decided they were n’t going to carry it … not because it teaches people how to make pipe bombs , grow marijuana and such … but because they thought the title would , appropriately , make people shoplift it .
8 | The Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank
The book that , above all else , illustrates a Holocaust victim ’s undying faith in the goodness of humanity , was banned by the Alabama State Textbook Committee in 1983 for being “ a real downer . ”
So I ’m thinking they read the book , then flipped through the few blank pages at the end , hoping to find the chapter where Superman swoops in , defeats the Nazis and spins the Earth backwards to make the Holocaust never happen … and when that never happens , I mean , not even Aquaman shows up , they decided the book was just too sad .
9 | Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
Like many books on this list , we ’ve got a story about the tragedy and danger of an oppressive government that makes decisions for you , the absence of independent thought , etc. , etc. , etc .
You knew the irony just by seeing that I ’d included it .
To switch it up , I went onto Yahoo Answers to see what they thought about Brave New World being banned .
A user simply named “ E ” had some arguments I had not thought of …
no why should it be banned ?
its pure fiction and it sounds kinda like the matrix and besides that you do n’t HAVE to read it so why should anyone care if its on the shelves someone wrote it to make money and they should be allowed to do that …since well the first amendment and all
It DOES kinda sound like The Matrix !

10 | The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling
Strip away all the magic and marauders maps and Dr. Seuss beasts and gay wizard crushes and , ultimately , the series boils down to the message that love , understanding and tolerance are the most important things in the world .
I know this because J.K. Rowling got lazier and lazier through the series , to the point where , in book seven , she was unabashedly dumping in chapters of exposition ( where someone could deus ex machina right into the past through a memory string or some shit ) .
Using that , she explicitly TOLD us that ’s the case .
And the Harry Potter books fit this list — religious watchdog groups have fought aggressively to ban a book about tolerance , respect and love because the main character happens to have magical powers ( like being able to apparate or make things levitate or turn water into wine ) .
I also find it fitting that people have worked tirelessly to ban the one book that made an entire generation of kids want to read books .
Harry Potter did more for literacy than Hooked on Phonics and Pizza Hut ’s Book It combined .
11 | To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
Like Huck Finn , another of the greatest anti-racism books of all time is often banned for its n-bombs .
( And again , as in Huck Finn , it ’s used to paint an accurate picture of the period . )
It ’s been banned across the country for using “ racial slurs ” … for “ promoting white supremacy ” … and almost ( in New Jersey ) because a parent thought the way “ blacks are treated by members of [ the ] white community in Alabama would upset black children . ”
Of course , all those arguments are ridiculous — never , ever has a book made it so clear who the good guys are and who the bad guys are .
Atticus Finch might as well have been named Joe Heroman and Tom Robinson named Innocent McFalselyaccusedblackguy .

Oct. 9 , 2009  -- Mark and Scott Blankenburg of Hamilton , Ohio , are identical twins .
But the 53 - year - old siblings share many traits beyond their identical facial features .
They 're both pediatricians , and for years , the two men were well regarded professionals with successful practices .
The brothers also lived together and neither one was married .
They were both budding amateur photographers -- taking hundreds of pictures at Hamilton High School sporting events .
Now the siblings share something else as well -- they 're both facing multiple sex charges involving young boys .
" This is a very bizarre case ... I have been doing this for 25 years , and every time I think I have seen the most bizarre , weird case , another one comes along and this one is it , " said Robin Piper , the prosecuting attorney for Butler County .
The case against the twins is basically this : Prosecutors allege that , for years , both men had sex with underage males -- including some patients .
In some cases , prosecutors allege , the doctors paid for that underage sex , other times they bribed the teens to keep quiet .
In addition , Mark Blankenburg is charged with providing prescription drugs to minors .
Piper said that a search of the men's home and office revealed thousands of photos of teen boys , including " 316 photographs of one kid basically bending over . "
Prosecutors charge that the photos and the graphic sexual fantasies demonstrate an unhealthy obsession with young boys -- one that spilled over into criminal behavior .
The men will be tried separately because the judge ruled that their identical appearances might confuse the jury .
Mark Blankenburg is facing 41 charges .
Scott Blankenburg is charged with 22 counts .
The Blankenburg trials have sparked a lot of interest in the criminal justice community .
" It 's very rare .
I know of no other case where ... not just identical twins , but brothers , professionals have been charged with crimes of this nature , " said Stephen Holmes , an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Southern Florida .
Identical Twins Share Bad Behavior
Nevertheless , there is a lot of evidence to show that identical twins share plenty of basic behavioral patterns .
According to Holmes , studies have found a strong genetic link in twins for negative behaviors , such as persistent lying , bullying and stealing .
Further , Holmes said , " studies show that twins share more behavioral patterns than brothers and sisters , and that includes criminal behavior and aggression . "
The correlation is even stronger for identical twins .
Studies conducted between 1929 and 1961 show that 60 percent of identical twins share criminal behavior patterns , compared with 30 percent of fraternal twins who matched on criminal behavior , according to Holmes .
The fact that the men lived together makes this case even more intriguing for researchers because it 's difficult to tell whether their shared DNA or shared experiences might have prompted the men to commit the alleged sex offenses .
" Some people have urges and fantasies and never act on them because they know it 's wrong and they think they 're the only ones .
But when you interact with others who may have similar fantasies , then you begin to rationalize your behavior , " said Holmes , who co-authored a textbook on criminal sexual behavior " Sex Crimes : Patterns and Behavior . "
Holmes noted that " twins are often exposed to the same stimuli " growing up and that " something in their adolescence could have triggered an interest in molesting children . "
While their trials are separate -- Mark Blankenburg 's case began this week and Scott Blankenburg will face a jury in April -- both men dispute the charges against them .
Trial Continues for Twins
" What I can say is my client adamantly asserts his innocence .
You hear that all the time but this is genuinely his position that he has done absolutely nothing illegal , " said Jack Garretson , Scott Blankenburg 's attorney .
Garretson said the photos of high school boys may be numerous but they do not show any nudity .
And , Garretson argues , any pornographic photos downloaded from the Internet show " persons who were over the age of 18 . "
At trial , he also intends to prove that someone else downloaded those photos off the Internet -- not his client .
As for the victims who claim to have had sex with the men ?
Garretson said his client maintains " they are lying . "
Prosecutors admit some of the victims in this case have " difficult " reputations .
" Our job will be to get the jury to understand that , because these boys grew up to be young men with behavioral problems , that should n't discredit them from telling the truth about what happened to them when they were teens , " said Piper .
And now at least one jury is getting a chance to decide what that truth is .
In the past , I have participated with several different C.S.A.s by paying for my box of food every month .
With a sick dog money has been tighter than ever so I decided to volunteer with my friend Andrea at a local farm in exchange for a box of food .
Now this is a pretty extreme action for a lazy smurf such as myself to undertake .
I had to wake up at 7 am on a Saturday to do 5 hours of manual labor !
Usually I spend Saturday morning cuddled up with beagles and eventually mustering up the energy to make some brunch around 1 pm .
With the sun just peeking its little head out of the night sky and a large coffee in my hand I drove to Johnson ’s Backyard Garden to start of day of picking vegetables .
We started with eggplant .
Even though it is the middle of October the plants are still producing like crazy and some of them were too small to pick .
After filling our baskets with eggplant it was off to the pepper fields to pick a wide variety of peppers .
This was my favorite part because they smelled so good and were really fun to pick , especially since each one is unique and came in a different shape .
After picking peppers we moved into the string bean field and this is when the serious work began .
I found out that green beans are so labor intensive to pick that farmer Brenton said even if he charged ten dollars a pound it would n’t be cost effective .
But since people like them so much ( and he does too ) they decided to start a small crop a couple years ago .
It takes forever to pick the beans , they grow like crazy all over the plant and you have to pull everything apart to get to them while being very careful to not compact the ground or step on the plant .
After a couple of hours of work I still did n’t have a quite a full basket and had done maybe a third of my row .
So now I have even more respect for farmers , and I already had a lot !
I spent the whole day thinking about my grandparents in their old village , migrant workers , slaves on cotton plantations , the true cost of food , and , of course , what I was going to make for dinner .
When we got back to the farmhouse we each stood by a type of vegetable and filled them all into boxes assembly line style .
It was really fun !
I started to get so hungry because by then it was after noon and all I had to eat was a couple string beans !
Note , if you ever volunteer on a farm bring a freaking granola bar or something because it is really hard work .
So finally we got our boxes and headed home .
I got so many organic vegetables I could n’t believe it .
Eggplant , peppers , hot peppers , amaranth greens , bok choy , arugula , basil , green beans , sweet potatoes , cucumbers , butternut squash , and lots and lots of okra !
Here in the south okra is like zucchini in the north .
It grows like crazy in the summer and people are always giving you some .
I became obsessed with the idea of making gumbo .
I had recently seen an episode of Good Eats where Alton Brown made a dark roux using his oven instead of the stove top .
I had been waiting for some okra to appear in my life to try the method and finally the time had come .
I also made some Andouille sausage testing a spice combination from the ppk but it did n’t work out at all , the sausages were good enough to put in the gumbo but I will have to work on the Andouille recipe .
You could use any other vegan sausage or other legumes in the gumbo , it will still be good .
In fact , it will be so good that you might be inspired to sing about it .
The Gumbo recipe is mostly from the Veganomicon , but it is really enhanced with the roux and the fresh stock .
Chez Rolez Gumbo
For the Roux , Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Whisk together
4 oz of flour ( by weight )
4 oz of vegetable oil
bake for an hour and a half , whisking four or five times throughout the process .
You want it to be a dark brick red without any black flecks .
For the Stock
add to stock pot on medium heat
8 cups of water
1 onion
1 leek ( with green parts )
2 carrots
2 celery stalks
1 bay leaf
2 smashed cloves of garlic
handful Parsley
dash of Thyme
Simmer for 40 minutes or so .
If you are making sausages you can steam them over the stock pot !
For the Gumbo
Put the Brown Roux on the stove top over medium heat
Saute for 10 minutes with
1 onion , chopped
3 shallots , chopped
2 bell peppers or equivalent ( I used a whole mess of sweet and spicy peppers ) , chopped
Add

Donington has held one Formula 1 race before , the 1993 European Grand Prix
Formula 1 commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone has categorically insisted there will be no British Grand Prix at Donington Park next year .
" There 's no Donington , " said Ecclestone at the new Yas Marina track in Abu Dhabi ahead of the final race of 2009 .
The proposed move from Silverstone to Donington collapsed because the company redeveloping the circuit failed to show it had the £ 135 m funding required .
Silverstone are trying to ensure there will be a British Grand Prix in 2010 .
The company which owns the Northamptonshire circuit , Silverstone Holdings , stalled when a new deal was being renegotiated .
That allowed Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd - who lease Donington Park from the owning Wheatcroft family - to sign a 17 - year deal with Ecclestone , which is now dead in the water .
This is a very British institution and every effort must be made to keep the race in the UK
Business secretary Lord Mandelson
But Ecclestone says any possible deal is now in the hands of Silverstone to make sure the British Grand Prix goes ahead next year , and beyond .
" We 're talking , " he said .
" A deal can be done if they [ Silverstone ] want to . "
Asked if there was a difference of opinion over the details , Ecclestone added : " There is n't actually .
As far as I 'm concerned , no problems .
" Donington have missed the deadline which we kept extending for them .
" It 's unfortunate for them .
It was the credit crunch that caused them to be in trouble - because their intentions were good , that 's for sure . "
On Thursday , Business Secretary Lord Mandelson contacted Ecclestone to stress the importance of Formula One and the British Grand Prix to the UK .
" This is a very British institution and every effort must be made to keep the race in the UK , " said Mandelson .
" Losing it would be a body blow to UK sport , the teams , and the fans .
Bernie reassured me he was doing everything possible to maintain the British Grand Prix in the UK .
" Former F1 world champion Damon Hill , who is trying to land the event for Silverstone , said on Tuesday that he feared the future of next year 's British GP is far from certain because of competition from around the world .
" F1 can go anywhere in the world and get a huge amount of money , " he told BBC Radio 5 live .
" That 's what Bernie 's wrestling with .
But it 's not his job to give a discounted job to the UK . "
606 : DEBATE
This leaves Donington with no F1 , no MotoGP and a half - built track and no money
Readbetween
The British GP has been held every year since 1948 and has a rich history , while recently English drivers Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button have won 2008 and 2009 world titles respectively with Brackley - based Brawn also clinching this year 's constructors ' crown .
Silverstone has hosted every British Grand Prix since 1987 , while Donington , which is synonymous with MotoGP , has held only one F1 race , the European Grand Prix in 1993 .

“ I AM not a Nazi , I 'm not being paid to be here , and I 'm not un-American ! ”
The elderly man who uttered those angry words on the afternoon of Monday August 10th was clearly boiling over .
He and several hundred others had gathered in a poorly ventilated hall in North Arlington , New Jersey , to berate Steven Rothman , their Democratic congressman , for advocating health reform .
The patriotic constituent echoed the sentiments of the angry crowd by declaring that the Democrats ' health plan was something his children and grandchildren simply “ ca n't afford ” .
With Congress in recess this month , many members are holding such town hall meetings — and meeting a similar reaction .
Across the country politicians are being confronted with the outrageous allegation that Democratic reforms will create a rationing bureaucracy of “ death panels ” to decide who lives and who dies .
What explains all this ?
The initial Democratic instinct was to see a dark plot masterminded by conservatives .
Mr Rothman recalls encountering such open hostility at public meetings only twice before — during Bill Clinton 's impeachment saga and over the Iraq war — but the difference this time , he insists , is that the complainers are well - organised .
A White House official claims that the protests were the result of a “ concerted viral whisper campaign ” .
Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House , went so far as to suggest this week that the tactics used by those disrupting public meetings were “ un-American . ”
It is true that e-mails and other documents have surfaced confirming that conservative groups and talk - radio hosts have been fanning the flames of discontent .
And prominent Republicans ranging from Newt Gingrich to Sarah Palin have indeed pounced on the issue with glee .
The former governor of Alaska even posted a note on her Facebook page claiming that Democratic reforms would somehow do in her handicapped child .
Look beyond such opportunism , however , and it becomes clear that there is much genuine anger and concern among ordinary people about health reform .
For one thing , the punters at these meetings often have poignant and unscripted personal tales that explain their distrust of proposed reforms .
Also , numerous polls now confirm that scepticism among Americans at large — and independents in particular — is growing about health reform .
The Democrats are using two other strategies to try to quell dissent .
The high - minded tactic is the White House 's redoubling of efforts to address the concerns of Americans directly .
To that end , the administration has set up a new website designed to debunk half - truths and myths and is pouring money into a huge advertising campaign .
Mr Obama has also headed out on the road again , with three town hall meetings on health reform planned for this week alone .
The more underhanded gambit is the decision to bash the insurance industry at every turn .
Ms Pelosi now calls its bosses “ villains ” , while Mr Obama wags a disapproving finger .
This will score some political points , as many Americans have a deep ( and often well - founded ) distrust of health insurers .
But the tactic could ultimately hobble or even doom reform .
That is because the health insurance lobby may prove to be Mr Obama 's most important friend this year .
Though it has a shameful history , the insurance industry has done a U - turn of late .
It now accepts the need for a radical overhaul of insurance markets through measures such as guaranteed issue of coverage and the creation of health insurance “ exchanges ” .
But its leaders are increasingly unhappy about the shrill attacks .
Can Mr Obama continue to bash the insurers one day and rely on them the next ?
From where we sat , a young couple was heard talking about indie bands and Silver Lake / Echo Park music venues .
One row down , a 70 - year - old man is used his point - and - shoot camera to record the Dudamel in action .
To the side , a toddler pretended to conduct the orchestra with his hands .
If there was one thing to say about Saturday night 's concert at the Hollywood Bowl , which was 28 - year - old Gustavo Dudamel 's premiere as its conductor and music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic , is that it brought excited crowds out from all walks of life .
When Dudamel walked out for the first time to conduct the youth orchestra , he was given a standing ovation by the 18,000 ( or so ) people in the crowd .
It was quite a statement in itself for the world 's most watched conductor to raise his baton for the first time at his new job , not to professionals , but to children from South Los Angeles .
But that 's what Dudamel is all about -- the children , education , experiencing music like he did growing up in Venezuela .
And then came the L.A. Philharmonic .
And in the words of LA Times ' music critic Mark Swed , " the Dude pulled it off . "
In a major way .
Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony literally rocked .
If you missed it ( in person or online ) , no worries , the Dude will be here for a good while .
He says he loves this city .
So do we .
Mature Scrum at Systematic - Mixing Agile and the CMMI
Carsten Ruseng Jakobsen , Jeff Sutherland
Systematic Software Engineering , Scrum Training Institute
Abstract
Systematic is a CMMI level 5 company , where the adoption of Lean led to a unique way of working based on synergies between CMMI , Lean , Scrum and other agile practices .
Lean provides the principles and values needed for high performance teams and organizations , as demonstrated by Toyota for more than 50 years .
CMMI provides the process descriptions and support for what disciplines to consider in order to be successful .
Agile approaches like Scrum provides best practices and methods for working according to the values of Lean and adopting change as it occurs .
Lean , CMMI and Scrum are strong by themselves , but they can be combined to amplify each other - and that is what Systematic has done .
The experiences from combining Lean , CMMI and Scrum have led Systematic to identify examples of explicit guidance from CMMI that help to execute Scrum activities even better .
These activities can be implemented based on Lean values and principles and by doing so Scrum can be augmented and matured to ensure that even larger and more complex projects in the future can and will benefit from Scrum .
1. Introduction
Systematic was established in 1985 and employs more than 500 people worldwide with offices in Denmark , Finland , USA and the UK .
It is an independent software and systems company focusing on complex and critical IT solutions within information and communication systems .
Often these systems are mission critical with high demands on reliability , safety , accuracy and usability .
Customers are typically professional IT - departments in public institutions and large companies with longstanding experience in acquiring complex software and systems .
Solutions developed by Systematic are used by tens of thousands of people in the defense , healthcare , manufacturing , and service industries
This paper presents how Systematic combined Lean , CMMI and agile during the past 5 years .
What were the different steps and what are the experiences and lessons learned .
Agile purists and small agile projects may find our experiences and suggestions non-agile or counter - productive and very large high maturity organizations may find our experiences too undisciplined .
The experiences are fit for Systematic , but may not be fit for your project or organization .
Some companies may be in a similar context to Systematic , and find our experiences directly applicable to their challenges .
Others may be in a different context and may find that the answers represented by these experiences are not applicable , and instead find inspiration in the questions asked leading to Systematic 's experiences .
2. Why CMMI , Lean and Scrum
Experience .
Lean established a new mindset leading to identification of significant improvements
Experience .
Scrum implements many of the tools and principles in Lean Software Development
Experience .
Scrum implements a subset of project management when interpreting CMMI in a Lean context
Systematic was appraised 11 November 2005 and 15 May 2009 using the SCAMPI ( Capability Maturity Model Integration , and SCAMPI are service marks of Carnegie Mellon University ) method and found to be CMMI level 5 compliant .
Implementing CMMI was the main driver for improvements until November 2005 and therefore as part of yearly strategic planning in the summer 2005 , Systematic discussed how to ensure a continued flow of significant improvements after achieving CMMI level 5 .
The result of the discussion was that future improvements are expected to be implemented applying the CMMI capability established , but using primarily a Lean perspective on new improvements , may help identify new substantial improvements that may be overlooked in a focus on processes alone .
Lean has a proven track record for more than 50 years at Toyota and has been applied successfully to many other industries , and Mary Poppendieck has with her book " Lean Software Development " provided a solid basis for understanding how Lean is applied to software development , described through 7 principles and 22 thinking tools , [ 1 ] .
In order to understand how to apply Lean Software Development , Systematic analyzed the causality of the principles and thinking tools , and the result is shown in Table 1 .
In the table thinking tools are labeled with a ( T ) and principles are labeled with ( P ) followed by the number and name of the principle or thinking tool as defined in [ 1 ] .
Principles and tools to the right depend on principles and tools to the left .
As part of the analysis it was also observed that the principles and tools addressed different perspectives .
Some focused on the engineering practices , another part on the management perspective , and the rest focused on people .
These categories are shown as rows below .
Finally , the column headers are inspired from Womack and Jones book on " Lean Thinking " where Lean is defined in 5 steps : Value , Value Stream , Flow , Pull and Perfection , see [ 5 ] .

T9 Decision making People P5 Empower team T16 Expertise P5 Empower team T14 Motivation P5 Empower team T15 Leadership P5 Empower team T13 Self determination
Table 1 Analysis of causal dependencies in Lean Software Development
The analysis shows that in the engineering dimension , the most dependent parts are the thinking tools " T17 Perceived Integrity " and " T18 Conceptual Integrity " .
" T18 Conceptual Integrity " is concerned with what is usually understood as good technical quality , whereas " T17 Perceived Integrity " is concerned that the customer receives what he perceives to have ordered as opposed to what was actually ordered initially .
This thinking tool addresses that the final product fulfills the actual needs of the customer and not only the original requirement specification .
In most cases , the complexity and changes of organizations and technologies introduces the need for an adaptive approach where regular feedback ( T3 ) is needed to identify and absorb the changes necessary to achieve perceived integrity .
To allow the customer to provide valuable feedback , the customer needs to see parts of the system as it evolves .
In other words , it is necessary that the project is delivered in short iterations ( T4 ) delivering parts of the project , in a way where the customer can relate and comment to it .
To deliver high quality code in short iterations , the discipline of test ( T20 ) must be well established , otherwise speed will soon drop as defects are identified and quality is built in afterwards .
The analysis shows similar dependencies for the thinking tools and principles related to Management and People .
The model is not used to " implement " Lean , but as a mean to understand the primary tool for future improvements : Lean Software Development .
Using the analysis of Lean Software Development from above and analysis of historical data from all projects in the organization , it was decided to pilot a changed software development process with focus on early test and short iterations .
The improvement resulted in the introduction of a new development method in Systematic named Story Based Development , where work is ultimately decomposed into units called a story .
The completion of a story is handled with a checklist , that by design ensures that test of a story is considered before the story is coded .
Another key - aspect is that the work on a story is inspected a number of times to ensure that activities are carried out in the right order and are properly completed .
The improvement also led to the introduction of Scrum , and it was realized that Scrum addresses many of the thinking tools and principles from Lean Software Development .
The results from adoption of Scrum and Story Based Development were reported at Agile 2007 , SEPG2007 and HICCS2008 [ 2 ] and how Scrum fit together with other CMMI driven processes were reported at Agile 2008 [ 3 ] .
The core of these experiences stem from synergies between Lean , CMMI and Scrum .
CMMI provides insight into what processes are needed to maintain a disciplined mature organization capable of predicting and improving performance of the organization and projects .
Scrum provides guidance for efficient management of projects in a way that allows for high flexibility and adaptability .
When CMMI is interpreted from the basis of Lean values and principles , a large part of project management activities can be implemented using Scrum .
When mixing CMMI and Scrum , a magic potion emerges , where the mindset from Scrum ensures that processes are implemented efficiently while embracing change , and CMMI ensures that all relevant processes are considered with proper discipline .
Individually CMMI and Scrum has proven benefits , but also pitfalls .
A company can comply with CMMI , but fail to reach optimal performance due to inadequate implementation of processes .
Scrum and other agile methods can guide such companies towards more efficient implementation of CMMI .
An agile company may implement Scrum correctly , but fail to obtain the full benefits due to lack of consistent and sufficient execution of engineering or management processes within and across projects in the organization .
CMMI can help agile companies to institutionalize agile methods more consistently and understand what processes and disciplines to address .
Systematic has gained valuable experiences in combining Lean , Scrum and CMMI that are relevant both for projects in a CMMI and Scrum context .
In particular Systematic can point out where disciplines driven from CMMI , has created a positive synergetic effect to the implementation of Scrum .
These activities may not be needed by small or simple projects , but these disciplines are in most cases founded in Lean values , in line with the intentions of Scrum and will be helpful for larger and more complex projects working with Scrum .
3. CMMI , Lean and Scrum combined
Experience .
CMMI ensures that agile methods are institutionalized , including consistent implementation throughout the organization , role based training and continuous improvement
We believe the value from Scrum can only be obtained through disciplined use .
CMMI has an organizational - level concept of institutionalization that can help establish this needed discipline based on a set of Generic Practices ( GP ) that are applied to all processes .
Institutionalization is defined in CMMI as " the ingrained way of doing business that an organization follows routinely as part of its corporate culture . "
Others have described institutionalization as simply " this is the way we do things around here . "
How these GP's are applied to Scrum can be found in [ 2 ] .
The GP's will cover areas like , what is the policy for applying Scrum , how Scrum is performed is documented , relevant responsibility is assigned to Scrum Master and Product Owner , and people fulfilling these roles are trained for the roles .
Institutionalization will ensure that the organization as a whole is committed to Scrum , and that Scrum is performed completely and consistently on different projects , allowing for faster learning and improving of how the organization performs Scrum .
Institutionalization will ensure that the Scrum evangelist in each project overall speaks the same gospel .
3.1 Overview
Experience .
Scrum also needs some initial planning or setup activitieS
Experience .
Project initiation is fast , and risk are not hidden by speculative planning
Figure 1 . Overall lifecycle model
Using Scrum does not eliminate the need to setup or plan the project initially .
Instead initial planning is done with a focus on establishing the project infrastructure , product vision and an initial product backlog based on a mindset to avoid planning based on speculation .
This approach reduces the amount of initial planning significantly , but also makes explicit that once the project is setup , it will do two concurrent activities throughout the lifetime of the project .
The part of the Product Backlog that is sufficiently prepared will be the foundation for planning and execution of sprints .
The other part of the Product Backlog will iteratively be refined and make more of the product backlog sufficiently prepared for future sprints .
Once the whole product backlog is produced , we often find that customers want a final acceptance test of the whole product , even though they have received working code iteratively .
3.2 Setup - Sprint Zero
Experience .
Project Planning in CMMI is a disciplined and comprehensive Sprint Zero .
In order to run a good Scrum , it is vital to have good product backlog .
CMMI provides very valuable insight into what activities to consider in order to establish the initial Product Backlog during the Project Planning / Sprint Zero .
The overall project is planned at a slightly higher level of granularity , and uncertainties are managed with risk management .
The primary focus is to establish an initial Product Backlog .
The initial Product Backlog is analyzed , and sprints are not initiated until uncertainty and risk are at a level where the projects overall objectives can be met and the draft version of plans and solutions are approved by senior management .
When Systematic adopted Scrum , the project planning process was updated to produce an initial product backlog .
Expected CMMI practices include decomposition of work into manageable pieces that are estimated and analyzed for dependencies , planning of stakeholder involvement , and total project risk assessment .
In addition to the product backlog a set of overall project plans are established .
Agile teams talk about a sprint zero to establish the foundation for the team to do efficient sprinting .
Project Planning in CMMI can be perceived as a sprint zero that also produce a coherent set of plans , that will help improve execution of the product backlog .
Such plans cover topics like , stakeholder management , milestone and delivery schedules , cost estimates , and quality .
The initial version of these plans are typically established within few weeks after project initiation and will focus on the most certain elements of the projects plan , leaving more uncertain parts to be elaborated as the project proceeds .
The project planning process , has been changed to primarily deliver a prioritized Product Backlog where the top elements are described in detail , but the lower elements are described in decreasing detail .
It is an explicit decision to postpone much planning , and thereby accept that planning and execution will continue concurrently as the project evolves .
Many of the CMMI project planning activities are in line with the intentions of Scrum , the main difference is that in CMMI these activities are elaborated and documented .
Experience : Planning and risk management activities reduces risk of product backlog
The first draft product backlog is assessed for risk by the team .
Asking the team to estimate the products backlog using 3 - point estimates for effort will reveal the most uncertain parts of the work in the Product Backlog .
Conducting Risk Identification meetings will identify other important risks , and allow proactive mitigation to be initiated .
Experience .
Two levels of planning and tracking : Project as a whole and each sprint .
The project is planned and tracked with plans for the overall project and active sprint (s ) .
Figure 2 .
Two levels of planning and tracking
The plans for the overall project established with planning activities during setup provides a better context for defining sprint visions and goals .
They allow the team to focus on the sprint , because they can rely on the project manager or Product Owner to track the progress the overall progress .
In general CMMI is used for planning and tracking of the overall project , and Scrum is used for planning and tracking at the sprint level .
The CMMI and Scrum activities integrate primarily through the Product Backlog .
Sprint Review becomes a heartbeat in tracking of the project and provides high quality feedback into tracking of the overall project plan .
3.3 Execute and Deliver Sprints
Experience : Risk management can proactively prevent impediments
Scrum has a strong focus on removing impediments as soon as they are identified , however CMMI risk management activities focus on proactively identify some of these impediments as risks , and through mitigation eliminate them before they occur as an impediment in the future .
The distinction between risk and impediment is that risk describe a problem that may occur , whereas an impediment is problem that has occurred and is impacting planned progress .
Risk management activities are easily integrated with Scrum activities .
During project planning the project plans and solution architecture are inputs for initial identification of risks .
During project execution , bi-weekly meetings of 10 - 15 minutes are arranged , where the status of known risks is reported and new risks are identified .
It is our experience that these risk management meetings should be kept outside the daily scrum meeting .
New risks may be reported on the daily scrum , in which case the risk manager will just take a note .
Experience : Use checklist to ensure quality of stories
One of the important aspects of Systematic Story Based Development method was to ensure focus on early test .
The quality of stories are generally ensured by focus on early specification of test and by getting somebody else to look at the work done .
Developing a story includes many different activities , that need to be structured to some degree .
The Story Completion Checklist accomplishes these goals , by structuring activities and defining when work must be inspected by an inspector .
Experience : Automated test is a must in order to do one month sprints
When the sprint duration is one month , all tests must be automated to the extent possible .
It is an integrated part of developing a story , to also implement the automated test verifying the story .
Automated test are used on the teams shared repository and run every time a developer commits code to the shared build server .
Experience : Continuous integration must be supported with discipline for check in
In order to avoid chaos when developers continuously integrate with each other , we have defined the following criteria for check in of code to the integration repository :
The test must run smoothly in the developers sandbox and the code must comply with the code standard checked with FxCop ( a static code analysis tool ) .
Experience : Automated test and integration must be supported by a standard production line </ p>
Every project needs this infrastructure and therefore we have established standard production line setups , allowing projects to get started faster .
Scrum promotes short iterations , e.g. one sprint per month , and in our experience this drives the need for a strong discipline in configuration management , test , integration and release .
You can only deliver high quality sprint deliveries every month , if you address defects immediately they are identified as opposed to store and fix them later .
In a 1 month sprint you should spent at most 3 calendar days to test , integrate and release .
This is only possible if you build quality in , and test is expected to NOT find any defects .
To establish this capability CMMI helps with :
Establish standards for production line , including standard setups for build - and test servers
Establish discipline on criteria for integration
Measures to objectively evaluate performance
Disciplines to maintain integrity of configuration management system , builds , and releases .
Experience : CMMI facilitates data driven identification and elimination of impediments
From a CMMI perspective Scrum is one process out of a set of processes used to execute a project .
In a CMMI context all processes for development are monitored for effectiveness and efficiency .
Therefore measures are also established on the Scrum process .
The choice of measures were inspired from Lean [ 3 ] and from the objective to establish a stable flow of work .
We wanted a measure to help establish focus on a " Stop the line " mindset to defects , to ensure defects are addressed immediately after they are identified .
We also wanted insight into the flow of story implementation - that is , how much waiting time is incurred when a story is implemented .
These considerations led to a number of measures where the most important are :
Fix time for failed builds - are problems proactively handled ?
Flow in implementation of story - is a story implemented without breaks in calendar time and context shift to implementation of other stories ?
The main reason to measure how long it takes from a build fails on the shared build server until the next succeeding build has to do with speed and quality .
If a defect or a problem is not addressed immediately after it is identified , rework will accumulate and it will be difficult to deliver a sprint with high quality and maintain a high velocity .
The two measures can be considered a sub- process for fixing failed builds and coding a story respectively .
The measures are regularly analyzed using statistical control charts , and data - points outside the control - limits are evaluated .
Analysis of such data often identifies project impediments .
Experience : Focus on " fix - time after failed build " drives good discipline in project
Using standard infrastructure setups allows for efficient data collection and analysis .
In particular Systematic has been inspired from Lean thoughts on flow and jidoka ( stopping the production line when an error is detected ) .
We want our projects to be able to deliver on a daily basis , and hence that unresolved failed builds are fixed within a working day .
We use CruiseControl ( a build management tool ) to signal all developers when a build fails .
We also monitor the objective by analyzing data from the build servers using control charts like the one shown below .
Many projects have achieved this one work day objective , merely by the focus on the measure .
The objective is easy to understand , and presenting the information in CruiseControl and control charts has established a good habit of fixing broken builds immediately when they fail .
3.4 Prepare Product Backlog
Experience : Explicit quality plans helps the team to build the right quality in
One of the results of planning is a quality assurance schedule ( QAS ) , where it is outlined what quality activities will be used to ensure the quality objectives are achieved and when .
The QAS may specify
What stories are subject to inspection
What code is subject to review
What documents are subject to what types of review
What unit test and automatic test is produced
What is included in the acceptance test
A typical QAS document is only a few pages long , but the above descriptions help a scrum team to elaborate and understand the definition of done .
Experience The Product Backlog must be groomed with at least the same speed as sprints are delivered
Figure 3 . Balancing preparing and delivering activities
The general experiences from working with CMMI and Scrum is that it requires strong discipline to deliver high quality code after each sprint , while at the same time ensure sufficient planning activities to groom the Product Backlog .
The initial plan ensures a sufficient confidence for the project as a whole , and postpones detailed planning to be executed as the project executes .
The activities postponed often include clarification or agreement to interpretation of requirements .
The challenge is that these activities often requires participation from members of the sprint team , who are committed to deliver a sprint delivery .
The amount of time spent preparing features on the product backlog will vary over time , and it is difficult to make a fixed plan for how much time to spend .
Instead the project track how much work is ready for future sprints concurrent to tracking the burn down chart for current sprint .
This provides a visual feedback showing if planning activities are starved .
The reason we talk about whether a feature or story is ready for implementation , is that we inspired from Lean want to have a smooth flow of implementing stories or features from the backlog .
We found that one of the main impediments for a smooth flow when executing sprints , was that the work allocated to the sprint was not sufficiently prepared or clarified .
Therefore we will only allocate features or stories to a sprint when they are sufficiently clarified .
Based on our CMMI implementation it is well defined when a feature is READY , and the work to bring from an initial state to the state READY is supported by a " Feature Ready for Implementation Checklist " .
The Product Owner is responsible for ensuring that the Product Backlog is constantly groomed to keep at least an amount of 110 % sprint velocity READY on the top of the Product Backlog .
This assures that new sprints can be planned , and only will allocate work that is READY .
By doing so we achieved significant better flow of story implementation in our projects .
Assume a story is estimated to be 3 workdays of effort .
However for various reasons it takes 9 workdays to implement the story .
The flow of this story implementation is defined as 3 days calendar time of work implemented over 9 calendar days , a flow of 3/9 or 33 % .
When we started measuring flow of story implementation it was around 30 % , from 2007 to 2008 it increased to approximately 60 % for Q4 2008 .
Efficient flow eliminates the waste associated with context shifts and handovers .
In addition the team members find it more satisfying that work initiated in a sprint is sufficiently clarified to allow for a smooth implementation during the sprint .
4. Recommendations
Systematic has experienced synergies between Lean , CMMI and Scrum that scales Scrum to be successful in larger or distributed projects and organizations .
The experiences from Systematic can be turned into the a number of recommendations that may help you to a great Scrum .
The recommendations are presented in the context of a stepwise adoption model for Scrum , that we believe many projects go through .
Projects inexperienced with Scrum are often seen to only adopt parts of Scrum .
This may have little or even negative effect .
As Scrum is fully implemented and the projects build experience , they learn how to bring the full benefits out of Scrum , and will typically improve significantly .
Instead of discussing the quantity of these gains , we will focus on what activities or disciplines we typically see a project master , as it brings the full benefit out of Scrum :
Scrum Type Driven by ScrumButt Lack of discipline to implement all of Scrum Pretty Good Scrum Basic Scrum roles and meetings established , teams co-located and values mutual respect and shared commitment to sprint goal .
Good Scrum Discipline in execution of Sprint and using DONE concept Great Scrum Discipline in grooming the product backlog using READY concept
4.1 ScrumButt
In order to avoid a partial Scrum implementation , Systematic have one interpretation of how to execute Scrum shared by all projects in Systematic and has gradually standardized on concepts .
For example all projects are recommended to use a Physical Scrum Board for the sprint backlog and not a particular tool .
Use CMMI Generic Practices to ensure a full and consistent implementation of Scrum in all projects in your organization including training of Scrum Master and Product Owner to their roles .
How this is done is elaborated in [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] .
Use the Nokia test to identify gabs in your Scrum implementation , for specific descriptions and guidelines please visit http://jeffsutherland.com/scrum/nokiatest.pdf
4.2 Pretty Good Scrum Co-locate project and teams to the extent possible Establish your own sprint zero , and include activities in the items below Use Risk Management to proactively address risks before they are identified as impediments Transform requirements into a solution description described in a set of high level features on the product backlog .
Prepare the product backlog by decomposing the highest prioritized features to stories allowing for efficient sprint planning .
Use 3 - point effort estimates on elements of the product backlog during initial planning .
Analyze dependencies , stakeholders , risk on elements of product backlog .
Establish milestone and delivery plan ( roadmap ) and their initial relationship to product backlog .
4.3 Good Scrum Decide and communicate on quality objectives including , what code and documentation to formally review to elaborate your projects definition of DONE .
Use Story Completion Checklist and inspection to maintain high quality of stories produced and ensure that DONE criteria is met Establish standards for project " production line " including development , build servers , and test servers .
Automate test and nightly build , and measure performance .
Establish criteria for committing of code to integration .
Maintain integrity of configuration management
Use a checklist for Work Product Evaluation to ensure and validate that sprint deliveries are consistent .
4.4 Great Scrum Define READY criteria for work on the product backlog .
Ensure visibility of the amount of work on the product backlog that is ready for Sprint Planning .
The amount of READY work should at all times be kept to at least Sprint velocity of all teams Product Owners work is not included in sprint plans but sprint is planned to support that team members can provide sufficient support to Product Owner activities .
5. Conclusion
Systematic has worked with Lean , CMMI and Scrum for several years , and found that they can be mixed in a way where strong synergies are achieved .
The focus of this article has been to share how Lean and CMMI can bring synergies and support your adoption of Scrum and agile .
The experiences were presented as recommendations for agile projects on activities or disciplines to adopt particularly in larger or distributed projects .
These recommendations are based on experiences gained from projects at Systematic running Scrum in the context of Lean and CMMI .
We believe that these experiences can be adopted by many agile projects , and are independent to whether your project or organization is working according to CMMI or Lean .
The experience from projects at Systematic is that to achieve the full benefit of Scrum you should use the concept of READY and DONE .
Systematic identified the need for and value of the READY criteria , in our search for stable flow in Sprints .
Adopting the READY concept makes it clear that the Product Backlog is divided into the following items :
In Sprint ( work in progress - facilitated by Scrum Master controlled with DONE criteria ) Ready ( Prioritized list of work ready for future Sprint Planning Meetings )
Preparing ( work in progress - facilitated by Product Owner controlled by READY criteria ) New ( Prioritized list of work waiting to be made ready )
It is important to understand that READY is the least amount of activity bringing an unspecified high granularity item on the backlog , into a state where it is sufficiently described to allow the team to implement the item without disruption .
Finally we advice other agile projects to map themselves against the Scrum adoption model presented above , and to apply the above recommendations stepwise from ScrumButt to Great Scrum .

The Justice Department has started a preliminary investigation into whether I.B.M. has abused its monopoly position in the market for mainframe computers , which remain vital to many of the world ’s largest businesses .
This month , antitrust regulators at the Justice Department began seeking information about I.B.M. ’s business practices from companies that compete with I.B.M. in the market for large computer hardware and software , people who had been contacted in the inquiry said .
The requests for information followed a complaint filed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association , a trade group with a history of involvement in antitrust disputes .
The organization , which is backed by I.B.M. competitors like Microsoft and Oracle , contends that I.B.M. stymied competition in the mainframe market and blocked efforts by competitors and potential partners to license I.B.M. ’s software .
The complaint follows similar legal action taken by T3 Technologies against I.B.M .
T3 , a small company that resold mainframelike computers , filed an antitrust complaint against I.B.M. in January in Europe .
T3 also filed a civil suit against I.B.M. in the United States .
Last week a federal district judge in New York dismissed that case .
T3 said it planned to appeal .
Steven Friedman , the president of T3 , said he had received a formal request for information from the Justice Department about I.B.M. ’s actions in the mainframe market .
“ They asked for a very broad set of documents and information , ” he said .
Hope College in Holland , Michigan has barred Milk screenwriter Dustin Lance Black from speaking at a forum on sexuality , according to the school paper , The Anchor :
" Hope College ’s Sexuality Roundtable ’s request to host Hollywood screenwriter Dustin Lance Black as a speaker on campus has been denied by the college administration .
According to the Sexuality Roundtable , Hope cited two reasons for its decision : ' Black ’s advocacy would be too strong for campus , ' and ' Black would ‘ polarize ’ the campus . ' "
And while Black has been barred from the Sexuality Roundtable , he has been invited to speak at a screenwriting class .
Said Dean of Students Richard Frost : " ' They have a class that deals with screenwriting , and so there ’s a natural tie in what he would talk about in terms of the process .
That would be an appropriate thing to talk about .
For example , if there ’s a political science class about elections , or politics , or how you do grassroots movement , how you do political organizing , how you do political campaigns , ( that ) would be a great thing for him to talk about because ( ‘ Milk ’ ) has parts of those things in it . ”
Read a PDF of the college paper here .
Added Frost to the Holland Sentinel : " We are willing to do these things , but for the college to do this , we
have to be sure it ’s educational .
It ’s back - and - forth and
educational .
It ’s not advocacy . ”

But trustees said they understand many faculty members thought they did and deeply regret ' confusion and distress that has resulted , ' he said …
The Faculty Senate voted earlier this month to ask the board to withdraw the memo , saying it stifles academic freedoms that encourage open discussion of social issues between students and professors .

Iran and three world powers have been handed a draft agreement aimed at reducing international concerns over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , which proposed the plan after talks in Vienna , wants an answer by Friday .
Details are yet to be confirmed , but the plan is believed to involve Iran exporting uranium to be enriched in France and Russia .
Iran 's chief negotiator has not commented on the uranium export plan .
The negotiations have involved the UN , Iran , France , Russia and the US .
IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei told reporters in Vienna that he was feeling " optimistic " after the talks , which he said had been " very constructive " .
ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC Tehran correspondent
Under the draft plan Iran would send around 1200kg , the majority of its stocks of enriched uranium , to Russia and then to France before it is returned to run a research reactor in Tehran .
The big advantage for the West is that the arrangement would neutralise most of Iran 's stockpile of enriched uranium .
At the very least this would delay Iran 's ability to make a nuclear bomb .
But no Iranian official has yet publicly acknowledged that Iran 's enriched uranium would be shipped out of the country .
There must be doubts whether President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government is really willing to allow its hard - won enriched uranium out of its grasp , particularly as Mr Ahmadinejad has turned the nuclear programme into such a matter of national pride .
But for the West , that key component of the agreement would surely be the deal - breaker .
" Everybody at the meeting was trying to help , trying to look to the future and not to the past , trying to heal the wounds that existed for many years , " he said .
" I have circulated a draft agreement that in my judgment reflects a balanced approach to how to move forward . "
Russian nuclear industry insiders told the BBC the process proposed would involve Iran sending its uranium to the IAEA , which would forward it to Russia for enriching .
The enriched uranium would then be returned to the IAEA and sent to France , which has the technology to add the " cell elements " needed for Iran 's reactor , they said .
This process would enable Iran to obtain enough enriched uranium for its research reactor , but not enough to produce a weapon .
Exporting uranium has been seen as a way for Iran to get the fuel it needs , while giving guarantees to the West that it will not be used for nuclear weapons .
Iranian chief negotiator Ali Asghar Soltaniyeh talked positively about a deal , but did not mention uranium export .
Confidence boost Mr ElBaradei said there had been many technical , legal and policy issues to address in the Vienna talks , as well as " issues of confidence and trust " .
" That is why it has taken us some time and that is why we need to send the agreement to capitals for final approval , " he added .
" I very much hope that people see the big picture - that this agreement could pave the way for a complete normalisation of relations between Iran and the international community . "
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Iran to act quickly , and said her country would continue " to discuss the full range of issues that have divided Iran and the United States for too long " .
She added : " The door is open to a better future for Iran , but the process of engagement cannot be open - ended .
We are not prepared to talk just for the sake of talking . "
France said the plan was acceptable and would benefit Paris and its partners .
Foreign ministry political director Jacques Audibert told France 24 television that the plan was " to remove this ( uranium ) from Iran , use it to make the fuel they need and thereby improve relations and lower the tensions over Iran 's civilian nuclear programme . "
Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and that it has the right to enrich uranium .
Western states believe it is attempting to develop a nuclear weapons programme .

A federal judge on Tuesday revoked bail for Bernard B. Kerik , the former New York police commissioner who is facing conspiracy and fraud charges .
Judge Stephen C. Robinson of Federal District Court in White Plains said Mr. Kerik could not be trusted to honor a consent order prohibiting him from revealing confidential information .
The judge cited an email that Mr. Kerik sent to the head of his defense fund that apparently included such information .
Mr. Kerik had been allowed to remain free on $ 500,000 bail , which was secured by his house in New Jersey .
The judge turned down a request by Mr. Kerik ’s lawyers to keep him from being put behind bars for 48 hours while they prepare an appeal .
Before revoking the bail of Mr. Kerik , Judge Robinson described him as a “ toxic combination of self - minded focus and arrogance , and I fear that combination leads him to believe his ends justify his means . ”
“ He sees the court ’s rulings as an inconvenience , ” Judge Robinson said , “ something to be ignored , and an obstacle to be circumvented . ”
After the proceeding , Mr. Kerik loosened his tie and removed papers and a wallet from his pockets .
He then carefully took off a chain and medallion and handed it to one of his lawyers .
He was led away , not in handcuffs , by court officers .
Jury selection in the trial is to begin Monday .
Mr. Kerik was indicted in November 2007 on corruption , conspiracy and tax fraud charges , and he was arraigned on Dec. 29 , 2008 , on additional charges that he prepared false tax returns .
He pleaded not guilty .
Mr. Kerik served as the city ’s correction and police commissioners under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani , and he gained an international reputation after the Sept. 11 attacks as he was often at Mr. Giuliani ’s side .
Two years after he left office , Mr. Kerik was nominated to lead the Department of Homeland Security , in part because of Mr. Giuliani ’s recommendation .
Mr. Kerik soon withdrew the nomination , citing his failure to pay taxes on an illegal immigrant whom he had hired as his nanny .
News reports soon followed , exploring financial entanglements and ethical problems that led the city to begin an investigation .
During a hearing last month , Judge Robinson criticized Mr. Kerik and his lawyers for what he said were various offenses committed by a lawyer who heads Mr. Kerik ’s legal defense fund .
The judge said the lawyer , Anthony K. Modafferi , sent e-mail messages to him and to The Washington Times that defamed government prosecutors .
Mr. Modafferi violated a consent order because in some of his e-mail messages , he leaked information that indicated he was privy to sealed court papers , Judge Robinson said at last month ’s hearing .
The judge then ordered Mr. Kerik to file an affidavit detailing his legal arrangement with Mr. Modafferi , whom the judge said may end up being called to testify in documents or in court .
The judge now believes that Mr. Kerik sent Mr. Modafferi an email containing the information that the lawyer then passed along .
It was that email that apparently violated the consent decree , causing Mr. Kerik to be jailed .
The specifics details that should not have been released were not revealed on Tuesday .
Robert McNamara , head of the Department of Defense during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations , offered the following analysis in 2005 :
“ I would characterize current U.S. nuclear weapons policy as immoral , illegal , militarily unnecessary and dreadfully dangerous . ” ( FAIR )
Debates about nuclear weapons typically feature lawmakers hyping the potential dangers we face from nuclear - powered foes like Iran and North Korea .
These fears are copied into print and echoed over the airwaves until rational opinions dissolve into mania .
Aside from possessing the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons and aside from being the only state to use them , the U.S. is actually in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty – a fact that must be understood to properly contextualize this issue .
In its 2005 report , Foreign Policy in Focus identified these ( ongoing ) violations :
The United States refused to uphold its previous arms control pledges , blocked consideration of the establishment of a nuclear - free zone in the Middle East , refused to rule out U.S. nuclear attacks against non-nuclear states , and demanded that Iran and North Korea — but not U.S. allies like Israel , Pakistan , and India — be singled out for UN sanctions for their nuclear programs .
That said , I do n’t support a nuclear Iran .
It is unwise to increase access to WMD , especially in a theocratic state .
But I also do n’t support nuclear stockpiles in the U.S. , where war is waged perpetually .
** UPDATE **
Here ’s a specific breakdown of U.S. noncompliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .

This panorama was taken by Scott Parazynski on 7 May 2009 at IMG Camp II on Mt. Everest in Nepal at an elevation of 6,600 meters ( 21,500 feet ) .
A GigaPan Epic and Canon PowerShot G9 were used .
This image is 330 degree panorama .
The SD card in use was of insufficient size to capture a full 360 degrees .
Begining at far left you can observe a small portion of the west face of Everest , with a backdrop of clouds just behind Lhotse ( the dark summit just inset from the border ; this is the 4th highest mountain in the world ) .
Just below Lhotse is the steep Lhotse Face , the standard approach to the summit of Everest ;
The photograph was taken early in the season , so Camp III ( between 24,000 and 24,500 feet above sea level ) has not yet been established .
If you zoom in tightly , however , you can see remnants of the 2008 post - monsoon climbing route : a diagonal cut coarsing up towards the Yellow Band ( a limestone band of rock at roughly 25,000 feet ) is still present .
Moving to the right you can see some of the sub-peaks of Lhotse , followed by the intimidating Nupstse , with hanging glaciers and heavily crevassed features .
The low point in the skyline is the location of the Western Cwm , the valley than connects Camp II to Camp I , the Khumbu Icefall and Everest Base Camp .

David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times and Slate technology writer Farhad Manjoo have both recently opined on the growing confusion consumers are experiencing as they begin to ascertain that Video On Demand is more of a present - day reality than they ’ve either imagined or been led to believe .
As Darth Vader often said : Do not underestimate the power of the Dark Side .
Cable companies want you to believe the worst and expect nothing but poor video quality and playback issues that would keep most folks away from VOD .
The last thing they want to do is see cable Internet broadband use go up while subscriber revenues dwindle as folks get used to the idea of ordering up any movie or TV show on their laptop or desktop computers , or for playback to their HD TV’s and home theater set -ups .
Not to mention the revenue they ’d miss from premium services like their HBO , Showtime and Starz offerings .
Hell no… they wo n’t budge , and especially not when a good portion of broadband use is n’t even running across their cable infrastructure .
As they see no revenue from DSL services and , like all big businesses , are generally adverse to change , the cable companies see no real reason to make VOD an everyday reality or to offer better , faster broadband service at an affordable price .
They are monopolies , and with local cable companies the little fiefdoms of the larger cable monopoly , they could care less about what the consumer wants or does n’t want .
It ’s why , over 30 years after the debut of UHF - Cable there ’s still no à la carte programming available without additional fees on top of what you already pay as a general subscriber .
Granted , everyone ’s gotta make a buck , and in business , if not in life , it ’s survival of the fittest ; yet , the lengths to which the cable companies have gone and will go to in order to turn a dollar puts the screws to the consumer .
The issue for the VOD consumer is simple : can you get enough content and bandwidth to make severing ties with subscription cable service a comfortable reality ?
However , for the cable companies , who tend to make everything complex , the issue is n’t convenience … it ’s how to structure usage - based billings while maintaining their fat profits .
Without enough entertainment content or increased bandwidth for faster , more consistent streaming speeds it ’s highly unlikely Video On Demand will become the delivery system of choice for HD entertainment , and the cable companies are loath to let consumers use all they can under a flat , monthly fee .
Which is where Lazarus and Manjoo come in with ideas on how this might be accomplished .
Both identify the issue as being one of how cable companies might legitimately structure billing based on usage while allowing for customers to legitimately get all they want in terms of content , be it movies and television episodes from any era , music , games and other forms of entertainment made for today ’s HD home theater systems .
Lazarus ’s piece in the Times ( L.A. Times April 15 , 2009 ) , while generally reporting on how Time - Warner Cable intends to find new ways to gouge the customer while providing less than stellar service , gently chided T - W for pricing Internet service based on consumption ( similar to how your other utility bills might work ) he hopes the FCC might step in under its new Obama - appointed chairperson and ensure that reasonably - priced Internet service is available to all regardless of usage metrics .
He indicates that a tiered system favoring low usage consumers would put a kibbosh on nascent services like Netflix ’s Instant Watch and Amazon ’s streaming VOD service .
Within days after that article was published , Lazarus then reported that Time - Warner quickly retracted their initial statements on tiered pricing and are suddenly saying that the idea is off the table … for now .
Manjoo threatens the ultimate in trendy revolt .
.. simply becoming a pirate ( arrrgh ! ) of consumer entertainment through the usual channels for such things if the cable companies or movie studios ca n’t get it together to provide his Superbad fix .
He ’s curious as to why no iTunes - type model exists for getting unlimited Video On Demand and why creative companies that make attempts at this type of system impose various restrictions that deny the consumer a true VOD experience .
Manjoo is absolutely correct in saying that a VOD system would not work with the current restrictive limits that the entertainment conglomerates impose through services like iTunes rental service ( not true VOD since the library ’s rather thin and consists of mostly new titles that disappear quickly ) , Netflix Instant Watch and Amazon VOD among others .
Those restrictions , such as tight time constraints for viewing anything through iTunes , a lack of interesting current titles in the Netflix Instant queue that do n’t date back to the mid-80 ’s underscore the complex licensing issues and ironclad lifecycle process of films that the studios have set up with pay - per - view services , premium cable , regular cable , TV , and other outlets for entertainment .
It means that the ginormous entertainment library that Manjoo envisions for VOD , wherein a consumer could rent today ’s current hit while having unlimited access to the movie and television titles of yesteryear , is simply out of reach at the moment .
And while we know where the cable companies stand on the issue– they need content , tightly restricted and viewable only by subscriber eyes– it ’s the studios who simply do n’t seem to realize how to structure such a system outside of the current lifecycle process they ’ve created … which actually means more revenue for them over the long haul .
They still cannot see the future for what it is , and seem to misjudge the fact that the future is now .
In the meantime , while many of us patiently wait for a HD - VOD system that always seems to be right on the verge of becoming reality , the cable companies are satisfied with providing lackluster broadband service while gouging the consumer for things they do n’t watch and never will ( all those community channels the cable company forces you to have … do you really watch ’em ? ) along with sub-par HD channels that offer the same schedule of crud day - after - day .
The consumer simply has no real choice about it , except to suffer an inadequate system that fattens the profit line of companies like Time - Warner , Cox , Charter and others .
These companies seem quite happy with this status quo wherein they are provided a captive audience without having to do much in terms of updating their services or infrastructure .

OCCUPY THE CRISIS ! : the emerging student - worker direct action movement in california
( a summary commissioned by the antioch rebel newspaper from a participant in the ucsc actions )
On Sept. 24 , thousands of students , faculty , and staff walked out of University of California campuses across the state .
The walk - outs and one - day strike were called by a wide coalition of UC unions and activist groups as a largely symbolic protest against the budget cuts , fee hikes and firings associated with the state budget crisis .
At two campuses , however , in Santa Cruz and Berkeley , some people then walked back in and began to initiate occupations .
Administrators and activists alike were stunned that the logic of symbolic protest had been abandoned for concrete , insurrectionary activity .
Occupation , a tactic which is mostly unfamiliar in the U.S. , is widely generalized in many social struggles throughout the world , and points towards new dimensions of struggle and autonomous organization that are likely to prove particularly vital as the economic crisis continues and deepens .

Administrators and activists alike were stunned that the logic of symbolic protest had been abandoned for concrete , insurrectionary activity .
Occupation , a tactic which is mostly unfamiliar in the U.S. , is widely generalized in many social struggles throughout the world , and points towards new dimensions of struggle and autonomous organization that are likely to prove particularly vital as the economic crisis continues and deepens .
WHAT IS AN OCCUPATION ?
An occupation is a break in capitalist reality that occurs when people directly take control of a space , suspending its normal functions and animating it as a site of struggle and a weapon for autonomous power .
Occupations are a common part of student struggles in France , where for example in 2006 a massive youth movement against the CPE ( a new law that would allow employers to fire first - time workers who had been employed for up to 2 years without cause ) occupied high schools and universities and blockaded transit routes .
In 1999 , the National Autonomous University of Mexico City was occupied for close to a year to prevent tuition from being charged .
Both of these struggles were successful .
In Greece and Chile , long and determined student struggles have turned campuses into cop - free zones , which has in turn led to their use as vital organizing spaces for social movement involving other groups like undocumented migrants and indigenous people .
Occupations have not been seen much in the U.S. since the 1970s until 2008 when workers at the Republic Windows and Doors Factory in Chicago occupied the building and won back pay from the bank that foreclosed the factory .
In following months , university students in New York City staged several occupations in resistance to the corporatization of their schools .
It was this activity which inspired the students in Santa Cruz and Berkeley .
WHAT IS THE CRISIS ?
Students at UCs and CSUs are facing a 32 % fee hike which their governing bodies will ratify on November 17 .
50,000 students were turned away from community colleges this year , and as many will be turned away from CSUs starting next year .
The hikes , cuts and firings affecting public education ( among other services ) throughout this state ( among other places ) are described as austerity measures in response to the global economic crisis .
Like the recession , those in power who are making these decisions would like us to believe they are temporary .
But it seems some of us have learned a little too well .
It turns out that global capital has been in decline for about 30 years , and has only been kept aloft by various financial bubbles - the S&L bubble in the 80s , the dot - com bubble in the 90s and more recently the housing market bubble which burst in 2008 .
This has led to the mass foreclosures throughout California as well as food riots throughout many of the poorer countries in the world .
We are going to school to avoid having to engage in menial labor for the rest of our lives , but this long collapse means the jobs simply wo n't be there .
Most of us are working shit jobs already , sometimes alongside people with degrees .
In the meantime , student loan volume has skyrocketed 800 percent since the early 80s .
College is now just a place where we 'll get ripped off one last time on our way to be dumped out of the system as debt - laden , unemployed nobodies .
Out of a workforce of 20 million in California , 2 million are now unemployed and 1.5 million underemployed .
Each year , it seems , capitalism needs fewer and fewer of us as workers ( except for cops to keep the rest of us in line ) .
We could well be heading into another Great Depression where we will have to band together to squat , loot and organize our own communities just to survive .
Crises are often times when reactionary forces take hold , capitalizing on people 's anxiety and desires to get back to " the way things were " .
This will very likely not be possible this time .
This is why activist approaches geared towards returning things to normal and negotiating with the state miss the point entirely .
We have a chance , if we use it wisely , to steer this crisis away from the reactionary option and towards a decisive break with the nightmare reign of economic value which renders us nothing but its disposable appendages .
WHAT IS HAPPENING ON CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES ?
The occupation of UC Berkeley on Sept 24 failed due to the intervention of reformist student activists , but the occupation of the Grad Student Commons at UCSC went off successfully .
Seizing control of this building on the campus 's central plaza , occupiers hung banners that urged " TAKE OVER CAMPUS , TAKE OVER THE CITY , END CAPITAL ! " and read a statement entitled " Occupy California " .
This explained that the occupation was a tactic to directly open space for the development of student and worker power , not a ploy to bargain with administrators .
The discourse of the activist is dead for us .
We know there is no funding and these assholes could n't help us even if they did see us as anything besides numbers .
Over the next 6 days , the space was used to host meetings about how to broaden and escalate the struggle , as well as to throw several raging dance parties in the plaza .
There was also an attempt to raid the campus bookstore en masse which was thwarted by cops .
Eventually the occupation was dissolved as the deadline of a threatened police action approached , so that the momentum could be kept up and transferred to new projects rather than everyone getting arrested for no reason .
The GSC was a bold step forward in an experimental process .
One thing we learned was that at this stage , authorities are very reluctant to create confrontations : they know they look bad enough already .
A tremendous amount of enthusiasm was focalized through the space , but unfortunately , the occupiers of the GSC had not planned to be able to hold the building for so long and had to scramble to assemble plans to spread radical activity .
We learned that people will come out of the woodwork if they are excited about what 's going on , but also that the occupation has to grow and ramify or it 's nothing .
In the weeks since then , a number of sit-ins and soft ( not barricaded ) occupations of space have occurred at UC Berkeley , CSU Fullerton , and CSU Fresno .
Another building at UCSC , this time including the office of a dean who cut many programs and fired a bunch of people , was occupied briefly .
Participants in the UCSC occupations traveled to several campuses in southern California recently and a UC - wide general assembly was held in Berkely .
Many folks have been inspired by the actions taken in Santa Cruz and there is a lot of talking and planning going on right now .
Some of the main obstacles the emerging student movement is facing are how to connect with non-student workers on campus , with people at other kinds of schools and with society as a whole .
Another big issue is how to avoid being recuperated and co-opted by administrators and activists .
One of the sit-ins , at a library at UC Berkeley , was seized on by the administration as an excuse to privatize library hours while showing how they are really listening to the students .
At the second UCSC occupation , a Marxist professor convinced many people to dismantle barricades and go home early .
It 's hoped by some that the insurrectionary approach will have the virture of deepening , not neutralizing the contradictions we are currently experiencing .
WHAT'S NEXT ?
Unions and student groups have announced they are planning to shut down the UC Regents meeting at UCLA on November 18th to prevent the fee hike from being voted in .
With the CSU Board of Trustees meeting in Long Beach on the same day , actions are being organized at public campuses around the state .
While geared to this temporality , the calls to action are not being framed around any deluded hopes for a return to a normalcy that was never good enough to begin with , and is certainly not coming back anyway .
We are under no illusions that we are ' leading ' a struggle , only that we are situated uniquely to confront the crisis as youth recognizing that we simply have no future in capitalism .
We can only begin where we are .
If we begin , it opens space for other people ( like non-student staff ) to also begin taking charge of their own lives .
If we act in concert , we can collectively dissolve the academy along with the alienating and exploitative society that it serves .
As it states in the " Occupy California " communique , " This crisis is general and the revolt must be generalized ...
We call on the people of California to occupy and escalate . "
This means schools , workplaces , foreclosed homes , BART stations .
This means we will break with capitalist time to inaugurate OUR time .
We have begun .

Some in the scientific community are criticizing the so - called “ post - hoc ” claims of evolutionary psychology .
This is the discipline that explains modern behavior using theories of human adaptation over thousands of years .
But a paper in press by Lisa DeBruine at the University of Aberdeen defends evo psych by offering another angle .
She writes : “ … the real power of an evolutionary perspective lies not in generating … reasons for behavior that we already know about , but in generating novel predictions about behaviors that have not yet been investigated . ”
DeBruine points to an evolutionary way of thinking that can allow us to ask new questions that then lead to testable hypotheses .
Take this example : back in the mid-60s predictions were made about how humans perceived vertical and horizontal distances differently .
One such theory predicted that vertical distances are overestimated when viewed from bottom up .
But no experiments were done , until researchers proposed a possible evolutionary reason for the discrepancy in vertical views .
And here the researchers predicted that humans ought to overestimate a vertical distance from top down , versus looking up from below because of this evolutionary reasoning : a fall from a high perch is much more likely to lead to death or injury .
And this ai n’t good for the overall fitness of the species .
Russell Jackson and Lawrence Cormack confirmed this effect in 2007 .
They found that nearly all of their 210 subjects ( from two separate experiments ) perceived the height to be 32 percent greater when looking down than when looking up .
DeBruine ’s point in her paper is that evo psych perspectives are valuable not because they provide reasons for human behavior , but because they lead to new hypotheses that then lead to discovery that is supported by verifiable evidence .

For all the cheering about the recovery one might think actual jobs were being created or bank lending was increasing .
Neither is true in the US or the Eurozone .
About a month ago the Sydney Herald reported Eurozone private sector lending almost stalls .
Eurozone private sector lending has nearly stalled , the European Central Bank warned on Friday , posing a threat to what is likely to be a weak recovery from the 16 - nation bloc 's first recession .
Growth in loans to the private sector dropped to 0.1 percent in August from a previous record low of 0.7 percent in July , an ECB spokesman said .
Capital Economics European economist Ben May said " there are still few signs that the ECB 's provision of unlimited liquidity to banks is boosting broad money and credit growth . "
Eurozone banks have been criticised by politicians and business leaders for failing to pass on cheap central bank funds to the wider economy and the ECB has also pressed the banks to do their part to support a recovery .
Private - sector lending in the eurozone drops
THE fragile nature of the recovery in the eurozone was highlighted yesterday in figures showing the first decline in private - sector credit since data was first collected in 1991 .
Despite record - low interest rates and efforts to flood the eurozone with funds , the region 's banks have cut the volume of loans to customers .
Loans to eurozone households and firms fell 0.3 pc in September from a year earlier , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) said .
On a monthly basis , lending rose slightly .
Loans to households and business fell , despite the ECB flooding banks with cash in an effort to revive lending -- billions in extra funds have been forwarded to banks .
The ECB also cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 1 pc in a further bid to boost credit .
The annual private - sector lending rate " is a lagging indicator " , said Nick Kounis , chief European economist at Fortis in Amsterdam .
He is forecasting the eurozone economy expanded 0.6 pc in the third quarter from the second .
" The monthly flow data suggests that much of the contraction in lending actually took place in the final months of last year and the first half of this year , while more recently there have been signs of stabilisation . "
ECB Rate Hikes In The Cards ?
THE European Central Bank ( ECB ) will have to start raising interest rates before employment picks up in the eurozone , in order to prevent inflation , German Bundesbank president and council member Axel Weber said yesterday .
But a rise in borrowing costs is still some way off , Mr Weber signalled , in one of the most detailed comments so far on the difficult task of withdrawing central bank stimulus to banks and the economy .
He indicated that the first step would be to start scaling back long - term ECB loans to the banks , which are part of the emergency stimulus measures .
The ECB has been lending banks as much money as they want for up to 12 months since the collapse of Lehman Bros last October .
Mr Weber said the withdrawal of emergency liquidity was likely to play an important role next year and indicated it may precede interest - rate increases , which will come when the ECB sees risks to price stability .
" We wo n't wait until employment picks up or unemployment rates fall to tighten , " Mr Weber said .
" That would definitely be too late .
Our monetary policy must be ahead of the curve , not behind . "
Eurozone Unemployment At Record Highs
With job losses continuing to mount , euro - zone consumers are unlikely to support the currency area 's nascent recovery by spending heavily in the months ahead .
Figures released Friday by the European Union 's statistics agency Eurostat showed the rate of unemployment in the 16 countries that use the euro rose to the highest level since records began in 1999 .
The euro - zone jobless rate inched up to 9.7 % in September from 9.6 % in August .
Eurostat said 184,000 people joined unemployment rolls across the euro zone in September following a rise of 165,000 in August .
That brought the total number of jobless to 15.3 million .
The figures showed that 3.2 million people have lost their jobs in the year to September .
Figures released by Germany 's Federal Statistics office Friday underlined how far the euro zone remains from a recovery in consumer spending .
Germany 's unemployment rate has risen only modestly since the start of the financial crisis , thanks to extensive and expensive government initiatives to keep people in jobs .
But the figures showed that retail sales in the euro zone 's largest member fell in September for the second straight month , down by 0.5 % from August , when retail sales posted a fall of 1.8 % .
" With auto sales also down sharply as payback for the surge in the first half of the year , German consumption clearly contracted sharply ... in the third quarter , " said David Mackie , an economist at J. P. Morgan .
The deal would see Iran exporting its uranium for enrichment Iran will respond to a proposed deal on its controversial nuclear programme by the middle of next week , it has told the UN 's atomic energy agency .
Agency chief Mohammed ElBaradei said he hoped the answer would be " positive " .
The UN watchdog had suggested exporting most of Iran 's enriched uranium to Russia and France for further refining .
The proposal followed talks between the UN , Iran , France , Russia and the US .
Friday was set as the deadline for a response from Tehran .
The draft deal , agreed by the US , France and Russia , was prompted by concern over Iran 's nuclear programme .
' New conditions '
" Iran informed the Director General today that it is considering the proposal in depth and in a favourable light , but needs time until the middle of next week to provide a response , " the IAEA said in a statement .
ANALYSIS BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne
Iran is giving extremely mixed messages over this important deal and has missed a deadline from the UN to give its verdict .
Either Tehran is playing for time or there are genuine differences within the Iranian government .
At one stage Iranian state TV said Tehran could not accept a key part of the agreement , shipping the nuclear material out of the country .
Later Iran told the UN nuclear watchdog that it was considering the plan favourably but needed more time to respond .
If the deal does go forward it would provide some evidence that negotiations with Iran can bear fruit , if not then the wider talks process would face a bleak future and new sanctions would once again be on the agenda .
Q&A : Iran and the nuclear issue
It said Mr ElBaradei hoped that Tehran 's response " will equally be positive , since approval of this agreement will signal a new era of co-operation " .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said : " We hope that they will next week provide a positive response . "
He added that " obviously we would have preferred to have a response today [ Friday ] .
We approach this with a sense of urgency " .
Under the proposal , Iran would get the fuel it needs for its research reactor in Tehran , but this would not be sufficiently enriched to make a bomb .
However , Iranian media earlier on Friday raised new conditions for the deal .
State TV said Iran would prefer to buy uranium for its research reactor , rather than send its own stock abroad for enrichment , as proposed .
It quoted a member of Iran 's negotiating team as saying : " Iran is interested in buying fuel for the Tehran research reactor within the framework of a clear proposal ... we are waiting for the other party 's constructive and trust - building response " .
Before the IAEA statement , France said Iran was not responding positively to the deal .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said during a visit to Lebanon : " I cannot say that the situation regarding Iran is very positive .
" Now , meetings are being held in Vienna ( the IAEA headquarters ) .
But via the indications we are receiving , matters are not very positive . "
Iran 's rejection of the deal would come as a disappointment to the US , Russia and France , and it could make the wider negotiation with Iran much more difficult - and the threat of sanctions more likely , says the BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna .
Enrichment in Russia Russian nuclear industry insiders have told the BBC the proposed process would involve Iran sending its uranium to the IAEA , which would forward it to Russia for enriching .
NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE
Mined uranium ore is purified and reconstituted into solid form known as yellowcake Yellowcake is converted into a gas by heating it to about 64C ( 147 F )
Gas is fed through centrifuges , where its isotopes separate and process is repeated until uranium is enriched Low - level enriched uranium is used for nuclear fuel Highly enriched uranium can be used in nuclear weapons
In depth : Nuclear fuel cycle
The enriched uranium would then be returned to the IAEA and sent to France , which has the technology to add the " cell elements " needed for Iran 's reactor , they said .
This process would enable Iran to obtain enough enriched uranium for its research reactor and for medical use , but the uranium would not be sufficiently enriched to produce a weapon .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and that it has the right to enrich uranium .
It revealed in September that it was building a second uranium enrichment site , in the city of Qom - much to the anger of world leaders who said Iran was building it in secret .
IAEA inspectors plan to visit the site on 25 October .

Events are fast pushing Israel toward a pre-emptive military strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities , probably by next spring .
That strike could well fail .
Or it could succeed at the price of oil at $ 300 a barrel , a Middle East war , and American servicemen caught in between .
So why is the Obama administration doing everything it can to speed the war process along ?
At July 's G - 8 summit in Italy , Iran was given a September deadline to start negotiations over its nuclear programs .
Last week , Iran gave its answer : No .
What 's an American president to do in the face of this nonstarter of a document ?
What else , but pretend it is n't a nonstarter .
Talks begin Oct. 1 .
Light is intangible and , in addition , it travels at great velocity .
Nevertheless , it can be confined to a very small space by controllably inserting light into a microscopic container surrounded by reflective walls .
The light will then be stored by continuous reflections and cannot escape .
In the scientific domain , such a small reflective microcavity is termed a microresonator .
These microresonators find applications in all areas where the interaction between light and matter shall be enhanced and studied in a controlled manner .
An important area of usage is , for example , the laser diode , which has revolutionized telecommunications and optical data storage in the past few decades .
Due to the high velocity of light -- in just one second light travels more than seven times around Earth -- the number of reflections per second in microresonators reaches up to a few trillion .
If , in this situation , the light is to be captured for as little as a millionth of a second , each of the one million reflections that occur during this time may only induce a loss of about one millionth of the light power .
An every - day metallic mirror loses a few percent of the light power per reflection and would thus fall short of this requirement by more than a factor of ten thousand .
A further property of microresonators can be explained best through comparison with a string of a musical instrument : akin to the way in which the latter can only vibrate at distinct frequencies which depend on their length , the dimensions of a microresonator determine the specific optical frequencies or colors it can store .
However , if , like for the example of a laser , the stored light is to be coupled to atoms , its frequency has to be precisely tuned to the relevant atomic species .
The lack of such a possibility of tuning a microresonator is thus a deficiency that impairs many important applications .
At the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz a team of physicists led by Professor Arno Rauschenbeutel have now for the first time realized a microresonator that combines all the desired properties , i.e. , long storage time , small volume , and tunability to arbitrary optical frequencies , in a single monolithic device .
As reported by the research team in the current edition of the scientific journal Physical Review Letters , to accomplish this feat , it is enough to heat and stretch a standard glass fiber until it reaches about half the diameter of a human hair and then to create a bulge - shaped structure with the help of a laser .
Light within this structure is continually reflected at the surface of the fiber and thus travels in a spiral path around the fiber axis .
In doing so , the light cannot escape along the fiber because the diameter of the fiber reduces on either side of the structure .
Similar to the motion of a charged particle stored in a magnetic bottle , i.e. , a particular spatially varying magnetic field , the light oscillates back and forth along the fiber between two turning points .
For this reason , this novel type of microresonator realized by the physicists in Mainz is referred to as a bottle resonator .
Tuning the bottle resonator to a specific optical frequency can be accomplished by simply pulling both ends of the supporting glass fiber .
The resulting mechanical tension changes the refractive index of the glass , so that depending on the tension , the round - trip of the light is lengthened or shortened .
Because of its exceptional characteristics and its simple design based on glass - fiber technology , the bottle resonator opens up numerous areas of application .
“ At Mainz University , we aim to use this novel multifunctional microresonator for coupling minute light fields , consisting of single photons , with single atoms , ” explains Professor Rauschenbeutel from the QUANTUM , Quantum - , Atom - , and Neutron - Physics - Division at the Institute of Physics of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz .
“ If that were successful , one could realize , for example , a glass fiber based quantum interface between light and matter , ” according to Rauschenbeutel .
This would then be an important contribution towards quantum communication and the future realization of a quantum computer .
Obama ’s European Honeymoon Is Over
The notion that the United States cannot govern the world alone , that the time has come for Americans to think " intercontinentally , " is hardly revolutionary .
On July 4 , 1962 , U.S. President John F. Kennedy described the obsolescence of the idea of U.S. hegemony : " Acting on our own , by ourselves , we cannot establish justice throughout the world ; we cannot insure its domestic tranquility or provide for its common defense , or promote its general welfare , or secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . "
The United States must , as Kennedy believed then , seek out a partner in this endeavor .
That partner was Europe .
Forty - seven years later , a new U.S. president , Barack Obama appears willing to resurrect the tenets of Kennedy ’s speech , adopting a far more conciliatory approach to transatlantic relations than his Republican predecessor .
In his address during April ’s NATO summit , Obama lamented the U.S. " failure to appreciate Europe ’s leading role in the world , " and acknowledged that " there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive , even derisive . "
He promised a more cooperative , multilateral approach where America " listens and learns from our friends and allies . "
European heads of state responded in kind , eager to ride the Obama wave of change .
Hopes for an Obama - led U.S. foreign policy soared , as did expectations for a more integrated and fully formed U.S. - EU partnership .
But that sentiment seems to be fading and some unexpected coolness has entered the relationship .
As early as the G - 20 summit in London , also in April , divergences appeared between the United States and the European Union .
Washington wanted the summit talks to emphasize joint economic stimulus measures .
The EU — particularly Germany , with Europe ’s largest economy , as well as France and Italy — stressed the need for greater financial regulation .
Further , Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized that Germany needed both to export more and maintain balanced budgets — ideas at odds with Washington , which viewed greater European domestic consumption and massive fiscal stimulus as important pieces of the global economic rebalancing puzzle .
Climate change is another area of concern .
It is now too late for the U.S. Congress to pass a climate - change bill before December ’s U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen , Denmark .
Further , whatever climate legislation that does emerge from the U.S. legislature is unlikely to be as meaningful as most Europeans ( and many Americans ) had hoped .
This is leading to disillusionment across the Atlantic , which would like to synchronize its trading scheme with the new U.S. plan .
Differences over Afghanistan in recent weeks also explain some of the unsettling state of affairs .
Despite the hawkish statements of figures like NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen , most European countries are looking to pull back their commitments and support a smaller - scale and lighter - footprint war there .
Washington sees Europeans reluctant to provide more resources to fight the Taliban , while in European capitals there is concern that the Obama administration ’s strategy is growing more uncertain .
It is normal for countries to disagree , even while remaining the staunchest of allies , but the cooling of the U.S. - EU relationship has less to do with policy discrepancies than a growing sense of unfulfilled promises .
The Obama administration may have jettisoned the unilateralist cast of the Bush administration , but it has fallen shy of the more ambitious rhetoric that characterized most previous administrations , whether that of presidents Kennedy , Clinton , or George H.W. Bush .
In his 1962 speech , Kennedy called for a " Declaration of Interdependence " with Europe .
The administration of George H.W. Bush produced the " Transatlantic Declaration . "
President Bill Clinton launched the " New Transatlantic Agenda " and " Joint U.S. -EU Action Plan . "
But no such vision has yet emerged from the Obama administration .
Instead , framed by a pragmatic and unsentimental outlook , it appears that while the United States sees a collection of 27 countries with whom it can and must broker deals , it is not attune to ways to share wide - ranging goals .
While Russia has benefited from an Obama " reset " and the Chinese now have a " strategic " as well as economic dialogue , a new U.S. strategy towards the EU is hard to discern .
And with the absence of a single European approach making transatlantic coordination cumbersome , unitary states such as China , India , Brazil , and even Russia are only too happy to fill in the leadership gap on a range of pressing issues from Iran to the global economy — but not always in a way that promotes U.S. - European interests .
For example , in the delicate task of moving Iran away from a nuclear future , Europe ’s cooperation will be important , but with their global clout and Security Council vetoes , China and Russia are also critical players .
With remaining pieces of the Lisbon Treaty about to fall into place and the identity of the first EU president to be decided soon thereafter , the time is ripe for the European Union to assume a greater role on the world stage and for Obama , as he continues to come under greater international scrutiny , to treat his new European counterpart as a real partner in the U.S. multilateralist foreign - policy agenda .
Whoever becomes the EU president must be someone of global stature — former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , for example — an individual capable of forging common EU foreign policy positions .
The United States in turn must make good on its promise to engage with its European partner .
There ’s no time like the present .
Next week ’s U.S. - EU summit in Washington offers the perfect occasion for the Obama administration to crank up its rhetoric about the importance of the U.S. - European relationship and to finally make good on Kennedy ’s 1962 plan to engage " a strong and united Europe … with whom the United States could deal on a basis of full equality in all the great and burdensome tasks of building and defending a community of free nations . "
VANCOUVER–He saluted his supporters crowded in a Vancouver courtroom to see him off , told his wife he loved her and then the self - proclaimed Prince of Pot gave one last defiant rallying cry .
" Plant the seeds of freedom .
Overgrow the government , everyone , " Marc Emery yelled out as sheriffs led him away to jail .
After years of flouting marijuana laws in Canada , openly smoking bongs in public and making millions off a marijuana seed empire that funded a magazine and an unsuccessful political party , Emery turned himself in to police in Vancouver Monday .
He pleaded guilty earlier this year and made a deal to serve a five - year prison term in the U.S. after being pursued by American authorities for selling seeds through the mail .
Emery , 51 , will be in Canadian custody before being turned over to American authorities in Washington state .
But he 's making a last - ditch attempt to get his supporters to lobby federal Justice Minister Rob Nicholson to stop the extradition or allow him to serve his sentence in Canada .
Emery , who called himself the most visible face of cannabis culture , said his incarceration will motivate millions of Americans to back him .
There were rallies last weekend to protest his arrest in various cities and countries , but nearly all of them drew small crowds .
In Vancouver , where Emery 's business is based , only 150 people showed up .
" I 've probably run the largest - scale revolution that has had no bodies .
There are no victims , no dead people , in my revolution , " said Emery .
" This is a revolution fronted by a beautiful plant .
The world 's most beloved plant . "
Emery has been arrested 18 times and served three months in a Saskatoon prison .
Legendary American - born entertainer Don Lane has died from a dementia - related illness aged 75 .
" Australia has suffered a great loss today , " his manager , Jayne Ambrose , said .
Lane began his career as a nightclub singer before emigrating to Australia in the early 1960s .
He quickly rose to fame as the host of several television variety programs for the Nine Network .
Lane was best known for his work on The Don Lane Show , which debuted on the Nine Network in 1975 and ran until 1983 .
It was on that show that he formed a close on and off - screen relationship with fellow entertainer Bert Newton .
In the 1990s , Lane hosted American NFL broadcasts for the ABC .
He also made a guest appearance on ABC TV's Late Show in 1993 .
Lane - who was once the highest paid man on Australian television - won an astounding 15 Logie Awards during his long career .
In 2003 , he was inducted in to the Logies Hall of Fame .
Frank Crook , editor of TV Week in the 70s , has shared his memories of ' The Lanky Yank ' with ABC's NewsRadio .
" I 'd been out to places for dinner with him and there have been people in the restaurant and they 've looked at him and [ said ] ' Oh , it 's Don Lane ' .
He loved that kind of thing , " Crook said .
" At one stage he carried a pocketful of little necklaces with him and when people would give him a wave he'd go over to the table , and if they had children he'd put the necklaces on them .
That kind of thing .
" I think he always left a lasting impression with everybody that he met , " he added .
Lane was diagnosed with dementia in 2005 .
Ms Ambrose says a private funeral will be held on Friday .
Details of a public memorial are yet to be announced .

Never ones to let a good deed go unpunished , scammers quickly learned to take advantage of a user - friendly policy that allowed a misregistered domain name — perhaps due to a typo — to be withdrawn at no cost .
Scammers used this " Add Grace Period " to grab huge numbers of domains , throw up pages full of advertising , then withdraw the applications before the bill came due .
It was a practice known as " domain tasting , " and it gave the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) a bad case of indigestion .
ICANN , which manages domain name assignments , ultimately responded by imposing penalties that would ensure any group that performed an excessive number of these premature withdrawals wound up with a substantial bill .
In a report on the results of the new policy , released yesterday , ICANN announced that its actions have essentially eliminated the delicious art of domain tasting .
Money for nothing
Domain tasters managed to make money with the practice , which essentially cost them nothing , in several ways .
By registering variants of some domain name in bulk , it would be possible to direct them all to a simple webpage that harvested revenue from advertising services ( Google , for example , acted to block the practice around the same time ICANN did ) .
These could be used to quickly grab users looking for something related to a current event , or to sample a wide range of typos for a popular site ; any names with staying power could be kept , while the rest could be discarded after a few days at no cost .
An alternate approach was to track users as they searched for the availability of different domain names , then register anything they considered .
If the user ultimately tried to register one , the domain taster could offer to part with the one they 'd registered at an inflated price ; if nothing happened in a few days , the name was returned .
None of this was very seemly , and it created an added burden for the domain management system .
Ultimately , the practice attracted a class action lawsuit .
In 2008 , ICANN decided to act .
It allowed domain registrars to withdraw as many as 10 percent of their total registrations ; they would face penalties for anything above that .
Initially , ICANN adopted a budget that included a charge of $ 0.20 for each withdrawal above the limit , which was in effect from June 2008 to July of this year .
Later , it adopted an official policy that raised the penalty to $ 6.75 , the cost of a .org registration ; that took effect in July 2009 .
The results have been dramatic .
Even under the low - cost budget provisions , domain withdrawals during the grace period dropped to 16 percent of what they had been prior to its adoption .
Once the heavy penalties took hold , the withdrawal rate dropped to under half a percent .
Essentially , as the report 's title states , we 've seen " the end of domain tasting . "
One of the unfortunate aspects of networked computing is that the cost of antisocial behaviors is so small ( especially if you have access to a botnet ) that it 's easy to profit from activities that make the Internet a less pleasant place .
It 's nice to see that ICANN has figured out how to make one of these behaviors unprofitable , but it will be difficult or impossible to apply this model to many other unpleasant scams ... or spams .
Chattanooga police have arrested and charged one of their own for allegedly having sex with a Meigs County girl .
Officer Chad E. Bradley , 35 , has been charged with aggravated statutory rape , statutory rape by an authority figure and tampering with evidence , said Lt. Kim Noorbergen , police spokeswoman .
The investigation was initiated on Wednesday .
Since then , investigators have determined that Officer Bradley had consensual sexual encounters with an underaged girl from Meigs County , she said .
Chattanooga police and Meigs County sheriff 's investigators located the victim today and interviewed her .
The victim is a 17 - year - old white female , police said .
She confirmed several consensual sexual encounters with the officer , police said .
Two of those were while he was on duty , Lt. Noorbergen reported .
The relationship began in July and the pair reportedly had engaged in sex four days ago in Meigs County , police said .
He is being charged locally for an encounter that allegedly occurred on Pan Gap Road in August , Lt. Noorbergen said .
Le DVD de la série " A visage découvert " consacré à Nicolas Sarkozy , un documentaire diffusé le 13 juillet sur France 5 et présenté par les journalistes Christian Malard et Bernard Vaillot , a été copié sans autorisation par le service audiovisuel de la présidence de la République à 400 exemplaires , sous la houlette de Frank Louvrier .
C'est ce que révèle Le Canard enchaîné , mercredi 7 octobre , qui explique que ces exemplaires ont été distribués lors de la 17e conférence des ambassadeurs , à la fin août , à Paris .
Edité à l'origine par Galaxie Presse , avec le logo de la production , la copie fabriquée à l'Elysée est frappée du logo de la présidence de la République et du copyright " Service audiovisuel de la présidence de la République - Unité photo - Tous droits réservés ( photos et vidéos ) " , explique l'hebdomadaire satirique , ajoutant qu'il n'est pas fait mention " du nom du producteur " .
Ce dernier , interrogé par Le Canard enchaîné , indique ne pas avoir été prévenu de ces copies .
" C'est un peu cavalier , s'est amusé le directeur de la société , Michel Rager .
D'autant que l'Elysée nous avait demandé cinquante de nos DVD et qu'on leur avait envoyés , gratis . "
De son côté , Frank Louvrier , le chef du service audiovisuel de la présidence de la République , déclare avoir demandé l'autorisation de faire des copies .
" On en avait une cinquantaine , il nous en manquait , on leur a demandé si on pouvait compléter et ils nous ont dit : ' Pas de problème ! ' "

Is it really as simple as " I do n't know anyone like that " ?
Because this is a huge crisis for millions .
The longer the Republicans bottle up the unemployment benefits extension ( for no other reason than they can ) , the more people without other options fall off the unemployment rolls .
You'd think someone in the media might see that as an important story .
But maybe when journalists started getting hired from Ivy League schools , they lost any interest in what happens to the paycheck class .
Gee , I hope not .
But I 'd love to see some evidence to the contrary .
The media should be out front , shaming these people :
Channel TV has said it is " dismayed " that ITV plc is to bring in a system of " double compliance " for shows after the network cast doubt on the smaller Channel 3 franchise holder 's ability to vet programmes .
The ITV franchise holder for the Channel Islands makes revenue from providing legal compliance services for a major ITV1 shows such as The X Factor , Britain 's Got Talent and The British Comedy Awards .
However , after Ofcom said today it would introduce tougher financial penalties for shows that breach the broadcasting code , ITV plc responded by saying that in future all network programmes would be checked again by its in - house team as it had " a lack of confidence in the compliance procedures of Channel Television " .
Channel TV strongly criticised ITV 's response , saying : " We are dismayed that our colleagues in ITV have seen fit to call into question our record ... [ with ITV ] only last year ... described by Ofcom as having a " completely inadequate compliance system " as demonstrated by the programmes they made and complied including Soapstar Superstar , Ant and Dec 's Saturday Night Takeaway and Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon , " the broadcaster said .
" In marked contrast to ITV , Channel has yet to be penalised for compliance failures , although expects a penalty with regard to one show after nine years of complying some of the biggest programmes on ITV such as The X Factor and Britain 's Got Talent . "
An ITV plc source said that compliance should not be seen as a money - spinner and should be aimed at ensuring programmes were of a high standard .
" Compliance should not be a competitive , free market business .
The fact that Channel see it that way should send alarm bells ringing across the industry , " the ITV source added .
" Compliance should be an at - cost service for producers , delivering high quality , security and probity for viewers .
ITV has put in place stringent compliance measures since the Deloitte Report [ into failings ] which are industry gold standard .
We comply thousands of hours of programming for ITV1 and all our digital channels .
Our ratio of breaches against hours of programming complied is minuscule compared to other licensees . "
The new Ofcom plans could leave ITV open to massive fines if ITV1 network shows are found to have breached the broadcasting code .
Ofcom has the power to fine TV companies that break the code up to 5 % of their " qualifying revenue " , which for ITV plc – which owns all 11 Channel 3 regional licences in England and Wales , out of a UK total of 15 – could be as much as £ 75 m overall .
The regulator has only previously been able to fine the individual licensee responsible for legal compliance of shows with its broadcast code .
ITV plc said that because of its size the move could mean it is liable for up to 92 % of any fine for ITV1 network TV shows that breach Ofcom 's regulations .
" The [ Ofcom ] review leaves in place the ability for producers commissioned by the ITV Network to choose which compliance licensee they use , which includes ITV licensees not owned or controlled by ITV plc , " said a spokesman for ITV .
" As a result ITV plc is now obliged to take steps to protect itself from exposure to sanctions arising from compliance processes in respect of which it currently has no control , and little visibility . "
ITV said that it has a " lack of confidence " in Channel TV , the main alternative licensee used by programme makers for compliance of ITV1 network shows .
Channel TV has been responsible for compliance for ITV1 network shows that have broken Ofcom 's broadcast code , including the British Comedy Awards , The Alan Titchmarsh Show , Beat : Life on the Street and the sponsorship credits for The X Factor .
Ofcom moved to update the sanction regulations following a review that concluded that the fines levied over TV phone - in deceptions were not hefty enough .
The regulator fined ITV a record £ 5.675 m last year , for " seriously and repeatedly misleading its audience " on 86 separate occasions over four years , causing viewers to waste £ 7.8 m on premium rate calls .
The shows involved included Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway , Ant and Dec 's Gameshow Marathon and Soapstar Superstar .
Because the ITV network is made up of 15 separate regional franchises with individual Ofcom licences , the regulator has only previously been able to fine up to 5 % of the revenues of the individual licensee responsible for legal compliance with its broadcast code .
Channel TV , the ITV licence holder for the Channel Islands , has qualifying revenue of about £ 4 m , and Ofcom could only impose of maximum fine of £ 200,000 .

Number of people treated in hospital for obesity soars by 360 % in just FIVE years
The number of people ending up in hospital because they are too fat has soared , shocking new figures revealed yesterday .
Last year , obesity was the cause of 60 per cent more hospital admissions than the previous year .
And in the past five years the numbers needing care because they are dangerously overweight has more than quadrupled - up by 360 per cent .
The figures include treatment for breathing problems , Type 2 diabetes , circulation problems , organ failure or heart disease which doctors say was caused by people being obese .
People admitted for weight - loss surgery such as stomach stapling are also included in the data from the NHS Information Centre .
The numbers of people having such surgery has risen since rationing watchdog NICE said people should be offered it on the NHS as a last resort .
Seventy stone : Paul Mason is so overweight he needs to be airlifted to hospital .
Over the last five years , the number of people needing care because they are very overweight has jumped by 360 per cent and by 60 per cent in the last year alone
There were 8,085 admissions for obesity in 2008/09 in England - a 60 per cent rise on 2007/08 ( 5,056 ) and a 360 per cent rise on 2003 / 04 ( 1,746 ) .
Overall , there were 14.2 million hospital admissions in 2008 / 09 , a 5 per cent increase on 2007/08 ( 13.5 million ) and a 20 per cent increase on 2003 / 04 ( 11.8 million ) .
Just over five million of these were emergency admissions , 5 per cent ( 260,000 ) more than in 2007/08 when emergency admissions stood at 4.8 million - putting casualty departments under mounting pressure .
The number of day cases reached 5.2 million in 2008/09 compared to 4.8 million in 2007/08 .
Tim Straughan , chief executive of the NHS Information Centre , said : ' The large increase in admissions for obesity reflects the growing impact that obesity has on the health of our nation as well as the demands it is placing on limited NHS resources .
' However , it also reflects the fact that overweight people are resorting to treatments such as bariatric surgery to tackle their health problems . '
Tory health spokesman Mike Penning said : ' Regrettably , the Labour Government have neglected their responsibilities when it comes to helping people to live healthy lives .
' There has never been a consistent plan to address the very serious problem of obesity , and these hospital admissions show that all too clearly .
A rise of 360 per cent in patient admissions for obesity over five years is a damning indictment of a Labour Party that has run out of ideas . '
Last week , it emerged a 70 - stone man who needs specialist medical treatment could make the 150 - mile journey to hospital in a private ambulance purpose - built for obese patients .
The St John Ambulance service said one of its specially - built bariatric ambulances could be used to move 48 - year - old Paul Mason - reportedly the world 's heaviest man - from his home in Ipswich , Suffolk , to Chichester , West Sussex .
Tam Fry , of the National Obesity Forum , said of the latest data : ' These figures are no surprise whatsoever and what 's sad is that unfortunately they are going increase even more .
' We are going to see more and more cases like Paul Mason .
The obesity problem is like a tsunami , as it rolls across it gathers momentum and we are going to see more and more people in hospital .
' Also , quick fixes seem to be the flavour of the month - we no longer try to use diet and exercise as a way of treating this problem .
The increasing demand for bariatric surgery is going to put a lot of pressure on the NHS . '
Public health minister Gillian Merron said : ' Obesity is one of the biggest health challenges we face .
We are taking action to address it and to prevent people becoming obese in the first place , backed up by major investment .
' Independent guidance on obesity from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that drugs and surgery should always be a last resort .
' Treating patients with drugs or recommending surgery is rightly a clinical decision - a healthier diet and more activity should be tried first . '
Earlier this week , Steve Jobs characterized iTunes 9 the " the biggest release of iTunes in a long time . "
We naturally grabbed a copy and took it around the block a few times to see if we could verify that claim for ourselves .
Though the biggest changes ( aside from the Home Sharing feature ) are mainly connected to the highly revised iTunes Store , what we discovered is that iTunes 9 has many refinements that are hidden all over the application .
Unfortunately , many of these little settings and features are n't easy to discover , and may be buried in menus you rarely think to check .
UI changes
The first thing we noticed when launching iTunes 9 is that the user interface has been revised yet again .
And no , standard scroll bars are n't part of the changes .
Instead , iTunes 9 looks unlike any Leopard or Snow Leopard application .
Note how almost every UI element looks different , even the sidebar icons .
The new UI look has been hinted to be the actual " Marble " interface theme rumored to appear in Snow Leopard ; it 's now suggested we wo n't actually see it until Mac OS X 10.7 .
iTunes 9 has an interface that departs heavily from that of iLife '09 and standard Snow Leopard UI widgets and styling that was earlier claimed to be Marble .
In particular , iTunes 8 tended towards a darker , more flat look to UI elements , giving it a smoother appearance .
It also used the same darker " unified window " appearance that came with Leopard and is carried over to Snow Leopard .
iTunes 9 , in contrast , has a much lighter window gradient near the top , and all the UI elements have a subtle , but notable 3D appearance .
All the buttons , the information display window , and even the icons in the sidebar all have this slightly smoother , slightly shinier look to them .
Honestly , it 's not a bad look , but I do n't see why Apple is always changing the UI look for iTunes , and why it never quite seems to be in sync with the OS .
The other notable UI change , and one I found confusing after I first launched iTunes 9 , is that in the " browse " mode , columns are to the left of the tracklist , instead of on the top .
By default , iTunes 9 shows a single artist column in a long vertical column on the left , with the track list on the right .
I vastly prefer the old method of having a series of shorter columns on top , and after some playing around in the view menu I found an option to move those browse columns back to the top .
Other UI changes , which are more subtle , include column headers in white , a lighter blue background on the sidebar , and an extremely faint blue background on the browse columns and an alternating light blue stripe in the track list .
Personally , I do n't care too much for these changes , but , c'est la vie .
A new library management scheme
The next thing we noticed is that iTunes was rebuilding the library file , which has become pretty much standard practice with each major ( and occasionally with a minor ) revision of the application .
What we did n't notice is that iTunes 9 brings a new default library management scheme .
That 's because iTunes will only use this new management scheme if it makes a new library , or you specifically tell it to use it .
The command to do so is buried under File > Library > Organize Library .
This new scheme puts a folder inside ~/ Music / iTunes called iTunes Media ( unless you upgrade a previous library , it which case it inexplicably remains named iTunes Music ) .
Inside iTunes Media , there are folders for Downloads , iPod Games ( if you have any ) , Mobile Applications , Movies , Music , Podcasts , Ringtones , and TV shows .
Previously , these folders were scattered in a few different places , and the new scheme is much better organized .
We noticed that a few folders were left over after running the organize command — after some digging it turned out to be either some duplicate files or , in one case , a corrupted file from trying to import a very old , scratched - up copy of Janet Jackson 's Rhythm Nation .
It 's safe to trash these leftovers .
( Several folks have noted that redoing the organization will result in a major Time Machine backup happening of your library , even though only the location of the files have changed — keep that in mind if you decide to opt for better organization . )
The other new thing added to this iTunes Media folder is — finally ! — a watch folder to automatically add media to iTunes .
Why Apple buried it in iTunes Media is beyond all logic , but you can make an alias of the folder and stick it anywhere you like .
I put it on the desktop — you could also put it in the Dock or in the Finder Sidebar for easy drag - and - drop importing into iTunes .
If for some reason the file is n't compatible with iTunes , it 'll get relegated to a " Not Added " folder inside the " Automatically Add to iTunes " folder .
Good move to make the watch folder — people have been asking for it for years — bad move burying it in the media library hierarchy .
The male equivalent of Michele Bachmann rose up in righteous defense of the leader of Republican party , Rush Limbaugh , at his unfair treatment by the NFL in not allowing him join a group that is intent on buying the St. Louis Rams of the NFL .
And no , Steve King did not use the exact words in the title above but he might just as well have .
REP .
STEVE KING ( R - IOWA ) : However , as I listened to the members of this committee discuss this and we 've covered a lot of the territory , I note that Sheila Jackson Lee said that she is concerned that owners need the right image , and her opposition to who might be buying the St. Louis Rams , her reason for that is owners that might not have the right image .
Now , she was n't any more specific than that , but we know who she 's talking about , and that 's Rush Limbaugh .
But I would ask Commissioner Goodell this question .
Your position on owners have the right image , and I would direct it to your statement on the 13th of October where you said , ' I think it 's divisive comments , or they are not what the NFL is all about .
I would not want to see those kinds of comments from people who are in responsible positions within the NFL , no , absolutely not . '
Now , I take you as a man of your word .
But I would point out that you have a couple of owners that have performed lyrics in songs that are far more offensive .
In fact , I do n't think anything that Rush Limbaugh said was offensive , but with Fergie and with J. Lo , they have , between the two of them , alleged that the CIA are terrorists and liars , they 've promoted sexual abuse of women , they 've used the N - word , verbal pornography , recreational drug use , et cetera , and they are owners of the Dolphins ,
And it is also ironic that Fergie was approved as an owner on the very day that you made your statement against Rush Limbaugh .
And I would point out for the committee , the statement that Rush Limbaugh made is this -- that seems to be the one that survives the criticism , and that is : " I think what we 've had here is a little social concern in the NFL .
The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well .
They 're interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well .
McNabb got a lot of credit for the performance of the team that he really did n't deserve , " close quote .
Now , I 've scoured this quote to try to find something that can be implied as racism on the part of Rush Limbaugh , and I can't find it .
There is an implication of racism on the part of the media .
That 's the only quote that seems to survive the scrutiny of chase - checking back original sources in at least nine quotes that were alleged to Rush Limbaugh .
And , by the way , of those , eight are complete fabrications .
They 're not based on anything .
They 're not a misquote .
They 're not a distortion .
They 're complete fabrication .
And the one that remains stands true and shines the light against the media , not against Rush Limbaugh .
And so if you 're concerned about this , Mr. Goodell , then I 'd ask you , you know , are you prepared to level the same charges against Fergie and J. Lo , or are you prepared to apologize to Rush Limbaugh today ? "

Sandra Day O'Connor Getty Images
WILLIAMSBURG , Va.  Retired Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor says she regrets that some of her decisions " are being dismantled " by the current Supreme Court .
O'Connor , who generally has avoided questions on the substance of the court under Chief Justice John Roberts , made the observation during a wide - ranging and unusually candid panel discussion over the weekend .
Asked how she felt about the fact that the current court had undone some of her rulings , the nation 's first woman justice responded , " What would you feel ?
I 'd be a little bit disappointed .
If you think you 've been helpful , and then it 's dismantled , you think , ' Oh , dear . '
But life goes on .
It 's not always positive . "
FREE SPEECH TEST : Animal - abuse videos test free speech
CASE LOG : Major cases on tap
CAPITAL EVENTS : Washington news
O'Connor , appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1981 , was a moderate conservative who often brokered compromises among justices and across ideological lines .
Since she retired in 2006 , the court has become more conservative and retreated from some rulings in which she crafted consensus , including on abortion rights , campaign finance and government race - based policies .
During the Saturday panel sponsored by the William and Mary Law School , O'Connor emphasized the value of diversity on the bench — in sex , professional experience , geography and religion .
She said she was glad another woman was on the court .
Justice Sonia Sotomayor , the third woman justice in history and the first Latina , succeeded David Souter in August .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the other woman on the court .
" It 's not enough , " O'Connor declared .
O'Connor , a former legislator in Arizona , said it was important for a president to pick justices from a variety of backgrounds .
All nine of the current justices were elevated from U.S. appeals courts .
" I do n't think we should have nine clones up there , " O'Connor said .
Asked about regional diversity , she said , " I do n't think they should all be of one faith , and I do n't think they should all be from one state . "
On the court are now a record six Catholics ; two are Jewish ; one , Protestant .
O'Connor , 79 , lapsed into levity during the discussion when asked what it was like to appear on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart last March .
In a mock whisper she said , " I did n't know what to think .
I had never seen it . "
Things every Christian parent should know
As Christian parents it is your duty to keep your children in the ways of God , ( Prov. 22:6 ) which means you need to be aware of the wiles of the Devil and thus protect your sons and daughters from his tricks ( Eph. 6:11 ) .
When you read this page you will be surprised at what he is using to get your youth .
Please read all the information presented here and do n't just dismiss this as a " conspiracy theory " , there is evidence to back up all of the claims I will make at the end of this page , look it up your self and be on your guard .
Satan wants your children , he is raising an army for his Anti-christ and he is doing everything he can to get them in his grip .
“ Usually when you see wacky space pictures , the Moon is unrealistically close to the Earth .
What ’s up with that ?
I wanted to get a better sense of exactly how the Earth and Moon would appear from an observer in space . ”
And that ’s what Drew Olbrich did in the most beautiful image above .
For all its emptiness , it ’s beautiful for all it represents .
" This image has the most impact if you make it fill your whole screen and then turn off all the lights in the room " suggests Olbrich .
" Stare at it for a while and try to imagine that you ’re out in space looking back through some kind of bizarre porthole . "
Click the on image to check the image in higher resolution versions .
And speaking of higher resolution , while I was contemplating this image I started thinking of what would be the size of the Apollo spacecraft travelling the distance : 250,000 miles .
It would certainly be so tiny that it would not be visible , being less than a pixel in size .
The obvious question then is : what should be the image ’s minimum resolution to have the Apollo spacecraft appear as a single pixel ?
Well , the command and service modules were about 11 meters high .
The lunar module that landed in the Moon was about 6 meters high .
Let ’s be generous ( and a bit arithmetically lazy ) and consider the whole set as 20 meters in size .
If they were represented as a single a pixel , then the 250,000 miles , or 400,000 km , that is , 400 million meters that separate the Earth from the Moon would occupy 20 million pixels .
If your computer screen has a 1024 pixels horizontal resolution and the distance from our planet to the Moon filled the screen in length , a single pixel in your screen would be around 20.000 wider than the size of the Apollo spacecraft .
Picture 20.000 spacecrafts one after the another to fill a single dot in your screen .
It ’s quite hard .
In fact , that would be only in one dimension , so if we were to be lazy again and assume the Apollo spacecraft was much like a spherical cow , or rather , a square spacecraft 20 × 20 meters in size , then you would have 20.000 × 20.000 Apollo spacecrafts to really fill one single square pixel .
That ’s 400 million square Apollo spacecrafts arranged one next to the other like in a parking lot .
Represented as a single dot .
The real number is bigger than that , as the spacecrafts were obviously not square , but cylindrical , slender .
That ’s quite hard to even imagine .
You can do the opposite instead , and picture a 20 million pixels horizontal resolution screen .
That would be equivalent to 10,147 full HD TVs side by side .
A 1024 pixels resolution would mean 10,531 PC monitors .
If each were about 40 cm wide , that would make almost 4 km , over 2 miles of computer screens .
Amongst all these screens , running over a couple of miles , a single point , a tiny pixel would represent the Apollo spacecraft .
Everything else would be empty space .
A single dust particle could accidentally cover the pixel .
One dead pixel could ruin the thing .
And the three astronauts inside the shuttle would be even smaller .
They would be still be smaller than a pixel even with miles of screens .
Now , picture yourself being inside this lone pixel .
" I am alone now , truly alone , and absolutely isolated from any known life . " wrote Michael Collins while he was orbiting the Moon .
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were walking in our satellite for the first time in the epic history of these naked apes .
Collins loneliness may not seem so great if you consider that , even though he was far from Earth , his two friends were " just " 65 miles away , which was the height at which he was orbiting the Moon .
But orbiting means circling the Moon .
He was 65 miles away from his two friends only when he was directly above then .
That was the closest he would be from the Apollo 11 landing site .
For two revolutions , Collins went over the far side of the Moon , where not only he could n’t see Amstrong or Aldrin , but communication with Earth was also impossible .
Those were the moments he was " truly alone " .
The loneliest person ever .
Collins confided in his notes : " My secret terror for the last six months has been leaving them on the Moon and returning to Earth alone " .
Try to imagine being smaller than that pixel and having to go through two miles of screens .
" Now I am within minutes of finding out the truth of the matter , if they fail to rise from the surface , or crash back into it , I am not going to commit suicide ; I am coming home , forthwith , but I will be a marked man for life and I know it . "
Dreary words that portray a little known story of the Apollo 11 journey as told by the " forgotten astronaut " , detailed in an excellent article by Robin McKie at the Guardian .
Forty years later , we know nothing like that happened .
Fortunately , all manned missions to the Moon had three passengers making company to each other .
Which reminds me of something else .
Right now we are more than 6 billion passengers of what Buckminster Fuller popularized as Spaceship Earth .
We may not be that lonely , but all the company we have is each other ’s .
And whilst Earth would fill a lot of screens if each pixel represented 20 meters , our planet is not really that large .
And it ’s only one .
It would be impossible to end this post without mentioning that , as Apollo could be represented as a single pixel lost in the middle of thousands of screens , Earth itself can be seen as a pixel from the edge of the Solar Sysrem .
It is a Pale Blue Dot .
Collins terror was not a sign of weakness but of the most reasonable sanity .
Those are the thoughts we must all share when realizing how , in spite of the chances of life in the Solar System and alien civilizations in the Galaxy , as far as we know we are all " truly alone " , " absolutely isolated from any known life " besides our own .
The abyss Collins stared at is the same one we have been staring from our Pale Blue Dot since the dawn of mankind .
It took us a long time to realize that , and few have grasped just how deep it is .
Some may despair at the prospect .
It ’s only natural , as we are naked apes .
But we are also intelligent apes .
Is n’t it more than clear we must take care of our only , tiny pixel ?
And if the abyss stare back at us , must we not seek other pixels – going to the infinite and beyond , searching other lifeforms , " to boldly go where no man has gone before " ?
Collins conquered the abyss and safely returned with his friends .
Five other missions conquered 250,000 miles of distance , landed on the Moon and came back .
Single pixels travelling for miles of screens .
If we only try , we are capable of achievements so absurdly great that it ’s difficult to even grasp their greatness .

This whole exercise also makes it clear why you cannot take a picture of the artifacts left behind by the astronauts in the Moon : they are smaller than the smaller resolution unit even of the Hubble space telescope , orbiting Earth .
Some recent images of these objects were only obtained by satellites in the Moon ’s orbit .
Olbrich image also reminds of a slightly wet piece or rock .
The top image is from sxc.hu , the Earth - moon scale image was seen at Chongas , and Collins comments were seen in Fogonazos .

Just this month , BP said that it found a giant deepwater field that might turn out to be the biggest oil discovery ever in the Gulf of Mexico , while Anadarko announced a large find in an “ exciting and highly prospective ” region off Sierra Leone .
It is normal for companies to discover billions of barrels of new oil every year , but this year ’s pace is unusually brisk .
New oil discoveries have totaled about 10 billion barrels in the first half of the year , according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
If discoveries continue at that pace through year - end , they are likely to reach the highest level since 2000 .
While recent years have featured speculation about a coming peak and subsequent decline in oil production , people in the industry say there is still plenty of oil in the ground , especially beneath the ocean floor , even if finding and extracting it is becoming harder .
They say that prices and the pace of technological improvement remain the principal factors governing oil production capacity .
While the industry is celebrating the recent discoveries , many executives are anxious about the immediate future , fearing that lower prices might jeopardize their exploration drive .
The world economy is weak , oil prices have tumbled from last year ’s records , corporate profits have shrunk , and global demand for oil remains low .
After falling to $ 34 in December , oil prices have doubled , stabilizing near $ 70 a barrel .
But if the world economy does not pick up , some analysts believe the price could fall again .
Oil companies contend that is not a prospect they can afford .
Despite reaping record profits in recent years , many executives have warned that they need prices above $ 60 a barrel to develop the world ’s more challenging reserves .
In fact , some exploration activity has already slowed this year , as producers seek better terms from service companies and contractors .
Many users are taking up the offer for Windows 7 " Upgrade , " which requires the user to have a pre-existing , legitimate copy of Windows 2000 , XP , or Vista already pre-installed on the user 's machine .
However , Microsoft has recently confirmed it is technically possible to install an upgrade - only edition of Windows 7 on a machine that does n't already have another version of Windows pre-installed .
That said , the firm has also pointed out that doing so is an illegal breach of licensing conditions .
Several websites have printed what they describe as ' workarounds ' , which use an upgrade disc to install the new operating system on an empty machine .
The process appears to take advantage in the way the installation works and does n't involve unauthorized copying of the Windows DVD media .
The financial savings from using this method depends on which edition of Windows 7 the user purchases , but it can be around the $ 100 mark .
Clean Install Trick " Breaches License "
In a post on a company blog , Microsoft 's Eric Ligman writes that using the Clean Install ' upgrade ' trick on a machine that does n't have a pre-existing copy of Windows , breaches licensing restrictions .
He explains that using Windows 7 requires either a full license ( such as that included with copies on new machines ) or a combination of an upgrade license and a license for a previous version .
In the latter case , the previous version must be the official release and not a test or beta edition .
Ligman condemned sites that provided the " workaround " without explaining the licensing rules .
He said such sites " give the impression that because [ the workaround ] is technically possible , it is legal to do .
Unfortunately , by doing this , they irresponsibly put end users at risk of loading unlicensed software . "
( Source : msdn.com )
Can Upgrade Trick be Detected ?
It 's interesting that Microsoft has posted a full - page response to this issue , knowing that doing so will inevitably draw more attention to the Win7 upgrade trick loophole .
This begs the question : is Microsoft 's response simply for " damage control " or does this warning imply that a breached license will cause a PC to fail the Windows Genuine Advantage ( WGA ) check ?
In the latter case , users would have limited access to Windows Updates , meaning that their PC could be more vulnerable to malware and hacker attacks .
In an extraordinarily outspoken speech last night , the Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , described the regulatory system framed by Gordon Brown in 1997 as " inadequate " , claimed that wrongly incentivised bankers had been " playing with fire " , and said that a central tenet of the Financial Services Authority 's new approach was a " delusion " .
Such failures had , suggested Mr King , meant that " we shall all be paying for the impact of this crisis on the public finances for a generation " .
Close to £ 1 trillion of public money has been devoted to supporting the financial sector .
Mr King called the sums " breathtaking " and " not sustainable in the medium term " .

" Anyone who proposed giving government guarantees to retail depositors and other creditors , and then suggested that such funding could be used to finance highly risky and speculative activities , would be thought rather unworldly .
But that is where we are now .
" It is important that banks in receipt of public support are not encouraged to try to earn their way out of that support by resuming the very activities that got them into trouble in the first place , " he said .
The current " tripartite " system of regulation was framed by Gordon Brown when he became Chancellor in 1997 , at which point banking supervision was transferred from the Bank to the FSA .
The basic architecture of the system has been recently reaffirmed by the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , while the Conservatives have said that they will return oversight of banks to the Bank of England .
Despite the risk that the Bank itself is being politicised by this controversy , Mr King laid into the Brown - inspired " inadequately designed regulatory system " , which , he said , " ignited the fuel " that led to the conflagration that has engulfed the nation .
Mr King added that " the past two years have shown how dangerous it is to let bankers play with fire " , adding that " it is a matter of the incentives they face " , pouring fuel of his own on to the debate about bankers ' pay and bonuses .
Mr King also expressed thinly veiled contempt for the proposals made in the Turner review and the Treasury 's White Paper on banking .
He said that the structure and regulation of banking in the UK still " need reform " and called for a " serious review of how the banking industry is structured and regulated " .
The Governor did not so much as pay lip service to the chairman of the FSA , Lord Turner 's review , or the White Paper .
Indeed , Mr King explicitly ridiculed the notion , central to the Turner review , that increasing capital adequacy requirements on banks would be sufficient to deal with the widely acknowledged " too important to fail " problem .
It is , said Mr King , " worth a try " , but Mr King was still scathing – " the belief that appropriate regulation can ensure that speculative activities do not result in failures is a delusion " .
Mr King repeated his call for a separation of so - called " utility banking " , covered by a state guarantee to depositors , from other forms of investment banking .
Such a system prevailed for many decades in the US under the Glass - Steagall Act , finally abolished in the 1990s , and , less formally , in the UK before the Big Bang reforms of 1986 .
He said that resolution of the issue was inevitable – " the sheer creative imagination of the financial sector to think up new ways of taking risk will in the end , I believe , force us to confront the ' too important to fail ' question " .
Mr King said that there are now too few banks and that they yield too much market power , implying that they should be broken up .
" By international standards UK banking is highly concentrated .
There are four large UK banking groups .
Of these four , two are largely in state ownership and their assets are a multiple of the assets of the next largest bank .
As in the English premier league , getting into the top four will not be easy for those outside it . "

Andrew Koob received his Ph.D. in neuroscience from Purdue University in 2005 , and has held research positions at Dartmouth College , the University of California , San Diego , and the University of Munich , Germany .
He 's also the author of The Root of Thought , which explores the purpose and function of glial cells , the most abundant cell type in the brain .
Mind Matters editor Jonah Lehrer chats with Koob about why glia have been overlooked for centuries , and how new experiments with glial cells shed light on some of the most mysterious aspects of the mind .
LEHRER : Your new book , The Root of Thought , is all about the power of glial cells , which actually make up nearly 90 percent of cells in the brain .
What do glial cells do ?
And why do we have so many inside our head ?
KOOB : Originally , scientists did n't think they did anything .
Until the last 20 years , brain scientists believed neurons communicated to each other , represented our thoughts , and that glia were kind of like stucco and mortar holding the house together .
They were considered simple insulators for neuron communication .
There are a few types of glial cells , but recently scientists have begun to focus on a particular type of glial cell called the ' astrocyte , ' as they are abundant in the cortex .
Interestingly , as you go up the evolutionary ladder , astrocytes in the cortex increase in size and number , with humans having the most astrocytes and also the biggest .
Scientists have also discovered that astrocytes communicate to themselves in the cortex and are also capable of sending information to neurons .
Finally , astrocytes are also the adult stem cell in the brain and control blood flow to regions of brain activity .
Because of all these important properties , and since the cortex is believed responsible for higher thought , scientists have started to realize that astrocytes must contribute to thought .
LEHRER : Why have glia been neglected for so long ?
KOOB : To understand this , you have to take a tour of the history of brain science .
Glia were mainly a sidebar for 200 years in the struggle over the idea of the neuron .
A few highlights were :
In the late 18th century , scientists discovered the electrical properties of the neuron in the spine of frogs .
Neurons have long tethers that are easy to study called ' axons ' that extend from the cell body from the brain into the spine and the spine out to the limbs and body .
Similarly , neurons in the senses were linked to the neurons in the brain .
This is where the notion of neurons as the base of our thoughts took root .
In the mid-19th century , glia were just being discovered , and researchers figured the glial cells simply held the neurons together ( glia is greek for glue ) .
What I find sort of hilarious is that scientists stumbled upon a very numerous cell in the brain , an organ responsible for our thoughts and personality , but they were so focused on neurons that they concluded the new cell was worthless .
In the late 19th century a staining method was developed to look at cells more effectively in the brain .
A brilliant researcher from Spain , Santiago Ramon y Cajal , took it upon himself to study the brain from the perspective of neurons .
He meticulously mapped out a scheme for how they process information and are connected , which led to " The Neuron Doctrine . "
( " The Neuron Doctrine " is a belief that neurons are responsible for our thoughts . )
However , Cajal seemed inconvenienced by glial cells .
They were very numerous and obviously hanging out all over the cortex .
Meanwhile , his brother Pedro , who was also a scientist , developed the theory that glial cells were ' support cells ' that insulated neuron electrical properties .
Cajal decided to back his brother 's theory .
And since 1906 when he won the nobel prize , this has been the dogma .
LEHRER : Could you describe some of the early experiments that first led scientists to reconsider the role of glial cells ?
KOOB : Glial experiments did n't get going until the 1960s .
All scientists knew about glia was that if you put neurons in petri dish , you had to have glia , or neurons would die .
Then , Stephen W. Kuffler at Harvard , for reasons unknown , decided to test Pedro 's accepted theory of insulation .
This was around same time that cell counts in the brain revealed glial cells to be nearly 90 % of the brain ( this is where the neuron based idea that we only use 10 % of our brain comes from ) .
Kuffler is notable because he ironically established the Harvard ' neuro ' biology department while he was performing these groundbreaking glial experiments .
Anyway , Kuffler took astrocytes from the leech and mud puppy and added potassium , something that is known to flow out of neurons after they are stimulated .
He thought this would confirm Pedro 's theory that glial cells were insulators .
What he found instead was that the electrical potential of glial cells responded to potassium .
Kuffler and colleagues found that astrocytes exhibited an electrical potential , much like neurons .
They also discovered in the frog and the leech that astrocytes were influenced by neuronal ion exchange , a process long held to be the chemical counterpart to thought .
Since then many researchers have completed experiments on the communicatory ability of glial cells with neurons , including in the late 80s and early 90s when it was discovered glial cells respond to and release ' neuro ' transmitters .
LEHRER : Why are calcium waves important ?
KOOB : In short , calcium waves are how astrocytes communicate to themselves .
Astrocytes have hundreds of ' endfeet ' spreading out from their body .
They look like mini octopi , and they link these endfeet with blood vessels , other astrocytes and neuronal synapses .
Calcium is released from internal stores in astrocytes as they are stimulated , then calcium travels through their endfeet to other astrocytes .
The term ' calcium waves ' describes the calcium release and exchange between astrocytes and between astrocytes and neurons .
Scientists at Yale , most notably Ann H. Cornell - Bell and Steven Finkbeiner , have shown that calcium waves can spread from the point of stimulation of one astrocyte to all other astrocytes in an area hundreds of times the size of the original astrocyte .
Furthermore , calcium waves can also cause neurons to fire .
And calcium waves in the cortex are leading scientists to infer that this style of communication may be conducive to the processing of certain thoughts .
If that is n't convincing , it was recently shown that a molecule that stimulates the same receptors as THC can ignite astrocyte calcium release .
LEHRER : You suggest that glia and their calcium waves might play a role in creativity .
Could you explain ?
KOOB : This idea stems from dreams , sensory deprivation and day dreaming .
Without input from our senses through neurons , how is it that we have such vivid thoughts ?
How is it that when we are deep in thought we seemingly shut off everything in the environment around us ?
In this theory , neurons are tied to our muscular action and external senses .
We know astrocytes monitor neurons for this information .
Similarly , they can induce neurons to fire .
Therefore , astrocytes modulate neuron behavior .
This could mean that calcium waves in astrocytes are our thinking mind .
Neuronal activity without astrocyte processing is a simple reflex ; anything more complicated might require astrocyte processing .
The fact that humans have the most abundant and largest astrocytes of any animal and we are capable of creativity and imagination also lends credence to this speculation .
Calcium is also released randomly and without stimulation from astrocytes ' internal stores in small bursts called ' puffs . '
These random puffs can lead to waves .
It is possible that the seemingly random thoughts during dreams and sensory deprivation experience could be calcium puffs becoming waves in our astrocytes .
Basically , it is obvious that astrocytes are involved in brain processing in the cortex , but the main questions are , do our thoughts and imagination stem from astrocytes working together with neurons , or are our thoughts and imagination solely the domain of astrocytes ?
Maybe the role of neurons is to support astrocytes .
As beer - making businesses go , the Taybeh brewery faces an unusual raft of challenges .
It is the only brewery in the Palestinian territories , where the population is predominantly teetotal Muslims .
It operates in bleak economic conditions , with high unemployment and the extra costs and challenges of dealing with the checkpoints and delays that make up Israel 's military occupation .
And , on top of that , they have to market their Palestinian beer to Israeli customers .
Yet , the Taybeh brewery brews on , producing thousands of bottles of lager every month .
This weekend the village , in the hills of the West Bank just east of Jerusalem , will hold its fifth annual Oktoberfest and expects to attract up to 10,000 visitors – not just tourists , but also inquisitive Palestinians and Israelis .
The Taybeh brewery was born in the years of optimism that followed the Oslo peace accords in the mid-1990s , a time when Palestinians and Israelis hoped an end to their conflict was in sight .
Nadim Khoury , now 50 , had left the village years before and was living in Boston in the US , where he had taught himself to brew beer at home .
His family encouraged him to return to the West Bank .
No bank or aid agency would fund a project as unlikely as a Palestinian brewery , so the family put up the $ 1.2 m themselves and in 1994 set up the brewery on their village land .
" The banks and NGOs thought we were crazy to build a brewery in a Muslim country , " says Khoury .
" But now I think we were lucky we did n't take their money . "
Business virtually ground to a halt in the years of the second intifada – the Palestinian uprising that began in late 2000 .
Many of the brewery 's workers were laid off but , since the business had no mortgage or other debts , it survived .
" I know so many friends who lost their businesses because the banks took over , " Khoury says .
Now that the violence has receded – in the West Bank at least – the brewery is fully functioning again .
Workers produce three different lagers – in varying strengths from light to dark – and this summer launched a new product , Taybeh Halal , a malty , non-alcoholic beer which is being heavily marketed at a young Palestinian demographic .
In part , this is an effort to enter a new market , in part it is an insurance policy .
" Just in case something happens and there is a change in the environment and political situation , " Khoury says .
The brewery dominates the village of Taybeh , which is largely Christian – Khoury himself is Greek Orthodox .
His brother , David , is the mayor .
However , the Christian population is in decline .
Khoury has seen so many Palestinian Christians leaving for a life abroad that he says there are now more of his fellow villagers living in Michigan than in Taybeh itself .
Taybeh beer is surprisingly popular in Japan and is also brewed under licence in Germany .
Closer to home , Khoury sells his beer to restaurants in the more liberal Palestinian cities , such as Ramallah and Bethlehem , but many of the deliveries go into Jerusalem and further into Israel , to Tel Aviv , Haifa and Nazareth .
That brings its own complications , because of the occupation .
Although Taybeh village is only a few minutes drive from Jerusalem , the beer deliveries must go through a checkpoint at Tarqumiya , near Hebron , which is about two hours by road .
There , the trucks are rigorously searched and the beer transferred to Israeli trucks in a process that can take several hours and leave the beer exposed to the sunlight .
Since they use no preservatives in the brewing process , this unwieldy transit process can be particularly problematic , Khoury says .
" My beer is delicate .
I cannot afford to have it sit in the sunlight , " he says .
Khoury himself has a US passport , but because he also has an Israeli- issued West Bank identity card he must apply for a permit to enter Jerusalem .
His permit allows him to enter only through one specified checkpoint , at Qalandiya , and only by foot .
He cannot stay the night and must renew the permit every six months .
He has faced severe delays importing bottles from Europe through Israel , so much so that he now buys Israeli - made bottles .
And he would like to export more Taybeh to the Arab world , but that brings its own complications : the Jordanians impose prohibitively high import duties to protect their own foreign - run beer industry .
If there were freer trade in the Arab world , his non-alcoholic beer would have a larger market .
Nonetheless , there are signs of an improvement in the West Bank economy this year , albeit from a low base .
" Demand has rapidly increased , " says Khoury .
" If there is peace and prosperity , people celebrate more . "
His daughter , Madees , 24 , is now playing a more important role in the brewery and is one day likely to take over from her father .
As well as running a successful business , they hope to change attitudes .
" People do n't believe that we have a product like Taybeh beer brewed in Palestine , " he says .
" On the news they see only violence , bombing and uprisings .
Now we are trying to change this and to show the world we can live in peace with our neighbours .
We are human beings .
We have a right to enjoy life .
Enough is enough with the fighting . "

Whispers of an " evil power " were heard in lines at dairy shops , in streetcars , stores , arguments , kitchens , suburban and long - distance trains , at stations large and small , in dachas and on beaches .
Needless to say , truly mature and cultured people did not tell these stories about an evil power 's visit to the capital .
In fact , they even made fun of them and tried to talk sense into those who told them .
Nevertheless , facts are facts , as they say , and cannot simply be dismissed without explanation : somebody had visited the capital .
The charred cinders of Griboyedov alone , and many other things besides , confirmed it .
Cultured people shared the point of view of the investigating team : it was the work of a gang of hypnotists and ventriloquists magnificently skilled in their art .

It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of Perl 5.11.0 .
Perl 5.11.0 is a DEVELOPMENT release .
We 're making it available to you today to make it easy for you to test your software on what will eventually become Perl 5.12 .
This release is the result of over two years of development by a global community of developers .
You can find a list of high - profile changes in this release in the file " perl5110delta.pod " inside the release .
You can ( or will shortly be able to ) download the 5.11.0 tarball from : http://search.cpan.org/~jesse/perl-5.11.0/
The release 's SHA1 signatures are : 0d436577386c668161e3dad385d233c383bf4c9d perl-5.11.0.tar.bz2 3137486cfe00094d1cd9a00e6e61f152f8fdb26e perl-5.11.0.tar.gz
We welcome your feedback on this release .
If you discover issues with Perl 5.11.0 , please use the ' perlbug ' tool included in this distribution to report them .
If Perl 5.11.0 works well for you , please use the ' perlthanks ' tool included with this distribution to tell the all - volunteer development team how much you appreciate their work .
If you write software in Perl , it is particularly important that you test your software against development releases .
While we strive to maintain source compatibility with prior releases wherever possible , it is always possible that a well - intentioned change can have unexpected consequences .
If you spot a change in a development release which breaks your code , it 's much more likely that we will be able to fix it before the next stable release .
If you only test your code against stable releases of Perl , it may not be possible to undo a backwards - incompatible change which breaks your code .
Today marks a major change in how we 'll be releasing development versions of Perl .
Historically , a single individual , the Perl " pumpking " has been personally responsible for all aspects of the Perl development process - ranging from direction setting , dispute resolution and deep hacking to mentoring , patch application and release engineering .
Over the years , we 've been blessed with a series of extraordinary leaders .
These hackers have eschewed fame , fortune and many nights ' sleep for the good Perl .
To help ensure that we do n't burn out our best diplomats and brightest coders , our release process is changing .
I have recruited the first few volunteer release managers .
Each month , on the 20th , the next release engineer in rotation will cut a new development release .
Today 's release of 5.11.0 is a transitional release to test our release machinery and process .
The schedule for the near future is as follows : 2009 ==== October 2 - 5.11.0 - Jesse Vincent October 20 - 5.11.1 - Jesse Vincent November 20 - 5.11.2 - Yves Orton December 20 - 5.11.3 - Leon Brocard 2010 ==== January 20 - 5.11.4 - Ricardo Signes
If you 're interested in volunteering to join the release - engineer rotation , please contact me off - list and I 'll add you to our talent pool .
It 's not a particularly lucrative job -
The only perks are your name in perlhist , the chance to choose the epigram for a release announcement and the warm feeling you get from bringing a new version of Perl into the world .

Mikey Weinstein , founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , said he wants Gordon Klingenschmitt , a former U.S. Navy chaplain , to " stop asking Jesus to plunder my fields ... seize my assets , kill me and my family then wipe away our descendants for 10 generations . "
The suit also asks the court to stop the defendants – Klingenschmitt and Jim Ammerman , the founders of the Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches – from " encouraging , soliciting , directing , abetting or attempting to induce others to engage in similar conduct . "

Weinstein , who is Jewish , said his family has received death threats , had a swastika daubed on their home , and feces thrown at the house .
He said the harassment started several years ago when he began protesting Christian proselytizing at his alma mater , the Air Force Academy .
A Christian organization is accused of Columbine tactics as they are viewed to be desiring the demise of a former Reagan White House official who accused them of wanting his end through prayer .
Such vicious tactics need to come to an immediate end !
Or should they ?
With the state of this country 's economy and moral fiber , surely we can find something better to entice the court systems with .
If you want to know why the dollar has been falling this week and gold hit a new high , look no further than the weak jobs numbers last Friday and the weak communique issued over the weekend at the G - 7 meeting in Istanbul .
Deploring " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates " is n't exactly a ringing defense of the greenback .
And 9.8 % unemployment convinced markets that monetary policy will remain loose regardless of dollar weakness .

In a rather cruel media ploy , the creators of the upcoming science fiction movie “ 2012 ” are purposely feeding the flames of internet panic about the ridiculous claims that the world will end in 2012 .
This viral marketing campaign has created fake science websites and encourages people to search for “ 2012 ” on the Web .
While there are many websites , like Universe Today , which provide solid and methodical evidence that the 2012 hysteria is complete nonsense , hordes of other sites out there are full of gobbledygook and a gross misstating of what they claim to be scientific evidence that some astronomical event will decimate our planet .
Why are these hoaxers doing this ?
For the oldest reason ever : for profit and notoriety .
If you visit their websites , most are trying to sell books or videos .

It is n’t Denis Mukwege , the doctor who ’s treated at least 21,000 rape victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
He ’s the only doctor there who does such treatment and the hospital he founded has helped hundreds of thousands of women .
It is n’t any of the Chinese dissidents who ’ve been jailed or had to flee their native land for daring to speak against its government .
It is n’t any of the human rights campaigners working in difficult nations without major media recognition .
It is n’t the Afghan woman ’s right campaigner .
And it is n’t Handicap International and the Cluster Munition Coalition , two organizations dedicated to clearing mines and helping the victims of cluster bombs and land mines .
Instead , the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize goes to the leader of a nation that continues to use cluster munitions and refuses to ratify the ban on land mines .
The prize has been awarded on hope .
Maybe that ’s the right thing to do .
The committee put great stock in Obama ’s policy for nuclear disarmament .
And while we have n’t destroyed a single weapon , the goal is as noble as they come .
My own criticisms of Obama would be wiped away if he leaves office with even significant progress towards nuclear disarmament .
I appreciate that much of the world views my native land more favorably since Obama ’s election , and i hope that he will follow the carrot being dangled in front of him .
But i have my reservations .
According to the committee :
Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world ’s attention and given its people hope for a better future .
His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world ’s population .
This is nice talk , but what of arresting a social worker for twittering police orders in Pittsburgh ?
Where is the stern response to the coup in Honduras ?
What of America ’s world leading prison population ?
Am i the only one who questions that the US speaks to everyone of peace while waging war ?
What sort of values are represented by telling Iran that it cannot develop nuclear weapons but refusing to speak on Israel ’s arsenal ?
Can a man who presides over the world ’s largest exporter of arms be a standard bearer for peace ?
Yes , my idealism is peeking through .
But remember that a cynic is just an idealist who ’s been confronted with reality one too many times .
I cannot disagree with the idealism that formed the basis of the committee ’s decision .
I applaud that idealism even if i cannot share it .
But i would like to see the Nobel Peace Prize given to someone who has achieved something rather than discussed achieving something .
I would rather see the prize money used to build another hospital for Congolese rape victims or applied to removing land mines around the world .
I would like to see the award given to someone who ’s work has come in the face of severe adversity , someone who has suffered for his / her idealism and retained it .
I appreciate the thank you given to a president who has , at least apparently , chosen to rejoin the world after the disaster of the previous administration .
But is that such a great achievement ?
Should n’t that be expected of our nation ?
I hope that President Obama leverages this award to good effect .
But i’m finding it more and more difficult to sustain myself on hope .
So i’m left with Gogol , laughing my bitter laugh .
Saudi Arabia is highly dependent on oil exports , which account for most of the government ’s budget .
Last year , when prices peaked , the kingdom ’s oil revenue swelled by 37 percent , to $ 281 billion , according to Jadwa Investment , a Saudi bank .
That was more than four times the 2002 level .
At one point in 2008 , the average gasoline price in the United States surpassed $ 4 a gallon .
Saudi exports are expected to drop to $ 115 billion this year , after oil prices fell .
American gasoline prices are hovering around $ 2.50 a gallon .
The one - year swing in the kingdom ’s revenues shows that oil prices are likely to be a bigger factor in Saudi Arabia ’s future that any restrictions on greenhouse gases , said David G. Victor , an energy expert at the University of California , San Diego .
Mr. Victor dismissed the Saudi stance as a stunt , saying that the real threat for petroleum exporters came from improvements in fuel economy and rising mandates for alternative fuels in the transportation sector , both of which would reduce the need for petroleum products .
“ Oil exporters have always , in my view , far overblown the near - term effects of carbon limits on demand for their products , ” Mr. Victor said .
“ For the Saudis this may be a deal - breaker , but the Saudis are not essential players .
In some sense , one sign that a climate agreement is effective is that big hydrocarbon exporters hate it . ”
A recent study by the International Energy Agency , which advises industrialized nations , found that the cumulative revenue of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would drop by 16 percent from 2008 to 2030 if the world agreed to slash emissions , as opposed to the projection if there were no treaty .
But with oil projected to average $ 100 a barrel , the energy agency estimated that OPEC members would still earn $ 23 trillion over that period .
Mr. Sabban , however , cited an older study by Charles River , a consulting firm , which found that the losses in revenue for Saudi Arabia alone would be $ 19 billion a year starting in 2012 .
As California ’s public retirement funds reel from losses of nearly $ 100 billion in recent years and lack enough cash to cover their long - term costs , thousands of state employees are collecting government pension checks along with their paychecks .
John Benoit , a Republican state senator from Palm Desert and a former California Highway Patrol captain , is one .
He draws a $ 98,600 annual state pension while also collecting a six - figure salary as a lawmaker .
David Turner retired as a state fire chief in 2004 , went back to work for the state firefighting agency two days later and is still employed there .
He collected $ 65,229 in salary in the last fiscal year in addition to a state pension of $ 105,000 .
Paul W. Anderson is a psychiatrist at Napa State Hospital who retired two years ago from the state Department of Mental Health .
His pension is $ 117,840 .
He also received $ 104,200 in state wages in the last fiscal year .

State records show that more than 5,600 others are drawing double checks , a figure 57 % higher than a decade ago .
Meanwhile , billions of dollars -- $ 3.3 billion in this fiscal year alone -- are being siphoned from the state budget to cover pension system expenses .
The California Public Employees ’ Retirement System and California State Teachers ’ Retirement System combined lost about $ 98 billion -- nearly a quarter of their value -- after their investments were battered in the real estate and stock markets over the last two years .
CalPERS is under additional strain from enhancements approved by lawmakers a decade ago that allow most state employees to retire at 55 instead of 60 and public - safety workers at 50 .
“ The notion is we have retirement systems so once people stop working they are provided for , ” said Alicia H. Munnell , director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College .
“ It seems just not acceptable to taxpayers that people are earning a salary and a retirement check . ”
Advertisement
The practice is not illegal .
Most of those getting both salary and pension are designated by the state as “ retired annuitants ” limited to working 960 hours a year , about half - time .
Legislators are different ; they work full - time .
Hiring pensioners can be a bargain , proponents say , largely because their healthcare is already covered by their retirement plan .
“ It ’s really good for the state , because they do n’t have to pay benefits , ” said Anderson , 79 .
Turner , who was 53 when he retired from the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection , was brought back to help bridge a gap in administrative staff , according to Daniel Berlant , a spokesman for the agency .
Advertisement
“ We have a lot of people retiring and we brought him back for his institutional knowledge while we continue to fill some vacancies , ” Berlant said .
Benoit , who retired at age 50 seven years ago , is a member of the state Senate Public Employment and Retirement Committee .
He said he had no comment .
Some states bar workers from returning to service for six months or even a year after they retire , according to the National Assn. of State Retirement Administrators .
Michigan employees forfeit their retirement checks when they go back on the state payroll .
And in Massachusetts , a blue - ribbon panel chaired by Munnell has proposed restricting how soon teachers can return to the public payroll after retirement and limiting the number of hours they can work if they do .
Advertisement
In California , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed moving the age when CHP officers , firefighters and police officers can retire with maximum payments back to 55 and the retirement age for other state workers back to 60 .
“ People are living longer and healthier , ” said David Crane , the governor ’s chief economic advisor .
“ People are working longer in the rest of the population . ”
Some lawmakers agree that it may be time for the state to rethink retirement ages for its workforce , reasoning that there would be fewer retirees on the payroll if workers had to wait until they were truly ready to leave state employment before they started collecting a pension .
“ You have this incentive for retiring early .
It ’s a little disturbing , ” said Sen. Denise Ducheny ( D - San Diego ) .
“ If you can take retirement at 50 and still work , why wait ? ”
Advertisement
But the governor ’s ideas have gained little traction in the Legislature , which is under pressure from public employee unions -- some of California ’s biggest political donors -- to preserve generous retirement benefits .
And government retirement records show that at least eight lawmakers are benefiting from the status quo , receiving public pensions in addition to their legislative salaries and about $ 35,000 a year in per diem expenses .
Assemblyman Joe Coto ( D - San Jose ) is a former school superintendent whose government pension is $ 178,000 .
Combined with his $ 116,000 legislative pay , Coto takes in $ 294,000 per year .
Democratic Assemblyman Tom Ammiano augments his $ 116,000 state income with a $ 75,708 annual pension from the San Francisco retirement system .
He was a member of the Board of Supervisors there , as well as a school board member and a teacher .
Assemblyman Danny Gilmore ( R - Hanford ) , a former CHP assistant chief who collects a $ 106,142 pension from that job and $ 110,000 in legislative salary , said the state needs to look at curbing benefits for workers hired in the future .
But he is adamant that law enforcement workers continue to be allowed to retire at 50 .
Advertisement
“ Being in public safety is a tough job , ” Gilmore said .
But former Assemblyman Keith Richman , a member of the California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility , said those getting a state paycheck while also collecting retirement payments are “ ripping off the taxpayers . ”
Richman ’s group is preparing a possible initiative for the November 2010 ballot that would , among other things , suspend payment of pension benefits during the period a retiree goes back on the state payroll .

Understanding and Caring I was involved in a minimal rear end car accident that resulted in soft tissue damage .
The accident was completely the other drivers fault .
I sought a lawyer for the purpose of getting my medical bills covered , nothing beyond that .
Jamal Allen took my case for the sole purpose of his belief in my injuries and where the fault fell .
After a protracted amount of time of fighting with the other insurance , he delivered a victory that got my medical bills covered .
He 's a straight forward stand up lawyer , and his paralegal Kourtnie was always super helpful and personable .

Ontario's already record budget shortfall has ballooned to a staggering $ 24.7 billion – billions higher than economists expected – and " difficult choices " loom , warns Finance Minister Dwight Duncan .
In the fall economic statement tabled Thursday in the Legislature , Duncan revised the deficit projection upward from the $ 18.5 billion he had announced in June ( and the $ 14.1 billion in the March budget . )
Until earlier this year , the ignominious record was a $ 12.4 billion shortfall in the 1992 budget introduced by NDP finance minister Floyd Laughren .
" Due to this global recession , our economy is now the same size as it was in 2005 .
Tax revenues are also now at 2005 levels , " Duncan told the House .
" Corporate tax revenues fell last year by an unprecedented 48.1 per cent – or over $ 6 billion , " he said .
" At the same time the recession has driven up demand for government services . "
That accounts for the deficit being far worse than the $ 22 billion leading bank economists had anticipated .
" The governments of Canada , the United States and some other provinces have all adjusted their deficit projections upward for the coming year , " said Duncan , noting Ottawa 's is $ 56 billion and Washington 's is $ 1.5 trillion .
" Due to the impact of the global economy on Ontario and our government 's desire to invest in the people of this province , the projected deficit is $ 24.7 billion in 2009 - 10 , " he said .
That 's on a $ 113.7 billion budget , which includes $ 104.3 billion in spending on programs and $ 9.4 billion on interest payments to service a provincial debt that has skyrocketed to $ 137.9 billion .
Despite the gloomy picture , Duncan emphasized that the Liberals would continue their focus on the big - ticket priorities of health - care and education .
To that end , the government will announce its long - anticipated plans Tuesday for all - day junior and senior kindergarten for four - and five - year - olds .
" This initiative will further increase the competitive advantage already found in our highly skilled and educated workforce , " the treasurer said .
" Full - day learning for our four - and five - year - olds will also help parents take advantage of new job opportunities , " he said , conceding that the government will be " phasing in " the program , which could take years .
" Making this investment will require difficult choices on our part , " said Duncan .
" And we will make them . "
While he was vague Thursday , in a speech on Tuesday , the finance minister said a sweeping review of government programs would be coming in the next few months to determine where cuts can be made .
" We will call on our partners in the public and the broader public sector to help us sustain public services in the long term .
We will also review all agencies , boards and commissions to ensure they are meeting Ontarians ' needs and expectations , " he said .
" We made the right choices for today .
As Ontario comes out of the recession , we will eliminate the deficit and pay down debt to ensure the sustainability of the public services we all value . "
However , Duncan did not offer a timetable for deficit reduction and elimination .
Opposition parties were flabbergasted at the new $ 24.7 billion deficit figure , which Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak called " a historically dismal performance " and warned it would boost each Ontario household 's share of the total provincial debt to $ 13,500 .
" The government was living high off the hog , " Hudak thundered in the Legislature .
" The McGuinty government is the problem .
The problem will not be fixed until we replace the sad , worn out McGuinty government . "

New Democrat finance critic Michael Prue said a deficit this large cannot come without dire consequences for both the public and public sector workers .
" I can read the code words , " Prue said .
" They can expect to get whacked in the months ahead . "
On Wednesday , Premier Dalton McGuinty left open the possibility of unpaid furloughs for public servants , including teachers , bureaucrats , and nurses .
That echoed former NDP premier Bob Rae 's " social contract " in 1993 , which introduced the phrase " Rae Days " into the vernacular .
While the Liberals privately insist " Dalton Days " are not on the horizon , McGuinty has steadfastly refused to rule them out .
" We 're just beginning this discussion , " the premier said Wednesday when asked about Rae 's response to a recession .
" I do n't know .
We 've all got our own particular approaches obviously .
I 'll let people judge , but what I would say is that ... the next several months will be very important as we come up to our own particular approach to this . "
Wayne Samuelson , president of the Ontario Federation of Labour , said Wednesday he 's worried the Liberals " are so freaked out about the deficit " they will force workers to take involuntary leave .
" They 're heading for a $ 20 billion deficit and it does n't look like they 're ready to raise taxes and it's pretty clear that the economy is not going to grow so there 's not going to generate extra money there , " said Samuelson .
" You can ( have furloughs for public servants ) or you start privatizing services and selling things off . "
The Ontario Public Service Employees Union ( OPSEU ) urged the Liberals to resist the temptation to privatize or cut .
" Every dollar spent in the public sector not only provides a service that people need , but also provides income that supports families , communities and local businesses , " OPSEU vice - president Patricia Rout said in a statement Wednesday .
" The track record of privatization is one of higher costs , reduced services , poorer jobs and structural deficits , " said Rout .

Obama to troops : I wo n't rush decision
JACKSONVILL E – As he moves closer to deciding whether to send as many as 40,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan , President Barack Obama on Monday reached out to the military men and women whose lives will be most directly affected by whatever new strategy he chooses for redirecting the eight - year - long war .
“ I will never rush the solemn decision of sending you into harm 's way .
I wo n't risk your lives unless it is absolutely necessary , ” Obama pledge to 3,000 marines , naval officers and their families who packed into an airplane hangar at the Naval Air Station here .
“ And if it is necessary , we will back you up to the hilt .
Because you deserve the strategy , the clear mission , and the defined goals , as well as the equipment and support that you need to get the job done . ”

But while the president weighs the advice of his advisors and studies his options , the stakes of his decision were painfully acute .
On Monday , 14 Americans – 11 soldiers and three civilians — were killed in two helicopter crashes in Afghanistan , making it one of the deadliest days of the war .
Obama offered his condolences to the families and loved ones of those who died and said the tragedy was a reminder that members of the military are “ our most precious resource . ”
“ And while no words can ease the ache in their hearts today , may they find some comfort in knowing this : like all those who give their lives in service to America , they were doing their duty and they were doing this nation proud , ” Obama said .
“ They were willing to risk their lives , in this case , to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a safe haven for al Qaeda and its extremist allies . ”
The timing of the deaths could not be worse for the president , who already faces a shaky Afghan government , waning American support for the war , and increasing reluctance among members of his own political party to commit more troops to a worsening conflict with seemingly no end .
Obama is expected to make a decision on a new war strategy in coming weeks .
The president has signaled he could wait until after the war - torn country holds a presidential runoff election on November 7 .
The president ’s military speech at the start of a two - day trip through Florida broadened the reach of his discussions on a new Afghanistan strategy to include rank - and - file service members .
Previously , the president has been briefed on the situation in Pakistan and Afghanistan by the war ’s U.S. commander , Gen. Stanley McChrystal ; he ’s spoken with members of Congress ; and he ’s held six meetings with members of his administration , including one Monday morning with his national security team in the White House Situation Room .
The meeting ran over the scheduled time , and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters afterward that Obama ’s decision “ could come at any moment . ”
“ So as soon as he has it , he 'll make it , ” Gibbs said .
“ Whether that 's before the runoff or not , I just do n't know . ”
Obama headed to Miami later in the day and was greeted with Spanish - language radio ads that criticized his “ reckless government - run health care experiment . ”
In it , RNC Chairman Michael Steele hit Obama on federal spending , saying his $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan has not created jobs .
The spots were a stark contrast to Republican Florida Gov. Charlie Crist ’s embrace of Obama in Fort Myers eight months ago , when the president was there to rally support for his stimulus plan .
The politics has changed since then .
Crist is now trying to fend off a conservative Republican primary opponent in his bid for the Senate and was nowhere near Obama Monday .
But one Republican , Rep. Ander Crenshaw , was in the audience and even flew with Obama on Air Force One. Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) and Rep. Corrine Brown , a Jacksonville Democrat , also made the trip .
“ We honor you for your sacrifices , ” Obama told service men and women , some of whom stood behind him on the stage .
“ And just as you have fulfilled your responsibilities to your nation , your nation will fulfill its responsibilities to you . ”
Crews completed welding on a section of the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge that failed Tuesday but the repair still needs to be tested for safety , a spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation said today .
Officials said they still did not know when the bridge will be reopened to traffic .
The bridge was closed after two rods and a 5,000 - pound crossbeam fell during rush hour traffic at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday .
Three cars were damaged and a driver suffered minor injuries .
The portion that collapsed was part of a repair done over the Labor Day weekend .
That repair was made after crews discovered a cracked link during a seismic safety upgrade .
The rods that snapped held a cap over the cracked link .
The closure left commuters scrambling for alternative routes , whether that meant taking other bridges or using mass transit .
Want to spy , er , keep track of your kids ?
Best Buy 's house brand , Insignia , recently released a new device that can help you do just that .
The device , known as the Little Buddy Child Tracker ( available here ) is a small portable GPS tracker that can be stored ( or snuck ) into a backpack , lunchbox , or pencil case .
Parents can then log onto the web and see where their child is at all times , or receive SMS alerts if they leave a designated area .
It looks like you can track where your child is using a Google Maps Street View type feature , designate a perimeter that your child is supposed to stay in , and make a note of different destinations .
The end result supposedly is that your kids are safer ( assuming they do n't chuck the device onto the kid next to them on the bus or clip it to the family dog ) , because you can always know where they are .
In reality , the idea — while attractive for the paranoid parent — is also a kind of creepy .
I mean , what fun is it to be 14 and skip going to the library after school and instead hang out at Taco Bell with the high schoolers if your mom is going to be trying to track your whereabouts from her BlackBerry ?
What do you think of these types of GPS devices ?
Would you attach one to your kid ?
Let us know !
The FT's Martin Wolf smacks down any hope that the new regulatory overhaul will prevent financial crises from happening again in the future .
Proposals for reform of financial regulation are now everywhere .
The most significant have come from the US , where President Barack Obama ’s administration last week put forward a comprehensive , albeit timid , set of ideas .
But will such proposals make the system less crisis - prone ?
My answer is , no .
The reason for my pessimism is that the crisis has exacerbated the sector ’s weaknesses .
It is unlikely that envisaged reforms will offset this danger .
At the heart of the financial industry are highly leveraged businesses .
Their central activity is creating and trading assets of uncertain value , while their liabilities are , as we have been reminded , guaranteed by the state .
This is a licence to gamble with taxpayers ’ money .
The mystery is that crises erupt so rarely .
The problem remains : Looting , looting and more looting .
As long as you 've got that public guarantee -- and nothing about the new regulatory scheme hints at taking that away -- the game for everyone is to maximize risk .
He adds :
Lucian Bebchuk and Holger Spamann of the Harvard Law School make the big point in an excellent recent paper .*
Its focus is on the incentives affecting management .
These are hugely important .
Still more important , however , is why a limited liability bank , run in the interests of shareholders , is so risky .
In a highly leveraged limited liability business , shareholders will rationally take excessive risks , since they enjoy all the upside but their downside is capped : they cannot lose more than their equity stake , however much the bank loses .
In contemporary banks , leverage of 30 to one is normal .
Higher leverage is not rare .
As the authors argue , “ leveraged bank shareholders have an incentive to increase the volatility of bank assets ” .
Think of two business models with the same expected returns : in one these returns are sure and steady ; in the other the outcome consists of lengthy periods of high returns and the occasional catastrophic loss .
Rational shareholders will prefer the latter .
This is what one sees : high equity returns , by the standards of other established businesses , and occasional wipe - outs .
It 's seemingly basic stuff , but Wolf argues it forcefully , and the matter of looting is the core of the problem .

Last Wednesday in Moscow , the remaining illusions the Obama administration held for cooperation with Russia on the Iranian nuclear program were thrown in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's face .
Stronger sanctions against Iran would be " counterproductive , " said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , just days after President Dmitry Medvedev said sanctions were likely inevitable .
This apparent inconsistency should remind us that Mr. Medvedev is little more than a well - placed spectator , and that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who discounted sanctions in a statement from Beijing , is still the voice ...

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
Thousands of workers were part of a strike in an important north Indian industrial hub Tuesday , underscoring touchy labor relations in Asia 's third - largest economy .
The standoff in the district of Gurgaon , neighboring the Indian capital of New Delhi , was sparked by the death of a protesting worker of an auto - component firm on Sunday .
Police blamed the worker 's death on what they called a clash between groups of striking and non-striking employees .
Trade unions accused company management and police instead .
D.L. Sachdev , secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress ( AITUC ) , insisted Tuesday 's strike had a broader agenda though .
" Workers in Gurgaon are denied the right to form a union and are victimized when they try to do so , " he said .
Sachdev claimed that up to 90,000 workers -- mostly technicians and machine operators -- have joined the stir led by the AITUC , one of India 's main trade unions .
Authorities , however , have declared the strike illegal .
" It is illegal in all respects .
It has also been declared illegal by the labor department , " said Jagdish Nagar , a deputy commissioner of police .
Nagar described the situation as " volatile " .
Workers wielding sticks also indulged in stone - throwing earlier in the day .
Gurgaon , in the north Indian state of Haryana , has witnessed a phenomenal industrial growth over the past few years .
Its industry has provided employment to more than 200,000 people , according to the district Web site .
A number of automobile firms have their plants in Gurgaon .
Many IT companies like Hughes Software , Tata Consultancy Service , Alcatel , HCL , Siemens , GE Capital and Silicon Graphics also have their units located in Gurgaon .
Companies in the South Asian nation , despite its rapid economic growth in recent years , have often faced tough labor issues because of what are seen as archaic laws and company policies on hiring and retrenchment .
Last month , angry workers beat to death a human resources vice president after he laid off 42 employees at an auto parts manufacturing company in southern India .
Also , in early September , India 's Jet Airways had to cancel hundreds of flights after pilots went on strike over the sacking of two of their colleagues .
Last year , the Indian head of an Italian company died after allegedly being beaten by a mob of sacked employees .
More than 60 people were charged with the murder of the chief executive of Graziano Transmissioni near New Delhi .

Six weeks after Jay Leno moved to primetime , NBC ’s wait - and - see approach to his sinking ratings is testing the patience of affiliate stations across the country .
The Peacock network maintains that putting Leno on five nights a week will pay off when fresh episodes of his show go up against reruns on other networks , but so far Leno has been a disappointing lead - in for the late newscasts that follow him .
After a strong start , his program at 10 p.m. is down sharply from its premiere week and is drawing one - quarter fewer viewers than its scripted predecessors a year ago .
This is having a ripple effect on the local newscast and late night .
Ratings for late newscasts at NBC affiliates in 44 of the top 56 metered markets are down this year , falling an average of 13 percent in the first four weeks of the season compared with a year ago .
In 10 of the top 25 major markets , the numbers are worse , with New York down 22 percent , Philadelphia off 37 percent and Miami down 30 percent .
NBC argues there could more factors at work than Leno and points out that some stations , such as Detroit , are up this season .
Still , ratings for NBC affiliates are down more than those of its competitors .
ABC affiliates ’ newscasts are down 10 percent , while CBS ’ are up 8 percent .
“ We believe in the combination of a bankable star like Jay Leno hosting an exciting , topical show five nights a week and are committed to continuing to engage with our affiliates in ways to make that relationship work , ” an NBC spokesman said .
NBC says Leno is a long - term strategy that will play out over 52 weeks , and that most affiliates appear to be on board .
“ Some of the significant dramas right now are going to run out of steam by December and be out until February , ” said DJ Wilson , general manager at KGW in Portland , Ore .
“ There is a real opportunity for Leno to pop .
We really agree that this is a marathon , not a sprint . ”
However , there are signs of growing discontent , with some station managers becoming more vocal about their dissatisfaction .
One manager said the clock is ticking and he gives Leno until next year to show improvement .
“ I give them through February , ” said the manager , who asked to remain unnamed for fear of reprisal .
“ I do n’t think anybody is anxious to pull any triggers .
Plan B is to give the 10 p.m. hour back to the affiliates . ”
The Peacock has been languishing in fourth place for a while , and it ’s been years since it had a strong scripted lead - in at 10 p.m .
In that time , affiliates have grown accustomed to doing the heavy lifting .
With Leno , NBC is easing the pain of lower ratings by giving affiliates additional commercial time to sell .
“ The network reformed the programs so we get an extra bit of commercial inventory , ” said Steve Baboulis , general manager of WNYT - TV in Albany .
“ The reality is our revenue in the 10 o’clock time period is up year - to - year .
The difference is better inventory . ”

WASHINGTON  Burning fossil fuels costs the United States about $ 120 billion a year in health costs , mostly because of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution , the National Academy of Sciences reported in a study issued Monday .
The damages are caused almost equally by coal and oil , according to the study , which was ordered by Congress .
The study set out to measure the costs not incorporated into the price of a kilowatt - hour or a gallon of gasoline or diesel fuel .
The estimates by the academy do not include damages from global warming , which has been linked to the gases produced by burning fossil fuels .
The authors said the extent of such damage , and the timing , were too uncertain to estimate .
Nor did the study measure damage from burning oil for trains , ships and planes .
And it did not include the environmental damage from coal mining or the pollution of rivers with chemicals that were filtered from coal plant smokestacks to keep the air clean .
TUSCALOOSA , Alabama ( Reuters ) - A jury found the mayor of Alabama ’s biggest city , Birmingham , guilty on all 60 counts in a federal corruption trial on Wednesday .
Mayor Larry Langford was found guilty of charges that included bribery , money laundering , criminal conspiracy , mail and wire fraud .
He faces possible life in prison as well as disbarment from office .
Atheistic Outreach
Pro-Outreach
Atheism & Reason ( Off Site ) ( 1999 ) by Austin Cline
" Perhaps you should consider doing what I have long encouraged : planting a seed of doubt .
Rather than attempting to foster a radical change in a person , it would be more realistic to get a person to begin questioning some facet of their religion which they had not seriously questioned before . "

How to Defend Atheism ( 1976 ) by George Smith
" Atheism will not get very far simply by attacking religious belief .
Rather , we have to defend reason , first and foremost , and then criticize religion within that framework . "
Nonbelief and Hope ( 2013 ) by Ryan Stringer
Many people hold on to supernatural beliefs because they feel that certain psychological needs could not be met without them — in particular , they feel that they would not be able to have any hope without such beliefs .
However , nonbelief need not be the " recipe for despair " that it is often assumed to be ; in fact , not only can it leave ample room for hope , but it can help people hope in a realistic , psychologically healthy way when it comes to important things in life .
Because nonbelievers can hope for most of the things that people generally hope for , dispelling the myth that nonbelief is a recipe for despair can go a long way toward making nonbelief psychologically acceptable to those who might otherwise resist it .
Planting a Seed of Doubt by Elie A. Shneour ( 1998 ) ( Off Site )
" To plant a seed of doubt into an unwavering conviction is a vast accomplishment in education as well as in thinking on one 's own .
To be able to doubt is humbling and constructive because it requires the application of rational thought in weighing alternatives .
Once that seed has been planted , it can germinate into a full reexamination of the options , which opens unlimited vistas , or it can remain a dormant seed .
In either case , the process cannot help but enrich each human being and make him or her a more effective and a more balanced member of a better society . "
Should Atheism Be Universally Held ? ( 2001 ) by Michael Martin
In a recent article , Dmitri Tymoczko argues that religion is false but useful .
Therefore , atheism should not be universally held by everyone .
Martin responds to Tymoczko 's article .
The Value of Atheism ( 2010 ) by Ryan Stringer
Supposing that atheism is true , is it important to defend its truth ?
Ryan Stringer emphatically answers in the affirmative .
Stringer argues that if atheism is rationally held to be true , that alone is sufficient reason to defend it , for truth and rational belief are intrinsic goods , and it is generally noble to try to change others ' minds when they seem to hold false beliefs .
In addition , Stringer considers a number of secondary , supplementary reasons for defending atheism .
These range from fighting religiously motivated mistreatment , developing beneficial public policies , redirecting resources going to religious institutions to benefit those in need , understanding our place in the world , and fostering thinking freely as rational and autonomous beings , among other things .
Stringer wraps up by considering whether anything indispensable to the good life is lost when we abandon traditional theistic belief for atheism , concluding that the purported benefits of theistic belief over atheism typically evaporate on closer inspection .

Anti-Outreach
Review of Michael Martin and Ricki Monier ( eds. ) , The Impossibility of God ( 2005 ) by Julian Baggini
" All infidels ... have several reasons to welcome the publication of this definitive anthology of arguments from the past fifty years for the impossibility of God ....
That said , I still found the book faintly dispiriting , futile even .
Rather than finding myself standing on the metaphorical touchline cheering my team as it chalked up point after point , it seemed to me that everyone on the pitch was engaged in a useless game that no one was ever going to win .
This was a bravura performance , but who was it for ? "
Jeffery Jay Lowder maintains this page .
I was writing a little program to track monthly outgoings .
“ Only ” £ 30 / month for internet access or whatever can quickly add up …
But what format should I save the data in ?
XML is heavyweight and redundant compared to S - expressions , compare :
< outgoing rate = " monthly " > < price > 30 .</ price > < name > Internet </ name > </outgoing > ( outgoing ( rate monthly ) ( price 30 . ) ( name " Internet " ) )
( Update : fixed XML x 2 )
One difference I always notice is the redundancy of attributes like rate= ” monthly ” .
S-expressions let you decide to make the attribute structured , but with XML you ’re stuck with a simple string unless you make an incompatible change to the schema .
Another difference is that S - expressions are typed .
30 is a float and “ Internet ” is a string .
XML is all just strings , which sucks when your language is typed .
On the other hand this article makes a good argument that XML is not ( and is better than ) S - expressions .
More debate here .
A killer feature of OCaml is the sexplib syntax extension which makes S - expressions really easy .
You just define any OCaml type in the usual way , and add with sexp after it , and that magically generates serializer and deserializer functions for your type , so you can slurp your data into and out of S - expression files effortlessly .
A page of boilerplate disappears in just two words .
That ’s probably the reason why I ’ll go with S - expressions for this .
Art and the World Economy
by
Brian Holmes & Claire Pentecost
Municipal statue , city of Finicke , Antalya province , Turkey ( all photos CP ; published in catalogue of 11th Istanbul Biennial )
.
An old man with a hearing aid stands with his back to a low wall , juggling a profusion of juicy oranges and bright red tomatoes .
One by one he plucks them from the air and sets them down in perfect pyramids , orange and red .
The juggler is the neoliberal ideologist Friedrich von Hayek , who thinks that that to act in a world of commodities , all you need to know are their prices :
It is a profoundly erroneous truism , repeated by all copy - books and by eminent people when they make speeches , that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing .
The precise opposite is the case .
Civilization advances by extending the number or important operations which we can perform without thinking about them .
On the other side of the wall is a garden crossed by winding paths .
Here and there , gold coins lie scattered on the ground , as if devoid of any value .
A bespectacled man in a woolen suit is watering a row of beans in the sun .
His name is Karl Polanyi , and he reflects aloud on the history of the industrial revolution :
The middle [ or trading ] classes were the bearers of the nascent market economy ; their business interests ran , on the whole , parallel to the general interest in regard to production and employment …
On the other hand , the trading classes had no organ to sense the dangers involved in the exploitation of the physical strength of the worker , the destruction of family life , the devastation of neighborhoods , the denudation of forests , the pollution of rivers , the deterioration of craft standards , the disruption of folkways , and the general degradation of existence including housing and arts , as well as the innumerable forms of private and public life that do not affect profits .
Both these men were economists , and both became famous in the wake of the Great Depression and the Second World War .
Their ideas developed in opposite directions , and over the long run , it is the former with his principle of ignorance who has been vastly more influential .
Could the latter have anything to say to us today , in the wake of yet another global crisis ?
Do artists , curators and intellectuals need to think about what they are doing in the world economy ?
The Crystal Casino
After many long walks , drives and conversations in the prodigious city of Istanbul , we set out to discover where the tomatoes and the oranges come from .
We thought we might also see how the phantasmatic juggler operates in one of the world ’s most prolific gardens .
This quest led us down the Mediterranean coast to Antalya , the fastest growing province in Turkey , the center of the country ’s tourist industry and the leading producer of hothouse vegetables for export .
On these coastal plains we found acres of crystal palaces : the older glass - paned and newer plastic - wrapped greenhouses of the global horticultural industry .
Feeding on the same sunny clime were stretches of condominiums for vacationers , shopping malls , and clusters of five - star hotels including replicas of the Kremlin and the Topkapi Palace .
At first glance the scene was uncannily similar to one we had investigated a few years earlier in the Spanish coastal province of Almería .
But with significant differences .
The Spanish horticultural industry had shallower roots in both time and space .
There it had mushroomed in a compressed twenty - year period so that there were none of the older glass and steel palaces erected in Antalya in the 1940s and 50s ; rather we saw uninterrupted stretches of flat white reflective plastic roofs stretching into the distant haze .
In Spain the vegetables were grown not in local alluvial soil but in packs of imported substrate , regularly cleared and trashed in dumpsites – pesticides , herbicides , plastic and all .
The draining of the regional water table to make all this gardening possible in an arid , semi- desert landscape had brought the region much closer to the brink of ecological collapse .
And the precarious labor was supplied by migrant Africans , mostly working without papers and suffering the bigotry inflicted on foreign workers worldwide .
In Turkey seasonal labor is drawn from the villages of eastern Anatolia , under conditions largely unknown to us , surely not without their own forms of suffering and discrimination .
In both countries we were struck by the singular views of intensive horticulture abutting luxury tourist destinations , locals struggling to make a living through a global export system in unobscured proximity to golf courses , upscale shops , restaurants and marinas designed for the mobile upper classes of globalization .
Such a composite offers a perfect example of what we have come to come to think of as an aesthetics of visible blindness : the capacity of select groups to enjoy the fruits of globalized capital while ignoring the price paid in drudgery and insecurity by others .
In Spain we had wondered what kinds of dark glasses the tourists must wear , not to see the damaging excess of the real - estate boom , the unsustainability of swimming pools and golf courses springing from the thirsty desert , the conditions of brutal labor exploitation rivaling those of the nineteenth century .
Such a blindness is structural : it ’s part of what keeps the whole system going even when it ’s clearly headed for social and ecological disaster .
Our guidebook on the trip to southern Turkey was written not only by Hayek and Polanyi , but also by the generous Istanbulite sociologist Zafer Yenal , who had given us the name of a grower so that we might see something more than the astonishing view from a rental car .
Equipped only with a bad map and a vague idea of our informant ’s territory , we lucked into the right village and spoke his name at the local café .
Hospitable cell phones immediately went into action and five minutes later we were having coffee with Mikhat , a distinguished tomato producer , and Aydin , the owner of an orange grove and also the muhtar , or village headman .
Aydin had taught himself English from a dictionary while working in the greenhouses , and now served us as an excellent translator , with plenty of his own opinions .
The two of them spent their Sunday afternoon giving us a tour of the typical production chain in Antalya .
We visited the family owned greenhouses and orchards , the washing and sorting facility , the box folding plant and warehouse .
The closest we came to the beginning of the line was a high - tech seedling company .
But a full mapping of the production chain is impossible for those who are directly involved .
The growers do n’t decide what they will plant .
In what is called a “ buyer - driven market , ” the exact patented varieties of tomatoes , cucumbers , peppers and other vegetables grown are dictated by an increasingly consolidated oligopoly of transnational distributors and intermediaries who deliver fresh and processed produce to supermarket shelves .
Control of the type of seeds actually in circulation , limited to relatively few out of the vast diversity cultivated through the history of human agriculture , amounts to mastery over the most basic form of shared intellectual property .
These gigantic distant players also determine just what other imported inputs – pesticides , herbicides and fertilizers – will be used by small producers throughout the Mediterranean .
Such conformity is mandatory if they want to enter the market , and the producers themselves have no bargaining power over the price of these necessities .
Last on our tour was the wholesale depot where teams of kerchiefed women packed produce for shipment and where we sat in the office of the local buyer for a taciturn cup of tea .
This buyer marked the end of what could be seen of the production chain from a producer ’s vantage point , being the nearest representative of the price mechanism signaled by markets in Istanbul , Russia , Europe and beyond .
We were witnessing the scene of our guidebook outlined by Friedrich von Hayek :
The most significant fact about this system is the economy of knowledge with which it operates , or how little the individual participants need to know in order to be able to take the right action .
In abbreviated form , by a kind of symbol , only the most essential information is passed on and passed on only to those concerned .
It is more than a metaphor to describe the price system as a kind of machinery for registering change , or a system of telecommunications which enables individual producers to watch merely the movement of a few pointers , as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials , in order to adjust their activities to changes of which they may never know more than is reflected in the price movement .
Hayek believed that human productivity was most effectively coordinated by the market mechanism , registering changes in the availability or need of products across the earth .
Fluctuating prices took the place of knowledge , because the chance to make a profit by selling high or buying low signaled exactly where resources could be allocated most efficiently .
There is an eerie correspondence between this theory and the way things really work .
What small producers are able to know is indeed reduced since they choose neither the seeds nor the chemical inputs or even the type of bee used to fertilize the plants in the greenhouses .
On the selling side of their business they “ watch merely the movement of a few pointers to adjust their activities to changes of which they may never know more than is reflected in the price movement . ”
In this way they become like players sitting at a roulette table , watching the spinning numbers that will determine how well they fare in a given year .
“ We are farmers , gambling is what we do for a living . ”
For both inputs and outputs the farmers are deeply integrated into the global food market , and since they have no control over the price of either , their sense of working blindly has intensified as world food prices and petroleum - based input prices oscillate erratically on the readouts of the electronic markets , climbing one year to the heights of prosperity , falling precipitously the next .
Whether or not they can make meaningful adjustments to global markets affected by fluctuating demand , oversupply , natural disasters , changing standards , currency exchange rates and commodity market speculation makes the difference between whether they will go bust , hit a jackpot , or just get by .
In this way , we discovered , the lives of villagers trying to join a world of consumer abundance are affected by the wild hopes and deep anxieties of what the political economist Susan Strange long ago called “ casino capitalism . ”
With its elegant greenhouses gleaming in the sun alongside the debt - financed palaces of postmodern tourism , Antalya appeared as the land of the crystal casino .
No Accounting For Taste
We spent the night in the town of Finicke , whose main street is adorned with monuments to the magnificent orange .
One shows a globe on a pedestal ; on top of this concrete world stands a girl holding an orange out to the sky .
Producers of all kinds of things want to offer their goods to the world market , and why should n’t they ?
Though the present level of global integration is unprecedented , oranges have been coveted treats in northern climes for centuries .
The oranges we brought back from Antalya were some of the best we ever tasted : juicy , sweet and full of complex flavors .
We wish we could say the same for the tomatoes , whose flesh was hard and flavorless despite their deep red color and impeccable round design .
Are the orange trees holdovers from an older horticulture , unlike the tomato seedlings nurtured in mass - produced plastic trays ?
Are they less subject to the distortions of just - in - time production ?
Is it easier to breed an orange for long distance shipping than to breed a packable tomato retaining the tenderness and flavor we recall from our childhoods ?
Is it a matter of luck ?
Of preference ?
Or some kind of obscure gamble with the intellect , the heart , the bank account and the senses ?
These questions can be existential ones for those who try to place themselves as tasty products in the world vitrine .
While grateful for the chance to travel , exhibit and present in far - flung locales , many of us grow uneasy when self - performance on the art circuit turns into a contest to raise your own price as a signifier of others ’ intelligence , passion , perversity or secret foreknowledge of upcoming trends .
In financialized economies where speculation on the future values of the sky above can wreak havoc with the ground beneath your feet , it ’s quite hard to believe that artistic expression is not just standing in for something bigger to come – like a gigantic hotel , residential complex or entertainment district that will wipe out the gritty neighborhood whose vibrant local life inspired you .
We ’ve thought about these problems for years , while trying to develop other contexts for the expression , reception , elaboration and understanding of art practices .
And when food prices spiked with the commodity bubble of 2008 , then plunged again after farmers around the world had been lured into costly investments , we found it even harder to keep our desires focused on the next invitation to Asia / Latin America / Western Europe / the Middle East .
We too felt like cherry tomatoes on a roulette wheel spinning wildly out of control .
In Antalya province at the site known as Yanartaş arises the famous Mount Chimaera , known since late Antiquity for its flames that flicker in the night , for its literally burning ground .
Historical sources cite this geothermal wonder as the origin of the myth of the Chimera , a fire - breathing hybrid of lion , goat and serpent ; while the natural explanation describes exhalations of methane from metamorphic rocks .
This mythical and real place reminds us of contemporary Chimerica , the hybrid continent we try to call home .
For the last ten years its Eastern workers have produced nearly everything its Western consumers crave , while the East side lends back to the West the money received for the floods of goods , in order to keep the wheels of industry turning .
This unusual geographic phenomenon , characteristic of the global division of labor and power , has been one of the mysteries of late Neoliberalism .
What kept mankind alive on its disjunctive territory , from Chicago to Shanghai , was a system of exchange whose human foundations no one cared to know , as long as the volatile prices added up to profits for politicians and businessmen on both sides .
The lure of gain stoked a decade of unsustainable development , reflected outside the centers of accumulation by the ugly mirrors of impoverishment and war .
Meanwhile , those tastes that market researchers can exhaustively account for – consumer drives and investor appetites – sucked the juice of life from two vast populations , while setting the stage for an economic collapse on a scale last seen in the 1930s .
The natural explanation in this case was not metamorphic but mathematical .
About a hundred and fifty years ago , Marx described the commodity as that product of human labor whose exchange value , seemingly animated with a life of its own , acts to render invisible the social relations that produced it .
About twenty years ago , some inglorious number - crunching quant invented a meta- commodity called the “ collateralized debt obligation ” ( CDO ) .
It ’s a derivative contract whose price is determined by a statistical analysis of the behavior of underlying assets , which in this case are not things but the ability of borrowers to pay their loans .
What these meta -commodities did was allow banks to sell to distant investors the revenue expected from payment on home mortgage loans , so that the bank which initially did the lending got its capital back from thin air , and could immediately go out looking for more borrowers on the ground .
To make the deal sweeter for the distant investors , the loans were split into tiny fractions and recombined with hundreds of others , so that the risk of any single failure to pay was diluted by the hundredfold .
Meanwhile other quants calculated the statistically average rate of bankruptcy on the housing market , which was considered to have the regularity of a natural phenomenon .
Another kind of derivative , known as a “ credit default swap ” ( CDS ) , was sold as insurance on this risk , and indeed on many others , in combinations and hybrids that defy the imagination .
The brilliance of the math and its perfect correspondence with the laws of financial nature omitted just one tiny detail , which was that this circular , self - reinforcing system entirely transformed the markets it was supposed to regulate and stabilize .
Prices rose from the ground like tongues of fire until they reached trembling heights : cut off from all connection with the underlying capacity of the borrowers to pay , the flame fell back to earth and burned everyone it touched .
As foreseen , the default insurance went into effect , but for losses exponentially exceeding what had been judged possible in nature .
And then , metamorphosing from the joyful illusion that it once seemed to be , the fabulous Chimerican prosperity of the early 2000s turned into a monstrous creature , rampant in every country on the face of the earth .
We do not know exactly where the current crisis will lead .
But what we have been foreseeing for the last several years is “ Continental Drift ” : a rearrangement of the unlikely bicontinent in which we briefly lived , the decline of the US dollar as the world ’s reserve currency and the beginning of far - reaching changes in the geopolitical order .
Rather than speculating right now on what those changes may bring at the global level , it may be more useful to draw some conclusions about the relations of art and economics in the period we have just lived through .
From the current economic perspective , growth is the only measurable good , making the signs of rising profit into the one convincing form of beauty .
Wall - to - wall computers , flashing LEDs , gleaming glass and glittering buildings are among the finest sights , but the highlight in the flesh is always the person on the stage , the speculative performance .
You too can be a top- value signifier , seemingly animated with a life of your own .
And a world - class museum can become the gateway of real - estate paradise , if the bar is more spectacular than the paintings .
Since your price is moving upwards on the market , why not let gentrification be your derivative ?
Very few people involved in contemporary art actually think this way , but very many of the funding decisions in the cultural world are made on exactly this basis .
Where the commodity as described by Marx acted to conceal the social relations of labor that produced it , the meta - commodities of our time act to conceal the collective deliberations that create the environment in which any labor , leisure , productivity or culture can take place .
The government of human affairs has been privatized by the calculations of a supposedly natural law .
The veil over all this is what we ’ve been calling the aesthetics of blindness .
But if that is the case , those of us working art face one very important question .
How could the veil be lifted ?
Touching Ground
Let ’s look through the spectacles of the man watering the beans in the garden , with gleaming coins scattered here and there as though devoid of any value .
Polanyi ’s major work , The Great Transformation ( 1944 ) , retraces the rise and fall of the gold standard , which served as the global medium of exchange during the period of the British Empire .
More profoundly it studies the belief in a self - regulating market , elevated to the status of a natural law whereby supply and demand automatically find their proper equilibrium .
The self - regulating market is the underlying structure designated by Adam Smith ’s metaphor of the invisible hand , then later by Hayek ’s more pragmatic image of the telecommunications system .
Looking further , Polanyi observed that the fundaments of human existence – labor , or the health of our bodies ; land , or the cyclically recurring growth of the natural world ; and the human institutions of governance , including money itself – were treated as freely available resources by the capitalist market which invested no care in their reproduction over time .
Labor , land and money are “ fictitious commodities ” by Polanyi ’s account , because their actual origins and destinies lie outside the market , even though the market depends on and depletes them .
The Great Depression and the World Wars are historical examples of the price ultimately paid for their neglect .
The persistent recourse in economics to the illusion of a natural market law serves to justify the core functions of labor and resource exploitation , while the investment of financial signifiers with supernatural powers acts to distract from the many crimes that accompany the system ( or some would say , provide its very basis ) .
These include imperialism , or the plunder of distant territories by force of arms ; enslavement , or the physical coercion of human beings against their will ; the formation of monopolies and oligopolies , permitting the fixing of prices in markets closed to the entry of smaller producers ; and more recently the reign of mass deception , whereby will and desire themselves are reshaped by the media bombardment of manipulative messages .
The grip of the natural law delusion is what gave Margaret Thatcher her hour of credibility , adamantly repeating “ there is no alternative . ”
It ’s remarkable that since the present round of computerized and networked financial innovation began in the mid-1970s , the ranks of the number - crunching quants and the formulas they employ are drawn largely from theoretical physics , reinforcing the economists ’ claim to be describing unequivocal phenomena of nature .
What makes Polanyi so interesting is his refusal of this natural market law .
Yet unlike communist planners of the early twentieth century ( to whom neoliberals automatically reduce any proponents of an “ alternative ” ) he did not believe that human needs and possibilities could be calculated by a central agency .
He understood the dynamics of human societies to be the result of three quite different fields of organization , each of which does not function according to any inherent natural law , but instead by the more - or - less conscious development of ad hoc principles that gradually work themselves into a sustainable balance .
The first of these broad fields of human interaction is exchange , which occurs in a bewildering variety of forms across history , and not only as the reductio ad absurdum of human relations to monetary mathematics .
The second , still quite apparent to the citizens of modernized societies , is redistribution as it is carried out by a centralizing administration .
In recent history this was the welfare - state function , largely banished by the class politics of neoliberalism .
The third domain of social coordination , almost as ignored by official scholarship as it is by market fundamentalists , yet one which still pervades and supports contemporary life , is reciprocity : the informal circulation of services , privileges , favors , care and support between individuals , families , clans , friends , voluntary associations and identity groups .
It was a notion of open - ended reciprocity that prompted a Turkish sociologist to share his rural contacts with us , that made those contacts treat us as guests to whom they offered time , information , openness and a splendid local lunch .
In many more incalculably extensive ways , it is reciprocity that undergirds and makes livable the harsh inhabitation of a world ruled by market numbers .
By recognizing these three fields in their heterogeneity and in the specificity of their mutual interaction it is possible to go beyond the eternal quarrels of the liberals , the communists and the anarchists , each of whom insists on the preeminence of just one field : the market , the state or voluntary association .
Unfortunately , they cannot even adequately describe the real workings of their single sphere of interest , since society is always constituted by particular combinations of all three .
Rather than operating within or against an idealized totality that does not exist on its own , one finds more chances in navigating between existing realms whose specific relations can be played against each other , and changed for the better .
This multidimensional understanding of society provides the tools to draw up much more useful maps of complex situations , including multiple roles for art .
When the market is invested with a superhuman accuracy of judgment , critics and institutions too often validate only what it has already validated .
In this scenario the artists become like our counterparts the horticultural producers , conforming their inventions to signals from a distant empire of finance .
But neither would it be satisfactory to have the state manage what kind of art will be produced and experienced .
Nor is it enough to have an art with no relationship to exchange or redistribution .
Art is a shifter between the three broad fields of interaction , dramatizing insufficiencies , suggesting possibilities , escaping deadlocks , opening utopias and bringing overly theoretical principles back home to lived experience .
As cultural producers we want to bring this full range of possibilities into play – in order to touch the ground , to regain some contact with the fundamental conditions of existence .
Sixty - five years ago , in a phrase whose timeliness verges on the uncanny , Polanyi wrote that “ the trading classes had no organ to sense the dangers involved in the exploitation of the physical strength of the worker , the destruction of family life , the devastation of neighborhoods , the denudation of forests , the pollution of rivers , the deterioration of craft standards , the disruption of folkways , and the general degradation of existence including housing and arts . ”
The sentence strikes home in a world marked by climate change , financial crisis and war .
If exactly the same problems are facing us today , then is n’t this what art most urgently needs to become : a sense organ of humanity , a space in which to perceive and express the transformations that human groups are unleashing upon themselves and their environments ?
A space in which to inquire about the creation of value , the roots of conflict , the sources of vital energy , the paths toward better ways of living ?
Of course , much of artistic production already does that , but in contexts made confused and ambiguous by the operations of financialized taste .
What is finally becoming more obvious today , in the context of the triple crisis – economic , ecological and geopolitical – is that mainstream cosmopolitan culture has been largely absorbed into a predatory system of capture and manipulation , instilling commercial ideologies and prosumer drives and generating multiple forms of self - interested blindness even in the spaces devoted expressly to vision .
The resulting breakdown of the human ecology , or lack of sense in world affairs , is provoking a widening crisis of legitimacy .
This explains the election of a relatively idealistic figure like Barack Obama , or at a smaller scale , the selection of a group like WHW to curate the Istanbul Biennial .
The question is what to do with the opportunities offered by this legitimation crisis .
Some practitioners have recognized that if art is to play any autonomous role in the shaping of contemporary sensibilities , it should be developed and evaluated within spaces of reciprocity where the predatory functions have no hold , whether these are private spaces , self - organized associations , informal networks of exchange or independent media projects .
We are not just talking about strong images emerging from circles of peers under particularly turbulent social circumstances , which can now capture lots of attention on the markets .
If art is to escape overcoding by existing value - forms , it must be created along with philosophical concepts and forms of social practice that are resilient enough to preserve their integrity despite the existing norms and functions .
State institutions – not to mention corporate sponsorship – cannot be trusted to provide the context of art production , for one simple reason : the current panorama shows the extent to which they have failed .
Yet at the same time , many positive developments on the cultural landscape show that artists , critics and curators who have developed strong networks of reciprocity can also find allies in both state - redistributive and market - exchange institutions , in order to develop singular and transformative proposals and to distribute them widely .
In our view – and this could be our polemic – the forces of reciprocity are not politically alive enough in art today .
If we have worked with activism , and if we have developed autonomous critical initiatives like Continental Drift , it ’s clearly for this reason , to engage in productive dialogues with other initiatives that have opened breathing spaces instead of just adapting to their instrumentalization .
Today under the pressure of a triple crisis that will no longer go away , but only continue to morph into successive forms , it is necessary for artists , intellectuals and curators to develop higher levels of ethical exchange before engaging with the compromises of the state and market spheres .
Not to maintain a politically correct consensus or some vain illusion of purity and self - sufficiency , but to find the precise resources that are needed to open up intense and problematic spaces of perception , revealing in advance the further conflicts and collapses which await and threaten – while in the best of cases offering broader perspectives , sweeter affects , clearer concepts and more generous actions in reality .
Polemics aside , we ’ll close with an attempt to answer this essay ’s recurrent questions .
They have to with the origins of taste , the creation of alternatives , and the place of perception in artistic expression .
Since one of the problems we ’ve identified is an excess of economically animated forms and performances – a visible blindness – our research will shift further toward a tactile dimension .
Worlds At Your Fingertips
In a memorable passage from an unfinished book , a philosopher performs the simplest experiment in perception : touching one hand with the other .
Maurice Merleau - Ponty worked in the tradition of phenomenology , trying to provide a philosophical definition of the primary scientific act : the clear and distinct perception of an object by a subject who stands outside it , exterior to what is being perceived .
But when your fingers touch your own fingers , perception doubles back on itself and the subject becomes inseparable from the object .
In this common experience the scientific mind must confront its own presence , its pulsating inherence to the phenomena that it wants to put at a distance .
Like the casting of a gaze , touching involves the expression of a desire to know the world that is indissociable from whatever we will ultimately know of it .
Yet there is a still more common and more poignant experiment in perception : one hand touching someone else ’s , my hand touching yours .
It is through this common experience that one discovers other worlds .
The self - reflexive turn of phenomenology shows that expression – and along with it , the vast material of spoken and written language – is an irreducible part of perception .
Consequently , the upsurge of the new and the encounter with the other can only be sensed in historically shared frameworks of words , ideas , artworks , urban forms etc , themselves existing flush with perception and in intimate contact with its proliferating differences .
To perceive is to constitute the object with the quality of your own attention , but also to be constituted by it : perception is a self - affecting movement that changes the very nature of one ’s sensorium , while spilling over through language , gesture and affect to others who also perceive , reflect and evaluate .
In this way sense is made .
Overflowing from each body in the world , the reciprocal relation of perception and expression gives rise to cultural experience : crisscrossing artifacts of sensate desire , overlaid upon each other in complex patterns that point beyond whatever they designate , toward the depths and the horizons of the worlds we constitute together .
Merleau - Ponty called this intertwining of perceptions “ the chiasm ” – a Greek word designating a point of crossover between two flows .
An example would be the optic chiasm , where the nerves coming from the left and right eye cross and intermingle before vision separates again into different areas on the right and left sides of the brain .
We have yet to find Lake Chiasma on the natural landscape , but we know this feeling of plunging into and emerging from intertwining perceptual worlds .
The emphasis on perception could evoke practices of a documentary nature : attempts to film , photograph , sketch , graph , record , speak or otherwise represent the world .
Such practices are extremely important , because they offer a chance to begin overcoming the blindness of contemporary society .
Yet we must take one further step toward a politics of perception .
In a critique of phenomenology and specifically of Merleau - Ponty , another philosopher shows that what is never taken into account by the scientific gaze is the human imagination .
What happens , asks Cornelius Castoriadis , when we focus our attention on dreams , on delirium , on hallucinations ?
When last night ’s dream is taken as a valid object of perception , “ all of philosophy is knocked out of order . ”
Yet dreams and visions , like images themselves , are also common phenomena .
They are the bearers of their own particular kind of truth and capacity to change the world .
There is a name for the insurgence of the image as a productive force in human thinking : the radical imagination .
Castoriadis defines it as “ the capacity to posit that which is not , to see in something that which is not there . ”
This imagination is not only visual : it is auditory , tactile , gustatory , olfactory , it is sexual and affective , it touches other people .
Here is the intersubjective force that transforms our relation to nature .
Those who proclaim the inexorability of market law do not only refuse to perceive its obvious failings ; they also try to cover up the human potential to see what is not there , to express an aspiration .
The politics of perception is inseparable from a collective exercise of the radical imagination .
As Castoriadis explains : “ I call autonomous a society that not only knows explicitly that it has created its own laws but has instituted itself so as to free its radical imaginary and enable itself to alter its institutions through collective , self - reflective , and deliberate activity .
And I call politics the lucid activity whose object is the institution of an autonomous society . ”
Polanyi wrote the history of the self - regulating market up to its first culmination in the mid-twentieth century , showing that its claim to a basis in natural law was fictive , and that under the cover of this fiction it destroyed the traditional institutions on which it was based in reality .
He called for the creation of new institutions , which could successfully re-insert or “ re-embed ” the world market into a tissue of acknowledged interdependencies that would stabilize it and keep it from exerting its most destructive effects .
Today we are light years from that kind of wisdom .
Yet it is still possible to conceive another society , not by the appeal to natural law but by the exercise of the radical imagination , and by its transformation through a political process into collective institutions .
Museums in the overdeveloped countries are still primarily used for historical conservation and the validation of isolated personal expression , though they are increasingly becoming sites of social design as well , launching pads for new product - behaviors .
But what contemporary societies more urgently need are experimental institutions where the perception of lived environments , the creation of tastes and values and their codification into laws and definitions of reality can all be played out again in concentrated symbolic forms , which include contestation , ambiguity and internal contradiction .
It is the artists ’ intervention on powerfully articulated symbolic material that can touch others , elicit responses and open up a space of reciprocity for many different uses of the radical imagination .
An international exhibition or biennial can be this stage or arena , a time made of many temporalities , a place where many places and their inhabitants come to meet .
This does not mean that everyone will agree .
In an age marked by extreme exploitation , environmental destruction and violent conflict , it ’s likely that they wo n’t .
But the exhibition can also be a place to sharpen new symbolic weapons , or to shift the terms of old arguments .
Instead of instilling preprogrammed behaviors in a manipulative way , it allows for self - conscious experimentation with the orientations of one ’s own perception , and for debate about the possible worlds that are bodied forth in images .
We were touched by our visit to Istanbul , and by our glimpse of a life out in the countryside that we could never have imagined – despite its arrival in bits and pieces to faraway supermarkets .
As in the naïve image of the girl standing on a globe and holding the fruit of her local culture up to the sky , we wanted to offer some food for thought in return : a glimpse of the kinds of knowledge that artistic practices can bring , a feel for singular situations whose life on the ground can never be communicated by the abstract movements of a pointer on the dial of the global markets .
To engage with this knowledge , rather than ignoring it , is one way to contribute to a systemic change .
Maybe it ’s another kind of gamble , but this is what we are looking for in art today : a politics of perception .

As legislation inches through Capitol Hill , onetime allies in the utility sector , like Exelon , which operates low - emission nuclear plants , and the Southern Company , a big consumer of coal , find themselves on opposite sides of the debate over renewable energy .
Utilities that have access to hydroelectric power or operate nuclear plants tend to favor a national mandate to increase the use of renewable power , because their carbon emissions are relatively low .
Many coal - dependent utilities , particularly in the Southeast and Midwest , oppose the provision because they emit more carbon and would have to buy more permits over time .
In past energy policy debates , the oil and gas lobbies were largely united .
In 2005 , they won incentives for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
Two years later , after Democrats had taken control of Congress , producers were unable to block a huge new mandate for alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel , but managed to save valuable oil industry tax breaks that some Democrats tried to end .
Today , each energy subsector , fearing any legislation that might give it a disadvantage , is battling for favor .
The gas producers , for example , have formed the American Natural Gas Alliance , which is spending heavily on advertising and lobbying to point out that gas emits roughly half the carbon dioxide of coal .
The group has also helped organize its allies in Congress into a new natural gas caucus , with two dozen members .

China executed two people Tuesday for their roles in a tainted milk powder scandal in which at least six children died and more than 300,000 became sick .
Zhang Yujun was executed for endangering public safety and Geng Jinping was executed for producing and selling toxic food , according to the official Xinhua News Agency .
Their sentences were upheld in March by an appellate court in the northern city of Shijiazhuang .
China requires death sentences to receive final approval from the Supreme People 's Court in Beijing , after which most are carried out by lethal injection .
Xinhua said news of the execution had been issued by the Shijiazhuang Municipal Intermediate People 's Court , although a court clerk who answered the phone Tuesday said he was unable to confirm the sentences had been carried out .
The case was one of China 's worst - ever food safety scandals , involving tainting of infant formula with the industrial chemical melamine , which can cause kidney stones and kidney failure .
Melamine , used in the manufacture of plastics and fertilizer , was added to watered - down milk to fool inspectors testing for protein , and to boost profits .
Zhang , a cattle farmer , and Geng both had been convicted of producing and selling a phony protein powder containing melamine , much of it to producers who sold tainted milk to the now - defunct Sanlu Group Co. , at the time one of China 's biggest dairies .
Geng 's brother , Geng Jinzhu , was given eight years and his sentence was upheld Thursday .
In all 21 people were tried and sentenced in January over the scandal , including Sanlu 's general manager , Tian Wenhua , who was given a life sentence after pleading guilty to charges of producing and selling fake or substandard products .
Three other former Sanlu executives were given between five years and 15 years in prison .
A total of 21 defendants were being sentenced Thursday in connection with the case .
The harsh sentences underscored the government 's resolve in tackling recurring food safety problems and an eagerness by the Communist leadership to move past the embarrassing scandal .
However , no public investigation was ever made into accusations that news of the melamine tainting was suppressed ahead of last year 's Beijing Olympic Games because the government did not want it overshadowing the prestigious event .

Are we having fun yet ?

No , actually , I 'm not .
I 've been playing Demon 's Souls — a game even its developer admits is n't " a fun game . "
The action - adventure game casts you as a hero confronting where progress is hard - won , recovery supplies are limited and equipment can wear out .
The twist is that when players die , they return as phantoms to navigate the same environments in a weakened state in the hopes of earning their bodies back — that 's right , the game actually gets more challenging the more you fail .
And yet I love it .
I can't stop playing , and I can't really figure out why .
Are n't games supposed to be accessible , and is n't frustration supposed to be a killjoy ?
What 's the allure in this difficult game ?

Expanded audiences and accessibility are major watchwords in the present era of gaming .
Microsoft Game Studios ' Bruce Philips recently unveiled research at Gamasutra showing that even among Xbox 360 games where completion rates are highest , most users only get about half the potential Gamerscore .
And 30 percent of users do n't finish some of the most popular and widely - played titles Philips studied .
His theory – and that of numerous other designers crafting games designed to be appealing to wider audiences – is that frustration is what makes players give up .
But even though I 'm definitely frustrated with Demon 's Souls at times , I 'd say I 'm even more driven to succeed and to conquer than I 've been in a long time .
What gives ?

" I do not think that games must be accessible to be appealing , " Demon 's Souls producer Takeshi Kajii told me in an interview .
" If you make a game accessible it will expand the audience .
However , if we were to make all games accessible , would n't you eventually get tired of the same thing ? "
Kajii explained that in creating Demon 's Souls the team sought to return to the core of what 's fun about games , and relied on three tenets : challenge , discovery and accomplishment .
" People commonly say Demon 's Souls is hard because of this , but we never made the difficulty needlessly high for the sake of being hard , nor did we intend for it to be a selling point , " he said .

Steep difficulty can be appealing .
Take the case of indie action - adventure title Spelunky , where the sense of discovery and achievement is maximized by stiff odds .
" I think that a tough challenge can make a game much more enjoyable , " said creator Derek Yu .
" Do n't we feel the most fulfilled when we overcome something difficult ?
Without that feeling of getting better , a game turns into a chore - something that you do as a distraction rather than something you do for fulfillment . "
The key to effective difficulty , as opposed to frustration that 's just frustrating , is all in the implementation .
" Doing something hard is n't fun in and of itself , " said Yu . " It 's not fun to sit in an empty room and try to balance a ball on your head for 10 hours straight .
To make challenge effective , you have to provide an interesting game world and create deep mechanics that are entertaining to play with and very satisfying to master . "

Nels Anderson , gameplay programmer at Hothead Games , also feels it 's important to delineate between frustration and meaningful challenge .
" Being frustrated usually means the player cannot determine a way to improve or progress , " he said .
" Part of the reason Demon 's Souls works so well is because you understand why you failed . "
Demon's Souls ' Kajii says that failure needs to be an ever - present possibility if the player is to feel a sense of accomplishment .
" We designed it so that players are likely to die if they are n't paying attention , " he says .
" By maintaining this intensity , players will be constantly nervous while playing , but [ will feel ] a tremendous sense of accomplishment is their reward for doing so . "

Achievements are more valuable , then , when there 's a lot at stake – and failure is less frustrating when it's clear to the player where they messed up .
" Demon 's Souls is a game where you ‘ die a lot , ' but as I 've already said , it is geared so that you will acknowledge that it was your own fault , " said Kajii .
" Players will keep playing because they know they can get past a certain point by taking a different approach , using their imagination , and thinking about how to overcome obstacles . "

In a game like Demon 's Souls , then , a frustrating death is simply the game informing me that my strategy did n't work .
The mechanics are such that I can't blame the game , and my failures never feel unfair .
I can then tackle the exact same obstacle with a different approach , until I figure out a tactic that will help me succeed – and victory 's all the sweeter thanks to all of my struggles on the way .
" Dying in a video game is like losing a tennis match , or getting rejected when you ask a girl out , or looking at a painting and not understanding its meaning .
You 'll always learn something and the next time will be better , " said Yu .
He says that if dying 's fun , that makes it all the better – and Demon 's Souls also features an interesting twist on death .

Enriched by its multiplayer element , the game allows players to see the bloodstains of other fallen heroes , and touch them to view how they died .
Players can leave notes and messages for one another warning of tough spots up ahead , and can also recruit the phantoms of players that have died to help them handle challenges .
Kajii says this system of strangers helping strangers came from a real - life experience of his , a time when his car was stuck on a snowy mountainside .
Numerous stranded drivers all banded together to push each of the cars in turn , but Kajji could n't stay behind to thank his benefactors , lest he end up stranded again .
" I wondered about things like whether the last person made it home , whether I 'd ever meet the people who helped me again ...
Maybe if I 'd met them somewhere else , I would 've made friends with them ...
Many thoughts crossed my mind , " he said .
" This occurrence of helping complete strangers was strangely very memorable , and I kept thinking about it for a very long time .
Advertisement
" Demon 's Souls is a game where you die many times , so I thought this idea of helping others would be a great fit .
It 's as simple as , ‘ We all die so easily , so let 's help each other out , ' " he adds .
" Unlike other RPGs , each player unfolds their own story , and each encounter with a phantom player expands and diversifies their experience . "
Designers are right to be concerned with players finishing fewer titles , and they 're right to offer low barriers to entry for expanded audiences – to a point .
" I think in an attempt to avoid frustrating players , the baby often gets thrown out with the bathwater in terms of difficulty , " said Hothead 's Anderson .
" It 's a pretty common misconception that players want easier games . "
Advertisement
He paraphrases some research from Jesper Juul of MIT 's Gambit Game Lab : " Players are more critical of a game that 's too easy than one that 's too hard .
The player can improve and make a difficult game fun , but short of handicapping oneself , there 's no way to make a game that 's too easy harder , " Anderson continued .
" However , as soon as players feel they do n't have any way to improve , their assessment of difficulty turns much more negative . "
Frequent death and frustration do n't need to be viewed as engagement - breakers in games – as long as the deaths are meaningful and educational , and as long as the player 's frustrated with themselves , not the game .
The most important factor is clearly that players must be able to see what they can do differently to surmount a challenge .

The tactic that finally gets me over a bridge swarmed with archers , or through a narrow hallway packed with vicious wolves , might not be the same one that works for another player , but it 's one I 've developed on my own , through trial and error , experimenting with the environment and with my own abilities .
" This act of trial and error in a tense atmosphere is the heart of challenge and discovery , leading to the strong satisfaction of accomplishment , " says Kajii .
" I 'd say Demon 's Souls is not a ‘ fun game , ' but a ‘ game to have fun with , ' " says Kajii .
" The goal is not to find a pre-defined answer — instead the answer is something created by the player on their own through their own play - styles . "

Concept devices go where most product designers fear to tread .
They are dream gadgets that hint at possibilities beyond what current technology can support – or what current fashion can accept .
And that 's just why we like them .
They may be fantasies , but concept designs point at a future that today 's designers aspire towards .
Some interesting new concept phones made an appearance this week at CEATEC , the Japanese equivalent of the Consumer Electronics Show .
These included a chameleon - like phone that could change its skin depending on its surroundings , a phone whose casing is made of wood and a phone with a flexible screen that can assume different configurations ( shown above ) .
A major source of the concept phones this year has been Fujitsu , which ran a mobile - phone–design contest .
But other companies such as NTT DoCoMo and KDDI also offered their futuristic phone ideas .
Of course , these phones are n't real .
Some of them are n't even in the prototype stage .
Yet they are interesting because they provide a glimpse of what lies ahead – even if it 's still only on paper .
Chamelephone
Designer Hiroyuki Tabuchi created this concept with the idea that the mobile phone 's body can mimic and take on the texture of the surface that it is placed on .
It 's a neat idea , but there 's no word on how that might be possible .
Current material science does n't support this , so it would have to be done with some kind of display technology , like e-ink or OLED .
As pretty as the concepts look , we wo n't count on seeing these phones for a few years – at least .
F - Circle
This phone , from designer Yuji Ito , is probably the most pragmatic of the CEATAC designs that we have seen .
It 's also the reason why it caught Fujitsu 's attention .
The phone combines a rectangular keypad with a round screen .
In some ways , it is reminiscent of the Aura , a $ 2000 luxury phone that Motorola offered last year .
Fold -a- phone
Inspired by Origami , designers Hanna Sahlen and Sachiko Munakata created the concept of a phone that can be folded and unfolded for use .
Interesting as the idea is , this is one concept we do n't expect to see anytime in the near future : Manufacturers can just barely make a flexible e-ink display , let alone an entire phone that folds up like paper .
Touch Wood
Apart from Fujitsu , NTT DoCoMo also showed off a cool concept device :
This one , built out of wood from trees culled during forest thinning .
The wood is treated with a coating that makes it resistant to insects and mildew .
The device , called Touch Wood , has a body made of cypress wood .
NTT DoCoMo used a three - dimensional compression - molding technique developed by Olympus to create the body of the phone .
Every handset made using this technique has its own distinctive grain pattern and natural coloring .
Eco-veneers have already been a big hit among PC makers .
For instance , bamboo has been especially popular because of its natural look and the ease with which it can be molded .
If Dell and Asus can offer bamboo - coated notebooks , there 's no reason why NTT DoCoMo can't take the idea a step forward with a wooden phone .
Joystick phone
KDDI also had a concept phone at CEATAC – with a small twist .
It showed a camera - based controller or a " joystick " for phones – effectively a small plastic tube that would attach itself to the back of a phone with help from a magnet .
The joystick is so positioned that the phone 's camera can look into it .
The phone also has custom software to make this setup work .
At the end of the joystick are two squares , red and blue , that the camera focuses on .
The software tracks the movement of these squares and interprets it as motion to get a camera - based controller .
Yes , this sounds like a hack – and according to reports , it does n't work very well yet either .

Have You “ Pulled Your Goalie ” in IT ?
I lived in Boston during the height of the Bobby Orr days , and I got caught up in the enthusiasm that Boston felt for their Bruins .
I had never seen ice hockey before I moved to Boston , and I learned the game by watching the Bruins win the Stanley Cup .
One of the intriguing tactics used in ice hockey ( just called hockey in Boston — the ice is implied ) is the practice of “ pulling your goalie . ”
The game is played with six players per side on the ice at any point in time ( minus any in the penalty box ) .
Normally one of those six players is a goalie who stays in front of the goal net and stops any shots on goal from the opposing team .
But in certain situations when a team is losing a game and desperate for a score , the team may “ pull its goalie ” and replace the goalie with an attacker to improve the team ’s chances of getting a score on the opponent ’s goal .
Pulling your goalie is trading a defensive player for an offensive player .
It intensifies your attack but it can critically weaken your defense .
Any random shot by the opposing team in the direction of your goal can score a goal for your opponent because of your open net .
It ’s a risk that you might take when you are sure that you ’re going to lose the game without desperate measures .
It ’s a last ditch effort to win something that otherwise might be lost .
Why talk about hockey ?
In our current economic situation , we have a lot of companies who are cutting back on expenses in extraordinary ways .
Millions of people have lost their jobs , and thousands of companies have closed their doors .
But not all businesses are equally desperate .
Most companies have suffered losses in revenue , but many businesses have solid foundations that can withstand temporary losses and then recover when times get better .
The economic turndown has affected IT organizations along with the rest of the business , and we ’ve had our share of layoffs , project cancellations and budget cuts .
IT has been under extreme pressure to cut costs wherever we can , and some very difficult decisions have been made .
Some of those decisions are equivalent to the tactic of pulling the goalie .
Many of us have cut the budget in areas that fundamentally weaken the IT and business infrastructure — cuts that expose our business to tremendous risk .
We have “ pulled the goalie ” in IT , maybe without even thinking of the consequences , and in most cases without making business executives aware of the risk we ’re taking .
Let ’s take a few examples .
In your IT organization , have you :
Stopped updating virus prevention software ?
Fallen behind on implementing operating system and network software updates ?
Cancelled offsite backup services or disaster recovery site contracts ?
Discontinued contracts with “ white hat ” Internet security audit firms who look for Internet security vulnerabilities ?
Postponed outside audits of business processes and systems ?
Delayed replacement or upgrade of servers which offer inadequate response times to your customers ?
Let your infrastructure deteriorate to the point where customers are complaining ?
Laid - off the only people who really understand how to maintain and support some of your current custom systems ?
If you answered yes to any of these questions , then you ’ve pulled your goalie .
You ’ve taken resource away from a crucial defensive area , presumably with the intent of using the money for a more critical need .
You ’ve acted out of desperation in a way that could cripple your business .
And in most cases your CEO does n’t even know .
That ’s because most CEOs do n’t understand the implications of some of the technical decisions we make in IT , and business executives will never understand those implications unless you tell them .
Conclusion
In hockey , pulling the goalie is a last ditch effort — a team only does it when they know that they ’re going to lose the game unless they take this drastic action .
But in hockey there ’s always another game and another season .
The score resets with each new game , and so battles are fought on a game - by - game basis .
In business , it ’s one continuous battle .
We do n’t restart each year with a fresh score and new equipment .
In business , a pull - the - goalie decision is a bet - the - company decision .
A loss can cost you the entire business .
And pulling the goalie in IT is a hidden decision — the CEO and stockholders wo n’t know that you ’re betting the company unless you tell them .
Pulling the goalie is an exciting part of hockey , and it ’s great fun for the spectators .
But pulling the goalie in business is a desperate move , and you should n’t do it unless you ’re truly desperate , and unless your CEO agrees .
Oct. 13 , 2009  -- Sen. Olympia Snowe , the sole Republican to vote in favor of a health care reform bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee today told ABC News she chose to break with party lines because , " I do happen to believe that we have to move the process forward , on this very difficult and challenging issue . "
The committee passed the measure , introduced by Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , by a 14 - 9 vote .
In an exclusive interview on ABC's " World News with Charles Gibson , " Snowe said she still has concerns about the measure , and reserved the right to change her vote as the legislation moves forward , especially if the cost of the bill goes up .
" We still have to work on that issue making sure Americans have affordable health plans .
They do under this legislation , but we need to do more and to be certain of that . "
Snowe , a moderate Republican from Maine , also warned that adding a publicly financed insurance option , demanded by many Democrats but not included in the Baucus bill , would be a deal breaker for her .
" That is not an area I have agreed to .
I do n't want government at the outset of the process .
It really could shut off the private sector , " Snowe told Gibson .
" I think the private sector can do a lot because of the market reforms that we included in this legislation that will compel them to live up to a standard . "
President Obama praised the Finance Committee after the vote and said he wanted to " particularly thank " Snowe , citing her " for both the political courage and the seriousness of purpose she 's demonstrated throughout this process . "
Snowe 's vote allowed Obama to claim the bill has bipartisan support .
" After the consideration of hundreds of amendments , it includes ideas from both Democrats and Republicans , " Obama said .
The bill would provide insurance for millions of Americans who have been unable to obtain or afford coverage .
" Today we reached a critical milestone in our efforts to reform our health care system , " the president said speaking from the White House Rose Garden .
Today 's vote in the Finance Committee kicks off what 's expected to be a long and arduous path through Congress for final legislation .
Snowe 's vote was crucial to any Democrats who still hope to pass reform with broad bipartisan support .
" When history calls , history calls , " Snowe said at the committee hearing " My vote today is my vote today .
It does n't forecast what my vote will be tomorrow . "
While hailing today 's vote , the President urged members of Congress to remain sober .
" We are closer now than ever before to passing health reform , but we 're not there yet , " he added .
" Now 's not the time to pat ourselves in the back , now's not the time to offer ourselves congratulations , now 's the time to dig in and work even harder to get this done . "
" In this final phase , I hope that we can continue to engage each other with the spirit of civility and seriousness that has brought us this far , and that the subject deserves . "
Bipartisan Support on Health Care Bill ?
Republicans panned the bill , and the Democrats , for not including their input .
" We are for health care reform , but it ought to be done in a restrained , good way , " said Sen.
Orrin Hatch , R - Utah .
Sen . Mike Enzi , R - Wyo. , the ranking Republican on the Senate health committee , said Democrats are in the process of " buying enough votes " to reach the 60 - vote threshold on the Senate floor .
This may have been a predictable victory for Democrats , but final health care legislation still has a long way to go .
Baucus , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pension Committee Chairman Sen . Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , will now start writing the real bill with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
In closed - door negotiations , the Democratic leaders will try to meld Baucus ' centrist bill with a more liberal one that passed the HELP committee in July .
That bill included a public health insurance option .
In the House , Democratic leaders have hinted they want to wait to see what the Senate does before putting their own final bill on the table .
Members of the House are working to merge the four different bills that have been put forth into one legislation .
Even after today 's vote , the same obstacles remain .
Democrats have to iron out the differences between themselves , namely on how to pay for health care overhaul and whether to include some form of a public option .
There 's still no consensus among Democrats on either issue .
Some , like Baucus , say a bill with a public option will not pass on the Senate floor .
House Democratic leaders insist that the final bill must include this provision .
As for the rest of the Republicans , they will continue to hammer at the bill for cuts to future Medicare spending that , Democrats say , will pay for reform .
President Obama praised Snowe and the Senate Finance Committee for their work on health care .
" In particular , Senator Snowe has been extraordinarily diligent in working together so that we can reduce costs of health care , make sure that people who do n't have it are covered , to make sure that people who do have insurance have more security and stability and therefore over the long term we 're saving families , businesses and our government money , " the president told reporters earlier in the day .
Snowe has been involved in bipartisan negotiations with fellow lawmakers and White House officials since the inception of health care discussions .
Her yes vote will make her the only Republican to support any of the Democratic health reform bills before Congress .
The ranking Republican on the committee , Iowa Sen .
Chuck Grassley , praised Baucus for his work on health care legislation but panned the bill for imposing new taxes and fees , and Democrats for " rebuffing " and " defeating " Republican efforts to be included in discussions .
" I hope we do n't have the possibility of further leftward movement , " Grassley said .
" This bill is moving on a slippery slope to more and more government control of health care . "
Taxes and Public Option Remain Big Issue
The bill was expected to pass even though some Democrats had expressed reservations about it .
One of them was Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D - W.Va. , whose attempts to introduce a public option in the bill were struck down , even by some in his own party , including Baucus .
But today , Rockefeller said he voted for the bill because " the time has come , " adding that he still thinks a public option is necessary .
" The bill before us still falls short of what people need and what people expect from us , " Rockefeller said .
" It is not enough .
Universal coverage has always been the goal of health reform .
... Leaving 16 million uninsured is wrong . "
Sen . Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , had also said he was concerned that the bill does n't provide affordable coverage and choice to all Americans .
" We clearly have more to do , " Wyden said , but he voted yes to the bill .
Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , said he will try to change the bill on the Senate floor .
" Again , we must have a public option , " he said , later adding , " This is not a perfect bill .
It needs further changes . "
The bipartisan CBO estimated the Senate Finance Committee bill would cost $ 829 billion over 10 years and reduce the deficit by $ 81 billion in the same time period .
If the bill were to become law , CBO estimates that 94 percent of Americans and legal residents would have health insurance .
Today , Elmendorf said the CBO did not have the time to assess the bill 's impact on people who are privately insured and that the total impact on national health care costs is still blurry .
The biggest issue on which the bill is different than other Democratic plans is in the lack of a public option .
Baucus ' bill instead calls for the creation of nonprofit health care insurance cooperatives as an alternative .
However , the CBO analysis suggested that co-ops are n't much of an alternative to what is currently being offered .
" The proposed co-ops had very little effect on the estimates , " the CBO report said , because " they seem unlikely to establish a significant market presence in many areas of the country or to noticeably affect federal subsidy payments . "
Another thorny point is the proposed taxes on high - value " Cadillac " plans .
Baucus ' bill would reap in $ 201 billion from this new excise tax , according to the CBO , but many Democrats oppose the plan , saying it unfairly hits unions that have negotiated generous health care plans in exchange for lower wages .
One point of agreement in all plans is that Americans would be required to carry health insurance .
The plans , however , defer in the types and amounts of subsidies that would be provided to low - income citizens to get coverage .

It looks like something played by the alien musicians in the bar in Star Wars .
It can be made to sound like it too .
The flagship Eigenharp Alpha comes with a price tag not far short of £ 4,000
This is the Eigenharp - described by its developers as " the most expressive electronic musical instrument ever made " .
One of my colleagues calls it more simply " a sci- fi bassoon " .
The Eigenharp is the brainchild of John Lambert , a musician and software entrepreneur , whose Devon - based team has been working on the project for eight years .
Gig stress
The idea dates back to the early 90s when Lambert played in ambient trance band Shen , who would travel to concerts in a truck packed with musical gear .
" The gigs were really good fun , " says Lambert , " but the setting up was just a nightmare .
Lots of stuff , equipment , wires , endless stress .
" At the same time I would go to the folk club , take my acoustic guitar out of the box , tune it up , get a pint of beer , and play . "
Lambert says the new instrument bridges that gap - bringing a vast range of sounds and drum loops to the fingertips of live performers .
But what 's it like to play ?
We 've got pretty fed up with watching people twiddle knobs on stage
John Lambert , Eigenharp inventor
It initially comes across as a baffling array of buttons with winking red lights .
But it does n't take long to get a broad spectrum of sounds out of the 132 keys , two strip controllers and the breath pipe .
Octaves and scales can be changed at the tap of a button .
The Alpha model - aimed at professional musicians - costs £ 3,950 .
There 's a smaller Pico version for £ 349 .
Theremins and phones
Of course , dozens of electronic instruments have come and gone over the years .
Could this be the end of keyboards on stage ?
Some - like the theremin or Mellotron - have been around for decades and are still in use today .
Many others are gathering dust at the back of recording studios .
In an age when complex music - making applications are being made for mobile phones , is n't there a danger that technology might overtake the Eigenharp ?
" No , " says Lambert .
" More likely our decision to make the software for the instrument run on a separate computer will pay off - we are already looking at porting the software perhaps into the PlayStation or Wii . "
Lambert points out that many artists no longer make a living from record sales alone .
Live tours have become a major source of revenue .
He is upbeat about the response from a wide range of performers , including those working in classical music , rock and electronica .
" The most unexpected thing for me has been the interest from drummers , " he says .
Goth rock Distant cousin : bassoon action from 1942
He says there is one high - profile musician who is about to take delivery of an Eigenharp , but wo n't give any names .
" Proper musicians want to take this away and learn it before they come out . "
Lambert does expect some criticism from musicians , but does not think the price tag will put people off .
" They 're going to say it 's too expensive .
This is a difficult instrument to make cheaply , " he says .
" I would be really shocked not to see these out in live situations within six to 12 months .
" It 's not just the sonic thing - they are visually compelling , and there 's a reason for that - we 've got pretty fed up with watching people twiddle knobs on stage .
" It was interesting once when we watched Kraftwerk and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark do it back in the 70s and 80s , but it 's not fun in 2009 . "
And the big question : is the Eigenharp cool enough for a Slash - style guitar solo ?
" We were demonstrating it to someone who is in a goth band , " says Lambert , " and they were really up for it - so yes .
We 're making one in jet black .
I think people are really going to rock out with these on stage . "

Robert Ouko was the Kenyan foreign minister with a fatal tendency to speak his mind .
In February 1990 he was bundled into a car that allegedly contained the country 's permanent secretary for internal security .
His body was found shortly afterwards .
His leg had been broken in two places , there was a bullet hole in his head and his corpse had been burnt .
The Kenyan police conducted a thorough investigation and came to the obvious conclusion that Dr Ouko had committed suicide .
This was the beginning of the cover - up that persists to this day , involving police and officials at every level of government .
I was reminded of Dr Ouko after reading the judgment on the case brought to the high court in London by Khuder al - Sweady and other Iraqis .
They were seeking a public inquiry into the events of May 2004 , when , they claim , they or their relatives were taken to a British army camp and tortured or killed .
The judges published their findings on Friday and ordered a proper inquiry .
It is the most damning judgment on official collusion and concealment written since Labour came to power .
Total coverage in British newspapers so far amounts to one short article in the Guardian .
The claimants say that after a battle at a checkpoint in southern Iraq , some of the survivors , including farmers cowering in nearby fields , were taken by the Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment to Camp Abu Naji .
Witnesses say that up to 20 prisoners were jumped on while their hands were bound , hit with rocks , had their eyes gouged out and their genitals crushed and mutilated and were then hanged or shot .
They claim that the corpses were then handed to their families as battlefield casualties .
The royal military police were supposed to have investigated these claims , but as a recent report on their methods by Greater Manchester police shows , they messed it up with panache , appointing unqualified detectives , losing evidence and failing to interview witnesses .
The military police concluded that no one had done anything wrong , that 20 Iraqi corpses and nine live captives were brought to the camp and all were released without further injury .
The Ministry of Defence has stuck to that line like a holy creed .
Reading the high court judgment , you have to pinch yourself and remember that this is n't Kenya under Daniel arap Moi , but good old Blighty , where the police are impartial , the civil service disinterested and a minister 's word is his bond .
In a civilised country , at least half a dozen senior officials would now be charged with perjury , the secretary of state for defence would be facing impeachment hearings and a number of soldiers would be on trial for torture and murder .
But in the United Kingdom , where we see only what we choose , the judgment sinks without a ripple .
We carry on believing what we have always been told : that unlike other countries , we do things properly here .
The judges found that civil servants working for the Treasury solicitor had repeatedly lied to the court , claiming that there were no further documents to disclose that might have cast light on the case .
They found that the defence secretary , Bob Ainsworth , " consistently and repeatedly failed to comply " with the obligation to disclose the documents the claimants were seeking .
He also slapped a public interest immunity certificate on some of the evidence , preventing it being revealed to the court .
It turns out that he signed this certificate " on a partly false basis " , seeking to suppress facts that were already in the public domain .
This abuse , the judges say , has caused the PII process " potentially very serious damage " .
Ainsworth 's lack of candour about the evidence meant that he had wasted " the whole of the cost of these proceedings " .
But the judges were harshest about the Royal Military Police .
They found that " the RMP investigation in 2004 - 5 was not thorough and proficient " .
It was blocked for five weeks , its procedures were risible , and none of the nine surviving captives was interviewed .
Worse was the quality of the evidence presented to the court by Colonel Dudley Giles , who is the deputy head of the military police and was the secretary of state 's principal witness .
Giles , they found , " was overall a most unsatisfactory witness " .
The excuse he gave for not disclosing key evidence was " wholly without foundation " ; " we are all firmly of the view that he lacked the necessary objectivity , proficiency and reliability " .
They suggested that if ever he was presented as a witness for similar purposes again , the court " should approach his evidence with the greatest caution . "
Most important was what the judges found in some of the documents they eventually prised from the grubby hands of the state .
They were , the court found , " consistent with the contention that more than nine live detainees " had been taken to the camp .
As only nine came out alive , these papers support the claimants ' contention that prisoners were killed there .
No wonder the government pretended that the documents did n't exist .
At the Labour party conference last month , the home secretary rightly observed that " social justice means nothing without criminal justice …
We need to support victims and subject perpetrators to the full range of enforcement powers " .
But this admirable principle does not extend to military justice , where the army , the military police and the government collude to prevent torturers and murderers being tried .
Friday 's judgment relates to one of several cases of alleged British war crimes in Iraq .
Just one – that of the hotel receptionist Baha Mousa , who was beaten to death by British soldiers – has so far resulted in a conviction .
Thanks to an apparently botched investigation and an army cover - up , only one soldier has been convicted of any crime in relation to his killing , and that was merely inhumane treatment , for which he was jailed for one year .
Even when soldiers appear to murder people on their own side , the cases are passed to the specialist investigations division of the Keystone Kops .
Of the four young recruits who died in suspicious circumstances at the Deepcut training barracks , one had been shot with a bullet to each side of his head and another had five bullet wounds in his chest : the ballistics expert sent to the barracks maintains that four of them were fired from a distance and one at close range .
After the army destroyed crucial evidence , Surrey police decided that all four had taken their own lives .
The ghost of Dr Ouko hovers into view again .
One of the tests of a functioning democracy is the extent to which its public servants are subject to the same laws as everyone else .
By this measure , the United Kingdom is a failed state .
When the army is in the dock , Justice swaps her crown for a bandanna , her sword for a Kalashnikov and her blindfold for a pair of dark glasses .
The state has tried to cover up the crimes of the armed forces since the Peterloo massacre and long before .
But surely , in 2009 , it can do better than this ?

You 've gotta wonder how much longer the Fox News brass will be able to tolerate Shepard Smith .
He keeps stepping on and debunking his fellow Fox anchors ' favorite talking points .
Yesterday , in demolishing Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barasso , he took a wrecking ball to the No. 1
Fox talking point of recent months -- that the public option in health - care reform equals a " government takeover . "
Here 's what Smith said :
SMITH : It ’s not a government takeover , Senator !
That ’s not fair and we both know it .
It ’s not a government takeover because what it would be is a government option if you have insurance now and you like it you can keep it .
…
That ’s not a government takeover if we ’re being fair is it Senator ?
Then he launched into an ardent defense of the public option
SMITH : Over the last 10 years health care costs in American have skyrocketed .
Regular folks cannot afford it , so they tax the system by not getting preventive medicine .
And we all end up paying for it .
As the costs have gone up , the insurance industry 's profits , on average , have gone up 350 percent .
And it 's the insurance companies which have paid and which have contributed to senators and congressmen on both sides of the aisle to the point where now we can't get what all concerned on Capitol Hill all seem to [ believe ] and more than 60 percent of Americans say they support , a public option .
Every vote against the public option is a vote for the insurance companies .
And for good measure , he points out what a travesty it would be for Congress to pass a reform measure with mandates but without a public option :
SMITH : What more than 60 percent of Americans say they support is a public option .
This has been an enormous win for the health care industry .
That is an unquestioned fact , but I wonder , what happens to the American people when we come out with legislation now which requires everyone to have health care insurance -- or many more people -- but does not give a public option ?
Therefore millions more people will have to buy insurance from the very corporations that are overcharging us , and whose profits have gone up 350 percent in the last ten years .
It seems like we the people are the ones getting the shaft here .
One can only imagine Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck watching this from the fetal position .
“ Once a liar , always a liar ” is a proverbial parental admonishment .
A new study claims there is truth to the adage : People who cheated on exams in high school are considerably more likely to be dishonest later in life , according to a report to be released today by the Josephson Institute of Ethics .
The study , which surveyed nearly 7,000 people in various age groups nationwide , offers a sobering assessment of today ’s youth as cynics who are aware that their behavior crosses boundaries but believe it is necessary to succeed .
And the findings suggest that habits formed in childhood persist :
Those who cheated in high school are more likely as adults to lie to a customer , inflate an insurance or expense claim , cheat on taxes and lie to their spouses .

“ When you see that teens are five times more likely than adults to think it ’s OK to cheat to get ahead , we have a problem , ” said Rich Jarc , executive director of the Los Angeles - based institute .
“ Just think if five times the number of people in business , politics and banking hold those beliefs .
That ’s alarming . ”
The institute issues biennial reports on the ethics of American high school students that have charted a steady increase in those admitting to cheating , lying and stealing .
The new study is the first to connect teen behavior to dishonest activities in adulthood .
Among the findings :
Teens 17 and younger are five times more likely than those older than 50 to believe that lying and cheating are necessary to succeed ( 51 % vs. 10 % ) , those in the 17 and younger group are nearly four times as likely to deceive their boss ( 31 % vs. 8 % ) and three times more likely to keep change mistakenly given to them ( 49 % vs. 15 % ) .
More young adults ages 18 to 24 reported lying to a spouse or partner than did the 41 - to 50 - year - old members of their parents ’ generation ( 48 % vs. 22 % ) , more made an unauthorized copy of music or a video ( 69 % vs. 27 % ) and they were more likely to have misrepresented or omitted a fact in a job interview ( 14 % vs. 4 % ) .

The older generation outdid its younger counterparts in one area : 69 % of adults 41 to 50 and 58 % of those older than 50 reported using the Internet for personal reasons at work , compared with 53 % of those 18 to 24 .
The report did not speculate about what is driving teen attitudes , but Jarc noted that many of the business people , politicians and athletes that have dominated media coverage in recent years gained notoriety for misdeeds .
Robert A. deMayo , a professor of psychology at Pepperdine University , suggested that new technology has created a generational shift in the ethics of many activities , such as illegal music downloads and plagiarism .
“ The young do that in a widespread fashion and say yes , they know it ’s wrong ; yes , it ’s stealing , but everybody is doing it .
It becomes normalized , it becomes almost irrelevant that it ’s against the letter of the law . ”

In defense of teens , he noted that many expressed positive views about ethnic and gender rights and rights to education that were not necessarily held by previous generations .
“ We want to denounce young people as immoral , but certain basic values that represent American ideals of freedom and equality seem to be on the rise with young adults , ” he said .
Today ’s students are also under more social and parental pressure to excel than perhaps any earlier generation , said educators .
The same federal mandates and state requirements for testing that tax school systems may affect student behavior , said Jeff Sherrill , associate director of the National Assn. of Secondary School Principals .
“ I can not say for sure if the pressure to test creates pressures to cheat , ” Sherrill said , “ but we know one reaction is a natural instinct to try to figure out how to finish ahead . ”

He said the Josephson report is an opportunity to spark dialogue on campuses .
Officials in the Downey Unified School District , which adopted a curriculum created by the Josephson Institute , report progress on that front .
In four years of promoting such characteristics as fairness , respect and responsibility , suspensions and expulsions have dropped and attendance is up , said Supt .
Wendy L. Doty , adding that schools must assist parents in teaching positive character traits .

Seemed to me like it was a version of stop motion footage , but not classic stop motion camera .
It seems like it was shot in a continuous shot and then heavily edited to cut out the unnecessary bits .
Another way to look at is that the footage was shot at a normal speed and in post production frames were dropped and set to fast forward .

Small cities in California are facing high unemployment , drained treasuries and now what some residents see as an assault on the only sacred moment in municipal affairs : the invocation at the start of city council meetings .
Turlock , Tracy , Tehachapi , Lancaster -- all have been threatened in the last few months with lawsuits claiming that prayer at meetings breaches the wall between church and state .
Nowhere has the ensuing debate played out more dramatically than in Lodi , where , after a tumultuous five - hour meeting this week , the City Council voted not only to continue invocations but also to allow phrases such as “ in Jesus ’ name . ”
“ For whatever reason , Lodi seems to have become ground zero for deciding this issue , ” City Atty .
Steve Schwabauer said at Wednesday ’s meeting , which drew a passionate crowd of more than 700 .

At times , rhetoric boiled over as speakers trooped to the microphone in a local auditorium -- the only room in town that could hold the anticipated crowd .
A woman who identified herself as an atheist blasted Christianity , blaming it for the decimation of native Americans , the Salem witch burnings and “ the oppression of all non-Christians . ”
Several speakers countered with stories of their personal salvation and dire warnings about the consequence of snuffing out prayer at city hall .
Frank Nolton , a local pastor , lamented the loss of school prayer , which was found unconstitutional in 1962 .
“ Our schools have become veritable war zones and playgrounds for immorality , ” he said .
“ If we disregard prayer , will our city follow the same fate ? ”
The crowd applauded heartily .
When another speaker recalled the Lodi that once was as “ a town that honored God so well everything was locked down from Friday night till Monday morning , ” an “ Amen ! ” rang out .
A city of about 61,000 , Lodi is the commercial center of a huge vineyard industry south of Sacramento .
It has a substantial number of Sikhs and Muslims , but only one or two non-Christians have delivered invocations at its City Council meetings in the last decade , according to city officials .

Public prayer has been a battlefield for years .
In Central California , the fight has been revived in a flurry of letters from a Wisconsin - based group called the Freedom From Religion Foundation .
“ It was just our summer for Jesus prayers , ” said Annie Laurie Gaylor , one of the organization ’s founders .
“ The more action you do on it , the more you hear from people across the country who are concerned . ”
She said the group is planning to sue over the issue in California , though it ’s still unclear which city will provide the strongest case .
Gaylor said she was alerted to Lodi ’s prayer practice by a group member who lives in the area and felt “ horrified and excluded ” by the invocations ’ frequent references to Jesus .
The city required three years ago that prayers be “ nondenominational and nonsectarian , ” but the policy has not been enforced .

In Lancaster , objections to similar prayers at council meetings came from the ACLU of Southern California .
In response , the city in August adopted a policy much like the one approved this week in Lodi : Make an effort at finding non-Christians to give invocations , tell people not to proselytize and do n’t censor what they have to say .
“ It was the typical ‘ gotcha ’ thing from the ACLU , ” said Ron Smith , Lancaster ’s vice mayor .
“ We basically told them to pound sand . ”
In Lodi , the issue exploded after it was taken up by a former Navy chaplain named Gordon James Klingenschmitt , founder of an effort called Pray in Jesus ’ Name .
A resident of Colorado Springs , Colo. , he organized a Lodi prayer rally that drew more than 300 people chanting the name of Jesus as a couple dozen opponents wielded signs .
Last week , he vowed to buy a year ’s worth of billboard space around Lodi naming any council members who voted against invocations .
On his website , he claimed that threat changed the mind of Mayor Larry Hansen , who had earlier leaned toward a moment of silence rather than a spoken prayer .
In an interview Friday , the mayor , a retired police officer , rejected Klingenschmitt ’s claim .
But he said the ex-chaplain was at least partly responsible for Lodi ’s unwanted national exposure .

“ There ’s been nothing close to it .
It was unprecedented , ” Hansen said , adding that he received 1,500 e-mails , mostly supporting prayer , from across the U.S .
For the Lodi council , the moment - of - silence idea represented a needless retreat from principle .
And prayers scrubbed of overt religious references are , as one speaker put it , “ a banquet without food . ”
Members crafted their new policy with help from attorneys for the Alliance Defense Fund , an Arizona - based network of Christian lawyers .
“ There ’s no reason to censor or silence a cherished tradition , ” said Mike Johnson , the group ’s senior legal counsel .
“ Over the last five or six years , atheist groups have swiped at it with radical demand letters to relatively defenseless , small , hometown governments . ”

Only one U.S. Supreme Court ruling has directly addressed prayer at public meetings .
In that 1983 case , Marsh vs. Chambers , the court held that the Nebraska legislature ’s paid chaplain and opening prayers followed a long , historic tradition and were constitutional .
However , the court noted that the chaplain had quit mentioning Jesus after a complaint from a Jewish lawmaker .
That case is cited on both sides of the current debate .
In California , a state appeals court ruled that prayers in Burbank that alluded to Christ were impermissible because they advanced a particular religion .
But the case does not have the weight of more favorable federal rulings , said Smith , Lancaster ’s vice mayor .

In Lodi , prayer opponents fear that the city ’s new policy will end up changing little .
Despite the city ’s assertion that it will ask even atheists for invocations , most prayers likely will name Jesus -- making non-Christians uncomfortable and putting the city at risk of a lawsuit , said David Diskin , an opposition leader .
Diskin , a software trainer who received the Chamber of Commerce ’s Volunteer of the Year award in 2004 , said he anticipated a load of hate messages when he got involved .
“ It was quite the opposite , ” he said .
“ A very pleasant Christian woman came up to me at the rally and gave me a DVD about an atheist reporter in Chicago who was born again .
She said I was the first atheist she ’d ever met . ”

Times staff writer Ann Simmons contributed to this report .
A team of Spanish and Portuguese researchers has carried out molecular genetic analysis of the Y chromosome ( transmitted only by males ) of the aboriginal population of the Canary Islands to determine their origin and the extent to which they have survived in the current population .
The results suggest a North African origin for these paternal lineages which , unlike maternal lineages , have declined to the point of being practically replaced today by European lineages .
Researchers from the University of La Laguna ( ULL ) , the Institute of Pathology and Molecular Immunology from the University of Porto ( Portugal ) and the Institute of Legal Medicine from the University of Santiago de Compostela ( USC ) have studied the Y chromosome from human dental remains from the Canary Islands , and have determined the origin and evolution of paternal lineages from the pre-Hispanic era to the present day .
To date , only mitochondrial DNA has been studied , which merely reflects the evolution of maternal lineages .
Rosa Fregal , the principal author of the recently - published study in BMC Evolutionary Biology , and a researcher from the Genetics Department of the ULL , explains to SINC that " whereas aboriginal maternal lineages have survived with a slight downward trend , aboriginal paternal lineages have declined progressively , being replaced by European lineages " .
Experts have also analysed an historic sample for La Concepción church ( Tenerife ) , which dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries .
With these data , they have established the impact of European colonisation and the African slave trade , and have determined the evolution of paternal lineages in aborigines from the Canary Islands or Guanches , from the pre-Hispanic era to the present day .
Although contribution is now mainly European , scientists state that North African and Sub -Saharan contribution was higher in the 17th and 18th centuries .
The explanation as to why there is a difference between the lineages of men and women from the Canary Islands stems from the diverse contributions of parental populations , and , above all , as a result of European colonisation .
During this period , most relationships between men and women were between Iberian men and Guanches women , " due to the better social position of the former [ Iberian men ] compared to aboriginal males " Fregel explains .
In addition to this , there was a higher mortality rate among male aborigines , who were displaced and discriminated against by conquerors .
" Not only during the Crown of Castile Conquest in the 15th century , but also thereafter " , the scientist affirms .
The researcher adds that in the case of Sub - Saharan lineages , both sexes were discriminated against equally , " and both maternal and paternal lineages have declined to date " .
Traces of European colonisation
A previous study of the Y chromosome in the current population of the Canary Islands demonstrated the impact of European colonisation on the male population in the Canary Islands , Fregal points out that " When estimating the proportion of European lineages present in the current population of the Canary Islands , it was found that they represented more than 90 % " .
Nevertheless , mitochondrial DNA studies in the current population demonstrated a notable survival of aboriginal lineages , where European contribution is between 36 % and 62 % .
Iberian and European contribution to male genetic patrimony in the Canary Islands increased from 63 % during the 17th and 18th centuries to 83 % in the present day .
At the same time , male aboriginal genes decreased from 31 % to 17 % , and Sub - Saharan genes , from 6 % to 1 % .
As for women , European contribution is more constant , having moved from 48 % to 55 % , and aboriginal contribution , from 40 % to 42 % .
The only decline observed in genetic contribution , from 12 % to 3 % in the last three centuries , has been in the case of Sub - Saharans .
Despite these advances , there are still mysteries to solve , such as how to determine whether the first inhabitants of the Canary Islands arrived by their own means or whether they were brought by force , " as there are no signs to ascertain whether they were aware of the navigation or if they came in one or several waves " , Fregal concludes .

MADRID —
Two advertising campaigns on Madrid buses are urging people to enjoy life — but for reasons that could n't be more different .
One reads , " God does exist .
Enjoy your life in Christ , " while the other tells readers , " God probably does n't exist .
Stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
The ads began in December , and promoters of both are happy to have sparked a debate in Spain , where faith is challenged at every turn .
The idea for the eveangelical ads started when Francisco Rubiales , a 39 - year - old pastor and lawyer , learned that London buses carried an atheist advertising campaign .
He resolved to respond in Madrid with an opposing message .
Rubiales ' modest congregation of some 50 souls , Centro Cristiano de Reunion , designated 2,000 euros of the Sunday offering to buy the ads on two buses .
" Little did we know that this anecdote would become a world campaign , " chuckled Rubiales , still astonished by the media 's coverage of the initiative .
Since the ads ' launch , he said , traffic to his church 's website is up 50 percent .
Meanwhile , an association of atheists and freethinkers ( called AMAL ) also bought advertising space on buses in Madrid , Barcelona and Malaga .
" The Church is used to occupying the whole space , " said Luis Vega , a 63 - year - old aircraft engineer and the president of AMAL .
" We wanted to make ourselves visible as atheists , as non-believers in God but believers in the human being , " Vega added .
Like the opposing side , Vega has seen a huge increase in interest since the advertising campaign began : AMAL has been so overwhelmed with support and small donations , totaling 30,000 euros ( about $ 39,000 ) , that there are plans to expand the message to other towns .
The campaigns reflect the larger issue of Spain 's complex relationship with religion , especially the dominant Catholicism .
Former dictator Francisco Franco 's national - Catholicism doctrine was embraced by many Spaniards .
Although some priests dissented , the Catholic Church generally supported Franco .
When Vega was young , non-baptized children could not attend school , and churches were full on Sundays .
But democracy brought change at a vertiginous speed .
Although more than three out of four Spaniards identify themselves as Catholic today — according to a 2008 survey by the Center for Sociological Research ( CIS ) — social and behavioral trends indicate that Catholicism in Spain is about tradition , not conviction , and is a sign of identity rather than faith .
Patron saint figures are paraded in the streets , surrounded by often inebriated fiesta - goers , and soccer players habitually cross themselves before taking to the field .
When it comes to following the Church 's teachings , many Spaniards are n't sticklers .
The most recent data from the National Institute of Statistics show that more than one in four babies are born out of wedlock and almost half of all weddings here are civil ceremonies .
Other CIS surveys show that two - thirds of Spaniards support same - sex marriage .
One in every five pregnancies here ends in abortion , according to the pro-life activist group Family Forum .
And fewer than one in five Spaniards attends Mass at least once a week , the CIS survey concluded .
But the Church 's presence does n't go away so readily .
Unlike in the U.S. , politicians here do not mention God in their speeches , and they are rarely photographed attending Mass .
However , a cross is prominently displayed on the table where Spanish leaders are sworn into office with their hands on the Bible or Constitution .
Politicians march in religious parades .
The cross often hangs from walls in public centers , although a court recently ordered the cross to be removed from the walls of a public school in Valladolid .
The Spanish constitution says there is no state religion .
But taxpayers can opt to give 0.7 percent of their income tax ( that is , part of , not in addition to , what they have to pay in taxes ) to the Catholic Church .
No other religion receives this concession , which one - third of Spanish taxpayers chose to use in 2007 .
Opponents criticize the public financing of the Catholic Church , but others defend it , pointing to the church 's charitable work , schools and restoration of centuries - old churches and monasteries .
The Spanish government does not plan to change this public financing , and a recent visit from the Vatican 's secretary of state made clear the importance the church enjoys in Spain .
Spain 's king , president , vice - president and the leader of the main opposition party all met with the Vatican 's representative .
Despite the difficult relationship between Spain 's center - left ruling party and the Spanish Catholic hierarchy over legislation regarding religious teaching in schools , abortion , fast - track divorce and same - sex marriage , President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero 's administration attempts to foster good relations with the Vatican .
The fact that Andalusia and Extremadura , two regions where Zapatero 's party has hegemony , have the highest rate of Catholic weddings may not be trivial .
Beating cancer with the help of medicinal mushrooms
( Natural News )
The cure for cancer already exists .
But it was n't created in a lab , and it was n't funded by pink - ribbon products or walkathons .
It was created for free by Mother Nature , and it exists as a collection of literally thousands of powerful anti-cancer phytonutrients found inMedicinal mushrooms contain some of the most potent medicine in the world .
They are living pharmaceutical factories , but they file no patents and ask for no royalties .
They just mind their own business , manufacturing healing medicines day by day , and waiting for someone wise and humble enough to come along and pick them .
Here , we 've assembled a unique collection of supporting statements about medicinal mushrooms and cancer from some of the top authors in the industry .
If you ( or someone you know ) suffers from any form of cancer , make sure to send them this information so they can learn what their conventional cancer doctor wo n't dare tell them ... that Many of the medicinal mushrooms , including chaga mushroom , maitake mushroom , ganoderma mushroom , and cordyceps mushroom , contain cancer - preventive and cancer - fighting actions .
Research has focused on the polysaccharides with beta 1,3 glucan linkages .
Indole - 3 - carbinol is a nutrient found in large quantities in cruciferous vegetables .
It is a potent antagonist of breast cancer , reducing formation of cancerous compounds from hormones and participating in blockage of cancer cell progression .
Other mushroom extracts that have been shown to have clinical effectiveness against human cancers are D - fraction extracted from the Maitake mushroom , and extracts from the split gill , turkey tail and Reishi mushrooms .
In 1998 , Maitake Products received FDA approval for an Investigational New Drug Phase II pilot study of maitake mushroom extract in the treatment of advanced breast and prostate cancer .
There is also some evidence that the consumption of mushrooms in the diet may ward off cancer .
As with many of the medicinal mushrooms , Shiitake has been shown to be of benefit as an adjuvant cancer therapy .
It has been shown to improve specific immune markers ( including natural killer cells , tumor necrosis factor , T - helper cells , and a variety of interleukins ) , and patient outcomes .
Reishi is one of the most versatile medicinal mushrooms .
It has long been used in Asia as an energy tonic to promote longevity and overall health .
Studies indicate that reishi is an antioxidant and contains polysaccharides and other compounds that may boost the immune system .
Reishi is taken to counter bacteria and viruses and has shown promise as an agent to help prevent or treat cancer , chronic fatigue syndrome , and other conditions .
Russian researchers at the Cancer Research Center in Moscow have had positive results using reishi extracts to boost the immunity of cancer patients .
Cancer patients may also wish to investigate medicinal mushrooms ( such types as reishi , shiitake , cordyceps , maitake , agaracus , and coriolus ) as immune - boosting companions to chemotherapy .
These medicinal mushrooms are sources of antitumor and immunity - modulating polysaccharides ( a type of carbohydrate ) that have been extensively researched .
Formulas containing concentrated extracts of medicinal mushrooms are available ; talk with your oncologist about which he or she might recommend .
Like many other medicinal mushrooms , reishi mushroom can be used to treat cancer patients due to its ability to activate NK cells , macrophages , T - lymphocytes , and cytokines , all important immune system components .
Kee Chang Huang reports that reishi " exerts a synergistic effect with other anticancer chemothera - peutic agents or radiotherapy , to augment the clinical therapeutic effect in the treatment of cancer patients .
" It takes about 15 pounds of reishi mushrooms to produce 1 pound of the powdered concentrate .
Medicinal mushrooms make a significant contribution to the healing process by enhancing and stimulating the body 's own immune system .
This is a very important factor in diseases like cancer and HIV , which have components unique to each individual .
In my protocols for people with cancer , I always include one or more medicinal mushroom extract products .
Descriptions of some of the more frequently used mushrooms follow .
Although the Mayo Clinic regards the use of medicinal mushrooms as more traditional than scientific , they operate in a manner similar to prescription drugs known as monocle .
Cancer patients need to understand the disconnect between the supposed mission to cure cancer and the objective of the companies that make monoclonal antibodies , which appears to be profits above delivery of an effective treatment .
The total therapeutic monoclonal antibodies market was estimated at $ 296 million in 2002 , and was projected to surge to $ 2.8 billion by 2010 .
In another study , researchers exposed mice to a known urinary bladder carcinogen , N - butyl - N' - butanolnitrosoamine ( BBN ) , every day for eight weeks and then fed them medicinal mushrooms , including maitake , shiitake , and oyster mushrooms .
All of the mice treated with BBN developed bladder cancer .
While each of the mushrooms reduced the number of bladder cancers , maitake was clearly most effective ( carcinomas were observed in 46.7 percent of the maitake - treated mice compared to 52.9 percent and 65 percent for shiitake and oyster , respectively ) .
There have been 150 species of medicinal mushrooms found to inhibit the growth of different kinds of tumors , especially cancers of the stomach , esophagus , and lungs , but chaga seems to stand out from the rest .
I learned about this mushroom from herbalist David Winston , who told me it has been used traditionally to treat different forms of cancer in Siberia , Canada , Scandinavia , the United States , and Russia .
Chaga is a fungal parasite that draws its nutrients out of living trees , rather than from the ground .
Japanese products containing LEM , a polysaccharide - rich extract from the shiitake mushroom , and similar extracts from maitake are currently undergoing trials in Japan and the U.S. to test their effectiveness in treating various forms of cancer .
They show promise for treating people suffering from various forms of cancer and AIDS and are currently in strong demand in Japan .
Goro Chihara notes that medicinal mushrooms such as shiitake can play an important role in augmenting " intrinsic host defense mechanisms " - boosting the body 's inherent abilities to fight off invading agents .
He says that such " host defense potentiators " should be a more important focus for cancer research than the current fascination with cell - killing substances .
Shiitake and reishi are the most common medicinal mushrooms in the United States today , though other varieties are beginning to become available either in fresh or packaged forms .
In Japan , pushcart vendors on the streets still sell medicinal mushrooms to the average citizen who uses them to maintain health and promote longevity .
Some Japanese people have even been said to travel hundreds of miles in order to collect wild mushrooms that only grow on very old plum trees - such as the Reishi - renowned as a cure for cancer and degenerative diseases .
Likewise , for over 3,000 years the Chinese have used and revered many fungi for their health - giving properties , especially tonics for the immune system ( Liu and Bau , 1980 ; Yun - Chang , 1985 ) .
Often called the " king of mushrooms , " shiitake is just one of a number of medicinal mushrooms currently under study at research centers in Germany , the United States , Japan , and China .
Shiitake is being used for a wide variety of conditions involving depressed immune function , from frequent colds to cancer .
In Japan , physicians prescribe shiitake in two different forms to treat many health conditions , including asthma , hepatitis B , ulcers , high cholesterol , AIDS , kidney inflammation , herpes , and various skin problems .
In the 1980s , Japanese researchers began to investigate the folklore behind medicinal mushrooms and found that many had truly remarkable properties .
For example , maitake mushroom stimulates the immune system by activating T - cells , the body 's natural defenders against viruses and cancer cells .
Recent animal studies have shown that maitake extract can shrink tumors in mice even better than a common chemotherapy drug .
Here is a brief summary of published studies on medicinal mushrooms and beta glucans : Mushroom polysaccharides have remarkable anti-tumor activity .
Mushrooms have anti-hyperlipidemic , hypotensive , and hypoglycemic actions .
Beta -glucan from maitake mushrooms may induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells .
Shiitake extracts have reduced cholesterol and have anti-viral effects .
Mushrooms are high fiber and function as prebiotics , antioxidants , and antibiotics .
As with most of the medicinal mushrooms , unique polysaccharides present in H. erinaceus have immune - enhancing properties , and preliminary studies are demonstrating some anticancer effects .
The most intriguing potential of H. erinaceus is that it may stimulate the production of a substance known as Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) .
This specialized protein is necessary for the growth of sensory neurons .
An in vitro study found that an extract from Hericium erinaceus mushroom promoted myelin sheath growth on brain cells .
Two species of medicinal mushrooms employed for healing purposes by Mazatec Indian shamans in southern Mexico have gone extinct in the past half century .
And tribes themselves continue to disappear .
This is just as great a tragedy , because almost every plant or plant derivative employed for medicinal purposes by Western society was investigated scientifically after being observed in use by " primitive " cultures .
Everything from codeine for pain to quinine for malaria to podo- phyllotoxin for cancer is based on plants discovered by ancient healers .
Shiitake and reishi offer a diverse range of potential health benefits .
You can take all of these supplements in perhaps eight to ten pills or capsules daily .
If you take just three or four of these natural supplements at breakfast and the same number later in the day , you will have substantially increased your energy levels , boosted your immune system , lowered your risk of heart disease and cancer , and strengthened and balanced your overall system .
Breaking Down the WSOP Final Table
2009 promises to offer one of the more interesting final tables in World Series of Poker history .
Basically every poker stereotype imaginable is present , including the amateur with the towering stack of chips he may or may not know how to use ( Darvin Moon ) , the low - profile live grinder ( Eric Buchman ) , the young internet phenom ( Joe Cada ) and , of course , the megawatt poker superstar ( Jeff Shulman ) .
Just kidding .
We refer , obviously , to Phil Ivey , who capped off this ‘ Year of the Pro ’ at the WSOP with an amazing run to the final table .
The collision of all of these players , with their wildly varying levels of experience , comfort , priorities and chips , should make for some extremely interesting poker .
Below we break down the final table and how play is likely to unfold as the November Nine returns from their respite and take their seats at the biggest Final Table in the pokerverse .
JUST THE FACTS
There ’s no redraw for seats at the final table , so the players will come back to the same seats they held while the table was ten handed .
When play resumes , Darvin Moon will be in the button , resulting in a final table that will look like this , positionally :
When play resumes , they ’ll start in Level 33 ( $ 120,000 - $ 240,000 with $ 30 k antes ) with approximately 24 minutes left .
That means every pot will be worth 630 k – not a huge chunk of the total chips in play , but a fairly significant amount to most of the players due to how Moon skews stacks with his massive chip edge .
To wit :
The average stack is about 22 million .
If you remove Moon , the average stack of the remaining players drops dramatically to 17 million .
After 24 minutes pass , they ’ll head into Level 34 ( $ 150,000 - $ 300,000 with $ 40 k antes ) .
Each level lasts two hours .
To translate that into hands , the average hands dealt at a live game is probably about 30 hands an hour .
With the pomp , circumstance and extended thought likely to go into play at this table , you can expect that hands per hour will probably dip into the high teens , meaning that players can expect to see between 30 - 40 hands , or about four orbits , per level .
Assuming no one is eliminated in the final minutes of Level 33 , the average stack in Level 34 will be a bit over 70 BBs .
The blinds increase fairly evenly over the next few levels .
You can view a complete structure sheet at WSOP.com here for a total picture .
IN THE BEGINNING …
While lots of experiences can prepare you for playing at the Final Table of the World Series of Poker , most people seem to agree that there ’s no way to completely prepare for the stress and pressure that comes along with the real thing .
Given that , expect most players to take the first orbit or so easy as they settle in to the table and work out the jitters caused by the weeks of anticipation preceding play .
Since this is the default path you ’d expect a typical player to take , there will obviously be players looking to exploit it .
Arguably in the best position to do so : Darvin Moon , whose mountain of chips will allow him to risk missteps that no one else at the table , save possibly Buchman , can really afford or stomach .
Next in line : Phil Ivey , who has to be in his opponent ’s heads – not only because he ’s Phil Ivey , but because all of the WSOP coverage up to this point has shown him either absolutely owning an opponent , having the nuts or both .
While he ’s never been on this stage , it ’s hard to believe that Ivey can be rattled sitting at any poker table under any circumstances and he ’ll likely be looking to build his stack by taking advantage of his ability to act decisively while others fade under the immediate pressure .
Finally , look for Buchman to take advantage of his excellent position and chip excess to turn on the gas if Moon and Ivey pass in front of him – and possibly even if they do n’t .
SHORT STACKS : ATTACK OR RELAX ?
The WSOP ME is a pretty deep tournament , so ‘ short stacks ’ is a bit of a misnomer at this table .
Consider : If Akenhead , the shortest stack at 6.8 million , does nothing but fold for two and a half hours , he ’ll still have close to a 10 BB stack as play moves into Level 35 .
That said , no one gets to this point and then settles for blinding off .
How should / will the five shorter stacks ( Ivey , Akenhead , Schaffel , Cada and Saout ) proceed ?
We ’ve already described how Ivey will probably get out of the gate : with aggression until he meets resistance or gets his stack closer to a point where he can really apply pressure to the 30 million + stacks .
Akenhead has plenty of live final table experience , so he ’s no stranger to managing the short stack , but his table position – sandwiched inbetween Moon and Ivey – might make it very difficult for him to be active without a hand .
Schaffel his a similar problem with Ivey acting before him and Buchman to his left , as Buchman will probably be very interested in getting involved in pots with Schaffell ( and Begleiter ) in position .

A burst of γ-rays lets scientists test quantum theories of gravity .
Space - time behaves like a fluid in the theory of general relativity .
Chris Henze / NASA / Science Photo Library
Astronomers have used a high - energy burst of light from a distant galaxy to test the fabric of space and time .
The work is the best test yet of attempts to create a ' theory of everything ' .
At present , two separate theories dominate the world of physics .
General relativity explains gravity and the motion of large objects such as planets , stars and galaxies , whereas quantum - mechanics explains the behaviour of very small things such as atoms .
Both theories do well at explaining their respective worlds , but they do n't fit together mathematically .
The problem is as fundamental as it gets : the two see space and time very differently , according to Giovanni Amelino - Camelia , a theoretical physicist at the University of Rome La Sapienza in Italy .
“ The study of space - time structure in a sense that is meaningful for quantum gravity has started . ”
Giovanni Amelino - Camelia
University of Rome La Sapienza
The difference is something like the difference between an ocean and a beach .
General relativity sees space - time as a vast , continuous fluid , whereas quantum mechanics suggests that it is grainy like sand .
Some quantum versions of gravity suggest that the ' grains ' of space - time , if they exist , would be vanishingly small , measuring around 10 – 35 metres .
That would make them nearly impossible to detect with instruments on Earth .
But high - energy light particles , known as γ-rays , might be able to tell the difference .
γ- rays are powerful photons that are thought to come from extreme astronomical events such as colliding neutron stars .
High energies correspond to short wavelengths , and some γ-rays are so short in wavelength that they might be able to distinguish between sandy and fluid space - time .
If space - time is grainy , then shorter wavelength γ- rays might stumble over the grains , perhaps making them travel slightly slower than γ-rays of longer wavelength .
" What you need is really a race , " Amelino - Camelia says .
Space race
The study , published online today in Nature , reports that an orbiting γ- ray satellite has caught just such a race in action1 .
On 10 May this year , the Fermi Gamma -ray Space Telescope spotted a short γ-ray burst from a galaxy at a distance of around 2 billion parsecs , or 7 billion light years , from Earth .
The burst lasted several seconds , with the γ-rays of shortest wavelength arriving around 0.829 seconds after the first rays were detected .
That 's late , but not late enough for the simplest theories of quantum gravity to hold up , according to Jonathan Granot , a member of the Fermi telescope team at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield , UK .
In other words , for now , space - time would seem to be smooth rather than sandy .

Granot says that he's a little disappointed the race only confirmed existing theories .
" If we could have clearly detected such an effect it would have been worthy of a Nobel Prize , " he says .
But , he adds , any test of far - out ideas about quantum gravity is " extremely helpful " .
Fundamental physics is " becoming very detached from observations " , he adds .
" The mere fact that we can significantly constrain some ... models is very good . "
The result does n't mean that the best efforts to unify gravity with quantum mechanics are wrong .
There are still plenty of versions of quantum gravity that would n't change the speed of light in the recent burst , according to Lee Smolin , a theoretical physicist at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo , Ontario , Canada .
Nevertheless , he says that the paper " is the best test yet of a general hypothesis about quantum space - time " .
Further measurements in coming years could guide theorists as they attempt to unify gravity with quantum mechanics .
" The study of space - time structure in a sense that is meaningful for quantum gravity has started , " Amelino - Camelia says .
An anarchist social worker raided by the feds wants his computers , manuscripts and pick axes back .
He argues that authorities violated the U.S. Constitution and the rights of his mentally ill clients while searching for evidence that he broke an anti-rioting law on Twitter .
In a guns - drawn raid on October 1 , FBI agents and police seized boxes of dubious " evidence " from the Queens , New York , home of Elliott Madison .
A U.S. District Judge in Brooklyn has set a Monday deadline to rule on the legality of the search , and in the meantime has ordered the government to refrain from examining the material taken in the 6 a.m. search .
Madison , who counsels more than 100 severely mentally ill patients in New York , seems to have first drawn attention from the authorities at September 's G - 20 gathering of world leaders in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
There he was arrested on September 24 at a motel room for allegedly listening to a police scanner and relaying information on Twitter to help protesters avoid heavily - armed cops — an activity the State Department lauded when it happened in Iran .
A week later , the Joint Terrorism Task Force , armed with a search warrant and backed by a federal grand jury investigation , raided Madison 's house , which he shares with his wife of 13 years and several roommates .
The squad seized his computers , camera memory cards , books , air - filtration masks , bumper stickers and political posters — all purportedly evidence ( . pdf ) that the 41 - year old social worker had broken a federal anti-rioting law that carries up to five years in prison .
But a closer look at the court documents leaves the unmistakable impression that Elliott Madison is yet another casualty of the government 's nasty , post - 9/11 habit of considering political dissidents to be threats to national security .
Madison , his wife and his lawyer Martin Stolar say the search violates the Constitution 's protections against general searches and prosecution for political speech .
The police also seized mobile phones , citizen emergency kits , manuscripts , posters and even the couple 's marriage license .
In a motion to throw out the search ( .pdf ) , Stolar called the search unconstitutional :
In this day and age , federally authorized agents entered the private home of a writer and urban planner and seized their books and writings .
The warrant ’s vagueness and lack of specificity encouraged the agents to use their own discretion and their own views of the political universe to seize , or not to seize , items which they thought were evidence of a violation of the federal anti-riot statute .
The law and the Constitution do not allow this .
If there really is a grand jury investigation with possible future prosecution under [ a federal anti-rioting law ] , the use of this statute as applied to demonstrations , demonstrators , and their supporters has profound 1st Amendment implications .
If Madison were an Iranian using Twitter to coordinate government protests , he 'd likely be considered a hero in the West .
Instead , the self - identified anarchist — who volunteered in Louisiana after Katrina — is now facing up to five years in prison for each count a grand jury cares to indict him on .
Oddly , Madison was in jail during the most dramatic of the G - 20 confrontations .
The day after his arrest by Pennsylvania State police on September 24 , hundreds of police officers chased protesters around Pittsburgh , using sonic weapons , pepper spray , batons , projectile weapons and tear gas , and arrested a reporter and bystanders .
Some self - styled anarchists broke windows of chain stores and pushed a dumpster towards a phalanx of cops in riot gear .
The connection between the federal and state investigation remains unclear , though the feds say they will turn evidence over to the state , if any is found .
The affidavits justifying the raid remain under seal , but court documents reveal a grand jury is investigating whether Madison , and possibly his wife , violated 18 U.S.C. § 2101 , the federal anti-rioting law .
That obscure law was famously used to prosecute the Chicago 7 after the 1968 Democratic Convention 's police riot .
Five of the so - called Yippies were initially found guilty of of inciting a riot , though the convictions were eventually thrown out .
Madison and his wife both volunteered as paralegals for the People 's Law Collective , their lawyer Martin Stolar said , and he'd worked with them before defending protesters .
In fact , he suggests that work might have sparked this entire incident .
" If you do your job effectively , then you draw the government 's attentions , " Stolar said .
Madison also belongs to the " Curious George Brigade , " which published a book called Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs .
The group was at work on a follow - up , until 50 copies of the first book and the electronic manuscript of the second were confiscated in the raid .
On Monday , Madison described the book in an affidavit to the court ( .pdf ) as a book of " political theory and practice . "
The published book seems sympathetic to the tactic of confronting police and destroying property of companies considered harmful , usually – though not always – multinational companies .
Writing such a book is not a crime , though , and many of the other books cited by the police as evidence justifying the search after the fact can be bought on Amazon.com .
Madison , who has no prior convictions , works as a counselor at a mental health facility .
He says some of the records seized by the government include confidential information that should be covered by a shield law protecting mental health records .
The U.S. Attorney 's office disputes that contention , saying the shield does n't apply since Madison is n't a registered social worker .
Moreover , the government says , Madison 's house was chock full of incriminating materials , including gas masks , pickaxes and air - filtration masks .
But Madison says that he'd become a believer in civil defense after the 2003 blackouts in New York and that the seized pickaxes are specialty , anti-sparking devices to be used in emergencies to shut off water mains .
In fact , Madison and his wife told the court they 'd made a YouTube video about what to put in a rescue pack .
A review of the video by Threat Level confirms the pickaxe in the video matches the one seized by police .
The government countered that his reading material is also very suspicious .
" As an initial matter , the government notes that a publication entitled ' Manifesto of Rioting ' was seized from the Weisses ’ bedroom , " the U.S. Attorney 's office told the court last week .
Some of the other evidence the feds seized that shows he promotes riots ?
Steampunk magazine , for one .
Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs .
Anarchist political - theory books .
A needlepoint depiction of Lenin that belonged to Madison 's wife 's grandmother .
( Not surprisingly , the police do n't seem to grasp the irony of an anarchist owning a Lenin bust in any form , given the hatred between the two ideologies since the Spanish Civil War , when the Communists turned on the anarchists and murdered their ostensible allies . )
His books on poison looks pretty incriminating , too .
But his lawyer wonders why the police seized The Poisons and Antidotes Sourcebook and left the book Deadly Doses : A Writer 's Guide to Poisons , both of which he says Elliot Madison uses for his fiction writing .
The feds also found caltrops – four - pronged metal defensive weapons that always land with a pointy side up , used to give flat tires or hobble horses .
Neither Madison nor his attorney has mentioned them in their filings .
They are not illegal to own .
When the feds also found nine packages of fireworks at the rear of a closet , a JTTF agent took him downtown to book him for the infraction – a ticketable offense .
The bomb squad took care of the fireworks , which one supposes must have been impervious to dousing by a regular police officer .
Federal agents also seized camera memory disks , Madison 's journals , computers and hard drives .
These contained his fiction manuscripts , his wife 's urban planning work and other writings .
The police also confiscated a housemate 's laptop that belonged to the Labor Department .
How did all of this get taken ?
Does n't a search warrant have to specify what exactly is to be seized ?
According to the U.S. Attorney 's office , the warrant was legitimate .
Signed by Judge Honorable Viktor V. Pohorelsky on September 26 , it authorized the government to seize :
Computers , hard - drives , floppy discs and other media used to store computer - accessible information , cellular phones , personal digital assistants , electronic storage devices and related peripherals , black masks and clothing , maps , correspondence and other documents , financial records , notes , ledgers , receipts , papers , photographs , telephone and address books , identification documents , indicia of residency and other documents and records that constitute evidence of the commission of rioting crimes or that are designed or intended as a means of violating the federal rioting laws , including any of the above items that are maintained within other closed or locked containers , including safes and other containers that may be further secured by key locks ( or combination locks ) of various kinds .
The list of what was taken ( . pdf ) stretches to pages .
The Madisons ' lawyers are trying to overturn the search on the grounds that the warrant was n't specific enough to pass constitutional muster .
They also argue the feds have no business collecting the names of people Elliot communicated with , and that records from the People 's Law Collective , as well as his work notes , are protected under confidentiality rules .
But the U.S. Attorney 's Office defended the search in court , arguing that the broad search was just like those used in drug warrants , which were increasingly broadened over the last quarter century 's ill - fated War on Drugs .
The affidavits that supported the search warrant are under court seal , because the grand jury investigation is " complex and multi- state , " according to the prosecution .
The federal anti-rioting statute is serious business , and is seemingly easy to violate .
For instance , it is a felony to " organize , promote , encourage , participate in , or carry on a riot ; or [...] to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in [...] a riot . "
By that token , simply telling a person fleeing cops with batons which way to run makes you a felon .
One wonders how the Southern Christian Leadership Council and Martin Luther King , Jr. would have fared under that law , when he was in a Birmingham jail , writing letters urging people to support the direct - action program of sit-ins and marches .
Those protesters were later attacked by police using dogs and fire hoses on the orders of Birmingham Sheriff Bull Connor .
A spokesman for the New York U.S. Attorney 's office , Bob Nardoza , declined to comment on the matter , citing rules forbidding officials to speak about grand jury investigations .

MERKABAH MAGICK - ( this was written by Vincent Bridges - as an edit to Dan Winter 's original " Light Poetry ) " New Emerald Tablet " http://www.fifthwaymysteryschool.org/NewEmTab.html.
Using Pentagonal Geometry to Explore Inner Space
Part Zero -
The Physics of Magick The Emerald Tablet of Hermes , a first century A.D. alchemical text , attempted to express ancient Egypt 's scientific wisdom in a few pithy lines of metaphorical and metaphysical symbology , suited of course for the educated Egyptian , or Greek or Roman philosopher / magician of the day .
Its insight is still breath - taking , if one has the key to the symbolism ; if not , its obscurity is profound .
Since few of use have the world - view of an Alexandrian mage , a simple how - to of magickal philosophy , in modern scientific terms , seems to e absolutely necessary .
Science is the magician 's willful apprentice , Magick 's lost step -- child / prodigy , who has learned one trick , and therefore must compulsively repeat that trick , without knowing how to stop itself .
To understand Magick , we must reclaim science as the observational and experimental tools needed to apprehend the true vastness of the Universe .
And so , with a nod to the real geniuses ( Winter ? ) who figures out what I am about to simplify , let 's take a stab at a new Emerald Tablet : ( This became a poem in Dan Winter 's 2nd book : Alphabet of the EarthHeart , Illustrated thanks to Vincent & Darlene 's editing ) 1 ) THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OF ONE SUBSTANCE
We all know the basic formula for this one ­­ E=MC2 .
Matter is just a lot of energy moving so slowly that we can touch it and sit on it .
energy is just a little bit of matter moving so fast we have trouble finding it .
They are polarities of the same substance , which is flowing or moving as different rates , constantly .
This very compressibility is what stores form and memory in its wave shape .
2 ) THE UNIVERSAL SUBSTANCE HAS ONLY ONE WAVE SHAPE -- THE SINE WAVE
The Fourier principle of frequency signature transformation means that even the most complex shape is a simple sum of sine waves of different lengths .
3 ) THE UNIVERSE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A GEOMETRY OF PRESSURE
Geometry can be thought of here as the basic creation of symmetry .
Any symmetrical structure creates a place where meeting waves , those traveling in opposite directions , can stand , that is , to phase and phase - lock .
Standing waves give the illusion of solidity , which is the segregation of momentum that makes possible the birth of matter .
Pressure occurs where waves meet .
Only ration is sacred ; scale is mundane .
Information is the only universal in our hologramic universe , every part contains the information of the whole .
Sharability , the way converging waves create sustainable forms , then becomes a property of inherent structure emerging naturally from the process itself .
In a world made only of waves , there would be just two geometric forms , the torus , or vortex , and the golden mean spiral .
the donut , torus , form is the only structure in a world of waves that can become coherent , that is , retain a regular shape like a smoke ring .
As more of these smoke rings are created and they want to relate to the first smoke ring , they must " nest " in the right pattern so that they can remember their form and still share structure .
the best pathway for doing this is the ratio we call the golden mean .
Only a form of Golden Mean symmetry will allow converging waves to add and multiply at the same time .
Only in this way , in this shape , can waves nest together without interfering with each other and canceling out their memories .
A Golden Mean spiral can nest triangles , Squares and five - sides figures , crating a dodecahedron as it does , .
the dodecahedron is the perfect Golden mean nest for turning information into coherent structure .
That 's why it is also the pattern of the braided DNA molecule .
The Golden Mean happens , the icosahedronal donut and the dodecahedronal donut generate the only other two naturally occurring numbers : Pi and E .
From this simple shape , and these three irrational , but naturally occurring numbers , the universe is built .
No wonder the ancient Egyptians called these qualities the cosmological Neters or forces .
4 ) FOCUS IS THE ONLY MEDIUM THAT CREATES IN A UNIVERSE OF WAVES
Focus , directed intensity of consciousness , occurs when the excited nests of smoke rings become fractally attractive along the patterns created by Phi , Pi , and E .
When this happens they also become matter , and the attractive quality is then seen as gravity .
Intention , like gravity , is a lens that bends light .
Focus in the form of the great geometric archetypes generates a sense of symbolic " gravity . "
5 ) SHAPE IS THE ONLY THING THE UNIVERSE HAS TO CONSERVE .
ALL QUALITATIVE CHANGES COME FROM DIFFERENCES IN SHAPE , NOT SUBSTANCE
Everything in our world , all matter , that is , all fractally attractive patterns of informational density , is composed of atoms , which are described by physics as a nucleus surrounded by electrons in so - called orbital shells .
These shells are the pattern , the shape or ratio , which is the only thing the universe must conserve , in order to know itself .
These shells or shapes are formed by the nestings of energy donuts or smoke rings .
the Atomic
Table then becomes a simple set of wave patterns , describing valency as symmetry .
Everything can be created from the nesting of one donut , with a pair of vortices ; three donuts , with six single direction vortices ; five donuts , with ten vortices ; and seven donuts , with fourteen vortices .
Count the vortices and you have the number of electrons in each orbital shell .
These patterns form regular shapes , called the Platonic solids because Plato was the first to write about them : the tetrahedron , on pair of vortices ; the octahedron / cube , three pairs ; the dodecahedron , five pairs ; and the icosahedron , seven pairs .
These basic shapes are important in transmitting the very waves structure of matter , best understood as templates that generate the focus of intensity necessary to become fractally attractive , that is , bend the straight energy flow of light into a circle of atomic structured matter .
6 ) THE ONLY WAY TO CONSERVE SHAPE ALONG A PATH IS TO MAINTAIN THE NEST OF RATIOS CONTAINING LENGTH , BREADTH AND VOLUME
The most elegant nest of ratio are those that intertwine Phi , Pi , and E , such as the DNA spiral .
We can think of this as simple proof that DNA is a structure that is codes to transmit information along the pathway of temporal evolution of physical life forms on the planet .
All life forms on the surface of the planet are the instruments and actors of an ancient epic opera hard - wired into the structure of our cells .
7 ) THE BEST PATHWAY TO MAINTAIN A NEST OF RATIOS IS THE GOLDEN MEAN
Wratcheting a cube five times at 32 degrees in the same visual space creates a dodecahedron .
Wratcheting a dodecahedron 32 degrees gives the powers of Phi ; Phi squared , cubed , etc .
The Golden mean pathway enables information ( shape ) to be moved without loss of momentum ( mind ) .
The closer we can come to forming this shape and path , the grater our conductivity , that is , the more energy can flow through us .
As we focus our intensity on these shapes and flow patterns , we create a sort of super conductive , super coherent energy exchange .
8 ) COHERENCE AT ANY LEVEL IS COHERENCE AT AL LEVELS .
An orderly arrangement between wave lengths establishes a connection between frequencies and fields .
But for this connection to last , it must resonate to all frequencies and fields .
This can only be accomplished through the resonate structure of golden mean pathways .
This harmonic cascade of inter-connected - ness is the structure of our hologramic universe , perceptible as ecstasy .
9 ) DNA IS THE SEED CRYSTAL OF THE HIGHER DIMENSIONAL LIGHT BODY .
DNA , a perfect
Phi structures crystal connecting long waves and short waves , is a three - dimensional patterns designed to transmit information , in the form of living being , through time and space , the fourth dimension .
Its goal seems to be the creation of a fifth dimensional intelligence , one capable of phase - locking with the information of the universe stored in the crystaline coding of the DNA geometry .
10 ) LIGHT , WHEN FOLDED BACK ON ITSELF , COMES TO KNOW ITSELF .
A fifth dimensional awareness , which we can categorize as one that sees all space and time , energy and matter , as components of the original wave form , bends Light into the circle of self - awareness .
This creates the rich blue / UV explosion of energy that accompanies the rise of Kundalini , the phase - lock of biological energies into the flow of the universal information energy stream .
This enfolded - ness creates enlightenment , a state where the awareness of the universal mind meets itself at every wave junction .
A one - month , street - level drug investigation dubbed Project Escape has resulted in 76 people being charged with more than 200 drug - related offences .
The investigation began after numerous residents and business owners throughout the downtown 's west end complained to police , Det. Karen Chapman told a news conference this morning .
Specifically , pockets near King St. W and Dufferin St. , King St. W and Strachan Ave. , Dundas St. W and Spadina Ave. , Queen St. W and Lansdowne Ave. and parts of Kensington were targeted .
" Those areas are well known for street - level drug activity , " said Chapman .
" But if you were to grab a coffee and go sit on the corner , you would probably not even necessarily know what you were watching . "
Investigators from the 14 Division plainclothes unit and members of the drug squad seized more than $ 17,000 in cash and quantities of cocaine , marijuana , ecstasy and OxyContin , among other drugs .
The majority of charges laid were trafficking , possession of illegal substances , possession of proceeds of crime and bail violations .

MANCHESTER , Ky. ( AP ) 
When Bill Sparkman told retired trooper Gilbert Acciardo that he was going door - to - door collecting census data in rural Kentucky , the former cop drew on years of experience for a warning : " Be careful . "
The 51 - year - old Sparkman was found this month hanged from a tree near a Kentucky cemetery with the word " fed " scrawled on his chest , a law enforcement official said Wednesday , and the FBI is investigating whether he was a victim of anti-government sentiment .
" Even though he was with the Census Bureau , sometimes people can view someone with any government agency as ' the government . '
I just was afraid that he might meet the wrong character along the way up there , " said Acciardo , who directs an after - school program at an elementary school where Sparkman was a frequent substitute teacher .
The Census Bureau has suspended door - to - door interviews in rural Clay County , where the body was found , until the investigation is complete , an official said .
The law enforcement official , who was not authorized to discuss the case and requested anonymity , did not say what type of instrument was used to write the word on the chest of Sparkman , who was supplementing his income doing Census field work .
He was found Sept. 12 in a remote patch of Daniel Boone National Forest and an autopsy report is pending .
Manchester , the main hub of the southeastern Kentucky county , is an exit off the highway , with a Walmart , a few hotels , chain restaurants and a couple gas stations .
The drive away from town and toward the area where Sparkman 's body was found goes through sparsely populated forest with no streetlights , on winding roads that run up and down steep hills .
Manchester Police Chief Jeff Culver , whose agency is not part of the investigation because the death was outside city limits , said the area where Sparkman was found has a history of problems with prescription drug and methamphetamine trading .
" That part of the county , it has its ups and downs .
We 'll get a lot of complaints of drug activity .
They 'll whittle away , then flourish back up , " Culver said .
He said officers last month rounded up 40 drug suspects , mostly dealers , and made several more arrests in subsequent days .
FBI spokesman David Beyer said the bureau is assisting state police and declined to discuss any details of the crime scene .
Agents are trying to determine if foul play was involved and whether it had anything to do with Sparkman 's job as Census worker , Beyer said .
Attacking a federal worker during or because of his federal job is a federal crime .
Lucindia Scurry - Johnson , assistant director of the Census Bureau 's southern office in Charlotte , said law enforcement officers have told the agency the matter is " an apparent homicide " but nothing else .
Census employees were told Sparkman 's truck was found nearby , and a computer he was using for work was inside , she said .
Gov. Steve Beshear expressed his condolences to Sparkman 's family .
" The Medical Examiner 's office is awaiting test results to determine cause of death , and once a cause and manner have been established , state police will focus their investigation in the appropriate direction , " Beshear said in a statement .
Sparkman 's mother , Henrie Sparkman of Inverness , Fla. , told The Associated Press her son was an Eagle scout who moved to Kentucky to direct the local Boy Scouts of America .
He later became a substitute teacher in Laurel County , adjacent to the county where his body was found .
She said investigators have given her few details about her son's death .
They did tell her his body was decomposed and have n't yet released it for burial .
" I was told it would be better for him to be cremated , " she said .
Acciardo said he became suspicious and went to police when Sparkman did n't show up for work at the after - school program in Laurel County for two days .
Authorities immediately investigated , he said .
" He was such an innocent person , " Acciardo said .
" I hate to say that he was naive , but he saw the world as all good , and there 's a lot of bad in the world . "
Sparkman had worked for the Census since 2003 in five counties in the surrounding area , conducting interviews once or twice a month .
Much of his recent work had been in Clay County , officials said .
The Census Bureau has yet to begin door - to - door canvassing for the 2010 head count , but thousands of field workers are doing smaller surveys on various demographic topics on behalf of federal agencies .
Next year , the Census Bureau will dispatch up to 1.2 million temporary employees to locate hard - to - find residents .
Mary Hibbard , a teacher in Manchester , said she recognized Sparkman on the news as the census worker who visited her house this summer for about 10 minutes .
Hibbard said he asked some basic questions including the size of her house , how many rooms it had and how much she paid monthly for electricity .
" I know he has a Christian background , " she said .
" You come to my house , we 're going to talk religion . "
Hibbard said she thinks most people in the area were shocked by the death .
" I think the negative publicity of it is a stigma on our county .
It makes people think less of us even though this is an isolated incident . "
The Census Bureau is overseen by the Commerce Department .
" We are deeply saddened by the loss of our co-worker , " Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said in a statement .
Locke called him " a shining example of the hardworking men and women employed by the Census Bureau . "
Kelsee Brown , a waitress at Huddle House , a 24 - hour chain restaurant in Manchester , when asked about the death , said she thinks the government sometimes has the wrong priorities .
" Sometimes I think the government should stick their nose out of people 's business and stick their nose in their business at the same time .
They care too much about the wrong things , " she said .
Appalachia scholar Roy Silver , a New York City native now living in Harlan County , Ky. , said he does n't sense an outpouring of anti-government sentiment in the region as has been exhibited in town hall meetings in other parts of the country .
" I do n't think distrust of government is any more or less here than anywhere else in the country , " said Silver , a sociology professor at Southeast Community College .
The most deadly attack on federal workers came in 1995 when the federal building in Oklahoma City was devastated by a truck bomb , killing 168 and injuring more than 680 .
Timothy McVeigh , who was executed for the bombing , carried literature by ultra- right - wing , anti-government authors .
Sparkman 's mother is simply waiting for answers .
" I have my own ideas , but I can't say them out loud .
Not at this point , " she said .
" Right now , what I 'm doing , I 'm just waiting on the FBI to come to some conclusion . "

Dave Cleveland , founder and CEO of Riverside Bank until he sold it a decade ago and became a millionaire after 40 years in the trade , was hired by federal regulators in 2008 as the volunteer chairman of troubled Community National Bank of North Branch .
Cleveland found top executives looting the joint , including through a deal that ended up infecting 20 other community banks .
Last Friday , Curtis Martinson , 54 , of Eden Prairie , was the third Community National executive to admit that he ripped off the bank .
His plea in federal court followed guilty pleas in August from former president Bill Sandison , 65 , and his son , Ross , 42 , who were charged earlier with siphoning bank funds from the $ 35 million real estate development deal they led into foreclosure in the Anoka County city of Ramsey .
Cleveland smelled trouble when he saw that the Sandisons were paying themselves $ 300,000 apiece plus bonuses , country club memberships in Florida , vehicles and much more .
Cleveland 's board paid him $ 250,000 a year a to run Riverside , a much larger bank that also was among the state 's most profitable .
By the time Cleveland arrived , an investigation was underway .
In 2007 , an appraiser tied to the Sandisons through kickback schemes left a suicide note that provided a roadmap to investigators , who already were getting complaints from worried community bankers .
The bankers had been solicited to take pieces of the $ 35 million participation loan made several years ago to finance what was supposed to be a 322 - acre project in Ramsey full of housing , stores and a transit station .
Only one problem .
A project that size was n't merited by demand .
The tenets of diversification and good stewardship that bankers pledge to uphold when they are investing the money of government - insured depositors went out the window .
" Greed , greed , it was all about greed , " said Cleveland , 76 , now a tree farmer and community volunteer .
" It was n't just this deal .
Greed and lack of diversification got our industry into trouble .
Maybe we bankers have proven , after all the deregulation , that we need more regulation .
We seem unable to discipline ourselves . "
The commercial real estate and subprime mortgage binges burst into the worst American recession in 60 years in 2007 .
Alan Greenspan , then chairman of the Federal Reserve , chose to dismiss warning signs five years ago thanks to his unshakable belief that powerful market players always act in the long - term interest of the shareholders .
Sorry , the guys who ran AIG , Citigroup , Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers were more focused on their next eight - figure bonus checks .
In 2007 , Chuck Prince , since - ousted head of Citigroup , told the Financial Times that there could be trouble at the confluence of excessive leverage , limited capital and heavy bets in real estate : " When the music stops , in terms of liquidity , things will be complicated , " he said .
" But as long as the music is playing , you 've got to get up and dance . "
And here I thought the high - buck CEO 's job was to avoid the mob mentality .
Citigroup -- the huge financial conglomerate that got Congress in 2000 to free federally insured depositories to dive into all manner of investment banking , subprime mortgages and hedge funds -- plunged into greater risk , abetted by duplicitous bond - rating agencies that put their Grade A seal of approval on securitized junk , and federally chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , who insured billions in suspect mortgages that were backed by the government .
By the way , the stock of Citi has fallen from about $ 55 per share to $ 4.50 since deregulation passed .
Whether it was Community National of North Branch or Citigroup , the root problem was the same , Cleveland said .
BANDA ACEH , Indonesia  Under Islamic law , or Shariah , the religious police have administered public canings for such things as gambling , prostitution and illicit affairs .
But under a new Islamic criminal code that goes into effect this month , the Shariah police will be wielding a new and more potent threat : death by stoning for adulterers .
Most of Indonesia still lives up to its reputation for a moderate , easygoing brand of Islam , and Islamist parties suffered heavy losses in this year ’s national elections .
But how Aceh went from basic Islamic law to endorsing stoning in a few short years shows how a small , radical minority has successfully pushed its agenda , locally and nationally , by cowing political and religious moderates .
Though extreme , Aceh is not an isolated case .
In recent years , as part of a decentralization of power away from the capital , Jakarta , at least 50 local governments have used their new authority to pass Shariah - based regulations regarding conduct and dress , though none have gone as far as Aceh to deal with criminal matters .
Most experts and human rights advocates believe the regulations discriminate against non-Muslim minorities and contravene the country ’s Constitution , which guarantees freedom of religion .
But the government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  a moderate former general whose Muslim credentials have often been questioned by political opponents  has not challenged them .
In fact , Mr. Yudhoyono has backed morality - based laws that pleased Muslim conservative allies but angered advocates of human rights .
HOUSTON / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A crude oil tanker collided with a service vessel in the Gulf of Mexico near Texas , spilling 18,000 gallons ( 68,140 liters ) of the tanker ’s fuel but none of its cargo , the U.S. Coast Guard said on Wednesday .
The accident occurred in rough seas late Tuesday after the tanker finished receiving crude oil from a supertanker too large to enter port 46 miles southeast of Galveston .
Ship - to - ship oil transfers , called lightering , are common and often involve a third vessel servicing the operation .
The 820 - foot ( 250 - meter ) Liberian - flagged , Russian - operated Krymsk , collided with the 166 - foot lightering service vessel AET Endeavor , after the Krymsk had finished taking Arabian crude oil from a larger ship , the Vega Star .
One of the Krymsk ’s fuel tanks was pierced , spilling No. 6 bunker fuel , officials said .
The cargo tanks were undamaged and none of the cargo , 70,475 metric tonnes of crude , spilled , a spokesman for Krymsk operator Novorossiysk said .
The crew transferred the ship ’s remaining fuel , about 45,000 gallons , to an undamaged tank , stopping the leak , the spokesman said .
The Endeavor , owned by American Eagle Tankers , was not seriously damaged .
Weather conditions on site - 40 - knot winds and 5 - foot waves - prevented surface vessels from starting cleanup of the spill , so the Coast Guard used dispersants dropped from airplanes .
The incident is in a zone off Galveston designated for ship - to - ship transfer of crude oil and ship traffic was unaffected by the accident or the spill , the Coast Guard said .
The spill of fuel used to power the Krymsk is relatively small , although No. 6 is heavy and thick compared to gasoline , and posed little environmental threat so far offshore , shipping sources said .
The cause of the accident was under investigation .
The Coast Guard said such accidents are rare in an area where many ships load and unload crude oil for delivery to the largest U.S. refining complex along the Gulf Coast .

Tens of thousands of revelers pelted each other with tons of ripe and over - ripe tomatoes at the annual “ Tomatina ” festival in Bunol , Spain , Wednesday .
The world ’s biggest tomato fight attracted more than 40,000 people this year , town officials estimated .
Revelers , some from as far away as Japan and Australia , filled the streets .
40,000 people , 100 tons of tomatoes , blah , blah , blah ...
This is really what it 's all about .
Come to think of it , is n't that what everything is about ?

VdB 152 : Reflection Nebula in Cepheus
Credit & Copyright : Stephen Leshin
Explanation : Described as a " dusty curtain " or " ghostly apparition " , mysterious reflection nebula VdB 152 really is very faint .
Far from your neighborhood on this Halloween Night , the cosmic phantom is nearly 1,400 light - years away .
Also cataloged as Ced 201 , it lies along the northern Milky Way in the royal constellation Cepheus .
Near the edge of a large molecular cloud , pockets of interstellar dust in the region block light from background stars or scatter light from the embedded bright star giving parts of the nebula a characteristic blue color .
Ultraviolet light from the star is also thought to cause a dim reddish luminescence in the nebular dust .
Though stars do form in molecular clouds , this star seems to have only accidentally wandered into the area , as its measured velocity through space is very different from the cloud 's velocity .
This deep telescopic image of the region spans about 7 light - years .

Sleep is underrated .
According to experts , it is as important to your health as exercise , nutrition and not being set on fire .
And it 's the easiest route to self - improvement imaginable , far more straightforward and achievable than 100 squat thrusts .
All you have to do is lie around doing nothing for eight hours .
So simple , even a corpse could do it .
But not , apparently , a child .
Concerned health campaigners want Britain 's schoolchildren to be given " sleep lessons " to teach them the benefits of regular night - long slumber .
This is an exciting development , because it raises the prospect of " sleep exams " – practical snoozing assessments that even the thickest kid could pass with their eyes closed .
It 's easy to sleep when you 're a toddler .
Your mind and body skitter around all day until they burn themselves out , leaving you blissfully knackered when the sun goes down .
You 've only got two modes : on and off , like a blender .
But once you reach adulthood , things are altogether less binary .
You 've got responsibilities and concerns , not to mention an alarm clock with a sarcastically oversized face sitting beside the bed mocking any attempt at shuteye .
Chances are you 've spent your day mumbling to co-workers , bumping into furniture and performing pedestrian chores .
Your brain spends the daylight hours in a state of drowsy semi-consciousness , and only decides to spring into life when the lights go out .
The insomniac brain comes in various flavours ; different personality types you 're forced to share your skull with for several hours .
It 's like being trapped in a lift with someone who wo n't shut up .
Sometimes your companion is a peppy irritant who passes the time by humming half - remembered TV theme tunes until 7 am .
Other times it 's a morose critic who has recently compiled a 1,500 - page report on your innumerable failings and wants to run over it with you a few times before going to print .
Worst of all is the hyper - aware sportscaster who offers an uninterrupted commentary describing which bits of your body are currently the least comfortable .
No matter where you put that leg , he wo n't be satisfied .
And he 's convinced you 've got one arm too many .
This is the point at which " sleep lessons " might actually come in handy .
Not when you 're a kid ( they 'll only baffle you ) , but when you 're an adult who spends several hours each night staring at the inside of your eyelids , exploring desolate inner dimensions on a rickety mental tricycle .
That 's when you need all the help you can get .
But practical tips only , please .
No one needs to be told how important it is for your health .
We 've all experienced the aftermath of a sleepless night .
You shuffle through the next day feeling fuzzily toxic , as though all your internal organs have been for a 20 - mile run and have n't had a hot bath yet .
I 've got a phrase for it : " time - poisoning " .
Anyway , in a bid to pre-empt the health professionals , here 's a list of insomnia " dos and don'ts " guaranteed to give you a good night 's sleep :
DO keep your eyes closed .
DON'T try to convince yourself you 're asleep by making snoring noises .
DO focus on slowing your breathing down as much as possible .
A handy tip is to imagine there 's a speed camera pointing at your face ; a magic speed camera that can photograph air .
If you inhale or exhale too quickly , it 'll fire a sharpened steel bolt into your forehead .
Keep thinking about this all night .
DON'T go to bed wearing a makeshift crown fashioned from coathangers and bells – and if you do , do n't sit upright violently shaking your head from side to side until sunrise .
DO keep the " worrying cells " of your brain occupied .
Playing simple word games in your head is an excellent tactic .
If it helps , imagine you 're a contestant on Countdown , but try not to picture the gigantic clock looming behind you on the studio wall , with its huge sweeping hand marking the frantic passage of time , its hideous unbroken sweep impassively signifying the silent extinction of second after second . . . the hand that describes an arc . . . an arc that becomes a circle . . . a circle that becomes a spiral . . . a spiral that mirrors your twisting descent as you corkscrew downwards through time itself , plunging ever deeper into a void of meaningless decay . . .
If you start thinking about that , quickly interrupt yourself by imagining Jeff Stelling throwing to a break .
DON'T stay in bed if you have n't fallen asleep with 30 minutes .
Instead , get up and do something practical , such as driving a car or operating some heavy machinery .
DO drink nine litres of warm milk before bed .
There .
Simple .
And if none of that works , eat some drugs , use a different pillow , or saw your head off and stick it on a pole made of lullabies .
Piece of piss .

Monsanto : A history
6 February 2009
How one of the top 10 US chemical companies used the world 's biggest selling pesticide to turn itself into a GM giant in order to try and escape its past
Chemical origins
Monsanto was created in 1901 .
The company 's first product was the artificial sweetener saccharin .
In the 1920s Monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals .
During the Second World War Monsanto contributed to research on uranium for the Manhattan Project , which lead to the atomic bomb .
Monsanto continued to operate a nuclear facility for the U.S. government until the late 1980s .
During the 1940s Monsanto also become a leading manufacturer of synthetic fibres and plastics , including polystyrene – ranked fifth in the EPA ’s list of chemicals whose production generates the most total hazardous waste .
From the 1940s onwards Monsanto was one of the top 10 US chemical companies .
Agent Orange and dioxins
Following the Second World War , Monsanto championed the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture .
Its major agrochemical products have included the herbicides 2,4,5-T , DDT , Lasso and Agent Orange , which was widely used as a defoliant by the U.S. Government during the Vietnam War and which was later shown to be highly carcinogenic .
The Agent Orange produced by Monsanto had dioxin levels many times higher than that produced by Dow Chemicals , the other major supplier of Agent Orange to Vietnam .
This made Monsanto the key defendant in the lawsuit brought by Vietnam War veterans in the United States , who faced an array of debilitating symptoms attributable to Agent Orange exposure .
Internal Monsanto memos show that Monsanto knew of the problems of dioxin contamination of Agent Orange when it sold it to the U.S. government for use in Vietnam .
Agent Orange contaminated more than 3 million civilians and servicemen , and an estimated 500,000 Vietnamese children have been born with deformities attributed to Agent Orange , leading to calls for Monsanto to be prosecuted for war crimes .
No compensation has been paid to Vietnamese civilians and though some compensation was paid to U.S. veterans , according to William Sanjour , who led the Toxic Waste division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , “ thousands of veterans were disallowed benefits ” because “ Monsanto studies showed that dioxin [ as found in Agent Orange ] was not a human carcinogen . ”
An EPA colleague discovered that Monsanto had apparently falsified the data in their studies .
Sanjour says , “ If [ the studies ] were done correctly , they would have reached just the opposite result . ”
The birth of Roundup
The success of the herbicide Lasso had turned around Monsanto 's struggling Agriculture division , and by the time Agent Orange was banned in the U.S. and Lasso was facing increasing criticism , Monsanto had developed the weedkiller “ Roundup ” ( active ingredient : glyphosate ) as a replacement .
Launched in 1976 , Roundup helped make Monsanto the world 's largest producer of herbicides .
The success of Roundup coincided with the recognition by Monsanto executives that they needed to radically transform a company increasingly under threat .
According to a recent paper by Dominic Glover , “ Monsanto had acquired a particularly unenviable reputation in this regard , as a major producer of both dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) – both persistent environmental pollutants posing serious risks to the environment and human health .
Law suits and environmental clean - up costs began to cut into Monsanto 's bottom line , but more seriously there was a real fear that a serious lapse could potentially bankrupt the company . ”
Hundreds of millions paid out for pollution lawsuits
Such a fear was not misplaced .
By the 1980s Monsanto was being hit by a series of lawsuits .
It was one of the companies named in 1987 in an $ 180 million settlement for Vietnam War veterans exposed to Agent Orange .
In 1991 Monsanto was fined $ 1.2 million for trying to conceal the discharge of contaminated waste water .
In 1995 Monsanto was ordered to pay $ 41.1 million to a waste management company in Texas due to concerns over hazardous waste dumping .
That same year Monsanto was ranked fifth among U.S. corporations in EPA ’s Toxic Release Inventory , having discharged 37 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the air , land , water and underground .
In 1997 The Seattle Times reported that Monsanto sold 6,000 tons of contaminated waste to Idaho fertilizer companies , which contained the carcinogenic heavy metal cadmium .
Then in 2002 the Washington Post ran an article entitled , “ Monsanto Hid Decades Of Pollution , PCBs Drenched Ala .
Town , But No One Was Ever Told ” .
Monsanto began production of polychlorinated biphenyls in the United States in 1929 .
PCBs were considered an industrial wonder chemical – an oil that would not burn , was impervious to degradation and had almost limitless applications .
Today PCBs are considered one of the gravest chemical threats on the planet .
Produced deadly PCBs for over 50 years
Monsanto produced PCBs for over 50 years and they are now virtually omnipresent in the blood and tissues of humans and wildlife around the globe .
These days PCBs are banned from production and some experts say there should be no acceptable level of PCBs allowed in the environment .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says , “ PCB has been demonstrated to cause cancer , as well as a variety of other adverse health effects on the immune system , reproductive system , nervous system and endocrine system . ”
But the evidence of widespread contamination from PCBs and related chemicals has been accumulating from 1965 onwards and internal company papers show that Monsanto knew about the PCB dangers from early on .
For instance , toxicity tests on the effects of two PCBs in 1953 showed that more than 50 % of the rats subjected to them died , and all of them showed damage .
With experts at the company in no doubt that Monsanto 's PCBs were responsible for contamination , in 1968 the company set up a committee to assess its options .
In a paper distributed to only 12 people but which surfaced at the trial in 2002 , Monsanto admitted “ that the evidence proving the persistence of these compounds and their universal presence as residues in the environment is beyond question ... the public and legal pressures to eliminate them to prevent global contamination are inevitable ” .
Monsanto papers seen by The Guardian newspaper reveal near panic .
“ The subject is snowballing .
Where do we go from here ?
The alternatives : go out of business sell the hell out of them as long as we can and do nothing else try to stay in business have alternative products ” , wrote the recipient of one paper .
In 1969 the company wrote a confidential Pollution Abatement Plan which admitted that “ the problem involves the entire United States , Canada and sections of Europe , especially the UK and Sweden ” .
The problem was particularly severe in the town of Anniston in Alabama where discharges from the local Monsanto plant meant residents developed PCB levels hundreds or thousands of times the average .
As The Washington Post reported , “ for nearly 40 years , while producing the now - banned industrial coolants known as PCBs at a local factory , Monsanto Co. routinely discharged toxic waste into a west Anniston creek and dumped millions of pounds of PCBs into oozing open - pit landfills .
And thousands of pages of Monsanto documents – many emblazoned with warnings such as ' CONFIDENTIAL : Read and Destroy ' – show that for decades , the corporate giant concealed what it did and what it knew . ”
Covering up the truth
Ken Cook of the Environmental Working Group says that based on the Monsanto documents made public , the company “ knew the truth from the very beginning .
They lied about it .
They hid the truth from their neighbors . ”
One Monsanto memo explains their justification : “ We ca n't afford to lose one dollar of business . ”
Eventually the company was found guilty of conduct “ so outrageous in character and extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency so as to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in civilized society ” .
But by the time that the Anniston pollution case came to court , Monsanto had already managed to hive off the old core of its business into a new company called Solutia .
Although Monsanto and Solutia eventually agreed to pay $ 600 million to settle claims brought by more than 20,000 Anniston residents , Monsanto had by then relaunched itself as an agricultural biotechnology company .
Solutia was spun off from Monsanto as a way for Monsanto to divest itself of billions of dollars in environmental cleanup costs and other liabilities for its past actions – liabilities that eventually forced Solutia to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
According to a spokesman for Solutia , “ ( Monsanto ) sort of cherry - picked what they wanted and threw in all kinds of cats and dogs as part of a going - away present , ” including $ 1 billion in debt and environmental and litigation costs .
Some pre-bankruptcy Solutia equity holders allege Solutia was set up fraudulently as it was always doomed to fail under the financial weight of Monsanto 's liabilities .
Distancing itself from its legacy
The key to Monsanto 's metamorphosis into a biotechnology company was the run away success of the herbicide Roundup .
Within a few years of its 1976 launch , Roundup was being marketed in 115 countries .
According to Glover , “ Sales grew by 20 per cent in 1981 and as the company increased production it was soon Monsanto 's most profitable product ( Monsanto 1981 , 1983 ) ...
It soon became the single most important product of Monsanto 's agriculture division , which contributed about 20 per cent of sales and around 45 per cent of operating income to the company 's balance sheet each year during the late 1980s and early 1990s .
Today , glyphosate remains the world 's biggest herbicide by volume of sales . ”
By 1990 with the help of Roundup , the agriculture division of Monsanto was significantly outperforming Monsanto 's chemicals division in terms of operating income , and the gap was increasing .
But as Glover notes , while “ such a blockbuster product uncorks a fountain of revenue ” , it “ also creates an uncomfortable dependency on the commercial fortunes of a single brand .
Monsanto's management knew that the last of the patents protecting Roundup in the United States , its biggest market , would expire in the year 2000 , opening the field to potential competitors .
The company urgently needed a strategy to negotiate this hurdle and prolong the useful life of its ' cash cow ' . ”
Biotechnology was increasingly seen not just as a valuable complement to Monsanto 's chemical technology but as a way of enabling it to further expand into agriculture and secure its “ cash cow ” .
This lead to Monsanto selling off its plastics business to Bayer in 1996 , and its phenylalanine facilities to Great Lakes Chemical Corporation ( GLC ) in 1999 .
Much of the rest of its chemicals division was spun off in late 1997 as Solutia , as already noted .
This helped Monsanto distance itself to some extent not only from direct financial liability for the historical core of its business but also from its controversial production and contamination legacy .
Born-again GM Monsanto
By 2000 the current Monsanto had emerged from various transactions , including a merger for a time with Pharmacia , as a legally different corporation from the Monsanto that had existed from 1901 - 2000 .
This was depite the fact that both Monsantos shared not just the same name , but the same corporate headquarters near St. Louis , Missouri , and many of the same executives and other employees , not to mention much of the responsibility for liabilities arising out of its former activities .
As Monsanto had moved into biotechnology , its executives had the opportunity to create a new narrative for the company .
They begun to portray genetic engineering as a ground - breaking technology that could contribute to feeding a hungry world .
Monsanto executive Robb Fraley , who was head of the plant molecular biology research team , is also said to have hyped the potential of GM crops within the company , as a once - in - a - generation opportunity for Monsanto to dominate a whole new industry , invoking the monopoly success of Microsoft as a powerful analogy .
But , according to Glover , the more down - to - earth pitch to fellow executives was that “ genetic engineering offered the best prospect of preserving the commercial life of Monsanto 's most important product , Roundup in the face of the challenges Monsanto would face once the patent expired . ”
“ Roundup Ready ” GM seeds
Monsanto eventually achieved this by introducing into crop plants genes that give resistance to glyphosate ( the active ingredient in Roundup ) .
This meant farmers could spray Roundup onto their fields as a weedkiller even during the growing season without harming the crop .
This allowed Monsanto to “ significantly expand the market for Roundup and , more importantly , help Monsanto to negotiate the expiry of its glyphosate patents , on which such a large slice of the company 's income depended . ”
With glyphosate - tolerant GM crops , Monsanto was able to preserve its dominant share of the glyphosate market through a marketing strategy that would couple proprietary “ Roundup Ready ” seeds with continued sales of Roundup .
Although the first of Monsanto 's biotech products to make it to market was not a GM crop but Monsanto 's controversial GM cattle drug , bovine growth hormone – called rBGH or rBST , Monsanto 's corporate strategy led them for the first time to acquire seed companies .
During the 1990s Monsanto spent $ 10 billion globally buying up seed companies – a push that continues to this day .
It has purchased , for example , Holden 's Foundations Seeds , Seminis – the largest seed company not producing corn or soybeans in the world , the Dutch seed company De Ruiter Seeds , and the big cotton seed firm Delta and Pine .
As a result , Monsanto is now the world 's largest seed company , accounting for almost a quarter of the global proprietary seed market .
Monsanto's biotech seeds and traits ( including those licensed to other companies ) accounted for almost 90 % of the total world area devoted to GM seeds by 2007 .
Today , over 80 % of the worldwide area devoted to GM crops carries at least one genetic trait for herbicide tolerance .
Herbicides account for about one - third of the global pesticide market .
Monsanto's glyphosate - resistant ( Roundup Ready ) seeds have reigned supreme on the biotech scene for over a decade – creating a near - monopoly for the company 's Roundup herbicide – which is now off patent .
Roundup is the world 's biggest selling pesticide and it has helped make Monsanto the world 's fifth largest agrochemical company .
Virtual monoploly drives up prices
This concentration of corporate power drives up costs for farmers and consumers .
Retail prices for Roundup have increased from just $ 32 per gallon in December 2006 to $ 45 per gallon a year later , to $ 75 per gallon by June 2008 – a 134 % price hike in less than two years .
Because gene technologies can be patented , they also concentrate corporate power – by 2000 five pesticide companies , including Monsanto , controlled over 70 % of all patents on agricultural biotechnology .
And this concentration again drives up costs .
According to Keith Mudd of the U.S. - based Organization for Competitive Markets ( OCM ) , “ The lack of competition and innovation in the marketplace has reduced farmers ’ choices and enabled Monsanto to raise prices unencumbered . ”
At a July 2008 meeting , Monsanto officials announced plans to raise the average price of some of the company 's GM maize ( corn ) varieties a whopping 35 percent , by $ 95 - 100 per bag , to top $ 300 per bag .
Fred Stokes of OCM describes the implications for farmers : “ A $ 100 price increase is a tremendous drain on rural America .
Let 's say a farmer in Iowa who farms 1,000 acres plants one of these expensive corn varieties next year .
The gross increased cost is more than $ 40,000 .
Yet there 's no scientific basis to justify this price hike .
How can we let companies get away with this ? ”
What holds good for maize , also holds good for other GM crops .
The average price for soybean seed , the largest GM crop in the US , has risen by more than 50 % in just two years from 2006 to 2008 – from $ 32.30 to $ 49.23 per planted acre .
Patenting also inhibits public sector research and further undermines the rights of farmers to save and exchange seeds .
Monsanto devotes an annual budget of 10 million dollars to harassing , intimidating , suing – and in some cases bankrupting – American farmers over alleged improper use of its patented seeds .
Recent price hikes have taken place in the context of a global food crisis marked by rapid food price inflation , which has exacerbated extreme poverty and hunger , and increased social tensions .
The World Bank attributes 75 % of this global food price inflation to “ biofuels ” , and Monsanto has been at the very heart of the “ biofuels ” lobby , particularly the lobby for corn ethanol .
Monsanto has been accused of both contributing to and benefiting from the food crisis , while simultaneously using it as a PR platform from which to promote GM crops as the solution to the crisis .
In 2008 the President of the General Assembly of the United Nations condemned corporate profiteering : “ The essential purpose of food , which is to nourish people , has been subordinated to the economic aims of a handful of multinational corporations that monopolize all aspects of food production , from seeds to major distribution chains , and they have been the prime beneficiaries of the world crisis .
A look at the figures for 2007 , when the world food crisis began , shows that corporations such as Monsanto and Cargill , which control the cereals market , saw their profits increase by 45 and 60 per cent , respectively . ”

HOUSTON , Oct 30 ( Reuters ) - U.S. safety regulators on Friday hit oil giant BP
BP.L
BP.N
with a record $ 87.4 - million fine for failing to fix safety violations at its Texas City , Texas , refinery after a deadly 2005 explosion .
In announcing the fines , U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said old and new safety violations found by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration at the nation 's third largest refinery " could lead to another catastrophe " like the 2005 explosion that killed 15 workers and injured 180 .
BP filed a contest to the fine , calling OSHA 's actions disappointing as the company believed the Texas City refinery had honored a 2005 agreement with the agency to fix safety problems that led to the blast .
BP said contesting the fine will send the dispute to a U.S. administrative law judge for a ruling .
BP also has an appeal pending before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission , an independent panel that reviews OSHA actions .
" We believe our efforts at the Texas City refinery to improve process safety performance have been among the most strenuous and comprehensive that the refining industry has ever seen , " said Texas City Refinery Manager Keith Casey in a statement .
A United Steelworkers safety official said the union , which represents Texas City refinery workers , would seek to participate in any settlement talks or hearings before the commission and judge .
" We want this settlement to be fair to company , fair to OSHA and especially fair to workers and to the community around the refinery , " said the USW 's Michael Wright .
Of the fine , $ 56.7 million was for 270 instances of failure to abate problems found in 2005 .
The remaining $ 30.7 million was for 439 new willful violations of industry process safety standards , OSHA said .
BP took multiple steps to fix problems found at Texas City in the first three years after the 2005 blast , " but later their commitment waned , " said Dean McDaniel , OSHA regional administrator .
The multiple life - threatening problems raise questions about , said a Labor Department official .
" There are some serious systemic safety problems within the corporation , specifically within this refinery as well , " said Jordan Barab , acting assistant labor secretary for OSHA .
The U.S. Chemical Safety Board said the refinery industry has problems beyond Texas City .
The board had concluded in 2007 after a two - year probe that BP suffered from a broken safety culture in which warnings of disaster were ignored in pursuit of profit .
" While OSHA reported that a potential for another catastrophic accident remains at BP Texas City , the CSB has found that safety problems continue across the U.S. refinery industry , " board Chairman John Bresland said in a statement .
In 2005 , BP paid a then - record $ 21.3 million fine to OSHA and entered into a four - year agreement with the agency .
As the agreement neared its end in September , OSHA warned the company that numerous problems remained .
" BP gets to claim they have the No. 1 and No. 2 largest fines of any industry under OSHA supervision , " said Brent Coon , attorney for victims of the BP blast .
BP has said it has invested more than $ 1 billion to repair safety problems at Texas City .
The company has paid more than $ 2 billion to settle civil lawsuits stemming from the blast .
Earlier this year , BP pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the explosion and paid a $ 50 - million fine to the U.S. Justice Department .
The company was placed on three years ' probation , a condition of which was fulfilling the agreement with OSHA .
The U.S. attorney 's office in Houston was reviewing OSHA 's action , a spokeswoman said in a statement .
" We will take all appropriate actions to ensure the plea agreement is not violated and cannot comment further at this time , " said Angela Dodge , spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney 's office .
Eva Rowe , who lost both her parents in the explosion hailed OSHA 's action .
" I think it 's fantastic OSHA is standing up to BP , " Rowe said in a statement issued by her attorney .
" I hope that this will still lead to criminal prosecution and conviction of the BP officials that were responsible . "

In ONI 's in - depth 2007 study of Internet filtering and controls in Venezuela , we declared Internet use to be " not subject to extensive content restrictions " but remarked upon concerns that the " Chávez administration could institute Internet filtering in the near future . "
It would seem that time is nigh : Following a declaration of the Internet to be a " superfluous expense " by the government , President Hugo Chávez has now branded Twitter users traitors after a Twitter campaign against the government 's crackdown on media .
The crackdown has focused primarily on television and radio , recently shutting down 34 commercial stations in favor of state - owned " community media " channels .
Critics warn that the Internet - specifically social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook could be the next targets .
A law to channel all Internet communication through servers controlled by CANTV , the state telecom , has been proposed and would severely limit freedom of expression , critics say .
The government 's actions prompted a Twitter frenzy , causing the government to make a claim that Twitter is a haven for " terrorists . "
Reporters Without Borders and Human Rights Watch have spoken out against Venezuela 's actions .

A video posted to YouTube a few weeks ago making the rounds across the internet apparently shows Fox News Channel host Glenn Beck having Vicks applied under his eyes in order to cry on cue for a photo shoot .
One blog , Sensico , mocks , " This is only shocking video to those that love Glenn Beck and think he cries non -stop because he 'loves this country .
'" The blog links to a montage of Beck crying jags put to the theme song of " The Crying Game " as sung by Boy George : YouTube link .
In April , Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert mocked one of Beck 's tear - ups , by pretending to be choked up about it : " I 'm sorry .
I just love Glenn Beck 's sanity -- and I fear for it .
" Of course , using Vicks to cry during a staged photo shot would n't be the same as using it to produce tears on television about how the country " is turning Socialist . "
So , until another tape surfaces showing Beck getting the Vicks treatment before a rant on Fox , it would be premature to speculate that he only emits fugazi tears .
But if Beck is outed as a Vicks - enabled weeper , then there are other tricks of the trade he can employ .
A wikiHOW manual offers many suggestions such as , " Make a crying face , which usually involves closing your eyes and scrunching your face . " " Turn the corners of your lips down a little , " the manual advises .
" Try to force the inner corners of your eyebrows upwards .
Wrinkle up your chin like people do right before they start bawling .
" However , the manual notes , " This may look faked . "
So , another suggestion is to " try pinching hard in some sensitive parts of your body , " and " tears will automatically flow down . "
( CNN ) --
With motor fluid spraying their faces and the weight of a car numbing their bodies , two Nevada college students struggled to stay calm after a drunk driver allegedly tore into their home , ripping them from their slumber .
Kristin Palmer and Trent Wood were asleep in their home last week when a motorist allegedly drove into their bedroom around 4 a.m. , mistakenly believing it was his ex-girlfriend 's home .
The University of Nevada students spent almost an hour pinned between the car and their bed while emergency workers battled furiously to free them .
Somehow , the two left the scene with relatively minor scrapes and burns -- and a new lease on life , Wood said .
" When you experience something like that there 's no limits anymore , you can try to do whatever you want to do , " Wood told HLN 's Mike Galanos .
" We feel like we have more of a purpose , like we were meant to live . "
Authorities say the motorist was drunk when he drove into the couple 's home in Sparks , mistakenly believing it was the home of his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend .
Eric Cross is accused of drunken driving , battery with a deadly weapon , possession of a stolen vehicle , driving without a license and careless driving for his alleged role in the crash , which occurred October 21 , according to the Washoe County Sheriff 's Office .
Initially , Woods struggled to comprehend what had happened to him after being abruptly torn from his slumber .
" I thought the roof caved in from an earthquake because it's an old house , " Woods said .
Then , his girlfriend began screaming and parts of the car came into focus , helping Woods to groggily piece the scene together ,
" I could see the tire to the right side and I was like , there 's a car on top of me right now , " he said .
" That was really hard to get through my head . "
As fluid poured from the car , burning Palmer 's face , the couple feared that the car might explode with them underneath , he said .
Woods credited the slackness of the bed for preventing their legs from breaking altogether as the weight of the car pinned his girlfriend 's entire body and his lower half to the bed .
" She was screaming really badly because I could actually move above my chest and neck , but she could n't move anything , " he said .
The couple calmed down somewhat after emergency workers arrived at the scene , using chainsaws to rip through the wall , Wood said .
About 42 minutes later , they had lifted the car enough to let the couple wiggle out from underneath it without it crushing their lower bodies .
" When the car was lifted and you could see blood circulating back through my legs , that was probably the happiest moment of my life : Yes !
I 'm not paralyzed , " he said .
" I was so happy , hugging everyone and making sure Kristin was all right , " he said .
" I was just real happy to get out of there . "

About 98 % of Aceh 's population is thought to be Muslim Indonesia 's province of Aceh has passed a new law making adultery punishable by stoning to death , a member of the province 's parliament has said .
The law also imposes severe sentences for rape , homosexuality , alcohol consumption and gambling .
Opponents had tried to delay the law , saying more debate was needed because it imposes capital punishment .
Sharia law was partially introduced in Aceh in 2001 , as part of a government offer to pacify separatist rebels .
A peace deal in 2005 ended the 30 - year insurgency , and many of the former rebels have now entered Aceh 's government , which enjoys a degree of autonomy from the central government in Jakarta .
It needs more public consultation .
We need to involve the ulemas - the Islamic clerics - in drafting the law
Adnan Beuransah , Aceh Party
The legislation was passed unanimously by Aceh 's regional legislature , said assembly member Bahrom Rasjid .
" This law will be effective in 30 days with or without the approval of Aceh 's governor , " he said .
The governor of Aceh , a former rebel with the Free Aceh Movement , is opposed to strict Sharia law .
He had urged more debate over the bill .
' Moral degradation ' Married people convicted of adultery can be sentenced to death by stoning .
Unmarried people can be sentenced to 100 lashes with a cane .
Muslim men in Aceh are expected to attend prayers every day Previously , Aceh 's partially - adopted Sharia law enforced Muslim dress codes and mandatory prayers .
" This law is a preventive measure for Acehnese people so that they will avoid moral degradation , " said Moharriyadia , a spokesman for the Prosperous Justice Party .
A new parliament will be sworn in next month , after local polls saw the moderate Aceh Party win the most seats in the provincial assembly .
The Aceh Party has said it will review the law once the new parliament is sitting .
" It needs more public consultation .
We need to involve the ulemas - the Islamic clerics - in drafting the law , " said Adnan Beuransah , a spokesperson for the Aceh Party .
About 90 % of Indonesia 's 235 million people are Muslim , practising a moderate form of the religion .

Queen Rosalie Gicanda ( L ) was revered by many Tutsis One of the most wanted suspects in Rwanda 's 1994 genocide has been arrested in Uganda .
Idelphonse Nizeyimana was an intelligence chief at the time of the genocide , in which about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed .
He has been extradited to Tanzania for trial at a UN - backed tribunal , accused of organising the killing of thousands - including the former Tutsi queen .
Rwanda welcomed the arrest but said he should be tried in his country .
" There is no time limit for justice , whether it comes fast or slow it is something we want to see , " said Augustine Nkusi , a spokesman for the prosecutor - general .
RWANDA GENOCIDE 6 April 1994 President Juvenal Habyarimana dies when plane shot down April - July Estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus killed July Tutsi-led rebels capture Kigali July Two million Hutus flee , sparking years of regional unrest
Profile : Idelphonse Nizeyimana Audio slideshow : 100 days Rwanda 's ghosts refuse to be buried " Fifteen years is very little compared to what was committed in Rwanda .
There are many victims who have not yet forgotten , who have not yet received justice . "
Mr Nizeyimana , an army captain , was head of intelligence and military operations at Rwanda 's elite military training school , the ESO , during the genocide .
The lengthy indictment says he elaborated , adhered to and executed a plan to wipe out the Tutsis - the minority in a country ruled by a Hutu government for more than three decades .
He is accused of setting up special military units to help carry out the slaughter .
One of these units is believed to have killed Queen Rosalie Gicanda , widow of King Mutara III who died in 1959 shortly before the country became a republic .

According to a 1999 report by US - based Human Rights Watch , Hutu soldiers took the queen from her home in the south - eastern town of Butare and shot her behind the national museum .
They also murdered several women who looked after the queen , who was about 80 years old when she died .
Another charge against Mr Nizeyimana is that he ordered the establishment of roadblocks at which Tutsis were captured before being murdered .
And troops said to have been under his command rampaged through the University of Butare , killing lecturers and students in what was seen as an attempt to wipe out the Tutsi intelligentsia .
Falso documents
Like an estimated two million Rwandan Hutus , Mr Nizeyimana fled after the genocide and took refuge in neighbouring DR Congo .
Idelphonse Nizeyimana allegedly helped draw up death lists
Officials believe that there he was active in a pro-Hutu rebel army called Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda ( FDLR ) .
The BBC's Geoffrey Mutogoma in Kigali says it is believed he rose to the rank of colonel in the FDLR and Rwandan officials hope his arrest will disrupt its activities .
He was arrested in a modest hotel in the Ugandan capital , Kampala .
Ugandan police said he had crossed the border from DR Congo last week , and was heading for Kenya with false travel documents .
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , based in Arusha , Tanzania , said he would appear before the judges in the coming days .
The tribunal , which is due to finish its work by the end of next year , says it is still trying to find 11 fugitives .
So far 40 people have been convicted of crimes connected with the genocide .

Dr. Wittner is Professor of History at the State University of New York / Albany .
His latest book is Confronting the Bomb : A Short History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement ( Stanford University Press ) .
Addressing a U.N. Security Council Summit on September 24 , 2009 , President Barack Obama observed that the resolution unanimously adopted by the Security Council earlier that day " enshrines our shared commitment to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons . "
But the enthusiasm for this measure among the representatives of major nations should not obscure the fact that securing their commitment to a nuclear - free world was for years an uphill struggle — one that began , with some political sleight - of - hand , in a nuclear superpower , the Soviet Union .
Of course , for the first four decades of the Cold War , the Soviet government had spoken glibly about abolishing nuclear weapons .
But it was never serious about this enterprise .
Such talk was meant for propaganda purposes — to convince people of other nations that the Soviet Union was a peace - loving nation with their best interests at heart .
In practical terms , about the most that could be hoped for from the Kremlin was a series of rather modest arms control agreements .
But , then , in March 1985 , Mikhail Gorbachev was elected Soviet party secretary .
And Gorbachev was dead serious about nuclear disarmament .
Faced with the " self - destruction of the human race , " he declared , it was time to " burn the black book of nuclear alchemy " and make the next century one " of life without fear of universal death . "
The " nuclear era requires new thinking from everybody , " he argued and " the backbone of the new way of thinking is . . . humankind 's survival . "
Gorbachev 's ideas and rhetoric clearly came from the tumultuous popular campaign against nuclear weapons that swept around the world during the early 1980s .
As the Soviet leader put it : " The new thinking took into account and absorbed the conclusions and demands . . . of the public and the scientific community , of the movements of physicians , scientists and ecologists , and of various antiwar organizations . "
Gorbachev not only changed Soviet rhetoric , but Soviet policy .
Shortly after taking office , he appointed sharp critics of the nuclear arms race as his key advisors on foreign and military affairs .
In April 1985 , he announced the cessation of the controversial SS - 20 nuclear missile deployments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe .
That July , he proclaimed a unilateral Soviet moratorium on nuclear testing and implored the U.S. government to join it .
And by early 1986 , the " new thinking " had produced a Soviet blueprint for a nuclear - free world .
Announced by Gorbachev on January 15 of that year , it consisted of a three - stage plan to eliminate all nuclear weapons around the globe by the year 2000 .
Gorbachev recalled that it was not " another Soviet propaganda trick , " but a sincere effort to prevent nuclear war and create a peaceful world .
But how did Gorbachev manage to secure the acquiescence of Soviet hawks in this official commitment to a nuclear - free world ?
It 's an intriguing story .
In the spring of 1985 , Soviet military officials were worried that Gorbachev and his advisors were getting ready to offer serious concessions to the U.S. government in negotiations over the removal of intermediate range nuclear missiles from Europe .
To head off such concessions , they suggested what they considered would a good combination of useful propaganda and a non-negotiable proposal : a nuclear - free world !
Nikolai Detinov , an official in the Soviet Ministry of Defense who drafted the nuclear abolition proposal , recalled : " They could show , on the one hand , that the Soviet Union and its General Secretary were eager to eliminate nuclear weapons and , on the other . . . that they understood that such a declaration hardly could lead to any practical results . . . or affect . . . the ongoing negotiations . "
But Gorbachev outsmarted them , for he used the military 's backing of nuclear abolition to legitimize the proposal and , then , to make it official government policy .
Thus , Detinov recalled , " the real authors of this idea became entrapped by their own gambit . "
Things now moved rapidly forward .
Sensitive to the strong public demand for nuclear disarmament , President Ronald Reagan responded eagerly to Gorbachev 's nuclear - free world proposal , asking : " Why wait until the end of the century for a world without nuclear weapons ? "
Although most national security officials in Washington and Moscow were horrified by the unexpected tilt toward nuclear abolition , Gorbachev and Reagan were considerably more enthusiastic .
At the Reykjavik summit conference of October 1986 , they came tantalizingly near a breakthrough on this score .
And in the next two years , they did hammer out the basis for major nuclear disarmament agreements : the INF Treaty ( 1987 ) ; the START I Treaty ( 1991 ) ; and the START II Treaty ( 1993 ) .
Today , when the call for a nuclear - free world has been revived by the nuclear powers , skeptics might wonder if it is merely another propaganda ploy .
Are the warriors and would - be warriors ready to forgo their nuclear toys ?
Probably not .
But clever politicians , particularly when pushed along by popular pressure , can sometimes use public commitments in unexpected ways .
And this might be such a time .
A motorist who was filmed drenching children at a bus stop by going through a puddle could face prosecution , police said today .
Kerry Callard 's driving in Plymouth , Devon came to the attention of officers after a 30 - second movie clip was posted on YouTube .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The footage from inside the car captures the drive down Weston Mill Hill and through the large puddle where the group are waiting .
Police said the 29 - year - old had contacted them voluntarily about the incident last Thursday and the evidence was now being reviewed .
A male voice is heard commenting on the clip saying : " Here we go , ready to drench the kids .. " and later " That was Brilliant !
Awesome ! " .
Although the extract has been removed from YouTube there are several other so - called " happy splashing " videos on the internet .
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said today : " We had three complaints from members of the public and as a result a 29 - year - old woman was interviewed .
The file has gone to the CPS for consideration . "
Charges of careless or even dangerous driving could be brought for this type of offence , the force said .
The spokesman added : " Although driving through standing water may be seen as a bit of fun , potentially it is very dangerous .

" Not only is it showing no consideration to the pedestrians who may get a soaking , but it could result in the driver losing control of the vehicle due to the force of the water snatching the wheel from the hands , or by the vehicle aquaplaning . "
Callard has claimed the children asked to be splashed and would not have done it otherwise .
She told the Daily Mail : " The fun factor is mostly gone from life these days but they were playing in puddles , like kids always have done .
" If the kids were n't saying ' Splash me , splash me ' , I certainly would n't have done it .
I 'm not a serial splasher . "
The force said the children 's possible agreement to the stunt would make no difference to how the standard of driving was judged .
A motorist from Somerset who soaked a workman by driving through a puddle was prosecuted in 2005 .
He was fined £ 150 and given three penalty points by magistrates in Yeovil after he admitted driving without due consideration .
It should come as no surprise that the economic production of each state is not evenly divided .
There are many variables including population , industrial base , and regional specialties .
With this deep recession it is important to get an understanding of how things are divided in the United States .
It is easy to get into the mode of thinking everything is evenly divided or the recession is being felt equally across state lines .
It is not .
Some states like California had historical housing bubbles that saw real estate prices in some areas triple in 10 years only to come crashing down .
Other areas like Texas had minor real estate appreciation .
In the United States 10 states make up 55 percent of all GDP .
The U.S. in 2008 had a GDP of $ 14.16 trillion and these states produced $ 7.89 trillion of that amount .
Let us take a look at how this breaks down :
When we start narrowing down the big economic states , we can also look at their local dynamics to get a better understanding of why this recession has made it so difficult for jobs to be created .
In fact , we have yet to see a month of positive job growth since the recession started back in December of 2007 .
The national official unemployment rate is 9.8 percent .
Out of the top 10 states , 6 have unemployment rates over 10 percent :
Think of the local dynamics of a few of these states .
California and Florida had enormous housing bubbles and the repercussion of a bursting bubble are still being dealt with .
These states are still losing jobs since a large part of their industries revolved around the housing market .
New York and New Jersey have big industries around the financial industry .
Now that the stock market has recovered , certain institutions are taking in gigantic profits since some of their competitors collapsed while the government selectively decided to bailout a few chosen .
But still , employment in these sectors do not come close to rivaling the peak of what we saw earlier in the decade .
The above data is important to focus on because these are the states that make up the bulk of GDP .
With rampant state budget deficits many of these states are cutting spending but also raising taxes .
Unlike the federal government that has access to the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve , states need to contend with balanced budgets .
These states are grappling with these problems so their GDP surely in 2009 will be lower than what was shown in 2008 .
If tax collections are any sign , the contraction will be rather severe .
If you boil the data down further , the top 5 states make up 40 percent of GDP .
In a way , this is similar to the too big to fail banks .
Sure , the U.S. has some 8,000 + banks that are insured by the FDIC but approximately 100 hold over 70 percent of all assets .
If there are problems in these big states , will smaller states carry the slack in GDP ?
Many of the smaller states are also contending with higher unemployment .
The economy is interconnected and many of these states export goods to higher populated regions .
If people stop spending and buying these goods , it will also hurt them .
Ask GM or Chrysler what happens when people stop buying your goods .
Looking at the list of the top 10 and four of the states had economies that benefited enormously by the housing bubble ; California , New York , Florida , and New Jersey .
Other states also saw benefits from the housing bubble but nothing to the level of these states .
You would have to look at Nevada and Arizona but these two states do not make it to the list .
So why look at these states ?
These are indicators of economic growth .
If these states can show that they can grow without the housing bubble , then we might begin seeing a recovery .
But instead , the government and Wall Street have decided to revive ( or try ) the housing bubble .
Giving away an $ 8,000 tax credit to potential home buyers , the Federal Reserve buying over a trillion in mortgage backed securities to keep interest rates low , and allowing banks to keep toxic assets hidden for as long as they like .
That is effectively the strategy .
The hope is that somehow , people go back to spending all their money on housing and cars again .
I ’m not sure if that is going to happen because job growth is now nowhere to be found .
What did happen for their trust in a banking sector that largely led us into this crisis is that more and more money is now concentrated in fewer and fewer hands .
If anything the government is looking more and more like a kleptocracy .
27 million unemployed and underemployed are wondering where that $ 13 trillion in bailouts and backstops has gone ?
Clearly it has n’t gone to create jobs .

The French Football Federation ( FFF ) has heeded the words of head coach Raymond Domenech and ensured it will be as difficult as possible for Republic of Ireland fans to get more than their official allocation of tickets for the second leg of the World Cup play - offs at Stade de France .
The travelling contingent is entitled to at least 10 per cent of the stadium ’s capacity of 81,338 , but unlike 2004 when about 25,000 Irish fans piled into the Saint - Denis venue , additional tickets will not be on sale on the internet .
Instead , they have been given the minimum permitted , according to the FFF , or 8,500 , according to the FAI 's chief executive John Delaney today .
Either way , on November 18th , the numbers are likely to be significantly down on the previous meeting between the two teams in Paris , when Ireland drew 0 - 0 with Domenech ’s side during the qualifying campaign for Euro 2006 .
The allocation , insists the FFF , is in line with other World Cup qualifiers that have taken place at the stadium in this campaign .
The French will also get their 10 per cent for the first leg at Croke Park on November 14th , meaning , if they sell all the tickets , nearly 7,500 travelling fans will be catered for on Hill 16 and in section 301 of the Cusack Stand .
That match was today confirmed to be an 8 pm kick - off , while the Saint - Denis fixture will be at either 8 or 9 pm .
Meanwhile , Coventry City 's Leon Best has emerged as an injury worry for the games .
The striker limped out of last nights defeat at Cardiff with a knee injury and left the stadium on crutches .
His club are waiting to discover the full extent of the injury with a scan scheduled for tomorrow but manager Chris Coleman admitted the initial prognosis was not encouraging .
“ We are not sure how long he is going to be out for , ” said Coleman .
“ His knee has swollen up badly and we wo n’t be banking on him returning soon .
He ’s a tough kid but it does n’t look too good .
It ’s a real worry . ”
Best has yet to break his international duck but has won five caps under Giovanni Trapattoni , the most recent coming in the final qualifier against Montenegro .
In his From the Editor blog post last week , Sambit Bal raised the issue of batting averages being devalued in the 21st century .
The example was that of Thilan Samaraweera , who averages 51.87 after 54 Tests , but the point was a more generic one : after the exits of Walsh and Ambrose , Wasim and Waqar , Donald and Pollock , McGrath and Gillespie , life has become much easier for batsmen around the world .
Some of those bowlers played well into the 2000s , but with pitches easing up and other weaker teams coming into the fray , this decade has generally been an excellent one for batting .
Once upon a time , an average of 50 used to be the benchmark of batting excellence ; now , it seems , that 's no longer true .
The tables below examine the batting averages of the specialists ( Nos. 1 to 7 in the line - up ) by decade , starting from the 1930s .
It 's clear from the numbers that the current decade has been a prolific one for batting , with an average of 38.22 runs per wicket .
Only in the 1940s were the averages higher .
The 1990s , on the other hand , was among the worst decades for batting - the average of 35.34 was the second - worst in the last eight decades .
In the 2000s there has been a century scored every 12.25 innings by a top - order batsman ( 892 hundreds in 10,927 innings ) , a rate that has been bettered , again , only in the 1940s .
In the 1990s only 537 hundreds were scored in 8264 innings , a 25 % drop on the conversion - rate in the current decade .
Batting averages of the top seven batsmen by decade Decade Tests Runs Average 100s / 50s Inngs per 100 1930s 89 71,474 37.38 158/ 324 13.12 1940s 45 39,444 41.13 103/ 178 10.20 1950s 164 118,135 32.42 229/ 551 17.09 1960s 186 153,494 36.36 290/ 802 15.74 1970s 198 163,518 36.72 357/ 805 13.50 1980s 266 201,672 35.86 434/ 965 14.15 1990s 347 268,662 35.34 537/ 1376 15.39 2000s 452 385,326 38.22 892/ 1801 12.25
Do the numbers change significantly if Bangladesh and Zimbabwe are removed from the mix ?
It turns out that the average runs per wicket increases marginally - from 38.22 to 38.95 - if they are .
This suggests that the poor scores by the batsmen of these teams generally more than compensates for the high scores of the opposition ( and it also matters that the opposition often play one innings in a match while these teams play two ) .
However , the average increases to 40.35 when considering batsmen from only the top eight teams , against all opposition ( including Bangladesh and Zimbabwe ) .
That 's obviously due to the number of runs batsmen helped themselves to against the weak attacks of these two teams .
Top seven batsmen in the 2000s Tests Runs Average 100s / 50s Inngs per 100 Top eight teams against each other 354 312,265 38.95 735/ 1474 11.82
Top eight teams against all opposition 444 351,668 40.35 859 / 1631 11.06
And now for a quiz question : what 's common to the following batsmen - Andy Flower , Mohammad Yousuf , Ricky Ponting , Jacques Kallis , Kumar Sangakkara , Inzamam - ul - Haq , Mahela Jayawardene , Brian Lara , Hashan Tillakaratne , Gautam Gambhir , Rahul Dravid , Graham Thorpe , Steve Waugh , Shivnarine Chanderpaul , Matthew Hayden , Sachin Tendulkar , Michael Hussey , Thilan Samaraweera , Graeme Smith , Younis Khan and Virender Sehwag ?
Answer : they 're all batsmen who 've played at least 30 innings in this decade and have a Test average of more than 50 during this period .
Count the names and you 'll realise there are 21 - more than there are on the ICC 's longlist for their 2009 awards .
In all , 114 batsmen have batted more than 30 innings in the top seven during this decade , which means more than 18 % of all specialist batsmen have averaged more than 50 during this period .
It 's an incredibly high number ( do they all merit the " great " tag being thrust upon them ? ) , especially when compared to the decade immediately before : in the 1990s only five out of 94 batsmen achieved this feat .
If you want to test yourself , you could take a moment , try and guess those five names , and then click here to check how many you got right .
I 'll bet you did n't get all five .
Decade - wise stats for batsmen in top seven ( Qual : 30 innings in top 7 in the decade ) Decade Tot. no. of batsmen Average >= 50 Percentage 2000s 114 21 18.42 1990s 94 5 5.32 1980s 69 5 7.25 1970s 55 6 10.91 1960s 51 7 13.73 1950s 44 5 11.36
And a quick check on what those numbers for this decade look like if Zimbabwe and Bangladesh are excluded from the list .
The change , it turns out , is minimal : with the same cut - off , 19 out of 105 batsmen have averaged more than 50 during this decade , a percentage of 18.10 .
Fifty - plus averages since 2000 ( Qual : 30 innings in the top seven ) Opposition Tot. no.of batsmen Average > =50 Percentage All opposition 114 21 18.42 Excl.

And before looking at the batsmen who 've cashed in in the 2000s , here 's a quick glance at the highly rated ones who fell short of the magical 50 - mark in the 1990s .
Among the big names who did n't make the cut are Dravid , Ponting , Allan Border , Inzamam and Kallis .
Some of them were in the initial stages of the career - Ponting , Dravid and Kallis had all played less than 45 Tests at the time - and blossomed into consistent run-machines only in this decade .
Inzamam had played 58 Tests , but his time would come later .
Dravid fell just two runs short of averaging 50 , while his middle - order mate Sourav Ganguly missed out by a whisker too , averaging 49.63 .
Dravid does average more than 50 in the 2000s , but only when you take into account his averages against Bangladesh ( 70.16 in five Tests ) and Zimbabwe ( 102.12 in eight ) .
Exclude those games and his average in this decade drops to 49.90 .
Given all his achievements , especially in match - winning causes overseas , it would be a harsh call not to include him among the greats , though - only 13 more runs against the top eight teams would have lifted his average from 49.90 to 50 .
Dravid is one of five batsmen whose average in this decade drops to below 50 when excluding games against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe .
Samaraweera is another - he averages 46.98 against the other teams , and so too are Tendulkar and Steve Waugh .
Tendulkar has averaged 46.73 against the top eight teams , but an average of 139 in five Tests against Bangladesh and 101.87 in six against Zimbabwe pushes his overall average for the decade up to 52.91 .
Similarly , Waugh 's average of 47.64 against the top eight converts into an overall decade average of 53.30 , thanks to his record against Bangladesh ( 256 runs without being dismissed ) and Zimbabwe ( average of 69.50 in two Tests ) .
On the other hand , there are three batsmen - Justin Langer , VVS Laxman and Michael Clarke - whose averages go up from sub -50 to 50 - plus when excluding performances against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe .
Langer averaged 36 against Bangladesh and 12 against Zimbabwe , while the corresponding numbers for Laxman are 20.50 and 40 , while Clarke has averaged 25.50 in two Tests against Bangladesh ( he has n't played Zimbabwe yet ) .
Kevin Pietersen is one of the few top names who misses out on a 50 - plus average for the decade so far - he averages 49.96 , three runs short of the 50 mark .
“ They probably get an ‘ A ’ from the standpoint of their success on their major initiatives , ” said Fred Downey , a former Senate aide who is now vice president for national security at the Aerospace Industries Association .
“ They probably got all of them but one or maybe two , and that ’s an extraordinarily high score . ”

Still , Mr. Obama said at Wednesday ’s signing ceremony , there is “ more waste we need to cut . ”
The act authorizes $ 550 billion for the Pentagon ’s base budget in fiscal 2010 and $ 130 billion more for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That compares to a total of $ 654 billion for both accounts in fiscal 2009 .
The measure also includes a ban on hate crimes that Democratic leaders attached to the bill .
Mr. Obama has said that he does not intend to reduce military spending while the nation is engaged in two wars .
But Mr. Gates also wants to cut more futuristic programs to free money for simpler systems like helicopters and unmanned spy planes that can help the troops now .
Winslow T. Wheeler , a military analyst at the Center for Defense Information , a Washington analytical organization , said another key to Mr. Gates ’s success was regaining control of the budget from the armed services .
But the administration has had to make some compromises , and some issues remain to be decided in a separate spending bill .
Mr. Obama had wanted to cancel an alternate engine for the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , a new plane that is expected to be a mainstay for the Air Force , the Navy and the Marines .
He had also threatened to veto the military bills if they took money from plane purchases to keep developing that engine .
But Congressional leaders say they believe that the second engine will provide crucial insurance for the $ 300 billion fighter program .
And they say they will take money from other parts of the military budget to save it .
very declaration of an enum type must be a complete definition containing a full list of its enumerators .
However , in some use cases declaring an enumeration without providing the enumerators list is desirable .
For example , you may use a forward declaration like this ...
enum class Direction ;
... instead of repeating the complete definition ( see below ) in every translation unit .
enum class Direction : short { Up , Down} ;
A year ago , the C++ standards committee voted into the Working Draft a proposal to add forward declarations of enum types .
This 10 - Minute Solution shows how to use forward declarations of enum types to expedite compilation time and reduce code dependencies .
Your project has an enum type containing hundreds of machine - generated enumerators that change frequently .
You must provide a complete definition of that enum in every translation unit , even if the compiler seemingly does n't need the complete definition of the enum .
Replace complete definitions of enum types with forward enum declarations where possible .

In jelly , the fruit comes in the form of fruit juice .
Jelly has the smoothest consistency and is usually clear .
In jam , the fruit comes in the form of fruit pulp or crushed fruit .
This makes jam less stiff than jelly .
In preserves , the fruit comes in the form of chunks in a gel or syrup .
Preserves will have more fruit in them than jam will .
Marmalade is a type of preserve with citrus fruits in it .
Jell - O is entirely different .
It is made from gelatin , which is a protein made from animal skins and bones .
Jell - O will have artificial colorings and flavorings but no fruit , unless you add it yourself when you make it .
Which spread should you use ?
That depends on what you 're trying to do .
For sandwiches , jelly or jam is preferred as they spread easier .
For recipes , preserves would deliver more fruit flavor , though jam could also be used .
First it was violence , then bulging wastelines , now video games are being blamed for falling vehicle sales in Japan , at least by one unnamed Toyota exec .
The argument ?
Games are so good lately there 's no interest in buying actual cars .

The translated quote goes something like this :
Home game machines are no good .
Playing something that realistic makes the need for cars disappear .

It 's a bit of a leap if you ask us , but something has to be responsible for falling sales , right ?
Could just be the combination of cars being wildly expensive to own and of limited utility in Japans crowded urban centers , but video games are probable just as likely a culprit .
While the statement is something of a blind item , it does provide a peak into the growing societal issues plaguing modern Japan .
Young men are forgoing family life in favor of extended bachelorhood , meaning enjoying video games and other hobbies seen as undignified perversions by the elder generation .
Heck , video games could just be the downfall of Japan , but killing car sales is a good start .

I therefore present some of the most devastating video you 'll ever see , as Sen . Al Franken ( DFL - MN ) grills an attorney representing Halliburton / KBR after the vote on his amendment .
Presented without further comment ( for now ) :
Update : Please DIGG THIS UP .
EVERYONE should watch this , especially those who are attempting to defend the 30 GOP " No " votes .
Update x2 : To expand on the diary somewhat , while it may be blatantly obvious to most of us here , there are those who have been trying to defend the " No " votes .
In case anyone asks about what possible justification there might have been for voting against this amendment , there are only two :
If the amendment was attached to some totally unrelated larger bill which you were against , and , and the only way to vote against the bill as a whole was to vote against this amendment ( which happens in many cases ) .
if the wording of the bill was too vague or open to massive abuse ( the " unintended consequences " issue ) .
HOWEVER , in this case , you could vote for the amendment and still vote against the main bill ( which is actually a DoD spending bill anyway , not the sort of thing Republicans are going to be against as a rule ) , and the actual , full text of the amendment is VERY specific and narrow ( bottom right of page S10069 ) :
Sec. 8104 . ( a ) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be used for any existing or new Federal contract if the contractor or a subcontractor at any tier requires that an employee or independent contractor , as a condition of employment , sign a contract that mandates that the employee or independent contractor performing work under the contract or subcontract resolve through arbitration any claim under title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of sexual assault or harassment , including assault and battery , intentional infliction of emotional distress , false imprisonment , or negligent hiring , supervision , or retention .
In other words , it specifically covers :
-- Violations of core civil rights
-- Rape
-- Assault
-- Torture
-- Kidnapping
-- Knowingly ( or being criminally negligent about ) hiring sick , sadistic , twisted rapist / murderer types
These are all criminal actions which have absolutely NO business being dealt with via arbitration , which is intended for disputes over intellectual property , compensation , nondisclosure of corporate secrets , that sort of thing .
In addition , this amendment does n't force the companies abandon contracts with these provisions -- it simply says that the Federal Government of the United States refuses to do businesses with those businesses that continue to do so .
Halliburton is still free to do business with other corporations if they wish ; they just lost their single biggest client , that 's all .
In this particular case , there are exactly zero legitimate reasons to vote against it .
Christ , they could have at least abstained or something ( for the record , 2 Democrats did n't vote at all due to illness or scheduling conflicts ) .

CITATION : R. v. L.L. , 2009 ONCA 413 DATE : 20090520 DOCKET : C46162 COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO Rosenberg , Feldman and Simmons JJ.A. BETWEEN Her Majesty The Queen Respondent and L.L. Appellant Christopher Hicks and Catriona Verner , for the appellant James K. Stewart , for the respondent Heard : November 20 , 2008 On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice J. Riopelle of the Superior Court of Justice , sitting with a jury , on September 8 , 2006 .
Simmons J.A. :
I. Overview
[ 1 ] Following a jury trial , the appellant was convicted of committing incest against his developmentally challenged daughter .
[ 2 ]
The complainant was 27 years old at the time of trial but had the intellectual capacity of a thirteen - year - old .
She testified that the appellant began having intercourse with her when she was eighteen years old and continued to do so until she moved out of the family home when she was 25 .
The complainant said the assaults happened “ about four or five times for five days out of seven ” and estimated that they occurred “ almost 2,000 times in a year . ”
[ 3 ]
In addition to calling the complainant as a witness , the Crown played a videotaped statement taken from the appellant by the police on May 20 , 2005 .
The appellant denied the complainant 's allegations .
However , the Crown relied on portions of the appellant 's statement as supporting aspects of the complainant 's testimony and used the videotaped statement for the purposes of cross-examination .
[ 4 ]
The appellant , his wife and their son , testified for the defence .
The appellant again denied the complainant 's allegations .
The appellant 's wife and son both indicated that although the appellant was alone with the complainant much of the time , neither had observed anything untoward in the relationship
[ 5 ]
The appellant raises two main issues on his conviction appeal :
i ) Did the trial judge err in dealing with issues relating to whether the complainant had a motive to fabricate ?
ii ) Did the Crown engage in misconduct that created a miscarriage of justice ?
[ 6 ]
For the reasons that follow , I would allow the appeal , set aside the appellant ’s conviction and order a new trial .
II .
Analysis
1 . Did the trial judge err in dealing with issues relating to whether the complainant had a motive to fabricate ?
[ 7 ]
The appellant submits that the trial judge made two errors in dealing with issues relating to the whether the complainant had a motive to fabricate .
First , he failed to edit the appellant ’s statement to exclude questions inviting an explanation concerning why the complainant would fabricate her allegations .
Second , he erred in his instructions to the jury by failing to correct misleading statements made by the Crown concerning the complainant ’s motive to fabricate and by failing to caution the jury against attributing undue weight to the absence of evidence that the complainant had a motive to fabricate .
[ 8 ] I will deal with these issues in turn .
a) Did the trial judge err by failing to edit the appellant 's statement ?
[ 9 ]
During his videotaped statement to the police , the appellant was asked on two occasions why the complainant would be making the allegations :
Detective : Okay .
The allegations are that you sexually abused her from the time of 18 years old .
What do you have to say about that ?
Accused :
It never happened .
Detective : Okay .
Why would she be saying this ?
Accused : Your guess is as good as mine .
She has been in and out , in problems with boys .
We have crashed down on her hard a few times about her boys ' situations .
And she has been screaming and yelling in the past ... for five or six years , wanting a baby and that .
And we go months , talking with her about that , and responsibilities .
And then she would say , okay ... and then two months later , she would be right back at it again .
She has gotten into all ( inaudible ) boys .
We have restricted her movements with them boys .
And she rebelled against us and ( inaudible ) .
It could be all that .
I have no idea .
Detective :
So you have no idea why she is making these claims ?
Accused : No .
Detective :
And you are telling me that they are totally false ?
Accused :
At home there , she leaves no indications of any problems between me and her .
...
Detective :
Why would she be saying this stuff ?
Accused :
And your guess is as good as mine .
[ 10 ]
After ruling that the appellant 's videotaped statement to the police was voluntary , the trial judge raised an issue concerning the propriety of the police officer 's questions to the appellant about why the complainant would be making the allegations .
Defence counsel at trial ( not Mr. Hicks ) , observed that the challenged portions of the statement might actually be helpful to the appellant because the appellant 's answers would likely answer a question that would be in the mind of the jury .
Nonetheless , defence counsel submitted that the challenged questions and answers should be edited from the statement because an accused person has no obligation to explain why a complainant might fabricate allegations and because the questions invited the appellant to state an opinion about the complainant 's state of mind .
[ 11 ]
The trial Crown ( not Mr. Stewart ) , submitted that it is neither customary nor correct to edit this form of questioning from police statements because an accused ’s out - of - court statements explaining why a complainant might lie are properly admissible .
[ 12 ]
The trial judge decided not to edit these portions of the appellant ’s statement but indicated he would provide the jury with special instructions concerning their use .
Immediately before the videotaped statement was played for the jury , the trial judge gave the jury the following instructions :
You will recall that at the opening of the trial this morning I said to you : " There is absolutely , under our system of law , no obligation on Mr. L. to testify and to produce any witnesses or to produce any exhibits . "
The responsibility here rests with the Crown to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt .
And that means several things but one of the things is , he does not have to testify .
...
During the course of [ the police ] investigation , there were , on two occasions a specific question asked by the police officer of Mr. L. , a question which could not have been asked of Mr. L. had he been in court .
So when you listen to that question , remember , as I have indicated to you on several occasions already , he does not have to prove anything , he does not have to supply any evidence .
The responsibility is always with the Crown .
The particular question has something to do with : “ Why would your daughter make up these allegations ?
And why would she say these things about you ? ”
And that invites from him a response .
That invites from him an explanation .
It puts him on the defensive .
He has to come up with some reasonable explanation .
At law , there is no obligation on him to do that .
[ 13 ]
I agree that the impugned questions and answers should not have been placed before the jury .
However , in light of the clear and contemporaneous instructions given by the trial judge , I am satisfied that no prejudice arose in this case from the failure to edit this portion of the appellant ’s statement .
[ 14 ]
Questions in cross-examination that ask an accused person to explain why a complainant would fabricate his or her allegations are improper for two reasons .
[ 15 ]
First , as a general matter , it is improper to invite one witness to comment on the veracity of another : R. v. Brown ( 1982 ) , 1982 ABCA 292 ( CanLII ) , 1 C.C.C. ( 3d ) 107 ( Alta. C.A. ) affirmed 1985 CanLII 3 ( SCC ) , [ 1985 ] 2 S.C.R. 273 .
This principle has particular application to an accuser and the accused .
As noted by Charron J.A. in R. v. Rose , ( 2001 ) , 2001 CanLII 24079 ( ON CA ) , 53 O.R. ( 3d ) 417 ( C.A. ) at para .
27 , this court “ has held repeatedly that it is improper to call upon an accused to comment on the credibility of his accusers ” .
[ 16 ]
Second , questions of this type create a risk of shifting the burden of proof because they may mislead the trier of fact into focussing on whether the accused can provide an explanation for the complainant ’s allegations instead of focussing on the central issue of whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the allegations are true : R. v. S. ( W. ) ( 1994 ) , 1994 CanLII 7208 ( ON CA ) , 18 O.R. ( 3d ) 509 ( C.A. ) , leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused , [ 1994 ] S.C.C.A. No. 290 . ; R. v. Ellard ( 2003 ) , 2003 BCCA 68 ( CanLII ) , 172 C.C.C. ( 3rd ) 28 ( B.C.C.A. ) .
As this court said in R. v. F. ( C. ) , [ 1996 ] CanLII 623 ( Ont. C.A. ) , such questions create a risk that the jury may draw an adverse inference if the accused fails to provide a “ reasoned or persuasive ” response .
[ 17 ]
Contrary to the submissions of the trial Crown , the fact that it may be appropriate for the police to ask such questions as part of an investigation does not mean that portions of an accused ’s statement in which such questions are asked are properly admissible .
This court made that clear in F . ( C. ) .
In that case , even though no objection was raised at trial , this court held that portions of an accused ’s statement to the police asking him to explain why the complainant made the allegations and why some people believed the complainant should not have been placed before the jury .
[ 18 ]
Nonetheless , I am satisfied that the trial judge ’s clear instructions explaining why this form of questioning is improper and emphasizing that the onus is on the Crown to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , would have cured any prejudice that might otherwise have arisen .
In the face of this instruction given before the videotaped statement was played , I see no real possibility that the jury would have been misled into focusing on any perceived failure of the appellant to provide an adequate explanation for the complainant 's allegations rather than on the issue of whether the Crown had satisfied its obligation to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .
[ 19 ]
Further , although the impugned questions may have led the appellant to volunteer that there were no problems in his relationship with the complainant , the appellant 's relationship with the complainant was a subject that could properly be explored both in the appellant 's statement to the police and in the evidence at trial .
Evidence suggesting the absence of any reason to make a false allegation “ is a factor which juries , using their common sense , will and should consider in assessing a witness ’ credibility ” : R. v. Batte ( 2000 ) , 2000 CanLII 5751 ( ON CA ) , 49 O.R. ( 3d ) 321 ( Ont. C.A. ) at para .
120 ; R. v. Mearow , [ 2006 ] CanLII 33765 ( Ont. C.A. ) at para .
18 .
b ) Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury concerning absence of evidence of motive to fabricate ?
Background
[ 20 ]
In my view , there are significant problems with the way the motive to fabricate issue was dealt with during the balance of the trial .
In order to address this issue , it will be necessary that I review the relevant events at trial in some detail .
i ) The Crown ’s opening address
[ 21 ]
In his opening statement to the jury , Crown counsel made it clear that he would be relying on the appellant ’s comment to the police that that there was no trouble between him and his daughter to demonstrate that the complainant had no apparent motive to fabricate :
There are three important things that this man has to say to the police .
Okay ?
The first one – I want this to ring in your ears all through the trial .
I want you to think about this when you make your final deliberations .
He says to the police officer , “ There 's no trouble between me and my daughter .
I was not aware of any concerns whatsoever . ”
It was a bombshell to him when he was arrested on or about May 20 , 2005 ...
No problems .
So you 're gonna think about that in terms of her alleged motivation .
[ Emphasis added . ]
ii )
The evidence relating to motive to fabricate
[ 22 ]
Several witnesses gave evidence about the complainant ’s relationship with the appellant and about the possibility that she had a motive to fabricate .
[ 23 ]
The complainant testified in - chief that she had a good relationship with her father until the sexual abuse began .
However , the complainant also noted that she was not allowed to go out at night and that the appellant asked her to leave the room if company came over .
In addition , she described the appellant as controlling .
[ 24 ]
In cross-examination , the complainant acknowledged that she had told her parents she wanted to have a child ; that her parents did not want her going out late at night ; and that she had difficulty accepting the return of two of their foster dogs .
The complainant denied suggestions that she wanted to be able to have the same things her working brother had , or that her allegations were based on things she had seen while watching pornographic movies .
[ 25 ]
Although the appellant alluded in his evidence in - chief to issues relating to the complainant wanting to have a child , wanting to go out at night and difficulties over returning the foster dogs , he acknowledged in cross-examination that there was no animosity between him and his daughter .
[ 26 ]
During cross-examination of the appellant 's son , J.L. , Crown counsel reminded J.L. of comments J.L. made to the police , suggesting that his sister made her allegations because she had to pay a total of $ 520 per month to her parents for room , board and cable TV and because she did not have the money to do what she wanted .
The following exchanges took place :
Q : In fact , you were so desperate to help dad that you offered an explanation as to why this complaint had been made .
Do you remember that ?
...
Let me refresh your memory .
And I ’ll quote on page three ...
“ I think it was out of retaliation , stuff like that .
She ’s paying for cable .
She pays $ 400 rent , which I do as well .
She 's jealous that I 'm working bringing money in and she is not . ”
And then you ’re asked : “ Does she have freedom at the house ? ” “ She can come and go where she pleases .
I think she feels that she did n't have the money to do what she wanted . ”
So , those are the questions and answers supplied by you as to why this complaint came .
I suggest to you that – that 's a pretty desperate thing you did on behalf of your father to make such an explanation .
Do you agree ?
A : Yes
...
Q : Now , let 's get back to that desperate explanation , you agreed it 's desperate , that you gave to the police in an effort to assist your father , let 's just analyze that a little bit .
Your opinion at the time , and I – I imagine that it still is , is that she was upset about money issues , right ?
A : Yes , she was .
Q : All right .
Well , let 's analyze that for a second .
Your position then and it still is , is that she did n't have enough money to do what she wanted to , right ?
A : Yes .
Q : And she was jealous of you , right ?
A : Yes .
Q : Okay .
Now , can we agree that N. was paying $ 400 a month room and board ?
A : She was .
A : And in addition to that was she paying for cable ?
A : Yes . ... 120 odd dollars .
Q : And was she shouldering the whole brunt of that or did she split the 120 with you and your folks ?
A : Well she was complaining about that because she was paying the cable and I was n't paying anything .
But meanwhile , I was paying into –into food .
...
Q : Will you agree with me that in the normal course of events , knowing human nature as you do , J.L. , that if a daughter says to the police : " My father has been having sex with me for seven years almost every day " , that that girl is not likely gonna stay under that roof much longer ?
A : Yes .
Q : Thank you .
So we 'll just play around with your theory a little bit .
So now N. has to leave and for $ 520 a month she 's getting room and board and cable .
Can you get room and board and cable elsewhere for $ 520 in your opinion ?
A : In my opinion ... no .
Q : No .
It 's not gonna happen .
So funny theory you had there .
Now , she 's worse off financially by making the complaint .
iii )
The closing addresses of counsel
[ 27 ]
Both trial counsel dealt with the issues of the appellant 's obligation to provide an explanation for the complainant 's allegations , and the complainant 's motive to fabricate , in their closing addresses .
[ 28 ]
Defence counsel essentially re-iterated that , even though the Crown might argue that there was no benefit to the complainant to fabricate the complaint , the appellant had no obligation to explain why she would do so .
He pointed out that there was no evidence of where the complainant was living and suggested that any financial considerations the Crown might rely on were irrelevant .
In addition , he suggested that making an allegation could be a way of getting out of the house to pursue a relationship .
Finally , he reminded the jury that the police officer ’s question asking the appellant why the complainant would be making her allegations could not be asked at trial and repeated the admonition that the appellant had no obligation to explain why the complainant would fabricate her allegations .
[ 29 ]
The Crown began his comments in this area by reviewing a portion of J.L. ’s evidence :
Let 's deal with J. for a second , brother J . As you know by now and it's been reiterated more than once , the accused can't be asked to explain why someone has said something bad about him .
But that does n't apply to other witnesses .
So I felt free to ask J. , " Tell us about that explanation you gave to the police , J. , about how she was jealous of your income and how she sort of wanted a little more balance between hers and yours . "
And within about 30 seconds he had to admit that was full of it , full of it .
Why ?
Because when she left the house she was worse off financially than before she made the complaint .
[ Emphasis added . ]
[ 30 ]
Later , the Crown turned to the general issue of lack of motive to fabricate :
Now , the last thing I want to talk about is lack of motive .
If all you heard from –from –on this point was my friend , you 'd conclude that it was completely irrelevant .
And I suppose he 's basing that observation or submission on the fact , and I agree , you can't ask the accused about it .
" Hey , Mr. L. , tell us why she 'd make this complaint if it was n't true ? "
We are past that .
But I can tell you right now and Justice Riopelle will reinforce in your mind that now is the time to think about that .
Now , it is a critical factor in your deliberations , a lack of motive .
Because you know what , thank goodness , the law is not an ass , at least not in this respect .
And you 're not going to be asked , like 12 ostriches , to go to Gillies Lake and stick your head in the sand and just ignore the fact this woman had no motive to lie .
You do n't have to ignore that .
It 's very important .
And what 's unusual in this case is , not only is there no motive to lie , I 'm going to spend a little time on that right now , everybody agrees she had a great relationship with her dad .
You may have asked yourself , " Why is that Crown attorney going on and on about that ?
Why is he reinforcing that in our minds ? "
Because it 's critical now .
You can and should use that in your deliberations .
No reason why .
But we 're gonna go past that .
She had reasons not to lie .
Put yourself in her shoes .
Twenty - seven years old with cognitive difficulties ; barely surviving on the money she makes with the support of her family .
She 's lost it all .
She 's lost it all .
Now , you have to compare that to my friend 's earlier suggestion , which is not based on the evidence , that she wanted to get out of the house .
Well , let 's think about that for a second .
Did she have to cook up this story to get out of the house ?
The accused himself said she was free to go .
And she did go and nobody held her back .
Why did she have to bring this on herself ?
Why did she have to forever , and this is a horrible , horrible thing to say but it 's true and we know it , why did she rupture this family forever ?
It 's not a family anymore .
It ca n't be a family anymore .
And that 's despite all the mutual love and all the good times they had , and the fact he was a good father except for incest .
She threw it all away .
That 's lack of motive .
That 's more than lack of motive .
[ Emphasis added . ]
iv )
The trial judge ’s instructions to the jury
[ 31 ]
The trial judge gave the jury the following instructions on the motive to fabricate issue :
Through cross-examination of this witness and other evidence , they tried to –it will be up to you to decide .
This is one of those dangerous grounds that judges go on , but I am not sure , it is up to you to decide , was there ever any reason for this disclosure to have been divulged the way it was .
There were some allusions to maybe there was jealousy between her and her brother with respect to him having money to buy things .
Generally it seemed to have been , according to the evidence , a happy relationship between father and daughter , mother and daughter , brother and sister .
Just a normal average home is what it seemed like .
You have to consider all those things as well .
The Crown made much of the fact that she may be even financially worse off now that she has made these disclosures .
You can take that into account as well I suppose , if you wish .
There has been a definite rupture in the family .
Things will never be the same between this mother and daughter , between this father and daughter , as a result of those disclosures .
Now , the father 's version is that this never happened .
This is all somewhere up in la-la land .
She made this up .
He cannot prove , as [ defence counsel ] has said to you , a negative .
You just cannot prove a negative .
That is why the responsibility is on the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .
You can prove a positive and that is what he has attempted to do during this trial .
Even though the question can never be asked of the father , " Why would she do this ?
Why would she make up these allegations ? "
They did , during the trial , attempt to answer those questions .
I have already alluded to what some of those answers might be .
That is for you to decide .
That is for you to review .
[ Emphasis added . ]
Discussion
[ 32 ]
The significant problems relating to the motive to fabricate issue began with the Crown ’s cross-examination of the appellant ’s son , J.L .
In asking J.L. about his “ desperate ” explanation to the police , the Crown elicited what appears to be an answer to a question similar to the question the police asked the appellant , why would the complainant be making these allegations .
As I have said , a question to any witness seeking to elicit that witness ’s opinion of another witness ’s credibility is improper and this cross-examination was improper for that reason .
[ 33 ]
That said , if this was the only problem that had occurred , it would not present a major issue .
Although improper , the Crown ’s questions were close to the line .
In his statement to the police , J.L. not only expressed his opinion , he also recounted facts capable of supporting a conclusion that the complainant was jealous of J.L. and unhappy about their respective financial obligations in their parents ’ household .
Had the questions been confined to eliciting those facts and any information J.L. had about the complainant ’s new living arrangements , the questions would have been entirely proper .
[ 34 ]
However , the Crown went further and used this line of questioning as an opportunity to editorialize about the complainant 's financial state when she left home ; he then referred to his editorial comment as if it was evidence in his closing address ; and he used his editorial comment in implicit support of his suggestion that the complainant had reasons not to lie .
[ 35 ]
This approach was prejudicial to the appellant because it allowed the Crown to reinforce and emphasize its position that there was no evidence of a motive to lie by leading inadmissible opinion about a possible motive to lie , and by discrediting the opinion with speculative editorial comment .
[ 36 ]
I am referring here to Crown counsel ’s response after posing the question to J. L. , “ Can you get room and board and cable elsewhere for $ 520 in your opinion ? ” .
Following JL's answer , “ In my opinion … no ” , Crown counsel said , “ No , she 's worse off financially by making the complaint ( emphasis added . ) ”
[ 37 ]
Since there was no indication that JL was aware of the details of the complainant 's living arrangements after she left home and since J.L. couched his answer as an opinion , J.L. 's response to the Crown counsel ’s question did not provide an adequate evidentiary basis for the Crown 's conclusion that the complainant was worse off financially after she made the complaint .
Moreover , Crown counsel ’s statement of a conclusion in response to J.L. ’s answer was an improper editorial comment .
[ 38 ]
In his closing address , Crown counsel referred to J.L. 's explanation to the police concerning why the complainant would fabricate and stated that J.L. had to disavow his explanation because the complainant “ was worse off financially than before she made the complaint . ”
As there was no other evidence at trial concerning the complainant 's financial status after she left home , Crown counsel ’s statement lacked an evidentiary foundation .
[ 39 ]
In the circumstances , rather than telling the jury that they could take account of the fact that the complainant may be worse off financially than she was before she made the complaint , the trial judge should have instructed them that there was no evidence at trial concerning the complainant ’s current living arrangements and that they should not speculate about that issue .
The trial judge should also have corrected the Crown ’s erroneous statement that he was entitled to cross-examine J.L. about his explanation to the police concerning why the complainant might be making her allegation .
[ 40 ]
Further , considering the Crown ’s comments in his closing address about the absence of motive to fabricate as a whole , in my opinion , it was incumbent on the trial judge to caution the jury against attributing undue weight to the absence of evidence of motive to fabricate .
[ 41 ]
I will repeat certain excerpts of the Crown ’s closing for ease of reference :
Now , it is a critical factor in your deliberations , a lack of motive .
…
You do n't have to ignore that .
It 's very important .
And what 's unusual in this case is , not only is there no motive to lie ... everybody agrees she had a great relationship with her dad .
…
But we 're gonna go past that .
She had reasons not to lie .
Put yourself in her shoes .
Twenty - seven years old with cognitive difficulties ; barely surviving on the money she makes with the support of her family .
She 's lost it all .
She 's lost it all .
…
Why did she have to bring this on herself ?
Why did she have to forever , and this is a horrible , horrible thing to say but it 's true and we know it , why did she rupture this family forever ?
It 's not a family anymore .
It ca n't be a family anymore .
And that 's despite all the mutual love and all the good times they had , and the fact he was a good father except for incest .
She threw it all away .
That 's lack of motive .
That 's more than lack of motive .
[ Emphasis added . ]
[ 42 ]
The difficulty with these comments is twofold .
First , they appear to suggest that the Crown proved lack of motive to fabricate when the evidence was not capable of supporting such a finding .
Second , by asking highly emotive rhetorical questions concerning why the complainant would create various negative consequences for herself , the Crown created a risk that the jury would jump to a conclusion that the complainant must be telling the truth if there was no demonstrated motive to lie .
[ 43 ]
In his comments , the Crown made outright assertions that the complainant had no motive to lie and also referred to the complainant 's reasons not to lie .
Particularly when combined with the prior suggestion that the complaint was worse off financially after making her allegations , these assertions suggested that the fact of the complainant ’s good relationship with her father and the negative consequences that she experienced proved that the complainant had no motive to fabricate .
[ 44 ]
When dealing with the issue of a complainant ’s motive to fabricate , it is important to recognize that the absence of evidence of motive to fabricate is not the same as absence of motive to fabricate .
As Rowles J.A. stated in R. v. B. ( R.W. ) ( 1993 ) , 24 B.C.A.C. 1 ( B.C.C.A. ) , at para .
28 : “ it does not logically follow that because there is no apparent reason for a witness to lie , the witness must be telling the truth . ”
Put another way , the fact that a complainant has no apparent motive to fabricate does not mean that the complainant has no motive to fabricate .
[ 45 ]
The complainant ’s good relationship with her father and the negative consequences she may have experienced as a result of making her allegations are not capable of proving that she had no motive to fabricate .
As this court held in R. v. White ( 1996 ) , 1996 CanLII 3013 ( ON CA ) , 29 O.R. ( 3d ) 577 , at p. 608 , ( Ont. C.A. ) ; affirmed 1998 CanLII 789 ( SCC ) , [ 1998 ] 2 S.C.R. 72 , in the context of an accused ’s motive to commit a crime , evidence of a good relationship does “ no more than reinforce the absence of evidence of proved motive . ”
The same reasoning applies to evidence of negative consequences that may ensue from making serious allegations .
Although they highlight the significance of absence of evidence of motive , they do not prove the absence of a hidden motive .
[ 46 ]
In my view , the Crown ’s suggestions that the complainant ’s great relationship with her father and the negative consequences she may have suffered by making her allegations amounted to no motive to fabricate required a corrective instruction from the trial judge to put the issue of absence of evidence of motive to fabricate into its proper context .
[ 47 ]
Further , in my opinion , the Crown ’s emotive rhetorical questions asking why the complainant would bring various negative consequences on herself also required a corrective instruction .
The problem with these questions is that they called on the jury in a compelling way to focus on what had not been proven ( a credible motive to lie ) rather than on what was proven and therefore created a risk that the jury would reason that failure to demonstrate a motive to lie proved that the complainant was telling the truth .
[ 48 ]
In Batte at para .
121 , this court identified the pitfalls that should be avoided in a trial judge ’s instructions to the jury on motive to fabricate .
The same pitfalls must be avoided in Crown counsel ’s closing address :
What must be avoided in instructing a jury is any suggestion that the accused has an onus to demonstrate that a complainant has a motive to fabricate evidence , that the absence of a demonstrated motive to fabricate necessarily means that there was no motive or , finally , that the absence of a motive to fabricate conclusively establishes that a witness is telling the truth .
The presence or absence of a motive to fabricate evidence is only one factor to be considered in assessing credibility .
[ 49 ]
I recognize that in Batte , this court concluded that the trial judge did not err when , in setting out the Crown ’s position at trial , he invited the jury to consider why the complainant would subject herself to the rigours of the trial process if her allegations were not true .
This court stated that at least some of the potential problems arising from such an instruction are overcome by the trial judge ’s general instructions on credibility .
Further , the trial judge ’s instructions in their entirety would not have “ led the jury astray from applying its common sense to the question of why the complainants would make the allegations they did , and the significance of the answer to that question , to their overall assessment of the credibility of the complainants ” : Batte at para .
126 .
[ 50 ]
However , in this case , by inviting the jury to focus on potential long - term negative life consequences to the complainant from making her allegations and characterizing them as reasons not to lie , in my opinion , Crown counsel in this case went far beyond the trial judge ’s isolated reference in Batte and virtually invited the jury to reason that in the absence of a demonstrated motive to fabricate the complainant must be telling the truth .
[ 51 ] Finlayson J.A. highlighted this risk in S. ( W. ) , supra , a judge alone trial , when he said , at p. 519 :
The Crown on appeal conceded that it was improper for the Crown at trial to demand an explanation from the appellant as to why the complainant would make up what counsel referred to as " this horrendous lie " .
There is no onus on an accused person to explain away the complaint against him or her .
The trial judge should have resolutely rejected this approach .
Instead he implicitly adopted it .
He was favourably impressed with the complainant and the manner in which he testified and , consequently , he believed her .
He then subtly shifted the onus to the appellant , as accused , to give some explanation as to why the complainant would lie .
Why would she bring all this grief upon herself and risk jeopardizing the close relationship between the two families if it were not true ?
[ Emphasis added . ]
[ 52 ]
Particularly in the context of a developmentally challenged complainant , by emphasizing what the complainant may have lost by making the allegations and by suggesting that it had proven absence of a motive to lie , the Crown created a risk that the jury would jump from those factors to a conclusion that the complainant was telling the truth .
It was , therefore , incumbent on the trial judge to neutralize that risk by providing corrective instructions .
Rather than addressing the problems created by the Crown ’s closing , the trial judge ’s instructions merely pointed out that it was for the jury to determine whether a motive to fabricate had been established .
The trial judge ’s instructions do not address how the jury should treat a failure to demonstrate a motive to fabricate .
[ 53 ]
At a minimum , the corrective instructions should have addressed the following matters :
• Because a persons ’ motives can sometimes be hidden , there is a difference between absence of apparent motive and proven absence of motive ;
• Although the defence had raised some possible motives for the complainant to fabricate her evidence , depending on their view of the evidence , it was open to the jury to find an absence of any apparent motive on the part of the complainant to fabricate ;
• Although absence of apparent motive to fabricate is a proper factor to consider in assessing the credibility of the complainant , it is but one of many factors to be considered ; and
• Whatever their view of the evidence relating to the complainant ’s motive to fabricate , it was essential that the jury bear in mind that the accused has no obligation to prove a motive to fabricate and that the onus remains on the Crown throughout to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .
[ 54 ]
The effect of the trial judge ’s failure to provide corrective instructions along these lines and along the lines I have referred to earlier in paras .
39 and 40 respecting the Crown ’s errors on this issue , was to permit the Crown to bolster the complainant ’s credibility unfairly .
When combined with the impact of the Crown ’s conduct in unfairly undermining the credibility of the defence witnesses , which I will discuss in the next section , the overall impact is sufficiently serious to require a new trial .
2 . Did the Crown engage in misconduct that created a miscarriage of justice ?
[ 55 ]
The classic statement of the role of the Crown is that set out by Rand J. in Boucher v. The Queen , 1954 CanLII 3 ( SCC ) , [ 1955 ] S.C.R. 16 , at 23 - 24 :
It can not be over - emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction , it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime .
Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented : it should be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly .
The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing ; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility .
It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity , the seriousness and justness of judicial proceedings .
[ 56 ]
The appellant submits that the conduct of Crown counsel in this case was so unfair and prejudicial that it gives rise to a miscarriage of justice .
In particular , the appellant submits that the Crown 's opening and closing addresses were improper and inflammatory .
Further , he contends that that the Crown : improperly expressed his opinion concerning the appellant 's guilt ; inappropriately suggested to the appellant in cross - examination that the jury disbelieved him ; improperly asked defence witnesses to comment on the veracity of other witnesses ; was rude , demeaning , and abusive throughout his cross-examinations ; led the complainant through crucial aspects of her evidence ; and mischaracterized earlier evidence in forming his questions .
[ 57 ]
I do not accept all of the appellant ’s submissions concerning the alleged transgressions .
However , I do agree that Crown counsel at trial engaged in some conduct that crossed the line of propriety .
In my opinion , the Crown ’s general approach involved overstating the Crown ’s position , demeaning defence witnesses and at least impliedly injecting his personal opinion into the trial .
Although perhaps not as egregious as Crown misconduct in some other cases , the overall impact of this approach was , on occasion , to unfairly cast defence witnesses in a bad light .
[ 58 ]
I will give some examples .
Before doing so I will briefly outline one of the issues at trial to which some of the misconduct relates .
[ 59 ]
One important aspect of the Crown ’s case was the complainant ’s testimony that the appellant ’s wife caught the appellant having intercourse with the complainant when the complainant was 19 .
According to the complainant , her mother did not get particularly upset about this incident but rather simply told them not to let it happen again .
[ 60 ]
The appellant was asked about the incident when he gave his statement to the police .
Although he denied any impropriety , he described an incident in which the complainant “ climbed in ” to bed with him and asked about a kiss .
The appellant said he gave the complainant a little kiss and that , at that point , his wife walked in .
The appellant acknowledged that his wife told them she did not want to see them in bed together again .
[ 61 ]
At trial , the Crown cross-examined both the appellant and his wife extensively about this incident and alleged inconsistencies and improbabilities in their evidence became one of the focal points of the Crown ’s closing address .
[ 62 ]
I will turn now to some examples of the Crown ’s misconduct .
a) The Crown ’s opening address
[ 63 ]
During his opening address , the Crown said the following about the incident :
Now , I told you the accused gave a statement to the police .
I 'm going to play that video tape for you ... and there are three important things that this man had to say to the police .
Okay ?
…
And the third thing that he admits to is something that N. is going to tell you about and this is the blockbuster .
This is a piece of evidence that I suggest to you at the end of the day is going to leave you with absolutely no doubt that this happened .
When N. was about 19 or 20 –so we 're talking about the middle of the seven year period , maybe a little earlier than that - the sex was going on all through the day .
Mom was out working 8:30 to 4:30 cleaning for the most part for two ladies .
Mom never came home for lunch .
One day she did .
( Unintelligible ) she saw her husband and her daughter having intercourse in bed .
You have to ask yourself , what would the typical woman do ?
The women that I know would react in a very , very uniform way .
…
But you 're going to hear … mom did n't get all excited at all .
She said , " L. and N. put your clothes on .
We 're gonna have a chat .
I want this never to happen again .
Do I have your promise ?
Do you promise " .
That was it .
The very next day , surprise , surprise , more incest .
You have to ask yourself what would a young gal in that situation , with her particular challenges , do when her own mom reacting that way , did nothing .
Yeah .
And her mom , I 'll ask you to conclude , knew the sexual abuse was going on at least for the next three years .
It 's shocking is n't it , if you conclude that it 's true .
[ 64 ]
As can be seen from this extract , the Crown portrayed the appellant as having admitted the conduct in issue .
Although it was undoubtedly open to the Crown to ask the jury to find the appellant admitted that the incident occurred , the bald assertion of an admission overstated the Crown 's position .
Moreover , characterizing the appellant 's wife 's alleged reaction as shocking was improper editorializing .
b ) The Crown ’s cross-examination of the appellant
[ 65 ]
The Crown was often subtly disrespectful and demeaning when cross-examining the appellant .
A prime example of such conduct was his habit of asking the appellant if he knew the meaning of the words used in questions posed in cross-examination :
Q. You know what analogy means .
...
Q . Do you know what a six week convalescence is ?
...
Q . Do you know what that means , destitute ?
...
Q . And so she goes into your room , she is the kisser , you are the kissee .
Do you know what that means ?
...
Q . You know what day surgery is ?
[ 66 ]
On other occasions the Crown was sarcastic :
Q . So we 're gonna get back to the time that you had to spend with your precious daughter , your one daughter .
[ 67 ]
A more flagrant example of improper conduct was Crown counsel ’s tendency to refer to the jury in his questions and , on some occasions , to suggest that either he or the jury were having difficulty with the appellant ’s answers :
Q. Now , let 's talk about the locks on the door ’ cause I have to say that –that I found your response rather unusual to the question put by the officer .
And I think the jury felt the same way and I 'll tell you why ...
...
Q. All right .
So let 's –let 's be frank here .
If you 're not in the picture , your wife is destitute ....
Do you know what that means , destitute ?
A . It means she 's got no place to go .
…
Q. That 's it .
No food , no lodging , no nothing .
She relies on you 100 percent .
And I do n't mean to sound crass but in a way you are her meal ticket , right ?
A. No .
Q. Well , gee for the jury ... might have some ... difficulty with that .
...
Q. Now , we 're going to talk about that fourth incident on the video tape that I claim is important .
I could be all wet on that but I think the jury will agree this is pretty important .
This is the incident where your wife walks in on you and N .
...
Q. Now , when I heard your testimony yesterday and I think the jury will agree that that was an important event in your life ?
A. No .
Q. No ?
Oh , okay .
Well , let 's examine that for a second .
See how it stands up to a little scrutiny .
You made this jury or gave them the impression that your wife was suspicious of what was going on .
Are you going to deny that ?
...
Q. That 's very interesting .
We 've heard it before and we ’re gonna go over it again but you know my question was : " Did you feel your wife was suspicious about what was going on ? "
A. No .
Q. Well , the jury ’s ...
A. Because there was …
Q. … having some difficulty ...
A. … nothing going on .
Q. … with that , I think .
We ’re gonna have some difficulty with that because , if your wife was n't suspicious , she 'd walk right on by and she'd do the laundry but instead she turns to you and says : " What 's going on here ? "
That 's the truth is n't it ?
...
Q. Now , the jury , having heard your evidence yesterday , I 'm sure has your most recent story fresh in their mind .
...
Q. All right .
And that 's basically what you told the jury but you left out an important part .
All right ?
...
Q. Asked for a kiss ?
Difference without a distinction or vice versa .
Asked about a kiss ?
Now is n't that totally different from what you told these good people just yesterday ?
...
Q. Let 's just deal with that for a second here .
This was , whether you concede the point or not , I think the jury will conclude that this was an important event in your life .
That your wife was suspicious that you were engaging in sexual activity with your own flesh and blood .
...
Q. All right .
So your story is mixed up about why she came to the room : who kissed who .
Let 's talk about the hug for a second .
You told these good jurors that when your wife walked in , she saw you hugging her , is that correct ?
...
Q. Did you catch that difference too ?
Your wife – you said on the videotape that your wife said to you and N. : " I do n't want you in that bed together anymore . "
Did you not hear that ?
A . No , I did n't hear it .
Q. All right .
Well , maybe the jury will sort that out for us .
...
Q. No .
It happens ...
I think we 're talking at cross-purposes here .
Now , so we painted a picture of you being a swell father but you said something that I ’m sure struck the jury yesterday and is at complete odds with the portrayal you ’d have us believe .
You told this jury that : " I was angry when I heard about these allegations and if she had been present , I would 've been yelling and screaming at her . "
...
Q. You 're avoiding the question .
You 're the one who threw it out .
I did n't invent this .
You and [ defence counsel ] broached it .
I 'm going to deal with what you told this jury yesterday and you can't deny it .
You said that if she had been present and made these allegations in your presence , you 'd be yelling and screaming in her face .
Kind , loving and understanding father .
...
Q. Okay .
And was there anything that was eating N. that was obvious to you outside of your relationship with her ?
A. Little bit , yes .
Q. All right .
It took little while to think about that one .
I guess it was n't so obvious .
Well , what were those problems ?
A . She would run and sort of say she'd be here and not there , those little things .
Q . That makes no sense to me so I 'm gonna move on , okay ?
A. Yeah .
Q. Let the jury make of it what they will .
...
Q. All right .
So let 's see if the jury can understand this .
Your position now is , you were aware that your daughter has gone to the police to talk about sexual abuse at your hands and then your daughter says : " Dad , let 's go to counselling . "
And you told this jury you had no idea what that was about , the counselling .
...
Q. All right .
We 've done a bit of a 180 degree turn here .
I think the jury will remember , just 15 minutes ago under oath , I asked you what you understood the option of counselling was and we drew a big fat zero , a big blank .
" Your guess is as good as mine , " you said to the Crown attorney .
...
Q. Well , how else can you cut it ?
How else can you cut this one ?
You tell the jury 15 minutes ago , " I 've no idea , Mr. Crown attorney .
I 've no idea why we 're going to counselling . "
And now you admit to them there was no other possible reason but the allegation of incest .
You lied to these people .
A . That was just drawing a general conclusion , yes , that – what that counselling would be about but it was n't for my participation in the counselling .
Q. A general conclusion .
So what do we glean from that , that the main topic would be having sex with your daughter almost every day for seven years , in addition to that , I do n't know , an eating disorder ?
You lied to these people did n't you ?
A No , I did not .
Q. We 'll let them make that decision .
The court : Mr. [ Crown attorney ] , that last comment was not necessary .
c ) The cross-examination of the appellant ’s son .
[ 68 ]
I have already referred to a serious example of Crown misconduct in relation to the cross-examination of the appellant 's son under the first ground of appeal .
d ) The cross-examination of the appellant 's wife
[ 69 ]
The most serious example of Crown misconduct during cross-examination of the appellant 's wife is an exchange in which the Crown expressed his opinion about what had occurred :
Q. Ma'am , let 's cut to the chase here .
I 'm going to tell you what I believe the truth is here .
We 're gonna see if we can agree , okay ?
The truth of the matter is that you did catch her daughter [ sic ] in bed with your daughter having full - blown sexual intercourse approximately 1999 when your daughter was 19 .
[ 70 ]
Although the Crown went on to frame his questions in terms of which version of events made more sense , he had clearly expressed his opinion concerning the truth .
e ) The Crown 's closing address
[ 71 ]
In addition to the improper conduct in his closing address that I have referred to under the first ground of appeal , Crown counsel used inflammatory language in referring to the appellant as a liar , improperly injected himself into the closing , demeaned the position of the defence and , at least implicitly , expressed his opinion that neither the appellant or his wife were worthy of belief and that the appellant was guilty :
You know what the hallmark of a liar is ?
The hallmark of a liar is to admit everything except the one little bit of information that will get you in trouble .
So he 's trying to be generous with the truth .
That 's the hallmark of a liar , trying to suck you in and say : " You know ?
I 'll meet you halfway on this but I 'm not a bad guy ? ”
The truth never changes .
But he tried to change the truth did n't he ...
They talked about what went on in the bedroom and how it was going be prevented in the future .
That 's the truth .
But now he has a different story for you .
He says : " We told her .
He told her you 're not coming back in here anymore . "
Really ?
Did he have any such objections in the minutes before his wife caught them in there ?
I think not .
The truth never changes .
Now , it seemed to me that those blatant and several contradictions would be enough for any jury to say to themselves , individually or collectively , " We can't believe that fellow .
He 's not worthy of belief . "
But it gets so much better for the prosecution .
It is almost of the Biblical story of manna from Heaven .
You do n't expect it or even deserve it but it falls into your lap .
After those contradictions were revealed , the accused proceeded to shoot himself in the foot twice did n't he ?
He lied to your faces twice .
That 's what I suggest happened here .
Now , what were those lies ?
I 'm sure they 're still ringing in your ears .
And do you remember how the accused squirmed on the hook after I exposed it ?
Really , how foolish he looked trying to rehabilitate himself in your eyes .
It 's not going to happen is it ?
You know a liar when you see one .
So what 's the big , fat lie number one ?
The first one is that : " She wanted me to go to counselling " .
...
So here 's the $ 64,000 question .
" Mr. L. , why do you think she wanted you to go to counselling with her ? "
Do you remember his response ?
It 's something of a refrain he has , right ?
He used it twice to the police officer .
He used it twice and cross-examination .
" Mr. Crown attorney , your guess is as good as mine . "
Your guess is as good as mine .
As if to say : " I have no bloody idea . "
But you know that was a blatant lie to your face .
It was n't the police officer .
It was n't a witness outside the court .
It was to your faces .
Because on the heels of that , I asked him some more questions ...
I said : " Well stop the presses here .
You just said you had no idea ... on the other hand you knew ...
So how do you square the circle ? "
And his jaw almost hit the ground did n't it ?
It 's almost a small child example where you catch them in an obvious lie and they do n't know what to do .
They run in little circles and now they 're caught in a corner and there 's nowhere to go .
So what did he do ?
He basically tried to blame me for confusing him .
But there 's no confusion on your part is there ?
That ’s crystal clear .
He lied to you .
And the one big fat lie was n't enough because he was in a downward spiral now .
That 's what happens when you start to lie ... because one lie follows on another in desperation .
The next lie had to do with how he would 've reacted to his daughter if she ’d had the gall to confront him with that in his presence instead of scurrying off tell the police ...
" I would have screamed and yelled in her face . "
I suppose an innocent man might do that .
But what did he do ?
He said to her , knowing full well what this was about , basically : " Honey I 'll go with you to counselling . "
Big fat lie number two .
...
Now , I 'm having some trouble understanding my friend 's position because it 's somewhat inconsistent .
Not that that 's a bad thing .
The defence can advance any number of possible defences ... the first one ... emerged yesterday in questioning of Ms. L....
He put to her : " You 've watched a couple of porn flicks late at night , have n't you ? "
" Yeah , I have . "
" And I suggest to you ma'am , that you 're confused . "
And in essence what he said to her was : " In your mind you and your dad were porn stars in those films . "
I do n't know about you but I almost fell off my chair with that one ..
...
Now , let 's talk a little bit about mom .
With great respect , she does n't deserve much comment does she ?
[ Emphasis added . ]
[ 72 ]
I acknowledge that there were few objections during the course of the trial to the Crown ’s conduct .
However , although that is a factor to be considered , it is not determinative : R. v. Jacquard , 1997 CanLII 374 ( SCC ) , [ 1997 ] 1 S.C.R. 314 .
The effect of some of Crown counsel ’s transgressions , taken individually , may not have been apparent at the time .
In my opinion , it is the cumulative effect of the improprieties under this ground of appeal and the first ground of appeal that undermines the fairness of the trial and requires this court to order a new trial .
Disposition
[ 73 ]
Based on the foregoing reasons , I would allow the appeal , set aside the appellant ’s conviction and order a new trial .

Methane bubbles can be trapped in ice during the autumn freeze
Scientists from Russia and the US measured methane bubbling from a number of thawing lakes .
Writing in the journal Nature , they suggest the methane release is hastened by warmer temperatures , positively feeding back into global warming .
Methane 's contribution to present - day global warming is second only to CO2 .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) estimates that atmospheric concentrations are about two and a half times those seen in pre-industrial times .
Methane flux from thaw lakes in our study region may be five times greater than previously estimated
Katey Walker and colleagues
" We show that methane flux from thaw lakes in our study region may be five times greater than previously estimated . "
The lakes are produced in summers when land which is usually permanently frozen - permafrost - melts .
Bubble traps
The study depended on the systematic deployment of bubble traps on two lakes in the Cherskii region of Siberia , supplemented by ground - based and aerial observations of a further 95 lakes .
Katey Walker from the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and her colleagues calculate that across the region , thaw lakes lakes emit 3.8 teragrams ( Tg , million million grams ) per year .
Click here to see how much Arctic permafrost is projected to disappear in the coming decades
More details
More than half of this total comes from human activities , notably farming .
The importance of the Siberian release may lie in the relationship between warming and methane production .
If a high release rate of a greenhouse gas is being triggered by rising temperatures , that will in turn stimulate still higher temperatures - a positive feedback mechanism .
Extra context comes from the age of the emerging gas .
Using radiocarbon techniques , the researchers showed that some of the escaping methane molecules had been formed more than 40,000 years ago .
The area of the planet covered by permafrost is projected to shrink as the surface warms .
Boreholes in permafrost in Svalbard , Norway , indicate that ground temperatures rose 0.4C over the past decade , four times faster than they did in the previous century .
